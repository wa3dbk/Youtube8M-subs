00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
here they're better at these types of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
here they're better at these types of
courses<00:00:36.510> pretty<00:00:36.870> good<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.190> like

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
courses pretty good so they look like

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.750 
courses pretty good so they look like
you<00:00:38.809> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:39.989> got<00:00:40.260> airborne<00:00:40.680> there<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you kind of get got airborne there and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000 
you kind of get got airborne there and
then<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> went<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.379> straight<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010

roll me it's you you have a lot of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
roll me it's you you have a lot of
direction<00:00:49.289> coming<00:00:49.469> over<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:49.980> so

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
direction coming over there because so

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.040 
direction coming over there because so
you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> rest<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> hillford<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you can use the rest of the hillford to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.569 
you can use the rest of the hillford to
gain<00:00:52.199> speed<00:00:52.410> across<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.949> bottom<00:00:53.250> flat<00:00:53.460> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
gain speed across that bottom flat it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.369 
gain speed across that bottom flat it
slows<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> lot<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.230> you're

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
slows down a lot there so if you're

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
think for us in general because of and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.530 
think for us in general because of and
Jake<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.280> made<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> lot<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.030> guys<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.269> are

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
Jake but made a lot of guys that are

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.050 
Jake but made a lot of guys that are
fashion<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.080> did<00:02:49.230> today<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.670> overall<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
fashion they did today and overall I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.660 
fashion they did today and overall I
think<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.630> going<00:02:52.080> over<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.290> europe<00:02:52.410> i<00:02:52.680> mean<00:02:53.580> i

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
think it going over to europe i mean i

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.830 
think it going over to europe i mean i
think<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> lot<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.480> lot<00:02:54.750> of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
think we have a lot of a lot of

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.479 
think we have a lot of a lot of
improvement<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.920> over<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.280> i<00:02:56.310> mean

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
improvement to do and over there i mean

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.759 
improvement to do and over there i mean
i<00:02:56.580> think<00:02:56.690> we've<00:02:57.690> kind<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:57.930> had<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.230> slow<00:02:58.500> season

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
i think we've kind of had a slow season

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.009 
i think we've kind of had a slow season
start<00:02:59.310> off<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.700> season<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> lot<00:03:00.870> of

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
start off to the season for a lot of

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.110 
start off to the season for a lot of
speed<00:03:01.200> guys<00:03:01.380> especially<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.370> think<00:03:03.000> there's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
speed guys especially so I think there's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.390 
speed guys especially so I think there's
there's<00:03:03.720> an<00:03:03.840> easy<00:03:03.989> easy<00:03:04.799> improvement<00:03:05.310> from

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
there's an easy easy improvement from

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.970 
there's an easy easy improvement from
here<00:03:05.610> on

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
here on

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.259 
here on
this<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.370> a<00:03:07.459> step<00:03:07.670> forward<00:03:07.819> this<00:03:08.120> week

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
this is a step forward this week

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.540 
this is a step forward this week
anything<00:03:08.780> yeah<00:03:09.500> for<00:03:09.680> sure<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.860> mean<00:03:10.010> far<00:03:10.250> better

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
anything yeah for sure I mean far better

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.850 
anything yeah for sure I mean far better
than<00:03:10.640> a<00:03:10.819> fake<00:03:11.569> police<00:03:11.750> was<00:03:12.140> for<00:03:12.409> as<00:03:12.500> far<00:03:12.680> as<00:03:12.799> a

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
than a fake police was for as far as a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.589 
than a fake police was for as far as a
team<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.099> that's<00:03:13.909> better<00:03:14.120> than<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.299> least<00:03:14.480> we

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
team so that's better than the least we

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:15.820 
team so that's better than the least we
had<00:03:14.720> two<00:03:14.840> guys<00:03:15.019> in<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.260> second<00:03:15.590> round<00:03:15.680> is

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
had two guys in the second round is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.199 
had two guys in the second round is
supposed<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.190> sold<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.549> we<00:03:16.580> only<00:03:16.819> had<00:03:17.000> myself

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
supposed to sold and we only had myself

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.320 
supposed to sold and we only had myself
so<00:03:17.659> it's<00:03:18.230> definitely<00:03:18.319> better<00:03:18.879> 68<00:03:19.879> kids<00:03:20.180> from

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
so it's definitely better 68 kids from

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.940 
so it's definitely better 68 kids from
