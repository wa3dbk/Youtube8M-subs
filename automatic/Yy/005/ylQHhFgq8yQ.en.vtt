demonstrating<00:00:39.920> some<00:00:40.100> common<00:00:40.430> mistakes<00:00:40.570> can

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
demonstrating some common mistakes can

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:53.859 
demonstrating some common mistakes can
you<00:00:41.659> pick<00:00:41.839> them<00:00:41.960> out<00:00:52.479> let's<00:00:53.479> look<00:00:53.690> at<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:53.869 
you pick them out let's look at the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.450 
you pick them out let's look at the
correct<00:00:54.140> technique<00:00:54.530> again<00:00:54.829> and<00:00:55.039> then<00:00:55.219> come

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
correct technique again and then come

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.959 
correct technique again and then come
back<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.789> this

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.349 

let's<00:01:05.969> see<00:01:06.179> that<00:01:06.210> again<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.719> slow<00:01:06.749> motion

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:08.359 
let's see that again in slow motion

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.580 
let's see that again in slow motion
start<00:01:09.359> with<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.569> target<00:01:09.899> up<00:01:10.109> out<00:01:10.319> of<00:01:10.439> your

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
start with the target up out of your

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.380 
start with the target up out of your
dog's<00:01:10.740> view<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:11.880> Swift<00:01:12.149> motion

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
dog's view and then in the Swift motion

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.109 
dog's view and then in the Swift motion
lower<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.039> the<00:01:14.219> sudden

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
lower it so we can see it the sudden

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.389 
lower it so we can see it the sudden
appearance<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.719> attract<00:01:16.049> his<00:01:16.170> attention

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
appearance will attract his attention

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.010 
appearance will attract his attention
then<00:01:17.399> when<00:01:17.609> he<00:01:17.700> touches<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> tone<00:01:18.569> and<00:01:18.780> treat

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
then when he touches it tone and treat

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
then when he touches it tone and treat
and<00:01:19.229> simultaneously<00:01:20.159> removed<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.789> target<00:01:21.149> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and simultaneously removed the target so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940 
and simultaneously removed the target so
that<00:01:21.539> he<00:01:21.630> focuses<00:01:22.109> on<00:01:22.259> getting<00:01:22.469> his<00:01:22.679> treat

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that he focuses on getting his treat

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.529 
that he focuses on getting his treat
rather<00:01:23.280> than<00:01:23.520> remaining<00:01:23.939> focused<00:01:24.149> on<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
rather than remaining focused on the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.099 
rather than remaining focused on the
target<00:01:27.890> now<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.219> catch<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.609> mistakes

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
target now can you catch the mistakes

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.480 
target now can you catch the mistakes

removed<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.319> target<00:01:55.679> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:55.979> represent<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
removed the target and then represent it

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.010 
removed the target and then represent it
in<00:01:56.850> an<00:01:57.119> appropriate<00:01:57.569> location<00:01:59.600> this<00:02:00.600> dog<00:02:00.840> is

in an appropriate location this dog is
still<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.319> step<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> represent<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
still on step one so I represent the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.510 
still on step one so I represent the
target<00:02:03.149> close<00:02:03.539> to<00:02:03.719> his<00:02:03.810> nose<00:02:04.159> remember<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
to train you to move the target closer

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.339 
to train you to move the target closer
to<00:02:10.830> him<00:02:11.150> also<00:02:12.150> notice<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.720> when<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.110> skip

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
to him also notice that when you skip

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:21.720 
to him also notice that when you skip
steps<00:02:13.650> your<00:02:13.950> dog<00:02:14.130> may<00:02:14.310> not<00:02:14.489> respond<00:02:14.910> very<00:02:15.150> well

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.059 

now<00:02:22.660> marilyn<00:02:23.110> has<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.500> technique<00:02:23.920> down

now marilyn has this technique down

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.339 
now marilyn has this technique down
better<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.390> good<00:02:25.540> idea<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.870> have<00:02:26.110> someone

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
better it's a good idea to have someone

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.190 
better it's a good idea to have someone
watch<00:02:26.650> your<00:02:26.920> technique<00:02:27.250> for<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.610> exercise
