 Thank you Masa Young Koji Seto is user tuber this time 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:31.330
 I played the phrase that is flowing in the ending of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:35.170
 I have already met with the video of Set Truly, youtube and you 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.070
 How to face each other has changed 180 degrees 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 I am looking forward to videos every day 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:48.000
 Then let's play the guitar actually by playing this phrase 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.860
 Yes there is one chop problem before that, but eh-the first of that phrase 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.800
 It is this leading 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:01.989
 Sound Tteyuu do is in the guitar 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:06.159
 Since the low sound prima facie 2 to like than the sound it puts out there guitar put out 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:13.110
 You will need an effector called Octaver 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:18.120
 Say in me is this g while 1 nu described even all videos 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.920
 I'm playing using the Octaber built in 2 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.920
 Well octave okay if not 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.940

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.890
 It's a little lighter, but it won't be too late 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.990

 Also back in the 5th string 5th fret 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.510

 Rifu will come from here I'd have flow contains the phrase of cutting back 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.130
 so 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.530
 I think that maybe the guitars overlap as much as Japan. 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:49.310

 5756 cases are overlooked and 57 from the word source 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.780
 You can suppress 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.780

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.540
 It will be the phrase 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:39.130
 If you have a guitar by all means If you have a guitar and Octaber a by all means 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.630
 How about trying a challenge 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.540
 I think that I can not pull even a little ukulele because I'm drawn to Seto's example 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:51.250
 I tried various arrangements but it was impossible 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.130
