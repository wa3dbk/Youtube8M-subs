00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.720
 for the foundry you will need a 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.590
 pair of gloves a jump for the mix 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.720
 a metal carcass 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.910
 we can also use a metal jump 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.110
 but I prefer this carcass because 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.030
 that she's already found down a 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.890
 cylinder smaller than the diameter 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.080
 of the carcass a cardboard mold for 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.190
 the lid several liters of water a 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.350
 metal tube for the arrival of sands 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.970
 there is plenty of sand beach then 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.290
 just go back and get your sand 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.320
 metal bar refractory concrete 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.580
 and roasting 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.820
 so before you make your hole will 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.820
 first pour a little sand 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:31.810
 sure the hole is done we can insert 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:32.980
 double go alone break it 2 that's it for 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.840
 the mixture made you a little 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.520
 legend wheels left then it will take 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.970
 3.5 kilos of concrete 4.8 kg of sand and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.710
 1.7 liter of water for the mixtures I 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.150
 I'm not too sure if a Portuguese who 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.430
 watch this video thank you for leaving a 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:54.280
 comment with dosages 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.360
 thanks to the winners igas then once 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 that the mixture of facts I will first 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.680
 wallpaper the bottom of the sco 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:14.730
 and the buzz is for you to mix it 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.959
 a little too liquid that can put the 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:27.450
 cylinder inside or what it is there 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:48.870
 we see too much and I'll be able to 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:53.900
 put two hostile horses so so 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.900
 be perfectly put anywhere 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:11.579
 good enough but it's nickel it's a 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.920
 little stud it's good it's perfect 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.150
 like that but now I'm going to be able 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.099
 put all the mixture 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.989
 I did a little animation that you 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.849
 understand better there you have the carcass 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.840
 metallic 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:26.459
 then the tube is where there will be 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.019
 the arrival of air skis to antwerp and the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.829
 Refractory concrete is what we put 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.269
 for upholstering the bottom and ski in arms in 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.510
 does it's the cylinder that's what's 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.159
 cardboard and where there is the arrow 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.709
 that's where we want to put sand in 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.220
 did get sand in the li m 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.930
 cylinder 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.420
 we really have the carpet for it 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.420
 be very solid if we do not do it and 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.079
 we put the concrete goes factor all around 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.980
 the cardboard will change will tear 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.500
 so that's why we have to put some 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.299
 sand like that even if the cardboard there 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.879
 moistened they will tear apart there will be 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.239
 always sand to protect the 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.680
 part 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.099
 the center and then with the arrows 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.840
 green 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.980
 this is where we will put the concrete we go 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:17.160
 frac earth all self that's it looks 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.180
 to that we can see that I'm fine 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.070
 protected the center for the cover that 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.130
 I will first use this fence for 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.610
 whether a concrete because, 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:33.110
 case of cracks on the lid the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.110
 toasting will hold everything 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.950
 once the sand remove that gives it that 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.430
 makes it pretty good and here we see the 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.120
 tube that's right before it's 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.120
 magnificent 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.230
 when it comes to mixing 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.750
 it's really good what I already feel 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.630
 the heat inside 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:08.400
 compared to the outside then to 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.440
 the interior effect 38 degrees to 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.360
 outdoors 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.850
 27 people see a big difference 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.979
 of temperature and the lid goes 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.200
 perfectly the top so I forgot 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.790
 a detail with the metal rods 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.860
 it should be rounded on the sides 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.120
 I should have their curve because the 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.620
 heat we'll go up and it'll go 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.389
 heat on the side that I'm going to finish it 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.229
 a frame he liked and for the container 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.770
 I took a fire extinguisher 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:39.840
 I will cut in half and you 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:45.810
 guess what's the point of the two things I 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.139
 lets you think for those who have 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.260
 find 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.669
 bravo you are smart and for those 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.550
 who have not found here is reborn the tale 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.470
 who will do a little test have already 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.900
 imagined that the foundry on the move 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.860
 all the fruits and everything does more than 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.860
 1700 degrees inside 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.930
 reborn the saint lazare and how he goes 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.260
 retrieve it 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:16.100
 once the container is at + 2 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.100
 degrees and then with magic tool 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.020
 so I'll just have to stand like that 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.360
 and take a rod and just fired 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.220
 the molten aluminum just goes dumped 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.940
 into two small still speaks lÃ© 

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.940
 place to tests 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 so
