00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
with a variety of different fields

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:18.820

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
pretty cool um let's see what else do we

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
pretty cool um let's see what else do we
have<00:06:18.889> for<00:06:19.190> bridge<00:06:19.630> we've<00:06:21.010> got<00:06:22.010> bridge<00:06:22.460> files

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
have for bridge we've got bridge files

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.870 
have for bridge we've got bridge files
let's<00:06:23.660> see<00:06:23.889> supposedly<00:06:24.889> bridge<00:06:25.190> will<00:06:25.550> allow

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
let's see supposedly bridge will allow

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.040 
let's see supposedly bridge will allow
me<00:06:26.120> to<00:06:26.419> access<00:06:26.750> stuff<00:06:27.410> on<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:28.419> micro<00:06:29.419> SD<00:06:29.750> card

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
me to access stuff on the micro SD card

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.020 
me to access stuff on the micro SD card
but<00:06:30.260> it<00:06:30.590> doesn't<00:06:31.340> seem<00:06:31.460> to<00:06:31.520> be<00:06:31.639> working<00:06:31.669> just

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
but it doesn't seem to be working just

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.010 
but it doesn't seem to be working just
yet<00:06:32.449> so<00:06:33.199> oh<00:06:34.039> you<00:06:34.490> know<00:06:34.820> what<00:06:35.000> I<00:06:35.270> know<00:06:35.510> why<00:06:35.750> I

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
yet so oh you know what I know why I

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.600 
yet so oh you know what I know why I
switched<00:06:36.380> out<00:06:36.590> my<00:06:36.620> micro<00:06:36.979> SD<00:06:37.220> card<00:06:37.460> to<00:06:37.580> another

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
switched out my micro SD card to another

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.150 
switched out my micro SD card to another
device<00:06:38.030> so<00:06:38.600> i'll<00:06:38.889> definitely<00:06:39.889> check<00:06:39.919> that<00:06:40.039> out

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
device so i'll definitely check that out

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.939 
device so i'll definitely check that out
and<00:06:40.400> make<00:06:40.490> sure<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.639> that<00:06:41.000> it<00:06:41.449> works<00:06:41.690> fine

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
and make sure that that it works fine

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.740 
and make sure that that it works fine
but<00:06:45.039> I<00:06:46.039> imagine<00:06:46.490> it'll<00:06:46.669> look<00:06:46.820> a<00:06:46.970> lot<00:06:47.120> like<00:06:47.360> the

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
but I imagine it'll look a lot like the

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:55.240 
but I imagine it'll look a lot like the
browser<00:06:48.560> for<00:06:49.220> the<00:06:49.400> files<00:06:49.699> locally<00:06:54.130> now<00:06:55.130> this

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
browser for the files locally now this

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.189 
browser for the files locally now this
is<00:06:55.400> the<00:06:55.430> bridge<00:06:55.639> browser<00:06:55.970> I'm<00:06:56.690> not<00:06:56.900> sure<00:06:57.110> if

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
is the bridge browser I'm not sure if

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.540 
is the bridge browser I'm not sure if
this<00:06:57.320> means<00:06:57.560> that<00:06:57.680> I'm<00:06:59.800> the<00:07:00.800> the<00:07:01.160> shortcuts

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550 
this means that I'm the the shortcuts

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.890 
this means that I'm the the shortcuts
here<00:07:01.699> are<00:07:01.850> completely<00:07:02.240> different<00:07:02.539> from<00:07:02.600> the

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
here are completely different from the

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.900 
here are completely different from the
native<00:07:03.400> playbooks<00:07:04.400> browser<00:07:04.699> so<00:07:06.669> these<00:07:07.669> are

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
native playbooks browser so these are

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.909 
native playbooks browser so these are
hold<00:07:08.720> and<00:07:08.960> that<00:07:08.990> they<00:07:09.470> aren't<00:07:09.560> even<00:07:09.800> the

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
hold and that they aren't even the

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.500 
hold and that they aren't even the
shortcuts<00:07:10.340> that<00:07:10.430> I<00:07:10.490> have<00:07:10.729> on<00:07:11.000> the<00:07:11.120> blackberry

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
shortcuts that I have on the blackberry

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.629 
shortcuts that I have on the blackberry
smartphone<00:07:11.630> so<00:07:12.260> imagine<00:07:13.160> these<00:07:13.310> are<00:07:13.520> just

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
smartphone so imagine these are just

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:17.350 
smartphone so imagine these are just
going<00:07:13.970> through<00:07:14.510> the<00:07:15.340> blackberry<00:07:16.340> torches<00:07:16.789> 3g

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
going through the blackberry torches 3g

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.810 
going through the blackberry torches 3g
