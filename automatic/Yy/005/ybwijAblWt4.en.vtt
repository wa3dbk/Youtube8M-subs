you<00:01:17.159> generate<00:01:17.670> most<00:01:18.390> people<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.810> concerned

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
you generate most people are concerned

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.279 
you generate most people are concerned
about<00:01:19.259> thyroids<00:01:20.219> surgery<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.109> might

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
about thyroids surgery and that it might

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.499 
about thyroids surgery and that it might
affect<00:01:22.619> their<00:01:22.829> voice<00:01:23.100> or<00:01:23.520> amount<00:01:23.939> affect<00:01:24.299> how

gain weight so we help them through all
of<00:01:28.259> these<00:01:28.499> problems<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.219> think<00:01:29.789> we<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.060> very

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
of these problems I think we have a very

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.349 
of these problems I think we have a very
