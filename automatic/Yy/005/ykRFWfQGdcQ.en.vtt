00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
up on stain and varnish now and this is

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.719 
up on stain and varnish now and this is
what<00:04:44.870> it<00:04:44.990> looks<00:04:45.139> like<00:04:45.229> so<00:04:46.039> to<00:04:46.099> compare<00:04:46.520> them

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
what it looks like so to compare them

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.279 
what it looks like so to compare them
all<00:04:47.470> they'll<00:04:48.470> each<00:04:48.800> have<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:49.280> unique<00:04:50.169> kind<00:04:51.169> of

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
all they'll each have a unique kind of

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.740 
all they'll each have a unique kind of
color<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:51.879> whichever<00:04:52.879> method<00:04:53.180> really<00:04:53.599> works

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
color so whichever method really works

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.749

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
if you're on a budget personally I think

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.050 
if you're on a budget personally I think
the<00:04:58.849> coffee<00:04:59.300> here<00:04:59.719> dark<00:05:00.199> coffee<00:05:00.699> really<00:05:01.699> looks

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
the coffee here dark coffee really looks

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.879 
the coffee here dark coffee really looks
really<00:05:02.330> good<00:05:02.479> in<00:05:02.629> real<00:05:02.780> life<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.650> color

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
really good in real life the color

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.980 
really good in real life the color
doesn't<00:05:04.129> really<00:05:04.219> translate<00:05:04.550> into<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.629> camera

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
doesn't really translate into the camera

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.409 
doesn't really translate into the camera
very<00:05:06.169> well<00:05:06.379> but<00:05:06.590> it's<00:05:06.740> very<00:05:06.949> good<00:05:07.190> and<00:05:07.419> second

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
very well but it's very good and second

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.439 
very well but it's very good and second

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
I'll probably put this the normal tint

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.050 
I'll probably put this the normal tint
the<00:05:11.449> professional<00:05:12.020> one<00:05:12.139> sorry<00:05:12.469> and<00:05:12.879> then<00:05:13.879> the

Milo and even the tea's really look
really<00:05:16.639> good<00:05:18.009> to<00:05:19.009> compare<00:05:19.129> it<00:05:19.460> that's<00:05:19.819> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
really good to compare it that's the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.569 
really good to compare it that's the
normal<00:05:20.449> color<00:05:21.819> so<00:05:22.819> that<00:05:22.849> each<00:05:23.270> is<00:05:23.479> a
