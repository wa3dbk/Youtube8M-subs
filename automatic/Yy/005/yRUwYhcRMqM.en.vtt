because this one is going to be
virtually<00:00:48.960> impossible<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.949> here<00:00:50.069> we

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
virtually impossible I think so here we

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.939 
virtually impossible I think so here we
go<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.489> think<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> number<00:00:51.239> seven

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949
