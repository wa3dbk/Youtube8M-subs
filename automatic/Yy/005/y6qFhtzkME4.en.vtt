00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the store I'd download at this puzzle

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
the store I'd download at this puzzle
game<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.650> let's<00:01:22.650> pull<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> quick<00:01:23.130> little

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
game and let's pull up a quick little

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.179 
game and let's pull up a quick little
puzzle<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.960> whole<00:01:25.080> idea<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.619> windows<00:01:25.950> 8

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
puzzle and the whole idea with windows 8

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.020 
puzzle and the whole idea with windows 8
obviously<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:28.400> all<00:01:29.400> about<00:01:29.729> touch

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
obviously is that it's all about touch

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.270 
obviously is that it's all about touch
so<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> bunch<00:01:32.189> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so as you can see there are a bunch of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
so as you can see there are a bunch of
different<00:01:32.610> uses<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.570> could<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.869> but

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
different uses that you could have but

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.140 
different uses that you could have but
the<00:01:34.530> idea<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.159> could<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.030> know

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the idea that you could have you know

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
the idea that you could have you know
ten<00:01:37.020> ten<00:01:37.619> ten<00:01:38.130> point<00:01:38.430> touch<00:01:38.729> or<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.810> bunch

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
ten ten ten point touch or just a bunch

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
ten ten ten point touch or just a bunch
of<00:01:40.259> fingers<00:01:40.439> touching<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.369> device<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
of fingers touching the device at the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
of fingers touching the device at the
same<00:01:42.869> time<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.009> cool<00:01:44.220> if

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
same time is really really cool if

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.620 
same time is really really cool if
