00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello friends of the thousand helicopter 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.820
 I imagine you are anxious to see the 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.789
 helicopter running but before 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.260
 the operation of this in this 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.020
 video lesson we will give a little bit of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.090
 attention in the initial window of r 8 mil 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.460
 because this is of great value to the 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.410
 pre-configuration or when 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.910
 we have a large diversity of 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.039
 local flight equipment and pilots 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.590
 touch area var to enter 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.399
 directly in the flight mode using the 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.300
 aircraft settings maps points and 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.370
 airspace of the last flight 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.859
 area of ​​Tokyo profiles allows you to choose - 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.440
 the local flight or the pilot who 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:53.350
 They are previously been configured 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.870
 in this we can perform the configuration 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.030
 for some equipment 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.199
 recognized, pre-configured and tested 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.330
 by the r 8 thousand programmers team 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.640
 we then tap into profiles to understand 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.829
 a little better its operation 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.320
 I remind you that these operations only 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.750
 will be possible after the 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.640
 configuration of aircraft profiles 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.039
 systems and pilots 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.909
 which will be addressed in the future in 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.520
 video-classes settings area 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.229
 Tokyo aircraft is used when we 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.380
 more than one type of aircraft 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.880
 this will save the settings 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.850
 associated with each aircraft 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.960
 such as polar curve load there and 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.909
 velocity 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.509
 there is no need to configure 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.759
 each exchange of aircraft 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.159
 system touch area is used when 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.159
 we speak at various flight sites 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.770
 this will save the settings 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.469
 associated with flight locations such as maps 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.649
 hi points information bars and 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.689
 overlays of the tokyo area 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.670
 equipment is a set of pre- 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.189
 settings for some equipment 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.819
 tested and recognized by the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.740
 programmers and the pilot tokyo area is 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.230
 useful when we have an equipment 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.870
 fixed on an aircraft used by 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.090
 several pilots to clarify 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.440
 better the operation of profiles 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.960
 we will use the following 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.920
 example we will use in osório in the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.990
 glider blanik l23 we can observe that 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.560
 the 8,000 who saved the 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.220
 characteristics of the last flight performed 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.230
 We then touch the aircraft after touching 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.750
 in the white area where we can select 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.830
 the aircraft profiles and select the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:46.660
 glider blank l23 we then play and 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.120
 selecting and finally to accept notes 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.210
 which at the time of the selection 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.660
 also the aircraft prefix and the file 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.120
 of popular curve used at the end 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.430
 we will select the system which has 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.580
 flight site information 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.580
 in this case of wo select osório 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.150
 then we have the settings for a flight 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.340
 of glider in osório defined 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.290
 just click on close to 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:26.110
 use the settings area 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.760
 tap to exit the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:34.000
 program without entering the flight mode 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.300
 and finally the touch area to simulate it 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.020
 we enter the simulated flight mode of r 8 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.080
 thousand 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.450
 In it we can simulate flights or 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.340
 view flights in c format 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.030
 interacting with the most diverse functions 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.910
 he dropped 8,000 in the next video lesson 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.959
 we'll cover the navigation screen of the 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.890
 fell 8 thousand 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.890
 until then
