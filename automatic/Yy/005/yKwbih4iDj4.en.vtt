00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.000
What is that?

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.400
Hey Antonio ! Look what I found !

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.900
What is that?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.600
One of France dictionary !

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.440
He has mark some pages ! Let's look why !

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.400
Which one did he mark ?

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.536
I don't know, I'm searching !

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.220
So...

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.780
Can you tell me what you're doing?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.320
We were interested by your language and curious about some pages you marked !

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.820
You know, Fritz knew and loved French language ! He found that it's a beautiful language.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.180
When you compare with German, that's obvious.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.320
What do you mean ?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.854
Nothing.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.420
Well, if you're interested by my language, do you want a little lesson?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.300
Why not?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.380
Well, Spanish and French are similar so, it will be easy for me !

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.260
I'm too awesome to fail !

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.920
Well, let's see that !

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.880
Well, I'm cool so I'm not gonna ask you some "Imperfect subjunctive" at the beginning.

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.274
We will start with "present".

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:32.340
For verbs of the first group, you take the verb, you remove the "er" and remplace it by -e, -es, -e, -ons, -ez or -ent after.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.560
Understood?

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.880
Well, if you understand, who want to start?

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.140
Me, if you want.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:47.996
Well, let's go with the verb "chanter" (To sing)! 

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:49.136
Ok !

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.280
Je chante / Tu chantes / Il chante 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.340
Nous chantons / Vous chantez /Ils chantent

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.060
Perfect !

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:02.034
It's so easy.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.520
Too easy?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.540
Ok !

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:08.352
My lovely prussian...

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.720
...I give you the verb "Aller" (To Go). 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.730
No problem !

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.260
Too easy !

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.620
Je "alle" / Tu "alles" / Il "alle"...

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.880
Ouch ! Why did you do that?!

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:26.992
"What did you do that ?"

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.640
You just destroyed my language !

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.440
I do what you told us !

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.620
Yes but I forget to say something...

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.120
And what?

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.920
Well, the verb "aller" is not from the first group but from the third.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.220
Am I supposed to know that ?!

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.720
No !

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.276
It was just for a joke !

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.700
Of course, if you don't give me something right...

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.640
Ok, I'll give one verb of the third group to Antonio

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.040
without giving him anything, I'm sure he will succeed !

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.260
I'm curious to see that.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.136
Well, let's go !

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.480
Good luck.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.380
Too easy !

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.180
So?

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.960
Well, what can I give you Antonio ?...

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.480
"Pouvoir" ! (Can)

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.720
"Pouvoir ?" Well...

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.220
Je peux / Tu peux / Il peut

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.540
Nous pouvons / Vous pouvez / Ils peuvent 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.340
Well, you see ! It's not complicated !

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.880
Your language have the same origine, that's to easy.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.540
Yes, of course...

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.752
Yes, but I succeed !

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.640
Ok, you know what?

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.200
You will take the verb I gave to Antonio....

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:35.116
...and with it, you'll ask something at the first person singular.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.160
Can you do it ?

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.036
No problem !

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:39.840
Yes, of course.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.920
"Peux-je?"

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.420
Argh ! Why did you do that ?!

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.932
Because it was so ugly !

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.060
But I do what you...

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.080
I just use the verb !

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Yes but don't you find that ugly ?

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.580
Repeat.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.280
"Peux-je ?"

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.560
I don't know if you noticed it but it's so ugly !

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.620
So, in French, we said "Puis-je?".

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.020
Like a flying bird...

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.080
Oh...the French language is so beautiful...

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.140
Maybe beautiful but hard to speak

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.820
Do you want to speak about the German language?

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.920
Nein, my language is too awesome for you.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.705
Yes, of course...

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.560
Where do you go?

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.796
Far away the latin languages.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.760
Poor him..

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.376
Incapable to appreciate the latin languages.

00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:36.536
Yes, it seems.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.960
Well, I go read a novel in my beautiful language. Do you want to come with me?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.225
No, I have something else to do.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.700
Yes of course. Like seducing Romano?

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.080
Good luck !

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.896
Thanks !

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.860
I don't want to do that !

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.160
Je "alle"/ Tu "alles" / Il "alle" ...

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.520
Are you ok ?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.480
It hurts !

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.240
"Pouvoir" !

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.860
In French, we say "Puis-je ?"

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.000
Like a flying bird !

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.140
Like a flying bird ?! 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.780
What are you doing ?!

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.080
We are interrested by your language !

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:43.816
Not the one in your mouth ! ("Tongue" and "Language" have the same translation in French)

00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:46.556
You're the only one interrested by this one !
