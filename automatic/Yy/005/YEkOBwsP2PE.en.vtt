00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.190 
kind of zoomed in in the GoPro software
there's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> preset<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.270> called<00:01:51.630> four<00:01:51.990> by

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
there's a preset that's called four by

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
there's a preset that's called four by
three<00:01:52.229> too<00:01:52.920> wide<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.880> when<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.180> select<00:01:54.390> this

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
three too wide now when we select this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.620 
three too wide now when we select this
preset<00:01:55.770> it'll<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.219> fix<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.450> video

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630

footage<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.380> make<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.219> more<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
footage and make it look more like the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.350 
footage and make it look more like the

aspect<00:02:06.540> ratio<00:02:07.469> now<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> want<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
aspect ratio now what I want to do is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.260 
aspect ratio now what I want to do is
export<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> video<00:02:10.470> footage<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.120> compare<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
export this video footage and compare it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.860 
export this video footage and compare it
to<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.930> 1080p

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
to the 1080p

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.050 
to the 1080p
superview<00:02:14.530> footage<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.069> what<00:02:15.550> we'll<00:02:15.670> see<00:02:15.910> is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
superview footage and what we'll see is

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.729 
superview footage and what we'll see is
that<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.450> exactly<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:17.319> same

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
that it's exactly the same

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.860 
that it's exactly the same
all<00:02:17.980> right<00:02:18.250> let's<00:02:18.430> recap<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.390> we<00:02:19.510> went<00:02:19.720> from

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
all right let's recap so we went from

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.040 
all right let's recap so we went from
the<00:02:20.050> 1440p<00:02:20.860> video<00:02:21.370> footage<00:02:21.760> looking<00:02:22.269> like

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
the 1440p video footage looking like

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.470 
the 1440p video footage looking like
this<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.590> four<00:02:23.800> by<00:02:23.950> three<00:02:23.980> aspect<00:02:24.489> ratio<00:02:25.209> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
this the four by three aspect ratio and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.830 
this the four by three aspect ratio and
we<00:02:26.470> converted<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.310> GoPro<00:02:27.700> studio<00:02:27.910> 2.0<00:02:28.599> and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
we converted it in GoPro studio 2.0 and

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.020 
we converted it in GoPro studio 2.0 and
now<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.110> looks<00:02:29.140> like<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.830> what<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:30.849> can

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
now it looks like this what we can

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.550 
now it looks like this what we can
notice<00:02:31.360> here<00:02:31.599> is<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.049> top<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.470> bottom

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
notice here is that the top and bottom

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.190 
notice here is that the top and bottom
is<00:02:32.920> preserved<00:02:33.819> we<00:02:34.090> don't<00:02:34.239> lose<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.840> extra

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
is preserved we don't lose that extra

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
is preserved we don't lose that extra
space<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.890> top<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.220> bottom<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:37.000> there<00:02:37.480> is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
space on the top and bottom but there is

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.869 
space on the top and bottom but there is
the<00:02:38.019> slight<00:02:38.410> disadvantage<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.370> super<00:02:39.670> View

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
the slight disadvantage of super View

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.199 
the slight disadvantage of super View
mode<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:41.140> get<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.709> distortions<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
mode that you get the distortions on the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.119 
mode that you get the distortions on the
left<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.750> right<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.019> get<00:02:44.349> that<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.709> crazy

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
left and right you get that like crazy

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.610 
left and right you get that like crazy
fisheye<00:02:45.730> effect<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.599> now<00:02:46.780> let's<00:02:47.049> just<00:02:47.110> compare

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
fisheye effect so now let's just compare

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.699 
fisheye effect so now let's just compare
this<00:02:47.890> 1440p<00:02:48.700> converted<00:02:49.690> video<00:02:49.959> file<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
this 1440p converted video file to the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.550 
this 1440p converted video file to the
1080p<00:02:51.280> super<00:02:51.849> view<00:02:52.000> video<00:02:52.329> file<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.230> what<00:02:53.440> we

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
1080p super view video file so what we

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.289 
1080p super view video file so what we
see<00:02:53.829> is<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.250> comparison<00:02:54.880> between<00:02:55.000> the

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
see is that the comparison between the

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.690 
see is that the comparison between the
two<00:02:55.329> is<00:02:55.660> very<00:02:55.989> close<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.950> only<00:02:57.130> difference<00:02:57.489> is

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
two is very close the only difference is

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.089 
two is very close the only difference is
that<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.090> did<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.690> shoot<00:02:59.019> these<00:02:59.230> two<00:02:59.290> shots<00:02:59.799> at

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
that I did not shoot these two shots at

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.039 
that I did not shoot these two shots at
the<00:03:00.310> same<00:03:00.579> exact<00:03:01.000> time<00:03:01.239> which<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.660> why<00:03:01.810> we're

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
the same exact time which is why we're

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:03.630 
the same exact time which is why we're
seeing<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.379> little<00:03:02.620> bit<00:03:02.769> of<00:03:02.920> inconsistencies

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
seeing a little bit of inconsistencies

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.729 
seeing a little bit of inconsistencies
for<00:03:04.510> those<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.140> don't<00:03:05.319> have<00:03:05.590> the

the same exact steps and you'll get

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.180 
the same exact steps and you'll get
similar<00:03:15.970> results<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.260> super<00:03:17.709> view<00:03:17.829> video

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190
