00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 Now I will tell one of the first such 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.990
 ways how to do so in my head 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.839
 there were interesting ideas all sorts of different 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:19.949
 things for this is enough to put on yourself 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:23.359
 synthetic shirt is asked what 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.910
 does synthetics synthetics it knocks down 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.060
 correctly correct say so minus 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.910
 a plus 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.630
 correct charge of electrical impulses 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.480
 brain you see naturally walk 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.570
 electrified yourself here's the result 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.789
 work of the left and the floor and the right hemisphere 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 through the corpus callosum the message between 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.460
 that is, they are not usually 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.899
 as we always as always happens in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.360
 ordinary clothes h.b. 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.989
 That is, it is clear that synthetics improve 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.899
 wear but if you need to decide which 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.570
 you don't know a very important task 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.479
 what to do you need to take a very important 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.880
 solution or creative solution for this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.840
 enough to wear synthetic 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.290
 things above it for a long time here 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.960
 particularly well here goes electrification not 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.430
 and loot for example wool with the usual 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 natural at the same time if not lonely wool 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 rubs from in a separate for example on 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 wool sweater 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.650
 nylon shirt electricity will 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.720
 so much that you have not only how 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.600
 it says ideas will come but also trendy 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.880
 will be around there and so well to the point 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.360
 degree you do not need to reach well what was 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.360
 one such known way 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.110
 there is also used as nylon 6 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.560
 here is a girl alone burned her so 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.299
 tell their charges carpets which 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.770
 advancing so much she was 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.780
 electrified that is us 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 electrify so not necessary but the principle 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 clear 6 no loom we can get 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.580
 maximum voltage states charge current 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.220
 and for more such bold normal 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.680
 solutions are fairly ordinary synthetic 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.140
 what time is enough to wear and synthetics 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 shirt and all the decisions you will have a place 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 should
