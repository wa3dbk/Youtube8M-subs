00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
in fast asleep once motion that is

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.680 
in fast asleep once motion that is
basically<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.540> persistence<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.630> vision

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
basically that is persistence of vision

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.200 
basically that is persistence of vision
as<00:01:27.200> they<00:01:27.440> find<00:01:27.680> on<00:01:27.950> by<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.290> alchemy<00:01:30.290> of

paper<00:01:40.430> drew<00:01:41.060> one<00:01:41.330> drawing<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.899> top<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.350> this

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
paper drew one drawing on top like this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.230 
paper drew one drawing on top like this
doing<00:01:42.950> nothing<00:01:43.070> wrong<00:01:43.399> on<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.729> bottom<00:01:44.060> paper

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
doing nothing wrong on the bottom paper

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.330 
doing nothing wrong on the bottom paper
like<00:01:44.540> this<00:01:44.570> flip<00:01:45.440> them<00:01:45.619> up<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.920> down<00:01:46.100> your

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
like this flip them up and down your

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.010 
like this flip them up and down your
brain<00:01:46.940> will<00:01:47.149> put<00:01:47.360> them<00:01:47.479> together<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:47.810> their

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
brain will put them together in their

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.190 
brain will put them together in their
movies<00:01:48.200> like<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.450> would<00:01:50.630> be<00:01:50.810> one

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
movies like this and that would be one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.730 
movies like this and that would be one
boring<00:01:51.800> movie<00:01:52.520> but<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:53.509> animation<00:01:54.229> turn<00:01:54.440> if
