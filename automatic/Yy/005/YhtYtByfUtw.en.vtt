00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.750 
were only on screen for about less than
a<00:02:56.110> second<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:56.709> all<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.040> them<00:02:57.190> they<00:02:57.670> were

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
a second for all of them they were

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.670 
a second for all of them they were
actually<00:02:57.910> randomly<00:02:58.510> thrown<00:02:59.110> with<00:02:59.290> him<00:02:59.440> there

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
actually randomly thrown with him there

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.440 
actually randomly thrown with him there
in<00:02:59.950> my<00:03:00.130> opinion<00:03:00.430> they<00:03:00.700> are<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:01.120> do<00:03:01.300> with

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
in my opinion they are to do with

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.270 
in my opinion they are to do with
zombies<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.019> could<00:03:02.170> possibly<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.769> off<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
zombies and could possibly be off the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.979 
zombies and could possibly be off the
site<00:03:03.610> or<00:03:03.910> what<00:03:04.030> are<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.180> first<00:03:04.330> sightings<00:03:04.840> of

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
site or what are the first sightings of

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.160 
site or what are the first sightings of
what<00:03:05.620> are<00:03:06.160> zombies<00:03:06.610> map<00:03:06.970> called<00:03:07.360> loot<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
what are zombies map called loot like so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.390 
what are zombies map called loot like so
why<00:03:08.350> do<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.560> think<00:03:08.800> it's<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:08.980> zombies<00:03:09.250> map

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
why do I think it's a zombies map

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.040 
why do I think it's a zombies map
because<00:03:09.820> like<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.000> said<00:03:10.150> they<00:03:10.450> were<00:03:10.480> on<00:03:10.690> screen

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
because like I said they were on screen

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.600 
because like I said they were on screen
for<00:03:11.230> less<00:03:11.440> than<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.680> second<00:03:12.040> something<00:03:12.340> trout

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
for less than a second something trout

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.190 
for less than a second something trout
didn't<00:03:12.880> really<00:03:13.120> want<00:03:13.269> us<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.510> see<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:14.050> will

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
didn't really want us to see that will

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.080 
didn't really want us to see that will
actually<00:03:14.320> try<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.709> hide<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.370> any<00:03:15.850> you<00:03:16.060> know

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
actually try to hide it any you know

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.600 
actually try to hide it any you know
Makos<00:03:16.660> actually<00:03:17.110> figure<00:03:17.500> this<00:03:17.680> out<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.160> also

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
Makos actually figure this out and also

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.150 
Makos actually figure this out and also
these<00:03:19.390> images<00:03:19.840> don't<00:03:20.050> relate<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.650> anything<00:03:20.950> we

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
these images don't relate to anything we

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.440 
these images don't relate to anything we
saw<00:03:21.370> within<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.790> trailer<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.209> do<00:03:22.300> with<00:03:22.390> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
saw within the trailer to do with the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.150 
saw within the trailer to do with the
campaign<00:03:22.840> or<00:03:23.019> multiplayer<00:03:23.350> they<00:03:23.769> were<00:03:23.920> just

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
campaign or multiplayer they were just

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.600 
campaign or multiplayer they were just
dark<00:03:24.519> as<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.150> my<00:03:25.450> opinion<00:03:25.810> these<00:03:25.930> images

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
dark as this and my opinion these images

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.009 
dark as this and my opinion these images
possibly<00:03:27.610> could<00:03:27.850> be<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.180> deal<00:03:28.360> with<00:03:28.540> zombies

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
possibly could be to deal with zombies

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.390 
possibly could be to deal with zombies
so<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> first<00:03:29.440> one<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:29.739> screen<00:03:30.010> now<00:03:30.130> we've<00:03:30.280> got

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
so the first one on screen now we've got

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.490 
so the first one on screen now we've got
a<00:03:30.430> bloody<00:03:30.820> gory<00:03:31.390> image<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:32.049> body<00:03:32.290> bags

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
a bloody gory image of body bags

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.380 
a bloody gory image of body bags
everywhere<00:03:33.100> something<00:03:33.700> we<00:03:33.790> would<00:03:33.910> definitely

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
everywhere something we would definitely

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.630 
everywhere something we would definitely
see<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:34.810> zombies<00:03:35.260> we've<00:03:35.620> also<00:03:35.799> got<00:03:36.040> two<00:03:36.250> bodies

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
see in zombies we've also got two bodies

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.120 
see in zombies we've also got two bodies
laying<00:03:37.150> up<00:03:37.360> against<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:37.870> desk<00:03:38.260> I'm<00:03:38.650> not<00:03:38.980> too

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
sure whether these are dead human bodies

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.720 
sure whether these are dead human bodies
dead<00:03:41.110> zombie<00:03:41.470> bodies<00:03:41.739> obviously<00:03:42.310> zombie<00:03:42.610> see

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
dead zombie bodies obviously zombie see

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.240 
dead zombie bodies obviously zombie see
humans<00:03:43.120> anyway<00:03:43.470> they<00:03:44.470> could<00:03:44.680> be<00:03:44.769> over<00:03:44.860> thanks

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
humans anyway they could be over thanks

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.340 
humans anyway they could be over thanks
to<00:03:45.280> those<00:03:45.579> but<00:03:45.910> we<00:03:46.420> got<00:03:46.540> dead<00:03:46.750> bodies<00:03:46.780> up

to those but we got dead bodies up
against<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.860> desk<00:03:48.070> in<00:03:48.430> my<00:03:48.489> opinion<00:03:48.910> this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
against the desk in my opinion this

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.780 
against the desk in my opinion this
screams<00:03:50.110> zombies<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:50.799> possibly<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.549> could

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
screams zombies so possibly this could

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.850
