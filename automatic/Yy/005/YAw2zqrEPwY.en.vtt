 so intricate we are listening here 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.159

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:16.249
 brutal and devastating in a female voice 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.079

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.850

 present the you want page 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.159
 the name makes him a lot of honor 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.189
 because it is total darkness we are 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.200
 listening to a heaviness that would be dignified and 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.310
 of great pride for the black sabbath of 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.690
 listen to heavy heavy heavy up 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.560

 Y 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.040
 the love of that dark feeling 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.250
 dark that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.500
 the same cave where I was stuck 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.650
 a demon and this implosion will do about 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.870
 he himself would be grateful that he 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.430
 the corts fell on as long as no 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.569
 continue to suffer the sound that produces 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.870
 this band is extraordinary 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.939
 gentlemen those who like tulle 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.969
 you have to get this out here there's a lot of 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.950
 the essence but totally taken to 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:50.680
 another side here we are listening to a 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.749
 female voice that does not ask for anything unless 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.599
 of this in another roll totally it 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:58.829
 dares to hit some insane screams 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:02.019
 of total madness of an absolute ghost 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.599
 an angelic voice that at times 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:08.189
 it even reminds us of the 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:13.720
 great and great list to carry 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:15.580

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:30.220
 15 minutes the piece 15 minutes and could 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.220
 last an eternity and is a 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.920
 a saucer as it is in bocatto di 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.490

 so worthy of kings hear this 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:46.460
 it pisses me off to know that these bands 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.640
 they are proposing are doing 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.680
 jobs that are really something that in 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.670
 the future everyone is going to come back in 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.040
 two months has been a classic and right now 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.600
 it is ignored many times all be 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.000
 buying his conch and not being 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.210

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.740
 click on reviews that should have more 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.930
 number of visits because we are 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.500

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.180
 Kristen is an absolute glory 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.390
 It impresses this fucking band I do not have 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.360
 enough words to flatter the 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.250
 you do not enjoy it, there were two of you and you say 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.290

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.030
 other tests that you like the metal that 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.430
 is making an experimental proposal 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.190
 of art do you like female vocals 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.530

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.270
 as to youtube as to everything gets 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.250
 where you came from and do not go because this is 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.580
 embarrassing that you may not like a 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.090
 metal 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.129
 here there is heaviness here there are feelings 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.530
 that there is atmosphere here in moments that 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.740
 they are growing and growing and growing 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.889
 this form of monumental ecstasy a 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.509
 heaviness that until the very other neon 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.150
 with his mustaches he would be smiling 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.120
 listened 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.760
 Enjoy the gentlemen check the former one 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.670
 great band I recommend it obviously the 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.160
 two discs the last but left in the 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.950
 I usually listen to strawberries or cables 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.770
 rule number the last row of the disk of 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.660
 15 minutes but the whole record is 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.550
 monumental and not even tell the 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.250
 spherical do not give a lazio that is the 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.990
 first album of 2011 out there the two 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.490
 launched independently but 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.580
 with a first level production 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:03.639
 offering an extra bass job well 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:11.139
 helping that form down the guitars 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:14.110
 but cesc demonic expressive sales and 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.629
 you have a vocalist there who does what 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.310
 he wants with his voice all there are sealing and 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.159
 praising the grunts of a brand trip 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.039
 nn and here no no no no no we enter the 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:26.919
 head what is to give vocal variety to 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.529
 something here is like that is a vocalist the 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.660
 rope to admire tremendous of 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:36.370
 Poland gentlemen 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:39.310
 great not to mention please I ask them 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.300
 out of respect for themselves since in this 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.300
 band see you
