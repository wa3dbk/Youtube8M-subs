second one I made so you have nice
convex<00:01:07.020> grind<00:01:07.409> Oh<00:01:11.060> ground<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.689> spike<00:01:12.960> from

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
convex grind Oh ground on the spike from

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
convex grind Oh ground on the spike from
both<00:01:13.530> sides<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.400> sharp<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> purpose

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
both sides it's not sharp and I purpose

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.149 
both sides it's not sharp and I purpose
actually<00:01:15.689> took<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.229> edge<00:01:16.380> completely<00:01:17.009> off

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
actually took this edge completely off

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.670 
actually took this edge completely off
just<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> sectors<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.259> doesn't

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
just from the sectors and this doesn't

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
just from the sectors and this doesn't
need<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.250> Barry<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.490> absolutely<00:01:20.939> no

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
need to be sure Barry is absolutely no

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
need to be sure Barry is absolutely no
reason<00:01:21.270> for<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.200> sharp<00:01:22.530> sharp

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
reason for it to actually be sharp sharp

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.070 
reason for it to actually be sharp sharp
it's<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.670> splitting<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.689> breaking

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it's really for splitting and breaking

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.109 
it's really for splitting and breaking
things<00:01:25.110> open<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.400> no<00:01:26.640> reason<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
things open so there is no reason to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.870 
things open so there is no reason to
make<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> char<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.950> gonna<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.400> gonna<00:01:29.670> make

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
make a char it's gonna it's gonna make

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510 
make a char it's gonna it's gonna make
it<00:01:30.060> safer<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.570> everything<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.460> said

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it safer and everything so like I said

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.609 
it safer and everything so like I said
just<00:01:32.880> takes<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.420> little<00:01:33.600> bit<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.810> habit<00:01:34.229> put<00:01:34.530> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
just takes a little bit of habit put it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
just takes a little bit of habit put it
in<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:34.920> doesn't<00:01:35.700> need<00:01:35.729> no<00:01:35.970> security

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
in there doesn't need no security

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
in there doesn't need no security
retention<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.710> niche<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
retention all the niche is just the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.130 
retention all the niche is just the
right<00:01:38.579> angle<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:39.000> retrieving<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:39.930> there

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
right angle of retrieving and it's there

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.429 
right angle of retrieving and it's there
it<00:01:40.619> has<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.070> duct<00:01:41.549> tape<00:01:41.820> handle<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
it has that duct tape handle with that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.219 
it has that duct tape handle with that
sports<00:01:44.220> tape<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:45.000> top<00:01:45.530> spike<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> bottom

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
pretty nice grind it has some scratches

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.880 
pretty nice grind it has some scratches
in<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> end<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.810> shit<00:01:54.990> will<00:01:55.229> scratch<00:01:55.619> over

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
