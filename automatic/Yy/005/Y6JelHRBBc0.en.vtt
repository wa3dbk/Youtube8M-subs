00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.130
 the firemen speak a little with you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.060
 resolves quickly on quenching 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 do it 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.910
 It's like you know you have two types of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.849
 seasoning is you have a selective temper 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.790
 a full temper the full temper 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.460
 the knife gets all the harder and 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.280
 by selective it becomes harder only 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.280
 where do you season or is you going 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 place in the fire at a temperature up to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 a temperature is for magnetic and goes 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 temper in oil will curb the best in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.909
 eye to eye paraffin or in any 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.970
 other is material that you had in 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.400
 Your forehead will knife this thing I 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.580
 I did 12 years ago to test a glue for 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.970
 test a way the pin a profile 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.659
 cut was half machadão comics 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.820
 Machadão it is looking good can 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.780
 also have also used neo 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.330
 garden 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.299
 there I did a selective temper in it or 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.369
 Either I did the selective only on the 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.009
 cutting profile of this knife 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.469
 the rest of it does not have time for just 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.820
 where it has the spinning which helps a 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.520
 selective tempering 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.469
 she keeps the cut of her missing most 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.929
 for the selective only leaves a film 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:41.249
 stiffer as I said what allows 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:43.920
 a better twist on your knife, right? 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:46.740
 In other words, you will not have any 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.210
 which can occur if I have all 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.240
 tempered one has to deliver to 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.450
 integral and you use fact as 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.249
 lever is not with the temper is selective 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.609
 this softer part 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:02.700
 she will resist this action more 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:07.249
 mechanic that suffers a time pattern 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.249
 so I use here then two nails 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.170
 who 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.670
 ah 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 it's screw 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.310
 can see that it did not compromise the stone 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.010
 because she's harder here clear 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.680
 this convex profile here I did as the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.599
 even if you 're not supposed to stay 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.090
 doing this with both knives just want 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.519
 I did only to illustrate what even for the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.430
 selective it does it causes this hardness 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.799
 higher on the wire in the knife 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.379
 remembering this one here a test knife that 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:15.409
 I did two years ago just to test the 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:17.690
 size is something that shows here tv 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:30.519
 who scored doing c'mon let's cut 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:30.519
 Anything else here looks there. 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.170
 they will continue 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.909
 look well 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:51.690
 Ok now look up here where you do not have 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:51.690
 the temper is seeing this is the jungle
