different moisture meters offer so first

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.039 
different moisture meters offer so first
thing<00:00:42.519> let's<00:00:42.760> define<00:00:43.030> moisture<00:00:43.510> meters<00:00:43.839> into

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:44.049 
thing let's define moisture meters into

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.070 
thing let's define moisture meters into
pinned<00:00:44.440> meters<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.190> pinless<00:00:46.089> meters<00:00:46.510> this

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
pinned meters and pinless meters this

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.750 
pinned meters and pinless meters this
one<00:00:47.290> here<00:00:47.500> on<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.650> end<00:00:47.890> this<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> meter<00:00:48.549> with

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
one here on the end this is a meter with

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.090 
one here on the end this is a meter with
pins<00:00:49.030> now<00:00:49.239> here's<00:00:49.449> what<00:00:49.600> happens<00:00:49.989> I<00:00:50.199> project

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
pins now here's what happens I project

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.960 
pins now here's what happens I project
these<00:00:51.519> pins<00:00:51.940> into<00:00:52.720> my<00:00:52.900> workpiece<00:00:53.970> different

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
these pins into my workpiece different

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.939 
these pins into my workpiece different
sets<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.510> pins<00:00:55.780> come<00:00:56.170> with<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.530> moisture

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
sets of pins come with the moisture

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.259 
sets of pins come with the moisture
meter<00:00:57.159> so<00:00:57.400> in<00:00:57.519> order<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.760> get<00:00:57.970> deeper

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
meter so in order to get deeper

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.109 
meter so in order to get deeper
penetration<00:00:58.420> I<00:00:59.140> can<00:00:59.739> change<00:01:00.129> to<00:01:00.369> a<00:01:00.430> longer<00:01:00.879> set

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
penetration I can change to a longer set

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.969 
penetration I can change to a longer set
of<00:01:01.239> pins<00:01:01.479> now<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.750> impact<00:01:02.199> of<00:01:02.379> that<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.769> that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
of pins now the impact of that is that

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.679 
of pins now the impact of that is that
we<00:01:03.519> want<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.820> make<00:01:03.970> sure<00:01:04.000> when<00:01:04.420> we're<00:01:04.540> taking

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
we want to make sure when we're taking

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.109 
we want to make sure when we're taking
moisture<00:01:05.229> meetings<00:01:05.619> that<00:01:05.890> we<00:01:06.490> get<00:01:06.729> the

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
moisture meetings that we get the

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.670 
moisture meetings that we get the
penetration<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.869> we<00:01:08.020> need<00:01:08.229> to<00:01:08.439> get<00:01:08.560> an

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
penetration that we need to get an

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.520 
penetration that we need to get an
accurate<00:01:08.920> reading<00:01:09.369> at<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.180> right<00:01:10.360> depth<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.500> a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
accurate reading at the right depth so a

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.039 
accurate reading at the right depth so a
couple<00:01:11.799> things<00:01:11.950> here<00:01:12.340> with<00:01:12.520> this<00:01:12.700> meter<00:01:13.049> I'm

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
couple things here with this meter I'm

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.810 
couple things here with this meter I'm
going<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.380> have<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.650> push<00:01:14.890> those<00:01:15.130> pins<00:01:15.430> into<00:01:15.640> my

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
going to have to push those pins into my

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.730 
going to have to push those pins into my
work<00:01:16.030> which<00:01:16.329> does<00:01:16.600> mean<00:01:16.840> I'm<00:01:17.350> going<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.590> leave

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
work which does mean I'm going to leave

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.669 
work which does mean I'm going to leave
two<00:01:17.979> little<00:01:18.250> snake<00:01:18.640> bite<00:01:18.880> holes<00:01:19.090> in<00:01:19.359> there

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
two little snake bite holes in there

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.349 
two little snake bite holes in there
also<00:01:20.679> you've<00:01:20.950> got<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.280> be<00:01:21.369> able<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.609> push<00:01:21.850> hard

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
also you've got to be able to push hard

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.880 
also you've got to be able to push hard
enough<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.780> get<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:22.929> penetration<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.770> you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
enough to get the penetration that you

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.399 
enough to get the penetration that you
want<00:01:24.070> which<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.820> some<00:01:25.090> harder<00:01:25.539> woods<00:01:25.780> can<00:01:26.229> be<00:01:26.380> a

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
want which in some harder woods can be a

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.739 
want which in some harder woods can be a
little<00:01:26.619> bit<00:01:26.829> difficult<00:01:27.009> that<00:01:27.999> takes<00:01:28.509> us<00:01:28.719> then

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
little bit difficult that takes us then

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.440 
little bit difficult that takes us then
to<00:01:28.990> pinless<00:01:29.560> meters<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.640> this<00:01:30.820> meter<00:01:31.119> over

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
to pinless meters so this meter over

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.499 
to pinless meters so this meter over
here<00:01:31.899> doesn't<00:01:32.229> require<00:01:32.469> any<00:01:32.859> pins<00:01:33.369> what<00:01:34.240> it

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
here doesn't require any pins what it

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.149 
here doesn't require any pins what it
does<00:01:34.749> is<00:01:35.049> it<00:01:35.200> puts<00:01:35.409> a<00:01:35.530> signal<00:01:35.859> out<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
does is it puts a signal out the

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.459 
does is it puts a signal out the
backside<00:01:36.609> that<00:01:37.270> signal<00:01:37.810> does<00:01:37.990> kind<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.409> a

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
backside that signal does kind of a

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.289 
backside that signal does kind of a
three-dimensional<00:01:39.429> read<00:01:39.670> into<00:01:40.179> the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
three-dimensional read into the

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.419 
three-dimensional read into the
thickness<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.840> your<00:01:40.869> material<00:01:40.990> in<00:01:41.710> order<00:01:42.280> to

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
thickness of your material in order to

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.639 
thickness of your material in order to
get<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:42.909> moisture<00:01:43.299> content<00:01:43.509> now<00:01:44.259> here's<00:01:44.499> the

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
get the moisture content now here's the

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.800 
get the moisture content now here's the
difference<00:01:44.770> between<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.579> two<00:01:45.729> from<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.329> little

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
difference between the two from a little

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.109 
difference between the two from a little
bit<00:01:46.929> of<00:01:47.020> an<00:01:47.109> accuracy<00:01:47.619> perspective<00:01:48.429> with<00:01:49.090> the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
bit of an accuracy perspective with the

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.819 
bit of an accuracy perspective with the
pinned<00:01:49.479> meters<00:01:49.899> what's<00:01:50.200> happening<00:01:50.649> is<00:01:50.799> that

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
pinned meters what's happening is that

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:53.249 
pinned meters what's happening is that
from<00:01:51.189> pin<00:01:51.429> to<00:01:51.579> pin<00:01:51.789> it's<00:01:52.299> taking<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.810> reading<00:01:52.990> at

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
from pin to pin it's taking a reading at

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.489 
from pin to pin it's taking a reading at
that<00:01:53.409> location<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.240> pinless<00:01:55.990> meters

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
that location with the pinless meters

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.889 
that location with the pinless meters
it's<00:01:56.979> taking<00:01:57.429> more<00:01:57.639> of<00:01:57.789> an<00:01:57.909> average<00:01:58.569> reading

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
it's taking more of an average reading

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.529 
it's taking more of an average reading
of<00:01:59.319> all<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.889> material<00:02:00.429> that<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:00.909> signal<00:02:01.210> is

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
of all the material that that signal is

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.590 
of all the material that that signal is
reading<00:02:01.869> through<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.389> things

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
reading through so one of the things

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.879 
reading through so one of the things
that<00:02:04.689> we<00:02:04.780> want<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:04.960> pay<00:02:05.139> attention<00:02:05.409> to<00:02:05.649> if

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:05.889 
that we want to pay attention to if

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.169 
that we want to pay attention to if
you're<00:02:06.039> choosing<00:02:06.189> to<00:02:06.460> go<00:02:06.549> down<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.850> pinless

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
you're choosing to go down the pinless

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.389 
you're choosing to go down the pinless
route<00:02:07.450> is<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:08.050> make<00:02:08.229> sure<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.530> you're

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
route is to make sure that you're

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.100 
route is to make sure that you're
looking<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:09.940> meter<00:02:10.209> looking<00:02:10.569> at<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.810> meter

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
looking for a meter looking at a meter

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.890 
looking for a meter looking at a meter
that<00:02:11.740> allows<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.490> control<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.330> depth<00:02:13.630> of

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that allows you to control the depth of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.340 
that allows you to control the depth of
your<00:02:14.080> reading<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.250> many<00:02:15.700> meters<00:02:16.050> allow<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
your reading so many meters allow you to

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.860 
your reading so many meters allow you to
set<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> depth<00:02:18.069> commonly<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.300> quarter<00:02:19.690> inch

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
set the depth commonly at a quarter inch

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.470 
set the depth commonly at a quarter inch
or<00:02:20.050> three<00:02:20.590> quarter<00:02:20.950> inch<00:02:21.130> depth<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:22.120> allows

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
or three quarter inch depth that allows

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.210 
or three quarter inch depth that allows
you<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.690> take<00:02:22.960> readings<00:02:23.290> at<00:02:23.710> the<00:02:24.040> center<00:02:24.490> of

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
you to take readings at the center of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.100 
you to take readings at the center of
different<00:02:25.700> thicknesses<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.360> materials<00:02:26.900> so

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
different thicknesses of materials so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.020 
different thicknesses of materials so
we're<00:02:27.740> with<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> pin<00:02:28.250> meters<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.850> would

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
we're with the pin meters we would

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.270 
we're with the pin meters we would
control<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.510> reading<00:02:29.660> location<00:02:30.350> by<00:02:30.500> how<00:02:31.040> far

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
control the reading location by how far

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.070 
control the reading location by how far
you<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.490> push<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.880> pins<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.330> with<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
you can push the pins in with the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.730 
you can push the pins in with the
pinless<00:02:33.410> meters<00:02:33.830> we<00:02:34.040> control<00:02:34.460> it<00:02:34.490> by<00:02:34.850> setting

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
pinless meters we control it by setting

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.260 
pinless meters we control it by setting
electronically<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.310> penetration<00:02:38.030> that<00:02:38.120> we

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
electronically the penetration that we

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.300 
electronically the penetration that we
get<00:02:38.480> from<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> electronic<00:02:39.620> reading<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
get from the electronic reading of the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.490 
get from the electronic reading of the
meter<00:02:40.490> itself<00:02:40.910> now<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> other<00:02:42.140> thing<00:02:42.350> we<00:02:42.380> have

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
meter itself now the other thing we have

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500 
meter itself now the other thing we have
to<00:02:42.620> consider<00:02:43.070> here<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.370> specie<00:02:43.970> correction

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
to consider here is specie correction

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.150 
to consider here is specie correction
not<00:02:44.660> every<00:02:44.930> wood<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.290> going<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.500> read<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.920> same

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
not every wood is going to read the same

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.910 
not every wood is going to read the same
so<00:02:47.060> if<00:02:47.360> we<00:02:47.480> come<00:02:47.690> back<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.110> meter<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.890> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
so if we come back to this meter on the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.790 
so if we come back to this meter on the
end<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:50.000> can<00:02:50.060> see<00:02:50.390> on<00:02:50.570> here<00:02:50.870> there's<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.110> 2<00:02:51.440> and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
end you can see on here there's a 2 and

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.520 
end you can see on here there's a 2 and
a<00:02:51.860> 3<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.490> those<00:02:52.640> are<00:02:52.850> wood<00:02:53.150> groups<00:02:53.540> when<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.260> look

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
a 3 so those are wood groups when I look

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.520 
a 3 so those are wood groups when I look
at<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.740> chart<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.730> comes<00:02:55.970> with<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.930> meter<00:02:57.170> I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
at the chart that comes with the meter I

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.920 
at the chart that comes with the meter I
can<00:02:58.160> tell<00:02:58.430> some<00:02:58.910> species<00:02:59.390> are<00:02:59.570> in<00:02:59.690> one<00:02:59.900> group

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
can tell some species are in one group

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.010 
can tell some species are in one group
some<00:03:00.650> species<00:03:00.950> are<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:01.430> another<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.360> set<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
some species are in another so I set the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.930 
some species are in another so I set the
meter<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.710> one<00:03:03.740> of<00:03:04.100> those<00:03:04.250> two<00:03:04.460> groups<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:04.880> I

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
meter to one of those two groups and I

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.780 
meter to one of those two groups and I
get<00:03:05.120> my<00:03:05.270> reading<00:03:05.480> on<00:03:06.440> other<00:03:06.650> meters<00:03:07.130> like

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
get my reading on other meters like

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.360 
get my reading on other meters like
these<00:03:08.240> I'm<00:03:08.510> looking<00:03:08.810> at<00:03:08.960> down<00:03:09.230> here<00:03:09.260> they<00:03:10.160> have

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
these I'm looking at down here they have

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.820 
these I'm looking at down here they have
a<00:03:10.400> more<00:03:10.730> finely<00:03:11.120> tuned<00:03:11.600> specie<00:03:12.260> correction

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
a more finely tuned specie correction

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.760 
a more finely tuned specie correction
what<00:03:12.950> it<00:03:13.070> allows<00:03:13.340> me<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.580> do<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.500> look<00:03:15.500> at<00:03:15.650> the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
what it allows me to do is look at the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.700 
what it allows me to do is look at the
chart<00:03:16.450> when<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> look<00:03:17.810> at<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.050> chart<00:03:18.290> there<00:03:18.590> are

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
chart when I look at the chart there are

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.710 
chart when I look at the chart there are
numbers<00:03:19.130> attached<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.490> different<00:03:20.120> species<00:03:20.360> of

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
numbers attached to different species of

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.350 
numbers attached to different species of
wood<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.680> then<00:03:21.920> I<00:03:21.950> would<00:03:22.190> bring<00:03:22.520> this<00:03:22.670> chart<00:03:23.060> to

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
wood so then I would bring this chart to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.320 
wood so then I would bring this chart to
my<00:03:23.510> meter<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:24.080> would<00:03:24.620> set<00:03:24.950> for<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.490> specific

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
my meter I would set for that specific

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.560 
my meter I would set for that specific
number<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.530> specific<00:03:28.160> meter<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.940> same

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
number on this specific meter that same

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.910 
number on this specific meter that same
thing<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:29.900> true<00:03:30.050> all<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.380> way<00:03:30.410> down<00:03:30.650> here

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
thing is true all the way down here

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.979 
thing is true all the way down here
including<00:03:31.340> into<00:03:31.550> these<00:03:31.670> pinless<00:03:32.120> ones<00:03:32.390> so

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
including into these pinless ones so

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.199 
including into these pinless ones so
what<00:03:33.709> you're<00:03:33.860> looking<00:03:34.070> at<00:03:34.190> there<00:03:34.520> is<00:03:34.550> your

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
what you're looking at there is your

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.060 
what you're looking at there is your
fine-tuning<00:03:36.020> your<00:03:36.080> moisture<00:03:36.560> content

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
fine-tuning your moisture content

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.130 
fine-tuning your moisture content
reading<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.520> little<00:03:37.760> bit<00:03:37.910> more<00:03:38.209> because<00:03:38.810> you're

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
reading a little bit more because you're

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.229 
reading a little bit more because you're
dialing<00:03:39.650> in<00:03:39.800> that<00:03:40.010> specie<00:03:40.520> correction<00:03:41.090> a

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
dialing in that specie correction a

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.620 
dialing in that specie correction a
little<00:03:41.690> bit<00:03:41.810> tighter<00:03:42.080> with<00:03:42.709> these<00:03:42.920> meters<00:03:43.630> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
little bit tighter with these meters the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.390 
little bit tighter with these meters the
other<00:03:44.780> thing<00:03:45.020> that<00:03:45.050> we<00:03:45.260> can<00:03:45.440> look<00:03:45.620> at<00:03:45.830> here<00:03:46.190> is

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
other thing that we can look at here is

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.120 
other thing that we can look at here is
if<00:03:47.030> we've<00:03:47.330> got<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.540> big<00:03:47.840> pile<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.620> rough<00:03:48.860> sawn

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
if we've got a big pile of rough sawn

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.770 
if we've got a big pile of rough sawn
stock<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.700> we<00:03:49.760> want<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.030> really<00:03:50.209> make<00:03:50.330> sure

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
stock and we want to really make sure

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.900 
stock and we want to really make sure
that<00:03:51.080> we're<00:03:51.650> getting<00:03:51.770> good<00:03:52.100> penetration<00:03:52.550> on

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
that we're getting good penetration on

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.960 
that we're getting good penetration on
thicker<00:03:53.300> material<00:03:54.430> then<00:03:55.430> you're<00:03:55.640> ready<00:03:55.820> to

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
thicker material then you're ready to

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.300 
thicker material then you're ready to
look<00:03:56.090> at<00:03:56.239> probes<00:03:56.600> like<00:03:56.870> this<00:03:57.170> one<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:57.650> with

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
look at probes like this one so with

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.390 
look at probes like this one so with
this<00:03:58.700> when<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.570> set<00:03:59.989> this<00:04:00.140> on<00:04:00.350> my<00:04:00.530> material<00:04:00.739> I

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
this when I set this on my material I

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.330 
this when I set this on my material I
can<00:04:02.209> drive<00:04:02.570> those<00:04:02.810> probes<00:04:03.200> very<00:04:03.709> deeply<00:04:04.190> and

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
can drive those probes very deeply and

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.860 
can drive those probes very deeply and
now<00:04:04.489> what's<00:04:04.670> cool<00:04:04.850> about<00:04:04.910> this<00:04:05.450> is<00:04:05.510> that

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
now what's cool about this is that

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.020 
now what's cool about this is that
notice<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:07.070> pins<00:04:07.340> themselves<00:04:07.910> are

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
notice that the pins themselves are

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.840 
notice that the pins themselves are
insulated<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:09.709> I'm<00:04:09.860> getting<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.250> reading<00:04:10.670> from

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
insulated so I'm getting a reading from

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.630 
insulated so I'm getting a reading from
here<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.300> here<00:04:11.690> not<00:04:11.989> from<00:04:12.290> here<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.680> here<00:04:13.040> so

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
here to here not from here to here so

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.860 
here to here not from here to here so
the<00:04:13.760> other<00:04:13.880> thing<00:04:14.090> that's<00:04:14.180> kind<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.450> cool<00:04:14.630> out

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
the other thing that's kind of cool out

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.949 
the other thing that's kind of cool out
of<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.410> on<00:04:15.769> thick<00:04:16.430> stock<00:04:16.790> with<00:04:17.630> just

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
of this is that on thick stock with just

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.289 
of this is that on thick stock with just
a<00:04:18.080> little<00:04:18.290> bit<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.680> penetration<00:04:19.220> I'm<00:04:19.609> getting

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
a little bit of penetration I'm getting

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.390 
a little bit of penetration I'm getting
a<00:04:20.450> surface<00:04:20.989> reading<00:04:21.350> of<00:04:21.470> moisture<00:04:21.890> content

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
a surface reading of moisture content

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.240 
a surface reading of moisture content
every<00:04:23.090> time<00:04:23.330> I<00:04:23.360> tap<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.990> more<00:04:24.530> deeply<00:04:25.040> I'm

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
every time I tap it more deeply I'm

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.310 
every time I tap it more deeply I'm
getting<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.090> reading<00:04:26.330> that's<00:04:26.690> deeper<00:04:27.140> and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
getting a reading that's deeper and

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.830 
getting a reading that's deeper and
deeper<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:28.010> deeper<00:04:28.310> into<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.580> wood<00:04:28.840> specific

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
deeper and deeper into the wood specific

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.650 
deeper and deeper into the wood specific
to<00:04:30.050> that<00:04:30.230> specific<00:04:30.980> penetration<00:04:31.610> point<00:04:31.880> so

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
to that specific penetration point so

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.020 
to that specific penetration point so
this<00:04:33.169> can<00:04:33.560> give<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.860> lot<00:04:34.039> of<00:04:34.100> accuracy<00:04:34.700> on

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
this can give you a lot of accuracy on

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.810 
this can give you a lot of accuracy on
that<00:04:35.270> thicker<00:04:35.900> stock<00:04:36.370> what<00:04:37.370> if<00:04:37.490> you've<00:04:37.640> got<00:04:37.789> a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
that thicker stock what if you've got a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.010 
that thicker stock what if you've got a
pile<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.150> stuff<00:04:38.539> in<00:04:38.720> the

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
pile of stuff in the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.140 
pile of stuff in the
and<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.889> want<00:04:40.069> to<00:04:40.160> make<00:04:40.310> sure<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.729> board<00:04:41.030> you

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
and you want to make sure that board you

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.400 
and you want to make sure that board you
have<00:04:41.419> all<00:04:41.629> the<00:04:41.720> way<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.020> middle<00:04:42.139> of<00:04:42.319> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
have all the way in the middle of the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.350 
have all the way in the middle of the
kiln<00:04:42.620> are<00:04:42.860> drying<00:04:43.160> at<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.430> proper<00:04:43.819> rate<00:04:44.030> you

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
kiln are drying at the proper rate you

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.119 
kiln are drying at the proper rate you
want<00:04:44.509> to<00:04:44.599> know<00:04:44.690> when<00:04:44.900> they're<00:04:45.110> dry<00:04:45.379> then<00:04:46.009> you

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
want to know when they're dry then you

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.490 
want to know when they're dry then you
can<00:04:46.280> look<00:04:46.370> at<00:04:46.490> setups<00:04:46.940> like<00:04:47.150> this<00:04:47.500> these

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
can look at setups like this these

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.100 
can look at setups like this these
probes<00:04:49.009> are<00:04:49.819> going<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.090> get<00:04:50.240> placed<00:04:50.599> into<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
probes are going to get placed into the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.809 
probes are going to get placed into the
material<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:52.610> wires<00:04:53.080> trail<00:04:54.080> out<00:04:54.460> then<00:04:55.460> as<00:04:55.699> I

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
material the wires trail out then as I

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.300 
material the wires trail out then as I
come<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.240> kiln<00:04:56.599> I<00:04:56.930> can<00:04:57.590> plug<00:04:57.860> these<00:04:58.039> wires

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
come to the kiln I can plug these wires

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.850 
come to the kiln I can plug these wires
into<00:04:58.460> my<00:04:58.819> moisture<00:04:59.270> meter<00:04:59.509> get<00:05:00.259> the<00:05:00.440> reading

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
into my moisture meter get the reading

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.830 
into my moisture meter get the reading
leave<00:05:01.639> with<00:05:01.789> my<00:05:01.940> moisture<00:05:02.360> meter<00:05:02.539> so<00:05:02.750> of

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
leave with my moisture meter so of

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.240 
leave with my moisture meter so of
course<00:05:02.990> we<00:05:03.349> don't<00:05:03.440> want<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.740> moisture<00:05:03.860> meter

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
course we don't want the moisture meter

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.999 
course we don't want the moisture meter
forever<00:05:04.639> inside<00:05:05.090> that<00:05:05.659> kiln<00:05:06.440> environment

is<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.830> good<00:05:19.009> thing<00:05:19.159> to<00:05:19.280> know<00:05:19.400> about<00:05:19.430> is<00:05:19.819> that

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
is a good thing to know about is that

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.200 
is a good thing to know about is that
the<00:05:20.960> pinless<00:05:21.409> meters<00:05:21.830> work<00:05:22.130> best<00:05:22.490> on<00:05:22.729> a<00:05:22.759> fairly

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
the pinless meters work best on a fairly

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.879 
the pinless meters work best on a fairly
smooth<00:05:23.539> surface<00:05:24.050> so<00:05:24.229> a<00:05:24.289> couple<00:05:24.470> ways<00:05:24.710> around

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
smooth surface so a couple ways around

this if you're working on rough sawn
stock<00:05:27.440> it's<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.800> good<00:05:27.919> idea<00:05:28.069> to<00:05:28.400> take<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.610> block

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880
