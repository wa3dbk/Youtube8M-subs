00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:05.339
 maybe he may welcome here to a part of the anatomy 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.330
 the test was 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.559
 But small is the more compact we are today 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.389
 Percent the topic head 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.569
 salvation 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:18.460
 and I can introduce myself briefly my name is Krause Finkeldei wanted 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.659
 and I'll get her through here now 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.679
 Part anatomy head neck and Euro a Niefern 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.890
 as well as for today first 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 the topic head neck 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.730
 the picture that used here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.430
 they come essentially from percent high as that come for them 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.420
 Dan the Neckar Atlas of Anatomy 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.630
 so Wolter 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.100
 and that's why I already know Triebel's neuroanatomy 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.600
 yes and our high school is 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.950
 after this 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.090
 he spent five hours again 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.840
 To be able to interpret the picture 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.880
 hopefully 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.920
 I do not want to go into it now, let's take a look at it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 The End 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 this day again 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.000
 Percent and sits down 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.890
 one could say 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.980
 who controls the anatomy 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.480
 in the way Andrae and dominated 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.510
 the TAIEX the anatomy the animal is therefore also correct in large parts 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.070
 this 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.260
 and that is why we want to continue today with the development and the embryology of 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.770
 head 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.480
 and neck operate 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.500
 and if you have this in Bologna 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.579
 understood 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.009
 then you can also get a lot of senior management, so to speak in the adult 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.630
 so stood 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.620
 is available 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.980
 around 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.380
 now it is like this 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.580
 the animal 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.470
 The drive from behind will not be against the back again 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.780
 Adolph spot 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.159
 there you can see here 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.730
 the German site 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.110
 which basically consists of taking the new program 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.099
 and from the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.689
 to program this 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.939
 the new program 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.829
 that goes out that he is there 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.599
 and from the skullcap 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.709
 And now to remember and to the Physikum very important that the 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.239
 Skull bars is actually a cartilage the roofing system is 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:27.949
 and that will 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.099
 by customer Basler the creations 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.669
 ossified 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.429
 the skullcap 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.439
 is connective tissue of the plant 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.849
 that arises 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.309
 through whose house is the coalition 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.439
 around 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.379
 taken the new program 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.529
 it stands 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.529
 on the one hand from the Pros front loader 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:55.379
 from the post-cinema league Lauener I can already say that raise 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.849
 shelves 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.579
 from the outside 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.459
 this is probably not here anymore 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.009
 to see only in this area and you can see that also to myself 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.249
 that's her corner 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.769
 this is the big one on the shelves otherwise you can see from the outside here of the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.200
 Side view Mixed 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.559
 on 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.410
 Berlin is it 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.819
 OWS Tembo Warner 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.589
 brew the post-areal days 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.799
 and the big one pulls the suit 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.799
 and that are also there from Großkämper 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.709
 up to Rock on Jun 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.239
 this essentially arises from gills derivatives what that is there come 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.669
 right now 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.120
 and that consists of the Leipziger 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.959
 the Belvedere 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 the cheers come too pomadig Roth 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.880
 He is to be seen that something 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.769
 US diplomats are actually only Selm goes 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.290
 and the Ark us diplomacy in short that is the whole country it consists of the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.209
 Prospect had come and part of the zontal temporal 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:05.929
 Dannemann 8 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.769
 the big highlight crew painter that is here 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.209
 in the orbiters 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.129
 this dark red 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.170
 the grand finale said 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.340
 yes you can watch TV 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.219
 Easter has Hansa name 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:19.079
 none 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.709
 Relationships with objects have existed before 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.349
 Question for her comes 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.489
 So you have to explain the bones of the organ days 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:33.159
 One question was once the ounce of nasals is the part of the Orbiter 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:36.739
 It is not because that is way too far in front and you can see that here 

00:04:36.739 --> 00:04:37.309
 also 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:38.999
 Comments place 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:40.219
 that she is now 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.219
 OTZ 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.260
 nasal 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.640
 and the orbiter that actually catches theirs
