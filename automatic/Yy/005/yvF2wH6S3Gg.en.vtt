00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.129
 is there actually enough perfume? 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.379
 back in the new century and was in 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.170
 china and there was no perfume 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.269
 but those were fragrance oils ok 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.399

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.390

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.210
 helpful to us and where can I find 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.369
 which fragrance smells special to me 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.100
 now fits the matching actually there 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.280
 I always like to try and then 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.810
 I really like it and it gives 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.429
 it's the right way to do it 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.969
 So I can test or wrong 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.009
 test 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.990
 really texts are already doing that then 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.909
 with the customers and that is there once 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 the scented candles are very neutral 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.799
 where to spray the air we'll spray in 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.009
 primarily by smell or what banks 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.399
 is supposed to be a fragrance of fine fragrance errors in 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.289
 episode 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.780
 thicker smells even better than one 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.500
 scented candles and it is also one more 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.369
 possibility to test 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.769
 okay I find quite tasty to testers 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.750
 myself if I have more over now 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.340
 sayings and you can smell more 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.319
 I will be favorite on the skin 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.760
 best in a pulsating position 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.160
 Mostly mama 's you at the inside 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.980
 from the wrist and then rub very well 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.350
 never enough when rubbing breaks 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.130
 the smell of light white why always 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.280
 dab or spray a string and run to 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.280
 bring 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.730
 and if I'm here five now 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.560
 different or ten different 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.120
 I'll have to try out some scents 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.060
 somehow my nose in the meantime 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.890
 So once again set to zero go 35 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.270
 might be different then the nose 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.160
 get used to it can not recognize anymore 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.800
 the differences then either in 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.300
 Arm bend as a monument judge as easy 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.810
 in the armlet even a whiff 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.030
 smell 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.680
 just to neutralize the nose or 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.660
 also does a lot of business or business 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.720
 many branches are now on 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.340
 shelf coffee beans coffee beans 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.690
 neutralize the nose how should I 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.690
 because actually the different scents 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.090
 often very similar to like them 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.650
 could be similar to computationally similar 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.410
 it is usually a problem when 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.970
 you tried several scents one after the other 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.850
 that nose get used to it then 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.250
 He directed all the same and why 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.010
 it is so that it is a fragrance in the running 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.690
 of the day changes differently in the morning 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.700
 smells like maybe then in the afternoon 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.160
 years are different notes that 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.690
 the koki heart in the base note in the 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.450
 the fragrance develops later 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.390
 base note so it smells definitely 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.160
 And what is the headnote the coop only 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.020
 right after you spray on the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.330
 first ten minutes then unfolds 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.120
 to heart and was half an hour later 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.370
 then the base note that smells like that 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.320
 how the fragrance is generally right in the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.590
 stadium of evaporation process at 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.590
 by 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.030
 Diana wrote us and she wanted us 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.010
 know how it is with the notes the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.990
 it is to be sniffed when looking for 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.450
 in the beginning description she reads the times 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.190
 she could not always do that now 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.600
 you always know the notes no 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.660
 So I can not do it as a layman 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.420
 because that's what the perfumers do 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.670
 the trained noses and they have 2500 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.770
 was allowed to create one 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.630
 at Kensington Palace and that they are likely the people 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.410
 even several hundred as not bad 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.300
 if the jahner can not do that if i do 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.680
 then stand here with you from the shelf 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.730
 I find myself for there to be quite so 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.830
 here are men 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.810
 typical men fragrances are here 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.120
 Women's fragrances but goes after the wrong 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.830
 I also color both the color bottles 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.180
 on sight that you better us 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.130
 can advise better and the customers 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.570
 you can also find your way around better 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.790
 For example, the sour blue are the ones 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.320
 fresh athletic should then go 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.630
 one over for example the dark ones 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.520
 colors folding box or bottle that 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.460
 are the more intense for example 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.020
 oriental scents or the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.080
 rose-colored ones are the flowery ones 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.060
 the lighter you were allowed fresh here 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.750
 darker the air folding box color 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.750
 the more intense 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.940
 17 certain fragrances the allergy sufferers take 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.890
 are 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.080
 no you can not if you have a few 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.060
 for ag should one avoid the smell as 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.250
 In any case, more often skin can do that 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.920
 in hair spray on scarves for example 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.570
 but with clothes for example on it 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.180
 pay attention because the whole surfaces lead 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.520
 and if I'm allowed to have migraine patients 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.620
 as perceive or honest as I will 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.840
 also avoid to have to go through 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.570
 try to find out which 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.920
 then the cranes war and therefore where 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.720
 I avoid war 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.850
 Martina why are we using it ? 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.920
 actually better than that 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.320
 Missing or general language 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.060
 piece of life waves of luxury i 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.920
 personally, would not leave the house 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.290
 go without a scent because that's for me 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.180
 like the first coffee in the morning brushing teeth 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.880
 I will not feel attracted and 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.890
 would like me and also with people 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.570
 delight
