to do with the fact that workers have

to do with the fact that workers have
very<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.699> leverage<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.859> that<00:00:58.859> larger<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
very little leverage and that larger and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.990 
very little leverage and that larger and
larger<00:00:59.910> shares<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:04.159> productivity<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.939> to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
larger shares of our productivity go to

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
larger shares of our productivity go to
the<00:01:06.210> top<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> not<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.890> middle<00:01:08.159> or<00:01:08.850> the

the top and not to the middle or the
bottom<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.740> think<00:01:10.740> unions<00:01:10.920> serve<00:01:11.850> an<00:01:12.000> important

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
bottom I think unions serve an important

bottom I think unions serve an important
role<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.869> way

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
role in that and I think that the way

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.570 
role in that and I think that the way
the<00:01:16.290> Bush<00:01:16.470> administration<00:01:17.100> managed<00:01:17.490> the

relations<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> thumb<00:01:25.920> too<00:01:26.130> heavily

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
relations put the thumb too heavily

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.770 
relations put the thumb too heavily
against<00:01:27.119> unions<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> lift<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.799> phone

there<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.110> steps<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.710> can

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
there are going to be steps that we can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.429 
there are going to be steps that we can
take<00:01:32.450> other<00:01:33.450> than<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> employee<00:01:34.200> free<00:01:34.409> choice

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
take other than the employee free choice

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.910 
take other than the employee free choice
act<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> difference<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.570> I

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
act that will make a difference there I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.740 
act that will make a difference there I
think<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> basic<00:01:38.220> principle<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.500> making<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
think the basic principle of making it

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
think the basic principle of making it
easier<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.840> fair<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.829> workers<00:01:44.340> who<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
easier and fair for workers who want to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.120 
easier and fair for workers who want to
join<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> union<00:01:45.149> join<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> union<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.619> important

join a union join a union is important

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.359 
join a union join a union is important

some balance now if the business
community's<00:02:22.680> argument<00:02:24.050> against<00:02:25.050> the

community's argument against the

community's argument against the
employee<00:02:25.440> Free<00:02:25.680> Choice<00:02:25.710> Act<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.850> simply<00:02:27.330> that

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
employee Free Choice Act is simply that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.270 
employee Free Choice Act is simply that
this<00:02:28.080> will<00:02:28.260> make<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.440> easier<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.980> people<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
this will make it easier for people to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.820 
this will make it easier for people to
join<00:02:29.520> unions<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.840> think<00:02:31.020> that's<00:02:31.200> damaging

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
join unions and we think that's damaging

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.110 
join unions and we think that's damaging
to<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.100> economy<00:02:33.110> then<00:02:34.370> they<00:02:35.370> probably<00:02:35.640> won't

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
to the economy then they probably won't

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.590 
to the economy then they probably won't
get<00:02:36.420> too<00:02:36.630> far<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.140> me<00:02:37.320> if<00:02:38.220> their<00:02:39.090> arguments

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
get too far with me if their arguments

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.630 
get too far with me if their arguments
are<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:40.410> think<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:40.830> are<00:02:40.920> more<00:02:41.070> elegant<00:02:41.490> ways

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
are we think there are more elegant ways

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.180 
are we think there are more elegant ways
of<00:02:42.000> doing<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:42.810> or<00:02:43.230> here's<00:02:43.980> some

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
of doing this or here's some

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.640 
of doing this or here's some
modification<00:02:44.940> or<00:02:45.060> tweaks<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> general

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
modification or tweaks to the general

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.300 
modification or tweaks to the general
concept<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.489> would<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:48.920> then<00:02:49.920> I

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
concept that we would like to see then I

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.250 
concept that we would like to see then I
think<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.030> conversation<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.720> not

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
think that's a conversation that not

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.650 
think that's a conversation that not
only<00:02:52.410> myself<00:02:52.800> but<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.340> think<00:02:53.730> folks<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.510> labor

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
only myself but I think folks and labor

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.800 
only myself but I think folks and labor
would<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.080> willing<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.780> know

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
would be willing to have but so you know

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900 
would be willing to have but so you know
that<00:02:58.020> that's<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:59.010> general<00:02:59.340> approach<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.880> I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
that that's the general approach that I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.690 
that that's the general approach that I
medicine<00:03:00.300> taking<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.630> terms<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:00.959> timetable<00:03:01.700> if

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
medicine taking in terms of timetable if

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.390 
medicine taking in terms of timetable if
if<00:03:03.090> we're<00:03:03.570> losing<00:03:03.870> half<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.140> million<00:03:04.320> jobs<00:03:04.650> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
if we're losing half a million jobs a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.260 
if we're losing half a million jobs a
month<00:03:05.780> then<00:03:07.070> there<00:03:08.070> are<00:03:08.220> no<00:03:08.370> jobs<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.850> unionize

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
month then there are no jobs to unionize

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.490 
month then there are no jobs to unionize
so<00:03:09.720> my<00:03:10.350> focus<00:03:10.590> first<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.989> those<00:03:12.989> key

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
so my focus first is on those key

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.650 
so my focus first is on those key
economic<00:03:13.890> priority<00:03:14.610> items

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.720
