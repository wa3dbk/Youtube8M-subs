00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
not personally pick the winner because I

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.529 
not personally pick the winner because I
feel<00:00:48.039> like<00:00:48.069> that<00:00:48.309> would<00:00:48.429> be<00:00:48.579> totally<00:00:48.819> uncool

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
feel like that would be totally uncool

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.439 
feel like that would be totally uncool
so<00:00:50.260> instead<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.769> use<00:00:50.949> a<00:00:51.370> website<00:00:51.579> that<00:00:51.819> randomly

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
so instead I use a website that randomly

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.840 
so instead I use a website that randomly
chose<00:00:52.749> the<00:00:52.929> comments<00:00:53.379> because<00:00:54.010> I<00:00:54.219> just<00:00:54.399> felt

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
chose the comments because I just felt

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.149 
chose the comments because I just felt
like<00:00:54.969> that<00:00:55.030> was<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.510> most<00:00:55.659> fair<00:00:56.409> way<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:56.649> do<00:00:56.979> it

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
like that was the most fair way to do it

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.219 
like that was the most fair way to do it
so<00:00:57.550> I<00:00:57.609> don't<00:00:57.969> want<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.390> think<00:00:58.600> that<00:00:58.749> I<00:00:58.839> pick
