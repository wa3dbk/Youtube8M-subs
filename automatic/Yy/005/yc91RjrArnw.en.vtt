00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
tiny population which means we're gonna

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.689 
tiny population which means we're gonna

panther<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:43.470> they<00:04:43.650> have<00:04:43.830> larger<00:04:44.280> populations

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
panther is they have larger populations

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.689

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
know Cherokee bricking touts that they

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.590 
know Cherokee bricking touts that they
saw<00:05:19.630> one

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
saw one

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.750 
saw one
it's<00:05:21.170> Megan<00:05:21.410> Telegraph<00:05:21.890> before<00:05:22.250> darkness<00:05:22.430> and

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
it's Megan Telegraph before darkness and

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.800 
it's Megan Telegraph before darkness and
my<00:05:22.850> offset<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.270> buddies

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
my offset the buddies

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.760 
my offset the buddies
I<00:05:24.620> guess<00:05:24.800> according<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:26.020> underbase

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.210 

Johnson<00:05:30.770> one<00:05:31.250> thing<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:32.200> the<00:05:33.200> DNR<00:05:33.680> says<00:05:33.710> they

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
Johnson one thing the the DNR says they

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.530 
Johnson one thing the the DNR says they
don't<00:05:34.370> believe<00:05:34.520> anybody<00:05:34.790> ablest<00:05:35.270> they<00:05:35.360> have<00:05:35.510> a

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
don't believe anybody ablest they have a

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.500 
don't believe anybody ablest they have a
plaster<00:05:36.020> cast<00:05:36.050> of<00:05:36.530> a<00:05:36.590> footprint<00:05:37.070> or<00:05:37.510> a

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
plaster cast of a footprint or a

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.670 
plaster cast of a footprint or a
photograph<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:40.720> I'm<00:05:41.720> thinking<00:05:42.290> that<00:05:42.530> if

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
photograph and I'm thinking that if

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.590 
photograph and I'm thinking that if
you've<00:05:42.800> got<00:05:42.980> all<00:05:43.160> these<00:05:43.340> sightings<00:05:43.730> and<00:05:44.330> some

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
you've got all these sightings and some

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.090 
you've got all these sightings and some
of<00:05:44.690> them<00:05:44.810> were<00:05:44.900> real<00:05:45.050> credible<00:05:45.470> people<00:05:45.890> like

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
of them were real credible people like

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.550 
of them were real credible people like
the<00:05:46.310> base<00:05:46.670> is<00:05:46.970> talking<00:05:47.240> about<00:05:47.480> mental<00:05:47.990> guy<00:05:48.200> and

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
the base is talking about mental guy and

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.920 
the base is talking about mental guy and
use<00:05:49.190> somebody<00:05:49.940> that<00:05:50.120> can<00:05:50.300> be<00:05:50.450> considered

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
use somebody that can be considered

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.430 
use somebody that can be considered
pretty<00:05:51.350> much<00:05:51.530> an<00:05:51.710> expert<00:05:51.800> on<00:05:52.220> footprints<00:05:53.440> with

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
pretty much an expert on footprints with

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.110 
pretty much an expert on footprints with
experiencing<00:05:55.130> them<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.730> that<00:05:55.850> might<00:05:56.090> be

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
experiencing them and that might be

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.500 
experiencing them and that might be
credible<00:05:56.690> enough<00:05:57.520> because<00:05:58.520> would<00:05:59.240> it<00:05:59.360> make

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
credible enough because would it make

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.440 
credible enough because would it make
any<00:05:59.570> difference<00:06:00.670> what<00:06:01.670> would<00:06:01.850> you<00:06:01.940> think<00:06:02.000> if

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
any difference what would you think if

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.510 
any difference what would you think if
you<00:06:02.660> haven't<00:06:02.990> taken<00:06:03.110> a<00:06:03.320> plaster<00:06:03.920> cast<00:06:03.950> and

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
you haven't taken a plaster cast and

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.760 
you haven't taken a plaster cast and
taken<00:06:05.360> it<00:06:05.480> to<00:06:05.510> other<00:06:05.870> people<00:06:06.020> could<00:06:06.440> they<00:06:06.590> of

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
taken it to other people could they of

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.550 
taken it to other people could they of
towed<00:06:07.270> more<00:06:08.270> than<00:06:08.390> you<00:06:08.540> is<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:08.930> just<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.260> shape

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
towed more than you is it just the shape

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.110 
towed more than you is it just the shape
of<00:06:09.800> it<00:06:10.010> is<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.640> shapes<00:06:10.910> narrows<00:06:12.640> so<00:06:13.640> basically

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
of it is the shapes narrows so basically

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.090 
of it is the shapes narrows so basically

you couldn't tell any more from plaster

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.270 
you couldn't tell any more from plaster

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
sunk into the mud deep enough that it

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.550 
sunk into the mud deep enough that it
would<00:06:44.360> have<00:06:44.480> showed<00:06:44.660> a<00:06:44.690> cause<00:06:44.990> of<00:06:45.020> it's<00:06:45.410> our

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
would have showed a cause of it's our

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.310 
would have showed a cause of it's our
dog<00:06:48.310> this<00:06:49.310> was<00:06:49.550> as<00:06:49.850> I<00:06:50.450> was<00:06:50.480> fairly<00:06:50.870> new<00:06:51.020> to

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
dog this was as I was fairly new to

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.340 
dog this was as I was fairly new to
Georgia<00:06:51.680> and<00:06:51.920> I<00:06:51.980> didn't<00:06:52.190> realize<00:06:52.550> that

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
Georgia and I didn't realize that

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.420 
Georgia and I didn't realize that
documented<00:06:54.350> was<00:06:54.500> signing<00:06:54.830> like<00:06:54.950> this<00:06:55.190> will<00:06:55.400> be

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
documented was signing like this will be

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.550 
documented was signing like this will be
that<00:06:55.520> critical<00:06:55.910> I<00:06:56.210> thought<00:06:56.510> that<00:06:57.230> was<00:06:57.350> not

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
that critical I thought that was not

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.150 
that critical I thought that was not
going<00:06:57.800> far<00:06:58.070> yeah<00:06:58.940> I<00:06:59.350> don't<00:07:00.350> not<00:07:00.680> saying<00:07:00.950> we

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160 
going far yeah I don't not saying we

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.250 
going far yeah I don't not saying we
catch<00:07:01.400> a<00:07:01.550> common<00:07:02.000> but<00:07:02.180> I<00:07:02.420> would<00:07:02.840> not<00:07:03.020> think

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:03.260 
catch a common but I would not think

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.650 
catch a common but I would not think
that<00:07:03.410> it<00:07:04.190> was<00:07:04.340> impossible<00:07:04.700> for<00:07:05.180> the<00:07:05.240> DNR<00:07:05.630> to

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 
that it was impossible for the DNR to

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.160 
that it was impossible for the DNR to
believe<00:07:06.080> that<00:07:06.230> to<00:07:06.500> capture<00:07:06.740> their<00:07:07.930> yeah<00:07:08.930> but

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
believe that to capture their yeah but
