 the cookies and the oatmeal is very 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.470

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.260
 include it very well we make our 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.810
 toppings we are going to add vanilla 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.180
 a trickle of vanilla extract for 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.610
 to give you a taste even more ay not know 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.000
 how oatmeal smells delicious to the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:10.560
 cookie if you want to not sugar 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.780
 really muscovado the cookie already has 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.190
 Sweet already has sugar but if you 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.639
 optional is a little bit nothing but yes 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.370
 is trying to 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.460
 - your face to your family can do without 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.710
 from her easily then we already have 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.080
 here exactly how we want 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.690
 let's divide the toppings we're going to 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.150
 make the base of our cake or of 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.970
 our frozen we have a refractory 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.300
 that can enter the freezer we put 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.340
 half and we started to press like 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.890
 we were making a cheese country 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:54.760
 just like that then we put 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:58.480
 butter avn remember biscuits and 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:02.070
 vanilla then good at home what 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.700
 we make very very nice very neat 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.560
 clean and small and the base was left 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.610
 I'm going to clean my hands to be able 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.310
 continue making the filling then 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.960
 the filling is very simple we are also going 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.090
 to put a bar of cream cheese 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.449
 at room temperature so it's 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.690
 well soft and do not have any 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.430
 problem look how smooth it is then not 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.710
 have no problem to include it with 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.830
 the rest of the ingredients we are going to 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.610
 put yoghurt I love it because it's acid 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:41.009
 it's much lighter it combines very very 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.990
 well and you will like it because this is going to 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.169
 to be as if it were an ice cream as if 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.990
