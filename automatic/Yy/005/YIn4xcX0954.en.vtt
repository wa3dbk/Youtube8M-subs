process on this avi file was about a gig
1.2<00:03:59.269> gigabytes<00:03:59.630> so<00:04:00.140> that's<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.890> fairly<00:04:01.250> fast

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
just going to delete this since I don't

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.089 
just going to delete this since I don't
really<00:04:17.090> need<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.450> here<00:04:17.630> but<00:04:18.229> go<00:04:18.859> ahead<00:04:18.979> and

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
really need it here but go ahead and

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.839 
really need it here but go ahead and
import<00:04:19.609> media<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.330> find<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.320> mp4<00:04:22.099> file<00:04:22.430> you

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
import media and find the mp4 file you

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.290 
import media and find the mp4 file you
just<00:04:23.210> made

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
just made

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.570 
just made
there<00:04:26.300> we<00:04:26.449> go<00:04:26.960> then<00:04:27.889> just<00:04:28.069> drag<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
there we go then just drag it to the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.189 
there we go then just drag it to the
timeline<00:04:30.849> and<00:04:32.979> you're<00:04:33.979> going<00:04:34.250> to<00:04:34.280> see<00:04:34.550> audio

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
timeline and you're going to see audio

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:42.070 
timeline and you're going to see audio
right<00:04:36.199> there<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.729> whole<00:04:41.000> audio<00:04:41.509> track<00:04:41.900> is

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
right there so the whole audio track is

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.040 
right there so the whole audio track is
there<00:04:42.259> now<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.970> video<00:04:44.210> is<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.419> lot<00:04:44.599> easier

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
there now and the video is a lot easier

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.820 
there now and the video is a lot easier
to<00:04:45.110> work<00:04:45.289> with<00:04:46.150> it's<00:04:47.150> building<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.229> audio

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
to work with it's building the audio

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.950 
to work with it's building the audio
right<00:04:49.160> now<00:04:49.310> as<00:04:49.460> we<00:04:49.610> speak

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
right now as we speak

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.309 
right now as we speak
building<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.889> Peaks<00:04:52.130> for<00:04:52.370> it<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:53.050> that's<00:04:54.050> why

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
building the Peaks for it so that's why

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.379 
building the Peaks for it so that's why
you<00:04:54.380> don't<00:04:54.590> actually<00:04:54.830> see<00:04:55.069> the<00:04:55.280> waves<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.300> all

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
you don't actually see the waves and all

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:06.010 
you don't actually see the waves and all
that<00:04:56.599> -<00:04:56.780> pretty<00:04:56.990> nice<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.620> suppose<00:05:04.539> but<00:05:05.539> yeah<00:05:05.720> so

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
that - pretty nice I suppose but yeah so

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.499 
that - pretty nice I suppose but yeah so
you<00:05:06.110> can<00:05:06.349> just<00:05:06.560> play<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:07.669> it<00:05:08.180> has<00:05:08.360> the

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
you can just play it and it has the

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.589 
you can just play it and it has the
audio<00:05:08.870> now<00:05:09.139> and<00:05:09.759> playback<00:05:10.759> is<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:10.970> lot<00:05:11.210> smoother

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
audio now and playback is a lot smoother

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.089 
audio now and playback is a lot smoother
it's<00:05:11.750> not<00:05:11.900> smooth<00:05:12.259> as<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.530> can<00:05:12.650> see<00:05:12.860> right<00:05:13.069> now

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
it's not smooth as you can see right now

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.129 
it's not smooth as you can see right now
for<00:05:13.940> me<00:05:14.030> because<00:05:14.330> I'm<00:05:14.449> recording<00:05:14.599> right<00:05:14.960> now

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
for me because I'm recording right now

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.649 
for me because I'm recording right now
but<00:05:15.979> it<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.610> lot<00:05:16.819> smoother<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.300> it's<00:05:17.509> a<00:05:17.569> lot

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
but it is a lot smoother and it's a lot

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.379 
but it is a lot smoother and it's a lot
easier<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:18.050> work<00:05:18.169> with<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:19.120> yeah<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.360> was

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
easier to work with and yeah that was

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.159 
easier to work with and yeah that was
just<00:05:20.479> a<00:05:20.720> really<00:05:20.960> quick<00:05:21.229> process<00:05:21.830> to<00:05:22.340> use<00:05:22.430> the

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
just a really quick process to use the

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.830 
just a really quick process to use the
AVR<00:05:24.169> media<00:05:24.500> game<00:05:24.740> capture<00:05:25.069> HD<00:05:25.150> mp4<00:05:26.150> builder<00:05:26.539> it

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
AVR media game capture HD mp4 builder it

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.839 
AVR media game capture HD mp4 builder it
does<00:05:27.259> add<00:05:27.530> an<00:05:27.710> extra<00:05:27.949> step<00:05:28.219> I'm<00:05:28.430> not<00:05:28.639> going<00:05:28.789> to

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
does add an extra step I'm not going to

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.499 
does add an extra step I'm not going to
lie<00:05:29.000> but<00:05:29.539> it's<00:05:29.690> a<00:05:29.780> very<00:05:30.050> easy<00:05:30.409> step<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:31.330> it's<00:05:32.330> a

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
lie but it's a very easy step and it's a

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.399 
lie but it's a very easy step and it's a
very<00:05:32.780> simple<00:05:33.080> process<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:34.270> this<00:05:35.270> software<00:05:36.080> is

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
very simple process and this software is

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:37.689 
very simple process and this software is
very<00:05:36.620> good<00:05:36.860> you<00:05:37.009> can<00:05:37.159> use<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.430> for<00:05:37.520> other

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
very good you can use it for other

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.490 
very good you can use it for other
things<00:05:37.820> as<00:05:38.210> well<00:05:38.360> if<00:05:38.570> you<00:05:38.659> have<00:05:38.780> other<00:05:39.080> AVI
