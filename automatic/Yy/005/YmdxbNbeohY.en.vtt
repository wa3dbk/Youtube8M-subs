00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 what does yoga have to do with notebooks or 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.069
 nothing could be thought of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.099
 but because of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.570
 Lenovo calls her convertible and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:17.789
 look at the latest one 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 Lenovo Yoga comes three per whole 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 ever in a packaging the very 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.960
 noble effect can not be said otherwise 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.240
 plain and black and let's see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.150
 So here are two black ones 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.009
 fold and if I now apart 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 then move the whole up 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 lifted and of course that makes one 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.590
 very high quality impression 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.850
 Here is the device 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.780
 we'll get started right away 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.600
 What have we got here yet ? 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.039
 Obviously this is manuals here 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.210
 or warranty note in exactly the same way 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.039
 where can you not speak so here 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.129
 that's just one of those 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.350
 quick reference what do we have here 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.850
 this looks like a usb 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.980
 cable but because of that that's it 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.570
 charging cable and that is here at the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.570
 power adapter connected 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.570
 now let the appliance slightly 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.430
 look closer convertible means yes I 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.909
 It can be used both as a tablet and as a 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.040
 use a notebook 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.799
 By the way, it is relatively easy by the way 1100 90 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.750
 gram from the outside I like it well 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.490
 looks really noble one wonders 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.790
 just what's that funny behind here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.680
 that looks a bit strange that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.780
 Now it is now that the hinge is off 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.820
 six different parts and that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.890
 In turn, there are over 800 items 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.360
 even so put that together 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.600
 Hinge is important too 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.250
 you always move that back and forth 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.840
 So speak now not as I 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
 perhaps now but can be anywhere 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.130
 happen during a day so that 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.299
 you go back and forth several times 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.390
 it works that way too 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.509
 So, how is it in here? 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.630
 that dark dull black that 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.579
 looks good and it is pleasantly light 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.969
 and so you will not use now 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.819
 but if I raise this or indeed 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.050
 it's okay as a tablet 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.569
 pretty hard, of course, logically 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.469
 but it also has 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.730
 at 13 3 inches its size brand new 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.900
 Incidentally, the hinge was developed 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.629
 that is with a so-called 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.459
 converter especially important and this 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.489
 new hinge that also allows 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.579
 It is a fairly thin device 12.8 mm 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.500
 necessary at the thickest point is installed 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.959
 a new low-power core processor 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.670
 from Intel's current haswell series 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.889
 advantage of this process is it 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.069
 does not have to be laboriously cooled and 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.150
 logically, this also saves space 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.189
 by default the processor works with 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.870
 1 gigahertz but can be per 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.280
 turbo boost technology also increase 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.109
 on 26 gigahertz 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.280
 that is then just for applications the 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.189
 more computing power is needed 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.540
 video editing software for example 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.489
 a total of 8 gb were used 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.019
 RAM and not ordinary 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.329
 disk more but a fast 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.340
 ssd and that may vary depending on equipment 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.370
 You can then buy up to 512 gigabytes 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.370
 Can the big be yes to the screen 13 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.709
 3 inches, the display is big are 33 8 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.569
 centimeter and the resolution can become 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.230
 let see 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.389
 3200 times 1800 pixels the wlan 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.569
 works on the ac standard and 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:23.079
 bluetooth 4.0 is supported and that 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.879
 device has two usb 3.0 ports 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.069
 the lenovo yoga three pro has us in the test 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.829
 really really liked it 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.949
 is a thoughtful convertible 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.810
 disadvantage, however, the price is 1599 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:38.229
 euro are then just a whole 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.229
 stake money
