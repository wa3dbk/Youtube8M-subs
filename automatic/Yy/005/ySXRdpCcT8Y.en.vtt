hardly ever find but one thing to
knowing<00:01:46.259> about<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> water<00:01:47.369> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
knowing about this is the water it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760 
knowing about this is the water it
sometimes<00:01:48.840> comes<00:01:49.079> off<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> edge<00:01:49.530> but

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
sometimes comes off the edge but

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.359 
sometimes comes off the edge but
sometimes<00:01:50.159> doesn't<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:51.299> not<00:01:51.479> exactly<00:01:51.720> sure

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
sometimes doesn't I'm not exactly sure

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.670 
sometimes doesn't I'm not exactly sure
what<00:01:53.369> causes<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.110> come<00:01:55.110> off<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.380> edge<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
what causes it to come off the edge and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.950 
what causes it to come off the edge and
what<00:01:55.860> causes<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:57.119> normal<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.659> think<00:01:57.840> it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
what causes it to be normal I think it's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.230 
what causes it to be normal I think it's
block<00:01:58.170> updates<00:01:58.530> though<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:59.130> water<00:01:59.549> freezing

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
block updates though like water freezing

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.510 
block updates though like water freezing
because<00:02:01.079> you'll<00:02:01.259> notice<00:02:01.500> around<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.280> where

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
because you'll notice around it is where

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.910 
because you'll notice around it is where
it's<00:02:02.640> happening<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.649> that's<00:02:04.649> kind<00:02:04.829> of

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's happening so that's kind of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.730 
it's happening so that's kind of
annoying<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.780> mod<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.350> still

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
annoying but you know this mod is still

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.219 
annoying but you know this mod is still
I<00:02:08.009> believe<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.700> its<00:02:08.970> beta<00:02:09.239> stages<00:02:09.569> so

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
I believe in its beta stages so

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.020 
I believe in its beta stages so
hopefully<00:02:10.560> we'll<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.830> fix<00:02:11.069> for<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.280> but

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
hopefully we'll see a fix for that but

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.860 
hopefully we'll see a fix for that but
the<00:02:12.120> cool<00:02:12.330> thing<00:02:12.360> is

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the cool thing is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.380 
the cool thing is
is<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.980> generate<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.640> cheese<00:02:14.909> generate

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
is you can generate the cheese generate

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.649 
is you can generate the cheese generate
that<00:02:15.540> trees<00:02:16.379> sorry<00:02:16.909> generate<00:02:17.909> the<00:02:18.420> full

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
that trees sorry generate the full

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.750 
that trees sorry generate the full
foliage<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.620> everything<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.099> it's<00:02:20.459> not<00:02:20.610> just

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
foliage and everything and it's not just

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.750 
foliage and everything and it's not just
the<00:02:21.030> wood<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> few<00:02:22.709> lease<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.099> top<00:02:23.280> so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the wood and a few lease on top so

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.160 
the wood and a few lease on top so
that's<00:02:23.940> definitely<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.540> really<00:02:24.780> nice<00:02:24.930> thing

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that's definitely a really nice thing

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.630 
that's definitely a really nice thing
because<00:02:25.409> otherwise<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.069> trees<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.489> just

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
because otherwise the trees would just

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
because otherwise the trees would just
look<00:02:26.730> completely<00:02:27.090> unnatural<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.379> see

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
look completely unnatural but you see

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.640 
look completely unnatural but you see
down<00:02:29.069> here<00:02:29.370> there<00:02:29.640> is<00:02:29.760> everything<00:02:30.120> spawning

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
down here there is everything spawning

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.000 
down here there is everything spawning
Cole<00:02:31.650> there's<00:02:32.010> iron<00:02:32.400> there's<00:02:32.430> gold<00:02:32.940> there's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
Cole there's iron there's gold there's

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.220 
Cole there's iron there's gold there's
again<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.430> quotes<00:02:35.790> caves<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.750> there's<00:02:37.019> lava

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
again in quotes caves and there's lava

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.530 
again in quotes caves and there's lava
so<00:02:37.829> in<00:02:38.129> this<00:02:38.340> world<00:02:38.610> i'm<00:02:39.000> not<00:02:39.150> sure<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.329> i'll

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
so in this world i'm not sure if i'll

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.089 
so in this world i'm not sure if i'll
find<00:02:39.780> diamonds<00:02:40.200> probably<00:02:40.650> not<00:02:40.769> though<00:02:40.920> in

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
find diamonds probably not though in

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.399 
find diamonds probably not though in
this<00:02:41.519> world<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.780> pretty<00:02:42.959> much<00:02:43.079> do

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
this world you can pretty much do

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.699 
this world you can pretty much do
everything<00:02:43.560> normally<00:02:45.410> now<00:02:46.410> that's

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
everything normally now that's

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.319 
everything normally now that's
interesting<00:02:48.109> hmm<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.890> water<00:02:50.160> while<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.030> maid

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
interesting hmm the water while the maid

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.940 
interesting hmm the water while the maid
cobblestone<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.500> pretty<00:02:52.709> cool<00:02:52.799> actually

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
cobblestone that's pretty cool actually

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.830 
cobblestone that's pretty cool actually
in<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.030> world<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.450> going<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.629> be<00:02:54.690> pretty

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
in this world it's going to be pretty

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.720 
in this world it's going to be pretty
hard<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.140> find<00:02:55.349> diamonds<00:02:55.530> though<00:02:55.920> same<00:02:56.579> right

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
hard to find diamonds though same right

hard to find diamonds though same right
there<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.659> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.900> pretty<00:02:57.989> hard<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
there it's going to be pretty hard to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.270 
there it's going to be pretty hard to
find<00:02:58.530> diamonds<00:02:58.739> because<00:02:59.810> who<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:02.010> I'm<00:03:02.129> getting

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
find diamonds because who so I'm getting

find diamonds because who so I'm getting
Oh<00:03:02.780> getting<00:03:03.780> distracted<00:03:04.079> by<00:03:04.409> things<00:03:04.470> i

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
Oh getting distracted by things i

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.559 
Oh getting distracted by things i
thought<00:03:04.980> i<00:03:05.099> was<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> shoot<00:03:06.000> down<00:03:06.209> but<00:03:06.480> it's

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
thought i was a shoot down but it's

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.610 
thought i was a shoot down but it's
going<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.840> pretty<00:03:06.900> hard<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.170> find<00:03:07.379> diamonds

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
going to be pretty hard to find diamonds

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.880 
going to be pretty hard to find diamonds
as<00:03:08.549> i<00:03:08.730> am<00:03:08.879> right<00:03:08.909> about<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.569> diamond<00:03:10.019> level<00:03:10.200> see

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
as i am right about it diamond level see

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.789 
as i am right about it diamond level see
I'm<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.340> level<00:03:12.060> 13<00:03:12.390> diamonds<00:03:13.200> are<00:03:13.409> typically

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
I'm it level 13 diamonds are typically

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.309 
I'm it level 13 diamonds are typically
level<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.340> 11<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.659> I'm<00:03:15.780> not<00:03:15.900> seeing<00:03:16.140> any

level like 11 and I'm not seeing any

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.379 
level like 11 and I'm not seeing any
just<00:03:17.010> because<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> world<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:17.910> narrow<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
just because the world is so narrow and

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.970 
just because the world is so narrow and
stuff<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.530> as<00:03:20.099> far<00:03:20.370> as<00:03:20.430> getting<00:03:20.790> order<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.239> go

stuff so as far as getting order to go
for<00:03:22.980> future<00:03:23.310> stages<00:03:23.819> of<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.060> mod<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.780> would

for future stages of this mod it would

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.300 
for future stages of this mod it would
be<00:03:25.019> nice<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.349> have<00:03:25.470> an<00:03:25.650> increased<00:03:26.099> frequency

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
be nice to have an increased frequency

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.369 
be nice to have an increased frequency
of<00:03:26.609> some<00:03:26.910> things<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.299> diamonds<00:03:27.599> especially

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
want to spend too much time building I'd

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.229

rather<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.949> just<00:04:08.250> explained<00:04:08.699> the<00:04:08.819> mod<00:04:08.970> which

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
rather have just explained the mod which

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.300 
rather have just explained the mod which
is<00:04:09.449> which<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:09.900> what<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.109> tried<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.379> do<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.769> I

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
is which is what I tried to do and I

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.539 
is which is what I tried to do and I
think<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.699> did<00:04:11.940> pretty<00:04:12.150> well<00:04:12.389> hopefully

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
think I did pretty well hopefully

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.219 
think I did pretty well hopefully
hopefully<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.760> did<00:04:14.910> pretty<00:04:15.060> well<00:04:15.180> really<00:04:16.109> not

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
hopefully I did pretty well really not

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.259 
hopefully I did pretty well really not
sure<00:04:16.260> how<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.070> guys<00:04:17.430> will<00:04:17.820> think<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.150> it

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
sure how you guys will think of it

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.899 
sure how you guys will think of it
though<00:04:18.419> so<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:20.220> way<00:04:20.340> I'm<00:04:20.430> going<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.699> build

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
though so the way I'm going to build

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.490 
though so the way I'm going to build
this<00:04:21.030> house<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.049> way<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.200> think

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
this house and this is the way I think

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.690 
this house and this is the way I think
it's<00:04:22.620> best<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:23.130> 2d<00:04:23.969> really<00:04:24.810> you

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
it's best for 2d really you

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.570 
it's best for 2d really you
you<00:04:26.000> oops<00:04:26.570> wrong<00:04:26.900> button<00:04:27.380> is<00:04:27.860> you're<00:04:28.340> going<00:04:28.460> to

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
you oops wrong button is you're going to

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.850 
you oops wrong button is you're going to
build<00:04:28.700> up<00:04:28.940> for<00:04:29.300> blocks<00:04:29.480> like<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:29.960> sure<00:04:30.710> the

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
build up for blocks like that sure the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.490 
build up for blocks like that sure the
first<00:04:31.040> two<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.600> then<00:04:32.600> you'll<00:04:32.750> see<00:04:32.930> if<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:33.230> look

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
first two and then you'll see if I look

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.060 
first two and then you'll see if I look
up<00:04:33.650> right<00:04:33.800> there<00:04:34.510> this<00:04:35.510> is<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.930> part<00:04:36.650> where<00:04:36.770> it

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
up right there this is the part where it

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.390 
up right there this is the part where it
gets<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.310> little<00:04:37.400> hard<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.790> build<00:04:37.940> in<00:04:38.210> this<00:04:38.390> mode

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
gets a little hard to build in this mode

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.460 
gets a little hard to build in this mode
yeah<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.480> can<00:04:41.600> imagine<00:04:41.780> this<00:04:42.140> would<00:04:42.290> be<00:04:42.440> a

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
yeah it you can imagine this would be a

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.510 
yeah it you can imagine this would be a
little<00:04:42.650> bit<00:04:42.770> annoying<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:43.160> I<00:04:43.220> wasn't<00:04:43.400> in

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
little bit annoying if I wasn't in

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.190 
little bit annoying if I wasn't in
creative<00:04:43.820> mode<00:04:43.850> not<00:04:44.150> going<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.360> destroy

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
creative mode not going to destroy

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.720 
creative mode not going to destroy
instantly<00:04:45.620> but<00:04:46.010> at<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.160> same<00:04:46.310> time<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.610> would

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
instantly but at the same time it would

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.850 
instantly but at the same time it would
be<00:04:46.760> possibly<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.510> little<00:04:47.600> bit<00:04:47.780> easier<00:04:47.930> but

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
be possibly a little bit easier but

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.740 
be possibly a little bit easier but
building<00:04:49.490> like<00:04:49.610> this<00:04:49.760> does<00:04:50.030> give<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.420> more

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
building like this does give you more

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.180 
building like this does give you more
the<00:04:50.870> satisfaction<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.500> doing<00:04:51.560> this<00:04:51.800> normally

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
the satisfaction of doing this normally

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.610 
the satisfaction of doing this normally
and<00:04:52.700> this<00:04:53.270> mod<00:04:53.480> kind<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.840> make<00:04:53.960> selector<00:04:54.320> area

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
and this mod kind of make selector area

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.990 
and this mod kind of make selector area
I<00:04:54.770> know<00:04:54.860> how<00:04:55.460> bunch<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.730> people<00:04:55.940> would

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
I know how bunch of people would

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.250 
I know how bunch of people would
probably<00:04:56.150> get<00:04:56.390> mad<00:04:56.600> at<00:04:56.720> me<00:04:56.750> for<00:04:56.930> saying<00:04:57.050> that

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
probably get mad at me for saying that

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.110 
probably get mad at me for saying that
because<00:04:57.830> there<00:04:58.640> are<00:04:58.700> two<00:04:58.880> completely

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
because there are two completely

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.190 
because there are two completely
different<00:04:59.540> games<00:04:59.920> ones<00:05:01.030> RPG<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.270> one<00:05:03.020> is

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
different games ones RPG and one is

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.860 
different games ones RPG and one is
building<00:05:03.680> but<00:05:04.190> I<00:05:04.220> mean<00:05:04.610> just<00:05:05.210> as<00:05:05.300> far<00:05:05.420> as<00:05:05.570> 2d

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
building but I mean just as far as 2d

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.480 
building but I mean just as far as 2d
goes<00:05:06.140> it<00:05:06.380> makes<00:05:06.890> it<00:05:07.010> kind<00:05:07.160> of<00:05:07.220> have<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.460> same

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
goes it makes it kind of have the same

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.280 
goes it makes it kind of have the same
2d<00:05:07.970> feel<00:05:08.180> as<00:05:08.480> terraria<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:11.000> same<00:05:11.180> way

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
2d feel as terraria and in the same way

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.360 
2d feel as terraria and in the same way
instead<00:05:12.290> of<00:05:12.410> just<00:05:12.560> leaving<00:05:12.800> my<00:05:12.980> house<00:05:13.130> like

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
instead of just leaving my house like

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.160 
instead of just leaving my house like
this<00:05:13.580> or<00:05:13.850> leaving<00:05:14.150> it<00:05:14.300> open<00:05:14.480> so<00:05:14.750> you<00:05:14.930> can<00:05:15.050> see

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
this or leaving it open so you can see

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.110 
this or leaving it open so you can see
the<00:05:15.260> outside<00:05:15.380> I'm<00:05:16.190> gonna<00:05:16.370> try<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.550> put<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
the outside I'm gonna try to put a

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.630 
the outside I'm gonna try to put a
background<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:18.470> way<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.740> terraria<00:05:19.280> kind<00:05:19.550> of

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
background the way the terraria kind of

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.610 
background the way the terraria kind of
does<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.910> although<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:20.990> really<00:05:21.290> hard<00:05:21.470> to

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
does it although it is really hard to

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
to do this right alright so I'm back on

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.810 
to do this right alright so I'm back on
right<00:06:03.680> now<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:04.840> we<00:06:05.840> will<00:06:06.050> just<00:06:06.350> put<00:06:06.860> a<00:06:07.130> simple

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
right now and we will just put a simple

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.520 
right now and we will just put a simple
little<00:06:07.910> backdrop<00:06:08.360> right<00:06:08.630> here<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.320> reason

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
little backdrop right here the reason

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.600 
little backdrop right here the reason
I'm<00:06:09.590> using<00:06:09.650> different<00:06:10.070> colored<00:06:10.250> wood<00:06:10.430> is

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
I'm using different colored wood is

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.280 
I'm using different colored wood is
because<00:06:10.790> I<00:06:11.150> think<00:06:11.360> it<00:06:11.420> will<00:06:11.540> show<00:06:11.720> the

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
because I think it will show the

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.530 
because I think it will show the
difference<00:06:12.680> between<00:06:12.830> the<00:06:13.460> background<00:06:13.970> and

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
difference between the background and

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.450 
difference between the background and
the<00:06:14.660> front<00:06:15.020> ground<00:06:15.260> are<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:15.650> foreground<00:06:16.190> I

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
the front ground are the foreground I

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.630 
the front ground are the foreground I
guess<00:06:16.730> I<00:06:16.820> should<00:06:17.000> call<00:06:17.120> it<00:06:17.270> pretty<00:06:17.870> nicely<00:06:18.140> and

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
guess I should call it pretty nicely and

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.170 
guess I should call it pretty nicely and
it'll<00:06:19.640> make<00:06:19.820> the<00:06:19.970> house<00:06:20.150> look<00:06:20.330> nice<00:06:22.180> alright

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
it'll make the house look nice alright

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.630 
it'll make the house look nice alright
so<00:06:23.360> turn<00:06:23.870> this<00:06:24.050> debug<00:06:24.530> mode<00:06:24.710> back<00:06:25.130> off<00:06:25.370> and

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.640 
so turn this debug mode back off and

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.760 
so turn this debug mode back off and
you'll<00:06:26.570> see<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:26.780> got<00:06:27.080> pretty<00:06:27.380> much<00:06:27.500> like<00:06:27.710> a

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
you'll see I got pretty much like a

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.090 
you'll see I got pretty much like a
house<00:06:27.950> and<00:06:28.250> it'll<00:06:29.240> look<00:06:29.450> a<00:06:29.840> lot<00:06:30.470> more<00:06:30.530> natural

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100

not exactly sure how easy it is to close
this<00:06:59.870> door<00:07:00.139> though<00:07:01.300> yeah<00:07:02.500> so<00:07:03.500> there<00:07:03.710> are<00:07:03.800> some
