00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
I've never really done anything with

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.509 
I've never really done anything with
Pathfinder<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:58.000> I'm<00:03:58.390> not<00:03:59.050> real<00:03:59.680> familiar<00:03:59.709> with

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
Pathfinder so I'm not real familiar with

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.780 
Pathfinder so I'm not real familiar with
the<00:04:01.269> system<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:02.019> mean<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.650> know<00:04:02.709> it's<00:04:03.010> based<00:04:03.549> on

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
the system I mean I know it's based on

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.510 
the system I mean I know it's based on
the<00:04:06.540> d20

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
the d20

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.790 
the d20
in<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.870> 3.5<00:04:09.870> but<00:04:10.170> I've<00:04:10.440> never<00:04:10.680> actually

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
in the 3.5 but I've never actually

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.130 
in the 3.5 but I've never actually
played<00:04:11.160> Pathfinder<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.240> this<00:04:12.780> looks<00:04:12.960> like

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
played Pathfinder so this looks like

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.090 
played Pathfinder so this looks like
it's<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.440> really<00:04:13.740> good<00:04:13.890> intro<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.330> system

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
it's a really good intro to the system

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.840 
it's a really good intro to the system
as<00:04:17.100> well<00:04:19.100> here's<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:22.010> map<00:04:23.010> kind<00:04:23.640> of<00:04:23.670> a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
as well here's the map kind of a

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.990 
as well here's the map kind of a
reversible<00:04:24.690> battle<00:04:25.620> mat<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.610> believe<00:04:26.880> you

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
can ride on this with both dry race and

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.970 
can ride on this with both dry race and
wet<00:04:35.220> erase<00:04:35.640> markers<00:04:36.180> which<00:04:36.390> is<00:04:36.540> really<00:04:36.780> nice
