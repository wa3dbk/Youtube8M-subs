00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.610 
after i got this camera
I<00:03:09.209> thought<00:03:10.209> I'd<00:03:10.360> just<00:03:10.390> take<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.140> for<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.319> spin

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
I thought I'd just take it for a spin

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.160 
I thought I'd just take it for a spin
check<00:03:12.370> out<00:03:12.489> how<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:13.090> not<00:03:13.299> how<00:03:13.599> it<00:03:13.750> really

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
check out how it's not how it really

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.580 
check out how it's not how it really
performs<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:15.159> daylight<00:03:15.879> and<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:17.049> did<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.379> far

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
performs and daylight and it did so far

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.000

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
also like go sending out of focus every

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.610 
also like go sending out of focus every
now<00:03:46.629> and<00:03:46.750> then<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.049> just<00:03:47.139> like<00:03:47.379> what<00:03:47.530> happened

now and then and just like what happened
there<00:03:47.950> it's<00:03:48.790> because<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.450> camera<00:03:49.780> has

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
there it's because this camera has

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.710 
there it's because this camera has
enough<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.440> has<00:03:50.799> well<00:03:51.159> I<00:03:51.400> think<00:03:52.359> a<00:03:52.569> lot<00:03:52.690> of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
enough I has well I think a lot of

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.470 
enough I has well I think a lot of
cameras<00:03:53.200> there's<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.560> auto<00:03:53.739> focus<00:03:54.099> function

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480

cameras there's the auto focus function
what's<00:03:55.480> amazing<00:03:55.870> though<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.500> this<00:03:56.709> camp

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
what's amazing though is that this camp

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.789 
what's amazing though is that this camp
can't<00:03:57.430> go<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.639> also<00:03:57.940> have<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.260> manual<00:03:59.260> focus

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.790 
video editor the thing is though I did
mention<00:04:40.580> its<00:04:40.820> built-in<00:04:41.180> each<00:04:41.810> plug<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
mention its built-in each plug the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.240 
mention its built-in each plug the
camera<00:04:43.840> through<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.930> USB<00:04:45.169> port<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:45.979> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
camera through a USB port on the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.090 
camera through a USB port on the
computer<00:04:46.280> and<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:48.050> program<00:04:48.380> within<00:04:48.860> the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
computer and this program within the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.610 
computer and this program within the
camera<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.669> launches<00:04:50.150> itself<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:51.380> can

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
camera it launches itself so you can

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.969 
camera it launches itself so you can
edit<00:04:51.740> your<00:04:52.100> footage<00:04:53.000> like<00:04:53.870> what<00:04:54.410> I<00:04:54.440> did<00:04:54.560> here

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
edit your footage like what I did here

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.529 
edit your footage like what I did here
um<00:04:56.710> this<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:57.889> good<00:04:58.130> because<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.880> camera<00:04:59.389> had

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
um this is good because the camera had

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.230 
um this is good because the camera had
to<00:04:59.660> be<00:04:59.750> shootin<00:05:00.250> MPEG<00:05:01.250> format<00:05:01.520> directly<00:05:02.120> in

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
to be shootin MPEG format directly in

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.840 
to be shootin MPEG format directly in
MPEG<00:05:02.539> format<00:05:02.750> which<00:05:03.139> a<00:05:03.440> lot<00:05:03.949> of<00:05:03.979> video<00:05:04.430> editors

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
MPEG format which a lot of video editors

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.300 
MPEG format which a lot of video editors
including<00:05:05.389> a<00:05:05.690> simple<00:05:06.380> ones<00:05:06.560> like<00:05:06.770> Windows

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310

else<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.900> do<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:16.310> perfect<00:05:16.610> because<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:17.389> can

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
else to do it's perfect because it can

actually<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:18.169> can<00:05:18.320> actually<00:05:18.440> edit<00:05:18.710> mp4<00:05:19.340> it's

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
actually you can actually edit mp4 it's

I<00:05:45.320> can<00:05:45.530> put<00:05:45.830> up<00:05:45.949> put<00:05:46.340> in<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.599> sepia<00:05:47.599> filter<00:05:48.400> this

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
I can put up put in a sepia filter this

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.650 
I can put up put in a sepia filter this
and<00:05:49.610> fine<00:05:49.789> tuning<00:05:50.120> i<00:05:50.240> can<00:05:50.389> increase<00:05:50.630> the

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
and fine tuning i can increase the

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.839 
and fine tuning i can increase the
brightness<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.470> all<00:05:51.560> these<00:05:51.710> things<00:05:51.849> pretty

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
brightness and all these things pretty

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.939 
brightness and all these things pretty
basic<00:05:53.120> but<00:05:53.360> it<00:05:53.570> would<00:05:54.110> work<00:05:54.260> you<00:05:54.590> know<00:05:54.710> just

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949
