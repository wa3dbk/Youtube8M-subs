 he performs limited art mahÃ³n an imprisoned vermiculture that treaty mints 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.250
 to transform organic waste from home and place through the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.539
 vermiculture 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.699
 this project began to be about three or four years 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 is let's say I learned about way and ideas d shape of dreams 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.769
 from the experience of some fellow vitalist portion 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.570
 that we made an album a couple of tests we are a little worried about the 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.090
 environmental impact of organic waste in the landfill 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.070
 sanitary 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 especially after the explosion that had the landfill 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.300
 and kind we meet other people 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.510
 Among which is my partner Emiliano Salinas road we did a course of 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.530
 vermiculture 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.980
 and at that time 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110
 percent I found out via email and villa newspaper 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.960
 This is a call for business ideas that the project is capable of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.630
 everyone 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570
 the national call 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 in putting the last day 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.389
 I delivered the form was delivered to look good tega 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.290
 do not forget the last day 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.560
 i sally selected dens and a hundred after 3 310 then among the 60 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.720
 awards 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.520
 ep so that it would be possible also have initial can leverage the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.840
 resources on which I was supported today the intimacy of follow-up to what they are 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.920
 the other two partners of the company 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.590
 and we started last year on January 20 we started 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.340
 the process already 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.340
 as seriously 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.790
 It has been a learning process 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.200
 intense 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.780
 of learning in all fields 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.110
 a game pieces that when making commented what is the business plan 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.970
 has everything solved and it is not like that 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.040
 the pieces of metal on waste treatment the letter square does not exist much 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.819
 there is the% vermiculture document from this 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.789
 Wednesday and ruminal content that we use rural content 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.179
 but we think that percent transform manure 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:26.569
 should be adopted if it is interesting what is most documented but others 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.049
 we have a strong percent environmental encouragement is not in our ours 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.369
 greater interests the environmental and obviously forest also in france 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.089
 sustainable or profitable 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.709
 and in that order of ideas it was studied they will not be afraid that the profile of the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.969
 company has as 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.840
 a pedagogical component that will impact the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.800
 to the public to change nothing is said of the source 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.380
 so that we can capture a lot of organic waste 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.079
 transform it here 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.119
 but also to mention that this organic waste goes to the landfill
