00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 and now let's fast forward to the era 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.210
 dinosaurs Tomsk scientists during 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 excavations have discovered the remains of one of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.290
 them is an adult tetrapod 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.800
 lizard who lived in the territory 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.230
 Siberia 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.179
 over a hundred million years ago find 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 the paleontologist is unique because it will be 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.420
 first described hall under from the territory 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.880
 Russia at first sight a pile of stones 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 In fact, a unique scientific discovery 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 Officer you go Stepan Ivantsov explains 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.160
 we are nothing but a rump 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.470
 ancient lizard 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.000
 individuals titanosaurs yes this is a major 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.620
 herbivorous dinosaurs walking on 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.829
 four legs with a long neck 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 long tail meaning they probably had 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.930
 some adaptation of the power top 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.730
 parts of the crown of the trees since necks 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.100
 located so vertically 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 their length could reach 30 40 meters 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 weight there are a few tens of tons of these 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 dinosaurs lived in the south 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.750
 Western Siberia approximately 100 120 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.879
 million years ago during the excavation 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.649
 scientists have established at the junction of Tomsk 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.379
 Kemerovo areas existed whole 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.320
 eco system here remains were found 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.180
 new species of mammals amphibians lizards 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.920
 it's about a graveyard 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.170
 dinosaurs and more commonly known as 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 Shestakov sky or even since the opening 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.740
 this location is the fifth year's bridge 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.259
 every year there were some 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.799
 fragments they settled quite 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.680
 locally 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.759
 but it was not possible 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.930
 stationary excavations due to the fact that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.670
 pretty steep cliff 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 so to extract from the breed 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.530
 fragments of raptor spine by scientists 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.689
 it took about seven years this one 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.900
 fragment he was about one here 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.820
 a large fragment of a very kilogram 70 then 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.619
 there is though from the camp it was well 100 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.090
 meters we had to fix it on 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.070
 rubber boats because on hand but 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.799
 could not turn about that knocked off 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.930
 large boxes filled them with sand and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.030
 the big cart was already taken to the university 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.009
 Today, the remnants of profit in Tomsk scientists 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.740
 started to assemble all the fragments 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 the skeleton is the sacrum scapula and cervical 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.030
 vertebrae in summer paleontologists 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.310
 continue excavations on the shtekam pyramid 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.320
 and they may be able to collect the whole 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.600
 the skeleton of an ancient lizard on the description 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.990
 which scientists will be oriented with 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.990
 all over the world
