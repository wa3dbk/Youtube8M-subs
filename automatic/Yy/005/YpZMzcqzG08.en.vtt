this spooky spooking me out man and this
is<00:05:28.190> from<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.819> end<00:05:29.919> not<00:05:30.919> sure<00:05:31.130> what's<00:05:31.340> going<00:05:31.610> on

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
is from the end not sure what's going on

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:32.520 
is from the end not sure what's going on
with<00:05:31.850> that

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
with that

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.200 
with that
that's<00:05:33.530> his<00:05:33.710> chest<00:05:33.949> room<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.220> course<00:05:34.400> so<00:05:35.090> yeah
