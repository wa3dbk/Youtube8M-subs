that I fix to show you is a project that

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.380 
that I fix to show you is a project that
I've<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.280> completed<00:02:22.640> we're<00:02:22.970> ready<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.240> put

I've just completed we're ready to put
some<00:02:24.230> finish<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:25.570> what<00:02:26.570> I<00:02:26.600> use<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:27.020> popular

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
some finish on and what I use is popular

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.610 
some finish on and what I use is popular
which<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.830> great<00:02:28.130> wood<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:30.110> does<00:02:30.380> have

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
which is a great wood and it does have

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.100 
which is a great wood and it does have
figure<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.760> try<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> make<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.450> that's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
figure to it but I try to make it that's

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.730 
figure to it but I try to make it that's
the<00:02:33.980> way<00:02:34.130> I've<00:02:34.280> glued<00:02:34.460> up<00:02:34.670> my<00:02:35.200> my<00:02:36.200> blanks<00:02:36.620> and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
the way I've glued up my my blanks and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.440 
the way I've glued up my my blanks and
everything<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.370> try<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.760> make<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.000> just<00:02:38.300> as

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
everything I try to make it just as

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.630 
everything I try to make it just as
smooth<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.020> transition<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:40.010> as<00:02:40.340> possible

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
poplar and it doesn't have a lot of

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.440 
poplar and it doesn't have a lot of
figure<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:04.130> tryna<00:03:04.460> you<00:03:05.210> try<00:03:05.390> to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
figure to it and you tryna you try to

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.240 
figure to it and you tryna you try to
use<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.900> grain<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.530> have<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:07.130> your

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
use the grain that you have to your

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.490 
use the grain that you have to your
advantage<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.910> try<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.510> blend<00:03:08.810> all<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.290> in

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
advantage and try to blend all this in

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.120 
advantage and try to blend all this in
together

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
together

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.270 
together
now<00:03:10.880> when<00:03:11.840> we<00:03:11.959> finish<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.560> will<00:03:12.770> take<00:03:13.040> away

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
now when we finish it it will take away

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.770 
now when we finish it it will take away
a<00:03:13.520> little<00:03:13.820> bit<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.150> detail<00:03:14.510> from<00:03:14.720> the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
a little bit of the detail from the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.360 
a little bit of the detail from the
piece<00:03:15.050> but<00:03:15.920> hopefully<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:18.370> everything

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
piece but hopefully that everything

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.820 
piece but hopefully that everything
that's<00:03:19.580> that's<00:03:20.030> there<00:03:20.270> won't<00:03:20.989> be<00:03:21.170> disturbed

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
that's that's there won't be disturbed

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
that's that's there won't be disturbed
by<00:03:22.780> by<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.840> finish<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.620> certain<00:03:25.459> finishes

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
by by the finish and certain finishes

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.110 
by by the finish and certain finishes
you<00:03:25.970> need<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.239> stay<00:03:26.420> away<00:03:26.600> from<00:03:26.660> or<00:03:27.340> ones<00:03:28.340> that

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
you need to stay away from or ones that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.000 
you need to stay away from or ones that
are<00:03:29.300> super<00:03:29.810> super<00:03:29.959> glossy<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.620> don't<00:03:30.830> want

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
are super super glossy you don't want

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.830 
are super super glossy you don't want
that<00:03:31.250> on<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.520> wood<00:03:31.760> burning<00:03:31.940> project<00:03:32.510> like<00:03:32.660> this

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
that on a wood burning project like this

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.380 
that on a wood burning project like this
one<00:03:33.400> another<00:03:34.400> thing<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:34.790> you<00:03:34.910> don't<00:03:35.090> want<00:03:35.239> any

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
one another thing is you don't want any

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.910 
one another thing is you don't want any
kind<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.630> dies<00:03:35.840> or<00:03:36.170> anything<00:03:36.380> like<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.650> in

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
kind of dies or anything like that in

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.260 
kind of dies or anything like that in
there<00:03:37.100> because<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.310> will<00:03:37.640> really<00:03:37.970> take<00:03:38.120> away

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
there because that will really take away

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.479 
there because that will really take away
from<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.630> detail<00:03:39.040> but<00:03:40.040> other<00:03:40.310> than<00:03:40.430> that

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
from the detail but other than that

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.610 
from the detail but other than that
that's<00:03:40.790> sky's<00:03:41.270> limit<00:03:41.300> you<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:41.900> use<00:03:42.020> relax<00:03:42.380> you

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
that's sky's limit you can use relax you

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.290 
that's sky's limit you can use relax you
can<00:03:42.739> use<00:03:42.890> poly<00:03:43.100> urethanes<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:43.910> use<00:03:44.060> all

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
can use poly urethanes you can use all

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.570 
can use poly urethanes you can use all
sorts<00:03:44.330> of<00:03:44.690> different<00:03:44.989> types<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:45.980> that's<00:03:46.310> just

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
sorts of different types but that's just

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.680 
sorts of different types but that's just
some<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.940> things<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.390> want<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.570> be

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
some of the things that you want to be

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.979 
some of the things that you want to be
aware<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:49.330> other<00:03:50.330> than<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.630> let's<00:03:50.870> get

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
aware of other than that let's get

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.090 
aware of other than that let's get
started<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.560> I'm<00:03:52.430> going<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.580> show<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.760> how<00:03:52.970> I

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100
