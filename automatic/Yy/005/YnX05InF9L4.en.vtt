00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.360
 the first impression he has a lot too 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.840
 to do with how we do it ourselves 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.090
 as we see ourselves 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.830
 simple example if you if you 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.600
 meet with friends or on 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.520
 meet someone they are looking forward to 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.130
 they will be much better on average 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.200
 first opinions of poor because they are from 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.500
 Club set of remote setting 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.840
 here 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.690
 curious were looking forward to the conversation 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.029
 if they have been prejudiced 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.500
 where to go that is difficult man 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.039
 Be the first impression 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.109
 probably just as well 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.850
 and sometimes we give ourselves that too 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.499
 chance for a second first impression 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.870
 maybe it's him too, that's her 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.550
 not always partners only conditionally 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.769
 Meet people they want to meet 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.839
 but sometimes for his sake 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.480
 people they meet voluntarily 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.829
 would not meet and there they can 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.620
 let's see if they meet someone 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.319
 In the beginning I liked more often 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:04.010
 that she can change that 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:05.990
 synonymous quite nice share because 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.360
 Of course and maybe they have 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.509
 as it also means people 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.829
 show not always authentic 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.909
 live in a time when we are very much 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.619
 quickly a bit of a mask 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.049
 put on 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.000
 just do not show too much in us 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.250
 by the little bit of ratio it still 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.310
 are saying come I hold only one time 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.219
 little back so not natural 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 Behave the typical situation 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.979
 application today should be today 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.049
 Every staff manager will be happy if one 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.509
 Applicant is really open 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.789
 and honest shows yes is because then can 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.970
 also the chief of staff an honest and 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.980
 good and fair decisions 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.950
 if it fits the company because of the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.330
 typical contestant sits the rhine giving 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.180
 just thinks that he is nothing 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.370
 what he should be wrong about 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.070
 We do not want to tell everything about life 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.410
 any cv gaps artificially 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.790
 can close 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.620
 You do not have to be surprised if you do 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.870
 After the trial period says that did not work 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.750
 Fit because you do not have them like that 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.340
 Just got to know how he really is 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.850
 again in general for the first 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.820
 impression 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.640
 The first impression is a quick one 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.440
 sort in a quick sorting 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:25.230
 in principle at most in this grid 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:28.770
 positive negative or neutral in the sense 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.310
 not say so at the first 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.890
 impression 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.200
 Reasonably fast reason for the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.520
 evolutionary first impression was earlier 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.560
 less between people but say 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.260
 We usually did not have that way 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.269
 so much time is left please 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.430
 stand by because I have to 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.440
 think I think but they had to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.830
 Rapidly decide friend enemy 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.570
 or unimportant and also your brain 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.110
 decides today in all first friend 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.110
 or enemy 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.130
 and that still has to be done 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.300
 evolutionarily they did not have it before 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.480
 minutes or hours of time 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.920
 we have to be aware of this 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.440
 we have to be clear 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.720
 that we end up just one 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.940
 wacky variation of our ancestors 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.820
 are they so we are we are still 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.220
 still driven one instinctively 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.820
 has been discovering for 12 years now 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.330
 I finally have to say that 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.700
 meaning of the gurus are the extreme 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.379
 large controls 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.870
 that was the was a sense of the long 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.310
 time was underestimated 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.310
 also the whole advertising industry has a lot 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.370
 much on visual on auditory so music 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.370
 to tunes or to great pictures 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.430
 today you can see many situations 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.959
 see that it smells in 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.610
 Any salesrooms have like that 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.670
 far but they have recognized how important 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.430
 this is not possible to smell this 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.989
 You can already fly first 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.269
 impression 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.549
 first impression quickly a word 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.239
 here in positively sympathetic negative 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:14.239
 unsympathetic or as I think 0 not 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.669
 say so i think worst for 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.760
 others do not say that one is one 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.870
 person with whom one converses 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.360
 but you will not meet again 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.430
 I want to and from the bank too 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.650
 no time knows nothing 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.650
 I have time I talked white
