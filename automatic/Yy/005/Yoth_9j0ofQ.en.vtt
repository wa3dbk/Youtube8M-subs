00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.070
 My name is Silvia GarcÃ­a and I am originally from 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.829
 from here of techaluta I have 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.739
 about 8 years old 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.070
 makes the jam is a recipe then 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.180
 that I'm inventing myself 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.820
 following step by step spoiling 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.160
 a lot of production from fresh to 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.040
 fruit until you achieve consistency 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.199
 what is desired and has very good 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.210
 acceptance in the public because it can 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.400
 to say that it is one of the only ways 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.269
 that can be carried by people 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.239
 mexican 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.760
 who has not tasted fruit for years 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.339
 the countrymen who come are taken to 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.900
 the families there the points of 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.820
 sale in guadalajara are in the nine 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.619
 corners and in different places where 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.229
 they go where they go to sell the 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.330
 fruit of purchasers to huca 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.850
 I have two presentations, this is the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.020
 sweet marmalade the traditional one that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.229
 accompany with the jaqueses with me 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.109
 with the most sought crepes and this is 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.630
 another creation also since the type 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.600
 pinch of tamarind but it is in version 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.789
 of pita already has salt and lemon and chili and 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.219
 It also has very good acceptance as 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.039
 candy for children both 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.740
 presentations have a life of 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:39.560
 two-year shelf because they do not have 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.750
 against conservatives and without opening the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.789
 vial has that duration does not lose the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.250
 color and even though it has no dyes 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:50.239
 artificial does not have any 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.789
 chemical is only what keeps it 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:56.270
 that is the cooking time that is a 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.340
 duration of 8 hours and then Embasa 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.729
 and you have to sterilize the bottle 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.069
 The lid of the container is left to cool and in the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.679
 only base is the secret the time of 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.390
 duration that lasts cooking and for the 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.369
 we invite you to give techaluta that the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.239
 consume and all the year we have 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.239
 existence
