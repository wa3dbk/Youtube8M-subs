00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 for determining visual acuity 

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.109
 use equipment with electrical 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.340
 bulbs for 62 and table head 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.809
 Sivtseva to determine api view 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.179
 the subject is seated on a chair on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 distance of 5 meters from the table and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.400
 offer to close a special eye 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.119
 pinch experiment at posts show 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.939
 subject to the letter and asks them called 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.740
 the definition starts with the top line and 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.140
 going down we find the lowest 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.630
 string all cuck who are subjects 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.300
 clearly sees and properly called 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.700
 for two or three we recommend 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 show slow 2 from each line 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.239
 figuratively 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 the pointer must not be on bukovina 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.219
 between the letters do not close the letter a 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.100
 be exactly under that stupid one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.770
 you research determines visual acuity 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 left eye draw your attention that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.969
 the other eye cannot be covered by hand 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.899
 you can not shut your eyes and need to close 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.899
 it is a special shield 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.899
 at 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:25.910
 us in our experience not 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.220
 correctly named the letter on this line 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.070
 so we climbed higher lying 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.260
 the line here again the subject was mistaken 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.540
 so we explore the next line and 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.290
 in this line we have to check everything 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.420
 letters for visual acuity we take that 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.390
 the line that the subject reads 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.720
 completely correct without a single mistake in 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.720
 our experience visual acuity put 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 0.4 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.770
 then examine the visual acuity of the right 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.619
 eyes for this left eye close 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.420
 special shield systems that the subjects 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.320
 error with we examine the above lying 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:11.170
 line of visual acuity of the right eye 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.170
 our cultural is 0.1 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.030
 write the result and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.030
 compare the data obtained words
