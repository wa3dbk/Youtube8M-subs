in<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.300> section<00:00:18.679> I'm<00:00:19.679> going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.980> show<00:00:20.130> you

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
in this section I'm going to show you

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.490 
in this section I'm going to show you
the<00:00:20.400> way<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.939> look<00:00:21.869> at<00:00:22.019> the<00:00:22.169> neck<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.710> sort<00:00:23.669> of<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
the way I look at the neck and sort of a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.349 
the way I look at the neck and sort of a
mapping<00:00:25.500> system<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.369> lets<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.880> navigate

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
mapping system that lets you navigate

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.799 
mapping system that lets you navigate
through<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.680> actual<00:00:29.399> notes<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.059> the<00:00:30.210> key<00:00:30.480> that

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
through the actual notes of the key that

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.670 
through the actual notes of the key that
you're<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.230> while<00:00:31.949> soloing<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:33.379> look<00:00:34.379> at<00:00:34.530> this

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
you're in while soloing I look at this

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.780 
you're in while soloing I look at this
as<00:00:35.030> basic<00:00:36.030> scale<00:00:36.390> shapes<00:00:36.980> in<00:00:37.980> my<00:00:38.100> opinion<00:00:38.550> what

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
as basic scale shapes in my opinion what

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.990 
as basic scale shapes in my opinion what
is<00:00:39.230> very<00:00:40.230> helpful<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.949> important<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.699> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
is very helpful and important is to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.149 
is very helpful and important is to
learn<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.489> natural<00:00:44.489> minor<00:00:44.879> major<00:00:45.479> scale<00:00:46.010> in<00:00:47.010> a

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:47.159 
learn the natural minor major scale in a

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.630 
learn the natural minor major scale in a
fashion<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.699> three<00:00:48.030> notes<00:00:48.239> per<00:00:48.480> string<00:00:49.640> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
fashion of three notes per string that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.020 
fashion of three notes per string that
will<00:00:50.820> involve<00:00:51.239> covering<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> whole<00:00:52.559> neck

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
will involve covering the whole neck

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.349 
will involve covering the whole neck
starting<00:00:54.030> from<00:00:54.210> each<00:00:54.500> note<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> scale

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
starting from each note of the scale

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.229 
starting from each note of the scale
from<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.510> lowest<00:00:57.929> note<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> neck<00:00:59.239> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
from the lowest note of the neck the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
from the lowest note of the neck the
first<00:01:00.510> fret<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> last<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.789> there<00:01:02.789> are

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
first fret to the last one there are

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.249 
first fret to the last one there are
many<00:01:02.940> ways<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.510> looking<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> fretboard

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
many ways of looking at the fretboard

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.400 
many ways of looking at the fretboard
but<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.550> me<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:07.250> three<00:01:08.250> note<00:01:08.460> per<00:01:08.490> string

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
but for me this three note per string

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.760 
but for me this three note per string
system<00:01:10.410> of<00:01:10.670> creating<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.869> map<00:01:12.869> network<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
system of creating like a map network of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.630 
system of creating like a map network of
notes<00:01:14.130> within<00:01:14.810> natural<00:01:15.810> minor<00:01:16.110> scale<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.190> very

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
notes within natural minor scale is very

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.600 
notes within natural minor scale is very
essential<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:19.289> later<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.160> the<00:01:20.280> next

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
essential for going later to the next

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.699 
essential for going later to the next
level<00:01:20.970> which<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.509> creating<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.080> sequences

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
level which is creating the sequences

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:26.150 
level which is creating the sequences
and<00:01:23.039> phrases<00:01:24.590> apart<00:01:25.590> from<00:01:25.739> helping<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
and phrases apart from helping you

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.639 
and phrases apart from helping you
navigate<00:01:26.340> through<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.910> tonality<00:01:27.569> during<00:01:28.500> an

improvisation or taking a solo these are

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.889 
improvisation or taking a solo these are
also<00:01:31.649> great<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.399> practicing<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.630> building

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
also great for practicing and building

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.170 
also great for practicing and building
up<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.050> technique<00:01:34.679> and<00:01:34.860> chops

I<00:01:43.320> will<00:01:44.320> be<00:01:44.440> demonstrating<00:01:45.010> these<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:45.370> case<00:01:45.580> of

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
I will be demonstrating these in case of

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.260 
I will be demonstrating these in case of
a<00:01:46.090> minor<00:01:46.390> C<00:01:47.080> major<00:01:47.230> but<00:01:48.160> strongly<00:01:48.910> advise<00:01:49.240> you

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
a minor C major but strongly advise you

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.080 
a minor C major but strongly advise you
to<00:01:49.570> take<00:01:50.560> them<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.040> other<00:01:51.190> technologies

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
to take them to the other technologies

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.140 
to take them to the other technologies
as<00:01:52.240> well<00:01:53.070> since<00:01:54.070> we<00:01:54.160> need<00:01:54.370> minor<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.970> root

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
as well since we need minor the root

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.400 
as well since we need minor the root
note<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:57.520> taking<00:01:58.420> this<00:01:58.570> three<00:01:58.900> note<00:01:59.110> per

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
note is a but taking this three note per

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.430 
note is a but taking this three note per
string<00:02:00.570> pattern<00:02:01.570> will<00:02:01.869> start<00:02:02.140> from<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
string pattern will start from the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.280 
string pattern will start from the
lowest<00:02:02.910> note<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.150> can<00:02:04.300> fret<00:02:04.540> which<00:02:04.750> is<00:02:04.930> an

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
lowest note that we can fret which is an

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:18.030 
lowest note that we can fret which is an
F

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.149 

I<00:03:32.659> will<00:03:33.659> not<00:03:33.780> go<00:03:33.959> into<00:03:34.140> details<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.890> how<00:03:35.099> you

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
I will not go into details of how you

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.820 
I will not go into details of how you
built<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.940> minor<00:03:36.390> major<00:03:36.750> scale<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.349> this<00:03:37.470> video

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
built a minor major scale in this video

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.020 
built a minor major scale in this video
and<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.489> find<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.849> information

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
and you can find that information

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.860 
and you can find that information
elsewhere<00:03:39.950> easily<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:42.120> next<00:03:42.390> thing<00:03:42.599> would<00:03:42.810> be

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
elsewhere easily the next thing would be

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.070 
elsewhere easily the next thing would be
the<00:03:43.560> descending<00:03:44.159> version<00:03:44.580> of<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:45.209> scale

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
the descending version of this scale

00:03:46.080 --> 00:04:13.270 
the descending version of this scale
pattern

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.580 

once<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.550> mastered<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.240> basic<00:04:16.049> map

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
once you have mastered this basic map

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
once you have mastered this basic map
you<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.549> actually<00:04:17.930> combine<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:20.220> patterns<00:04:20.669> by

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
you can actually combine the patterns by

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.590 
you can actually combine the patterns by
playing<00:04:21.329> one<00:04:21.660> ascending<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.800> then<00:04:23.610> entering

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
playing one ascending and then entering

00:04:24.600 --> 00:05:17.629 
playing one ascending and then entering
into<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.960> next<00:04:25.290> one<00:04:25.440> in<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.800> descending<00:04:26.190> manner

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.830 

that<00:05:18.639> would<00:05:18.759> be<00:05:18.849> a<00:05:18.879> good<00:05:19.060> moment<00:05:19.240> to<00:05:19.569> take<00:05:19.810> a

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
that would be a good moment to take a

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.770 
that would be a good moment to take a
look<00:05:20.110> at<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.470> string<00:05:20.889> muting<00:05:21.400> in<00:05:22.270> order<00:05:22.659> to

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
look at the string muting in order to

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.460 
look at the string muting in order to
execute<00:05:23.080> these<00:05:23.470> techniques<00:05:23.949> in<00:05:24.099> a<00:05:24.159> proper<00:05:24.460> way

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
execute these techniques in a proper way

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.260 
execute these techniques in a proper way
when<00:05:26.470> we<00:05:26.590> play<00:05:26.800> a<00:05:26.830> phrase<00:05:27.129> like<00:05:27.400> this<00:05:27.610> we<00:05:28.060> don't

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
when we play a phrase like this we don't

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.189 
when we play a phrase like this we don't
want<00:05:28.479> any<00:05:29.099> extraneous<00:05:30.099> string<00:05:30.669> noise<00:05:31.199> ringing

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
want any extraneous string noise ringing

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.189 
want any extraneous string noise ringing
or<00:05:32.729> whatever<00:05:33.729> else<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.240> is<00:05:34.479> not<00:05:34.690> the<00:05:34.960> actual

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
or whatever else that is not the actual

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.680 
or whatever else that is not the actual
noise<00:05:35.409> that's<00:05:35.620> going<00:05:35.680> to<00:05:35.830> plank<00:05:36.479> the<00:05:37.479> way<00:05:37.629> to

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
noise that's going to plank the way to

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.010 
noise that's going to plank the way to
stop<00:05:38.050> this<00:05:38.289> is<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.530> mute<00:05:38.919> these<00:05:39.190> strings<00:05:40.020> so

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
stop this is to mute these strings so

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.160 
stop this is to mute these strings so
when<00:05:41.259> I'm<00:05:41.379> playing<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:42.099> the<00:05:42.780> sixth<00:05:43.780> string

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.540 

the<00:05:47.380> index<00:05:47.830> is<00:05:48.010> muting<00:05:49.110> he's<00:05:50.110> here<00:05:50.530> when<00:05:51.370> I<00:05:51.400> go

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
the index is muting he's here when I go

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.120 
the index is muting he's here when I go
to<00:05:51.610> the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
to the

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.840 
to the
index<00:05:53.910> is<00:05:54.090> muting<00:05:54.420> the<00:05:54.600> fourth<00:05:55.190> third<00:05:56.190> second

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
index is muting the fourth third second

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.240 
index is muting the fourth third second
in<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.000> first<00:05:57.270> but<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.930> palm<00:05:58.290> is<00:05:58.620> muting<00:05:59.220> the

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
in the first but the palm is muting the

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.120 
in the first but the palm is muting the
sixth<00:05:59.880> string

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.070 

so<00:06:03.760> when<00:06:03.910> I<00:06:03.940> go<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.360> next<00:06:04.630> string<00:06:05.020> the

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
so when I go to the next string the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.560 
so when I go to the next string the
fourth<00:06:05.500> one<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:06.280> problem<00:06:06.670> is<00:06:06.790> muting<00:06:07.540> the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
fourth one the problem is muting the

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.190 
fourth one the problem is muting the
fifth<00:06:07.930> string<00:06:08.290> and<00:06:08.820> then<00:06:09.820> while<00:06:10.390> the<00:06:10.660> index<00:06:10.960> is

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
fifth string and then while the index is

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.160 
fifth string and then while the index is
reducing<00:06:11.710> its<00:06:11.860> role<00:06:12.280> to<00:06:12.910> muting<00:06:13.270> the<00:06:13.840> fourth

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
reducing its role to muting the fourth

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.130 
reducing its role to muting the fourth
third<00:06:14.650> and<00:06:14.920> a<00:06:15.310> second<00:06:15.760> and<00:06:16.000> then<00:06:16.750> when<00:06:16.900> we<00:06:17.020> get

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
third and a second and then when we get

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.270 
third and a second and then when we get
to<00:06:17.350> the<00:06:17.530> fourth<00:06:18.250> string<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:20.620> palm<00:06:20.860> will<00:06:21.130> be

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
to the fourth string the palm will be

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.120 
to the fourth string the palm will be
muting<00:06:21.930> sixth<00:06:22.930> fifth<00:06:23.200> and<00:06:23.470> the<00:06:23.530> fourth<00:06:23.860> string

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.190 

so<00:06:30.130> when<00:06:30.310> we<00:06:30.430> get<00:06:30.580> all<00:06:30.850> the<00:06:31.180> way<00:06:31.330> up<00:06:31.630> to<00:06:32.080> the

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200 
so when we get all the way up to the

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.600 
so when we get all the way up to the
first<00:06:32.410> in<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.740> second<00:06:33.100> string<00:06:35.280> our<00:06:36.280> right

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
first in the second string our right

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.420 
first in the second string our right
hand<00:06:36.910> will<00:06:37.390> practically<00:06:38.140> mute<00:06:38.440> all<00:06:38.830> the

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
hand will practically mute all the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.200 
hand will practically mute all the
strings<00:06:39.760> except<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.390> first<00:06:40.570> one<00:06:41.970> so<00:06:42.970> once

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
strings except the first one so once

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.870 
strings except the first one so once
when<00:06:43.540> you<00:06:43.690> learn<00:06:43.930> these<00:06:44.140> basic<00:06:44.200> shapes<00:06:44.880> you

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
when you learn these basic shapes you

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.900 
when you learn these basic shapes you
will<00:06:46.170> essentially<00:06:47.170> know<00:06:47.500> the<00:06:47.980> position<00:06:48.790> of

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
will essentially know the position of

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.500 
will essentially know the position of
every<00:06:49.060> note<00:06:49.330> of<00:06:49.630> a<00:06:50.020> minor<00:06:50.470> C<00:06:51.430> major<00:06:51.610> scale<00:06:52.180> on

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
every note of a minor C major scale on

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.620 
every note of a minor C major scale on
the<00:06:52.840> neck<00:06:53.430> this<00:06:54.430> is<00:06:54.490> a<00:06:54.640> great<00:06:54.880> starting<00:06:55.300> point

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
the neck this is a great starting point

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.250 
the neck this is a great starting point
to<00:06:55.750> move<00:06:55.990> on<00:06:56.170> and<00:06:56.850> see<00:06:57.850> what<00:06:58.180> else<00:06:58.390> we<00:06:58.960> can<00:06:58.990> now

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
to move on and see what else we can now

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.920 
to move on and see what else we can now
do<00:06:59.320> with<00:06:59.590> it<00:07:00.060> as<00:07:01.060> I<00:07:01.210> will<00:07:01.330> be<00:07:01.450> showing<00:07:01.660> you<00:07:01.780> a

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
do with it as I will be showing you a

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.400 
do with it as I will be showing you a
wide<00:07:02.320> variety<00:07:02.950> of<00:07:02.980> sequences<00:07:03.820> the<00:07:04.540> main<00:07:04.990> idea

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
wide variety of sequences the main idea

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.470 
wide variety of sequences the main idea
is<00:07:05.470> not<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:05.920> work<00:07:06.190> on<00:07:06.400> all<00:07:06.730> of<00:07:06.880> them<00:07:07.060> at<00:07:07.210> once

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.480 
is not to work on all of them at once

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.110 
is not to work on all of them at once
but<00:07:07.960> work<00:07:08.230> on<00:07:08.470> the<00:07:08.620> most<00:07:08.890> basic<00:07:09.310> ones<00:07:09.550> and<00:07:09.940> when

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
but work on the most basic ones and when

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.660 
but work on the most basic ones and when
you<00:07:10.210> get<00:07:10.390> them<00:07:10.690> down<00:07:11.230> in<00:07:11.950> a<00:07:12.070> proper<00:07:12.460> manner

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
you get them down in a proper manner

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.970 
you get them down in a proper manner
just<00:07:13.000> then<00:07:13.390> move<00:07:13.630> on<00:07:13.810> to<00:07:13.930> the<00:07:14.020> other<00:07:14.260> one<00:07:14.470> until

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
just then move on to the other one until

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.440 
just then move on to the other one until
you<00:07:15.070> feel<00:07:15.220> comfortable<00:07:15.490> for<00:07:16.030> getting<00:07:16.270> to<00:07:16.360> the

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
you feel comfortable for getting to the

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.980 
you feel comfortable for getting to the
other<00:07:16.600> one<00:07:16.840> etcetera<00:07:17.170> etc<00:07:18.420> most<00:07:19.420> importantly

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
other one etcetera etc most importantly

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.740 
other one etcetera etc most importantly
remember<00:07:20.460> not<00:07:21.460> to<00:07:21.580> try<00:07:21.760> to<00:07:21.820> play<00:07:22.090> fast<00:07:22.420> right

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
remember not to try to play fast right

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.520 
remember not to try to play fast right
away<00:07:23.020> go<00:07:23.830> through<00:07:24.100> these<00:07:24.900> sequences<00:07:25.900> very

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530 
away go through these sequences very

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.860 
away go through these sequences very
slowly<00:07:26.950> make<00:07:27.400> sure<00:07:27.670> that<00:07:27.910> the<00:07:28.120> right<00:07:28.300> hand<00:07:28.570> and

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:28.870 
slowly make sure that the right hand and

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.280 
slowly make sure that the right hand and
the<00:07:29.140> left<00:07:29.620> hand<00:07:29.800> are<00:07:30.570> coordinated<00:07:31.570> that<00:07:31.780> lets

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.290 
the left hand are coordinated that lets

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.380 
the left hand are coordinated that lets
you<00:07:32.410> have<00:07:32.560> all<00:07:32.860> the<00:07:33.010> details<00:07:33.130> worked<00:07:33.550> out<00:07:33.970> and

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.390 
you have all the details worked out and

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.440 
you have all the details worked out and
then<00:07:34.660> gradually<00:07:35.530> build<00:07:36.040> up<00:07:36.190> speed<00:07:36.550> you<00:07:37.270> can

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:37.450 
then gradually build up speed you can

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.730 
then gradually build up speed you can
use<00:07:37.570> the<00:07:37.660> metronome<00:07:37.960> which<00:07:38.320> is<00:07:38.410> a<00:07:38.440> very<00:07:38.680> good

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:38.740 
use the metronome which is a very good

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.510 
use the metronome which is a very good
idea<00:07:39.130> and<00:07:40.080> just<00:07:41.080> work<00:07:41.680> at<00:07:41.860> it<00:07:41.950> until<00:07:42.100> you<00:07:42.280> feel

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 
idea and just work at it until you feel

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.540 
idea and just work at it until you feel
comfortable<00:07:42.840> never<00:07:44.070> practice<00:07:45.070> while<00:07:45.400> you

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
comfortable never practice while you

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.070 
comfortable never practice while you
know<00:07:45.610> if<00:07:45.880> your<00:07:46.090> hands<00:07:46.360> are<00:07:46.450> hurting<00:07:46.810> and<00:07:46.930> if

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 
know if your hands are hurting and if
