00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello love my head and heartily 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.100
 welcome now but tron tutorial from 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.899
 to set up at 10.07 today and 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.030
 create a minecraft room service 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.830
 That's easy after we get together 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.300
 These minecraft riems have bought like 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.469
 that is the experience in a tutorial 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.940
 which I command you now once 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.039
 linked because that is a prerequisite 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.140
 so we minecraft riems menu on here 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.210
 the latest version 1.7 point 9 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.830
 also the option click to create olian 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.420
 must have on this now namely 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.250
 Just click on it and come 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.289
 we have another menu where we have a name 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.880
 need to set for this environment 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.439
 I'll just have a life with it 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.140
 1 0 7 and we have the opportunity 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.000
 also to select a template that is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.739
 but not necessary then 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 we get so pre-set worlds 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 but we do not need that right now 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.660
 we just do not choose a tablet and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.219
 click on create now we see 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.780
 even in the menu we have avoided 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.820
 that only seven directly below including one 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.379
 player named hugo 30 10 and we see 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.149
 a green dot that means that the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.860
 server is online and we can now 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.850
 Practical simply we suggest clicking 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 namely on play 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.730
 However, we have to do it again 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 the maincor dreams terms of service 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.109
 So that means we accept that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.579
 legally agree with that we 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.409
 now want to play my costume and stuff 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 continue and so on so we click 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.520
 rubber and already connect now to the first 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 on the server and are here directly 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.880
 vacated and in the world and everything is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.650
 fully functional 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.119
 but so all alone on the server too 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.619
 that's not enough for us 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 and that's why we need the server now 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.950
 We also do that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 in minecraft riems menu under the button 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.710
 we will click this once 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.680
 then we have different ones 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.790
 possibilities for example edit settings 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 We can go in there then 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.759
 we change the name again the bs 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.380
 have set and we can have one 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.240
 small description or as is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.189
 known by other servers is a mtb 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 define a test server is called the in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.320
 this case with me 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.520
 we can handle the difficulty level 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 I'll set it up 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.880
 peaceful and we can meet the standard 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.799
 set game mode is so the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.299
 play mode when a new player joint 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.890
 which one he gets then and that it is in 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.479
 In this case mark regev we click on 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.490
 then we confirm these changes 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 For example, we can go up now 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.060
 Subscription click here we get 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.920
 all information about our subscription 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 the minecraft frames and see how many 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.520
 days are still left to us and when 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.090
 we started the whole was by 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.229
 the seventh fifth of 2014 by 17 50 and so on 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.159
 On and on we can do the whole thing 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.590
 expand year 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.879
 But more about that in minecraft 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.649
 tutorial which I here again 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.480
 link but we click again 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.790
 on Beck and also backups for here 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.530
 to have 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.599
 the possibility and the download latest 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.930
 and a backup of the world down to 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.310
 load 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.689
 but that is too short after the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.340
 do not create yet and later you have 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.709
 Here's a little back up menu where you 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.989
 then just a backup from 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.459
 you can download server now 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.989
 We definitely have to get it now 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.189
 invite the players alone 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.930
 play that is really no fun 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.299
 and that's why we click on the plus 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.799
 and those under this list and give 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.239
 There simply took a minecraft 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.250
 I was on the example of 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.510
 gisborne disbon 1 I just upload 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.819
 take a plaster here one 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.549
 click on invite and he is here 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.049
 in the whitelist once the invitation 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.970
 from the owner of the minecraft environment 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.260
 was sent out at the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.120
 receiver on the top right a small one 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.859
 message from because of there are new ones 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.569
 invitations you can then completely 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.549
 Just confirm by clicking on this 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.099
 message is then also must 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.720
 here as always the minecraft teams 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.970
 of which accepts a compromise 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.739
 and you are connected and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.269
 the invited one can easily hang up 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.340
 the server down and you can go together 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.900
 let's play here we can recognize it 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.159
 we have the rough configuration 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.389
 practically already finished we have 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.200
 but also more 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.329
 possibilities 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.489
 so we can in this window where we 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.169
 invite the players also say if we 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.519
 someone open for you want to click 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:23.440
 just on the sign where so far 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.329
 normal user is then that becomes one 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.919
 operator changed or we can do that 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.359
 gisborne 1 also very easy again 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.709
 a click on the ixs from the server 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.669
 exclude and practically from the 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.680
 throw whitelist 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.840
 that too is quite simply possible 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.790
 was practically the setup and we can 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.290
 Here are up to 20 players in this list 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.639
 deposits ten players can 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.629
 at the same server that can be 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.340
 not change yet 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.569
 but I have the assumption that mojang 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.590
 the later still different options 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.840
 will offer 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.940
 in another tutorial show you 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.169
 how to host mini games on the server 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.970
 could also be possible 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.470
 more about that then but in the video what I 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.579
 Link you now and then 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.959
 I also thank you for that 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.150
