and a little sigh nuclear survival 0

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.380 
and a little sigh nuclear survival 0
if<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.650> change<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.280> survival<00:02:08.789> by<00:02:09.030> going

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
if not change it to survival by going

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
if not change it to survival by going
Luger<00:02:10.170> load<00:02:10.770> survival<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.310> should<00:02:14.490> be

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
Luger load survival and so it should be

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.350 
Luger load survival and so it should be
pretty<00:02:14.610> easy<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.630> year<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.880> already<00:02:17.880> binded

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360
