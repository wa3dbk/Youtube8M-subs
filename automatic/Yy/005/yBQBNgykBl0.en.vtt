to<00:01:34.619> go<00:01:34.770> longer<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> time<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to go longer but you know the time that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.179 
to go longer but you know the time that
Fletcher<00:01:37.020> picked<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> don't<00:01:37.920> think

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
Fletcher picked there I don't think

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.560 
Fletcher picked there I don't think
necessarily<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:39.150> news<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
necessarily was the good news is the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.810 
necessarily was the good news is the
transition<00:01:40.049> defense<00:01:40.170> behind<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.400> good<00:01:41.610> in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
transition defense behind it was good in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.039 
transition defense behind it was good in
that<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.030> didn't<00:01:42.420> clear<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.659> ball<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
that they didn't clear the ball that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.539 
that they didn't clear the ball that
well<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.590> they<00:01:43.619> stepped<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> midfield

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
well and they stepped up in the midfield

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.060 
well and they stepped up in the midfield
to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.030> back<00:01:45.180> pretty<00:01:45.360> quickly<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to get it back pretty quickly so I just

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499 
to get it back pretty quickly so I just
I<00:01:47.250> wouldn't<00:01:47.460> want<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.909> them<00:01:48.060> kind<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.329> go
