00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
typing and I say you pick a tempo like

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.339 
typing and I say you pick a tempo like
on<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:22.830> two<00:00:23.490> three<00:00:24.269> four<00:00:27.019> we<00:00:28.019> could<00:00:28.140> tell<00:00:28.320> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
on one two three four we could tell that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.529 
on one two three four we could tell that
the<00:00:28.650> delays<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.490> delay<00:00:29.880> comes<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.359> every

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the delays the delay comes on every

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.120 
the delays the delay comes on every
single<00:00:30.900> time<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.230> strike<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> string

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
single time you strike the string

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.220 
single time you strike the string
instead<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.000> tapping<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.480> downbeat<00:00:33.989> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
instead of tapping on the downbeat of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.260 
instead of tapping on the downbeat of
the<00:00:34.440> groove<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.489> would<00:00:35.640> normally<00:00:35.790> would

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the groove as you would normally would

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.540 
the groove as you would normally would
with<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.780> normal<00:00:37.320> tap<00:00:37.530> tempo<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:37.980> pedal

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
with a normal tap tempo of an pedal

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.810 
with a normal tap tempo of an pedal
you're<00:00:39.149> gonna<00:00:39.329> tap<00:00:39.809> instead<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.680> how<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> want

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you're gonna tap instead on how you want

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
you're gonna tap instead on how you want
the<00:00:41.940> delay<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> sound<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.410> other

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the delay to sound like so in other

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
the delay to sound like so in other
words<00:00:43.770> you're<00:00:43.890> gonna<00:00:43.950> tap<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> feel<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
words you're gonna tap in the feel of

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.319 
words you're gonna tap in the feel of
the<00:00:45.719> delay<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> mean<00:00:47.430> by<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.610> well

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the delay and what I mean by that well

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.529 
the delay and what I mean by that well
if<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.110> let's<00:00:49.860> say<00:00:50.039> play<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.610> temple

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
if you're to let's say play a temple

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.049 
if you're to let's say play a temple
like<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.219> thought<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.610> sound<00:00:53.969> like

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
like this I thought it will sound like

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:54.350 
like this I thought it will sound like
this

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
this

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.729 
this
two<00:00:54.780> three<00:00:55.559> four<00:00:56.340> tap<00:00:57.120> tap<00:00:57.660> tap<00:00:57.930> step<00:00:59.000> tap<00:01:00.000> step

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
two three four tap tap tap step tap step

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.479 
two three four tap tap tap step tap step
okay<00:01:01.940> okay<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:05.129> take<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
okay okay so what if you do take the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.390 
okay okay so what if you do take the
same<00:01:05.729> tempo<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.360> tap<00:01:07.229> instead<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.070> feel<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
same tempo and tap instead the feel of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:28.679 
same tempo and tap instead the feel of
it<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.000> I'm<00:01:09.090> gonna<00:01:09.650> go<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.010> tap<00:01:11.760> tap<00:01:12.360> tap

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.719 

so<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:30.049> is<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.320> way<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:30.500> audio<00:01:30.920> tap<00:01:31.189> data<00:01:31.579> it

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
so this is the way you audio tap data it

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.340 
so this is the way you audio tap data it
delays<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.149> don't<00:01:32.359> tap<00:01:32.600> on<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.929> downbeat<00:01:33.320> of

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
delays you don't tap on the downbeat of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.469 
delays you don't tap on the downbeat of
groove<00:01:33.649> you<00:01:34.009> tap<00:01:34.280> instead<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.939> dotted<00:01:35.299> eighth

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
groove you tap instead the dotted eighth

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.809 
groove you tap instead the dotted eighth
feel<00:01:35.929> into<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.710> pedal<00:01:36.829> so<00:01:37.429> let's<00:01:37.640> pick<00:01:37.729> a

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
feel into the pedal so let's pick a

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.669 
feel into the pedal so let's pick a
faster<00:01:38.149> tempo<00:01:38.299> let's<00:01:38.659> say<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.109> the<00:01:39.409> streets

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
faster tempo let's say for the streets

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.440 
faster tempo let's say for the streets
have<00:01:39.829> no<00:01:39.859> name<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.670> dotted<00:01:43.939> eighth<00:01:44.119> sound

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
have no name so the dotted eighth sound

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.850 
have no name so the dotted eighth sound
you<00:01:44.569> want<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:44.780> get<00:01:44.899> this<00:01:46.990> done<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.469> let's<00:01:48.709> try

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
you want to get this done so let's try

00:01:48.860 --> 00:02:15.470 
you want to get this done so let's try
to<00:01:48.890> tap<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.159> into<00:01:49.459> just<00:01:49.670> less<00:01:50.479> rapidly

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
