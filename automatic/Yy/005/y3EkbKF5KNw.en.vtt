00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.550
 and what happens churumbeles here if he steals the 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.650
 speaks and good today is at night and you see 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.550
 I bring you a video just out of the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.220
 oven because the news has come out that 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.410
 a long time ago there was a lot of talk 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.079
 people in the community of say play in 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.449
 I wanted a one-to-one map or 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:30.179
 two versus two then 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:33.550
 there were many spoilers of map types 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.060
 similar to what could be worth and the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.430
 map in particular was called 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.120
 magnet camber in Spanish camera 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.970
 magmatic agreement and nothing taking advantage 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 that will see the tournament this in china in 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.200
 shanghai so good apart from what it is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.150
 the tournament of 5 versus 5 for it 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.130
 we will be able to see the best players 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.550
 of the world playing on this map of 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.920
 agreement 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.600
 and good in principle the video will see 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.090
 three spoilers of what could be or was 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.130
 I foresaw that it could be the map and then 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.810
 I will put images of what really 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.659
 It's worth as a map, I can tell you 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:21.560
 I like it very good 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.749
 and pretty well done what happens that 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.719
 there are things that would polish badly in my 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:29.000
 way to see it but good 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.640
 it's okay to do this because there's 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.030
 people who sometimes want to measure the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.759
 ability and will say something else with others 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.159
 with other people of that better than you 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.829
 you are not better than me 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.719
 typical not so now with this map it 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.209
 will be able to do and I would love it 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.399
 besides that, it could have been done 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.099
 rankeadas of this type of rne that only 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.709
 start two because sometimes you want 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.360
 play alone for a friend or summer things 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.280
 because now he's very limited to teams 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.950
 of three or five and what really 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.979
 it's just right look at the world is more 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.479
 of five because the three is a bit 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.700
 they are a little off, not that aspect 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.049
 they are not so valued and good and 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.940
 going back to what is the camera 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.940
 magmatic there are magmatics 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.530
 well that what it says rivers 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.730
 basically more than basically says that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.599
 in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.239
 probably going to leave before the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.459
 six are four at the latest in the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.440
 season 4 this is not even available from 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.599
 pp or anything like that we will be able to see 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.580
 this weekend in the tournament 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.310
 shanghai and playing the best 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.260
 players of the world 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.450
 we will not be able to do 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.189
 so things have gotten ahead of how 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.290
 you will be able to win games in this 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:50.200
 map for example one of the ways to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.340
 winning is going to be killing 100 subjects 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.110
 I think that I do not like this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.689
 way to see it because there are characters that 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.810
 very fast carmen or minions and others not 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.849
 worth which I think is not 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.620
 eliminating would have to be a universe 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.010
 is one or two against two to kill the 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 Nexus at the point level 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.079
 another way to win would be to destroy the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.970
 enemy turret that comes to be this and 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.569
 another way to win is to get the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.140
 feads blood 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.439
 this would totally remove it because not 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.930
 it's funny that detracts from grace 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:28.370
 the basic grace of the game of mel and 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.069
 goblins and good 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.629
 you see also says rivers to people the 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.180
 community asks when is it going to 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.390
 to play this game on this map 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.450
 and good is answered that you have to do 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.209
 many things technologically for 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.329
 adapt this map well so that 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:53.030
 imagine the number of servers that 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.319
 there is to endure multi-tasking 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.780
 games that are on all servers 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.129
 so much European Americans now when 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.099
 the Latin American opens up 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.579
 imagine and on top you have to endure 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.769
 I do not know how many thousands of games of 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.069
 you are one against one eternal 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:14.189
 all that they have to optimize and everything 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.510
 that's also true that if they did this 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.239
 type of map they would have to make a 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.190
 exclusive balance for this map 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.289
 because there are characters that in one against 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.509
 one are much stronger than others 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.509
 they said and I already said in a video 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.060
 warning of this that river day was going to 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.669
 do some types of adjustments in 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.000
 some characters in dominion by 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.669
 example because they are very strong against 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.979
 others or in 3 versus 3 for the same 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.780
 they would have to do on it in this kind of 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.480
 maps is worth why 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.460
 otherwise it would not be viable but good 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.500
 news is simply this ok I hope 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.330
 that the images you like 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.950
 you can follow us there is a video out there 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.290
 on YouTube but I can not put it because 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.940
 I do not have rights, so I do not know what 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.610
 I can put and I tell you it's not in the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.950
 pc but you know that when any 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.010
 day they put it on tv what will you have 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.169
 right away and we'll try it and nothing 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.510
 it was simply this tell you this 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.090
 news that really is very very 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.070
 interesting to me and I suppose for all 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.860
 the community I hope you liked it 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.639
 the video give like a favorite 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.300
 subscribe 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.310
 and well I know that speaks a lot in this 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.159
 video is a tostÃ³n continues to listen but 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.409
 I think there was a need to see this 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.090
 news and know the agreed then nothing 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.210
 see you in the next video up 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.210
 then
