00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
debris which is a little bit easier to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.120 
debris which is a little bit easier to
see<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.049> a<00:02:36.079> this<00:02:36.680> pretty<00:02:37.010> much

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
see but this is a this pretty much

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.850 
see but this is a this pretty much
wrapped<00:02:37.340> up<00:02:37.489> pretty<00:02:37.820> pretty<00:02:38.390> tight<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.590> so

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
wrapped up pretty pretty tight and so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.840
