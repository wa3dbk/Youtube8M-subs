00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
so it can help you get it on but I was

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.720 
so it can help you get it on but I was
kind<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.680> looking<00:02:17.769> in<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.069> store<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.519> what

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
kind of looking in the store like what

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.149 
kind of looking in the store like what
is<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.209> but<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.840> think<00:02:20.019> it's<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.379> so<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.010> can

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
is that but I think it's like so you can

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.339 
is that but I think it's like so you can
pull<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:21.640> on<00:02:21.730> your<00:02:21.760> foot<00:02:22.090> easier<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.200> can

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
pull it on your foot easier and you can

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.190 
pull it on your foot easier and you can
have<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.709> back<00:02:24.120> heel<00:02:25.120> tab<00:02:25.359> too<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.840> can<00:02:25.989> just
