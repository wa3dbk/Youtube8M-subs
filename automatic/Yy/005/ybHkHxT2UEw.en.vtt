olden style jordans went across the shoe
and<00:03:17.770> then<00:03:17.860> down<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.340> way<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.180> half<00:03:19.570> of<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:19.840> was

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
and then down this way so half of it was

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.950 
and then down this way so half of it was
red<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.800> happens<00:03:21.250> white<00:03:21.660> instead<00:03:22.660> they<00:03:22.780> did

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
red it happens white instead they did

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.170 
red it happens white instead they did
read<00:03:23.320> ending<00:03:24.160> over<00:03:24.370> here<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.730> read<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> little

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
read ending over here and read a little

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.090 
read ending over here and read a little
bit<00:03:25.360> over<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.660> front<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.320> then<00:03:26.620> more<00:03:26.800> white
