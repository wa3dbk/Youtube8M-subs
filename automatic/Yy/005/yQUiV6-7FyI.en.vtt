00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
region and that you get a really strong

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.860

drawing<00:03:51.110> a<00:03:51.320> long<00:03:51.470> though<00:03:51.739> when<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.160> do<00:03:52.280> that

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
drawing a long though when you do that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.490 
drawing a long though when you do that
in<00:03:52.820> Melbourne<00:03:53.330> but<00:03:53.540> we<00:03:53.690> did<00:03:53.900> want<00:03:53.930> our

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
restaurant to be a version of that the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.720 
restaurant to be a version of that the
wines<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:57.050> we<00:03:57.170> chose<00:03:57.410> were<00:03:58.010> those<00:03:58.160> European

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
wines that we chose were those European
