00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.250
 you find a tutorial that was made 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.520
 important to upload to the channel since I 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.349
 change windows 8 to test or repair 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.710
 better seen state errors 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.220
 during games applications 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.390
 programs oils etc. this is the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.989
 first video about this system 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.290
 operative what I come to demonstrate now 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.920
 is how it works how to fix errors 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.379
 of the games since well then to me 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.580
 this car jumped on the screen 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.400
 error 0 x 0 0 7 v 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.150
 ok then how do you not see here what 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.540
 good why 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.820
 is the little boy that you see here is what I'm going 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.770
 to leave in the description of the video is 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.920
 they will decompress it and they will jump 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.360
 a folder like this is to open it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.970
 they will give how to execute as 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.010
 administrator and you to charge them a 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.470
 bar as it allows to load the bar 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.200
 a white box will appear in 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.480
 that bank box and there are two options the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.910
 on the left side the first option of 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.370
 left side to the right side you 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.650
 they are going to click then to start 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.410
 load to load install load lists 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.960
 the complements things for the system x 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.270
 then this is experience that ends 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.890
 do not move anything, you want to be 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.840
 do another thing to get paid 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.570
 part of your house I do not know 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.990
 and that they automatically return that 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.990
 window 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.670
 they were to execute their game and without 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.950
 problems that happened to me with 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.680
 with the heat I do not have water 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.900
 then we will look for games 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.239
 leaders and there are more passions mistakes 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.769
 will be bringing the solutions every day 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.769
 here will be updating 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.940
 I think this has been all 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.940
 if you like to leave your comments 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.620

 game 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:05.360

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.870
