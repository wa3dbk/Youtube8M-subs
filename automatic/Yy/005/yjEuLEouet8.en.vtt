direction<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.160> hair<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.580> not<00:01:50.790> going

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
direction of the hair and not going

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.330 
direction of the hair and not going
backwards<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.350> don't<00:01:52.500> want<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.680> travel<00:01:53.010> up<00:01:53.160> or

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
backwards you don't want to travel up or

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.890 
backwards you don't want to travel up or
it's<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.640> actually<00:01:53.790> pull<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.510> hair

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
it's going to actually pull that hair

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.690 
it's going to actually pull that hair
away<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.820> tape<00:01:56.820> that's<00:01:57.120> securing<00:01:57.600> it

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.670 

so<00:02:02.700> when<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.390> leopard<00:02:03.660> spots<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.350> lot<00:02:04.560> of

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
spot adjacent to it or a couple extra

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.290 
spot adjacent to it or a couple extra
spots<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.160> want<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.430> leave<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.820> fairly

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
spots but you want to leave a fairly

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.540 
spots but you want to leave a fairly
generous<00:02:15.750> portion<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> middle<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.400> that

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
generous portion in the middle so that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.690 
generous portion in the middle so that
you<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.820> add<00:02:17.970> your<00:02:18.209> secondary<00:02:18.690> color

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.040
