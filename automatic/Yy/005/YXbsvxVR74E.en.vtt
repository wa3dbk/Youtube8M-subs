00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.000
 hey people for this look also the first 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.610
 such a headband and bobby pins so 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.610
 small klitschen and small I have 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.730
 I'm the first one 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.730
 Central crest 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.050
 on one side of my hair one 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.190
 very long strands so if you step 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.630
 then you should already have it 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.730
 Be careful that you are not the top one 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.740
 really takes one of the 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.330
 longest and this then divided three 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.330
 on and maybe the normal 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.280
 until we get there and do that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.670
 whole with a fat little have the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.689
 then you can do the job one more time 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.689
 Loosen up a bit if you want 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.999
 you take your area 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.549
 come around her head once 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.970
 on the other side, put it then 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.970
 in the short term now with a bobby pins 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.110
 so that it stays where it is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.110
 you get your headband 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.780
 on 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.000
 assume one should actually now 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.500
 also the area to fold because of that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.500
 can you take out the audience again 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.140
 that's how I think so 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.690
 quite the look but what you then 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.250
 to do it is a few 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.660
 strands in front and increasingly the then so 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.660
 to wrap that striker 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.320
 the whole looks a bit more 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.060
 more beautiful in my opinion in the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.190
 voice has not been as far away as at 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.350
 but maybe a little darker 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.730
 or golden and the whole thing one more 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.450
 Bit smaller than not so 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.450
 big tripping 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.440
 you just do it on both 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.550
 pages so that I want to have it now 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.550
 both times twice 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.760
 and then can you we watch the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.660
 have lift want a bit 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.660
 position 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.569
 you'll see that's bad then 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.250
 actually this black band was there 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.329
 mostly with ourselves I am 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.650
 not too bad and then you can 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.370
 the hair on the top a bit on lok 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.260
 if you want 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.260
 and that's actually it 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.780
 I liked you this video
