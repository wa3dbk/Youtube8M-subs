00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.439
 how about 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.439
 yes 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.129
 a long time ago and serving to see 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.830
 die exactly 11 months ago without 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.630
 However everything has changed since then 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.310
 or the truth does not have follows the same 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.840
 rude that before however something is the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
 second must die to tell them more 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.800
 tips against her because she is currently 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 still fire in with the qualifiers 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.420
 he went up an entire league playing with her and 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.550
 they start to handle it but because you're left 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.530
 in this video to know more in a 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.960
 tank method and brokers brothers is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.120
 as an after all of time that is like 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.740
 those tanks that also stick well hard 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 like in the target box in this is 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.460
 being an explosive session and not 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.290
 necessarily resistant is very 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.910
 simple any composition should 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.100
 have one or two characters that contribute 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.829
 large amounts of damage very large 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.870
 great either magic or physical target is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.399
 good because you do not need flash or much 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.230
 positioning to reach those 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.510
 vital goals that are usually 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.220
 fragile added to that which has one of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 the most gross and explosive damages 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.640
 we have a champion that can erase and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.530
 knock down the pillar of the teams in this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.270
 season that's why it's so good 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.250
 option then how can you deal 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.670
 against her how can you prevent 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.259
 scale 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 power to represent a threat 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.979
 for your nation and Anna has one euro 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.600
 league in relatively weak e 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.520
 even passive as it does not have a form 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.770
 to connect lethal damage unless you 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.420
 follow repeatedly with your q try 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 punish the each time you want to farmar 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 in order to lower the performance of their 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 last blows be careful if you are a 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.440
 champion milk and because your shield can 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.420
 help you resist an exchange for 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.340
 beyond level 4 take good care of your life and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.170
 manna preparing you so that when he arrives 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 in level 6 you have little life and can 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
 explode if you're ape I recommend you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.600
 strongly to stay visual center 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.580
 since it will protect you from your central 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 aggressive and apart will give you an advantage 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.509
 against her to cause magical damage 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 the barrier spell is almost key 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.229
 against diana not only for the mir but 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.090
 also for the carry if you go against 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.890
 a bullseye and you're one of carrie consider 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.750
 barrier instead of healing since that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.250
 spell protects you much more damage and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.380
 will be just tailored against the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.970
 deadly entries of targets in matter 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 of equipment you have to see what you have to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.740
 do 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.539
 usually do not use carry in a 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.580
 battle formation take possession back 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.560
 against a bullseye tries to always 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.360
 the carry are in a middle position and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.459
 always guarded by a character with 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.690
 many since then in a battle of 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.520
 target team will try to enter 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.800
 quickly down the lane the bar 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.630
 need of impact and ss of your ally 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.790
 avoid counterattack by leaving a 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.380
 a vulnerable and committed target 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.150
 standard target will never enter if not 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.010
 first guess your tank so that the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.840
 worship of your ultimate cool this 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.970
 gives you an index of when you enter 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.650
 as a warning a good bullseye launches the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.690
 first the ultimate so that in the air 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.610
 throw the q in this way it will refresh 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.680
 the ultimate and will have it one more time 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.720
 available as final data the guards 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.860
 in tucumÃ£ are obligatory because remember 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.660
 that if you meet and you do not have 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.880
 vision will suffice for a few seconds 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.470
 they exploit you so there will be no more 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.090
 reason to fear this pale itch 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.980
 count definitive strategies 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.580
 against this champion of twin in the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.680
