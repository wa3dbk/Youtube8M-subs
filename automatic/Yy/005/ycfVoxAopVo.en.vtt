for my channel we're going to share that
I<00:01:52.369> think<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.939> weight<00:01:54.390> loss<00:01:54.630> stuff

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
I think a lot of the weight loss stuff

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.389 
I think a lot of the weight loss stuff
is<00:01:55.079> actually<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
is actually going to go back on the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.950 
is actually going to go back on the
weight<00:01:56.579> loss<00:01:56.610> channel<00:01:57.210> because<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
weight loss channel because I know you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
weight loss channel because I know you
guys<00:01:58.259> don't<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.159> very<00:01:59.310> much

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
guys don't really like that very much

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.240 
guys don't really like that very much
here<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.780> yeah<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.530> exclude<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.070> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
here and yeah I want to exclude it I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.709 
here and yeah I want to exclude it I
want<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> put<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.880> off<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.149> side<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
want to put it off to the side but I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
want to put it off to the side but I
think<00:02:04.079> maybe<00:02:04.320> I'll<00:02:04.530> interview<00:02:04.770> DDP<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.579> day

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
think maybe I'll interview DDP that day

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.490 
think maybe I'll interview DDP that day
or<00:02:05.909> maybe<00:02:06.030> we'll<00:02:06.299> just<00:02:06.390> hang<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.020> you'll

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
or maybe we'll just hang out and you'll

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
or maybe we'll just hang out and you'll
get<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.740> see<00:02:07.890> some<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> footage<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
get to see some of the footage but the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.490 
get to see some of the footage but the
majority<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> weight<00:02:09.840> loss<00:02:10.080> stuff<00:02:10.200> will

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
majority of the weight loss stuff will

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.930 
majority of the weight loss stuff will
start<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.220> weight<00:02:11.340> loss<00:02:11.370> channel

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
start going on the weight loss channel

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.160 
start going on the weight loss channel

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
have been very positively affected by it
of<00:02:43.290> course<00:02:43.440> most<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.159> have<00:02:44.250> probably<00:02:44.280> seen

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
of course most of you have probably seen

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.640 
of course most of you have probably seen
Arthur's<00:02:45.060> transformation<00:02:45.690> by<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.230> think

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
Arthur's transformation by now I think

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.839 
Arthur's transformation by now I think
it's<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.829> step<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> right<00:02:47.280> direction<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.790> I

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
it's a step in the right direction and I

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:48.979 
it's a step in the right direction and I
think<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.120> something<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.359> really<00:02:48.629> really

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
think it's something I really really

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.869 
think it's something I really really
need<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.379> having<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:49.980> personal<00:02:50.430> experience

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
need and having that personal experience

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.229 
need and having that personal experience
I<00:02:50.970> think<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.239> exactly<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.560> big<00:02:52.739> goal<00:02:53.239> speaking

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
I think is exactly the big goal speaking

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.569 
I think is exactly the big goal speaking
of<00:02:54.390> which<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.690> turn<00:02:55.140> well<00:02:56.129> I'm<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.400> going<00:02:56.519> to

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
of which I turn well I'm not going to

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.770 
of which I turn well I'm not going to
tell<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.700> how<00:02:56.849> old<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.060> guess<00:02:57.359> I<00:02:57.480> said<00:02:57.660> it

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
tell you how old I guess I said it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.599 
tell you how old I guess I said it
before<00:02:57.840> yeah<00:02:58.379> I<00:02:58.409> don't<00:02:58.980> feel<00:02:59.069> excited<00:02:59.459> again

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
before yeah I don't feel excited again

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.309 
before yeah I don't feel excited again
but<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.450> feel<00:03:00.629> free<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.870> make<00:03:00.959> your<00:03:01.140> guesses

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
but you feel free to make your guesses

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.839 
but you feel free to make your guesses
if<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.680> don't<00:03:01.859> know<00:03:01.980> how<00:03:02.129> old<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.489> am<00:03:02.519> down<00:03:02.790> to
