all<00:00:21.090> right<00:00:21.180> we're<00:00:21.779> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> start<00:00:22.170> off<00:00:22.260> by

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
all right we're going to start off by

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.980 
all right we're going to start off by
drawing<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.769> circle<00:00:23.510> then<00:00:24.510> we're<00:00:24.660> going<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
drawing a circle then we're going to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.900 
drawing a circle then we're going to
split<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.890> two<00:00:26.400> halves<00:00:28.279> like<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> bed

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
split it in the two halves like a bed

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.089 
split it in the two halves like a bed
prime<00:00:30.300> meridian<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.830> we're<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
prime meridian and then we're going to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.180 
prime meridian and then we're going to
add<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.550> triangle<00:00:32.940> shape<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> bottom

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
add in a triangle shape at the bottom

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.549 
add in a triangle shape at the bottom
for<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.790> force<00:00:36.780> cheeks<00:00:37.700> his<00:00:38.700> chin<00:00:39.559> reverse

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
for it the force cheeks his chin reverse

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.600 
for it the force cheeks his chin reverse
see<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.640> his<00:00:41.820> ear<00:00:42.770> split<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.950> circle<00:00:44.280> again

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
see for his ear split to circle again

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.069 
see for his ear split to circle again
and<00:00:45.890> draw<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.039> larger<00:00:47.700> circle<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> two<00:00:48.660> smaller

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and draw a larger circle and two smaller

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.840 
and draw a larger circle and two smaller
ones<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:50.820> planet<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:51.930> moons<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
ones like a planet in two moons so you

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.350 
ones like a planet in two moons so you
can<00:00:53.969> start<00:00:54.270> fleshing<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> nose<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.430> have

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
can start fleshing out the nose and have

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
can start fleshing out the nose and have
the<00:00:57.600> habit<00:00:58.350> connect<00:00:58.649> towards<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> eye<00:00:59.250> that's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the habit connect towards the eye that's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
the habit connect towards the eye that's
further<00:00:59.969> away<00:01:02.719> another<00:01:03.719> circle<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.229> his<00:01:04.320> nose

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
further away another circle for his nose

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.210 
further away another circle for his nose
ring<00:01:08.390> top<00:01:09.390> part<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.750> his<00:01:09.840> eyes<00:01:13.040> but<00:01:14.040> really

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
ring top part of his eyes but really

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
ring top part of his eyes but really
chibi<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.360> hard<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.350> look<00:01:16.500> at

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
chibi is not hard at all you can look at

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.620 
chibi is not hard at all you can look at
chibi<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.369> really<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.479> very

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
chibi and do this really it's a very

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
chibi and do this really it's a very
simplification<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.740> anything<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.280> you're

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
simplification of anything that you're

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
simplification of anything that you're
drawing<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:23.369> always<00:01:23.759> flesh<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
drawing and always flesh it out just a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
drawing and always flesh it out just a
little<00:01:25.560> bit<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> personally<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.210> feel<00:01:30.509> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
little bit if you personally I feel that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.300 
little bit if you personally I feel that
this<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> easiest<00:01:31.380> style<00:01:33.740> like<00:01:34.740> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
this is the easiest style like it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.730 
this is the easiest style like it's
mostly<00:01:35.729> simple<00:01:36.150> shapes<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:37.079> okay<00:01:37.409> take<00:01:37.590> his

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
mostly simple shapes like okay take his

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.149 
mostly simple shapes like okay take his
eyebrows<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:39.030> drew

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
eyebrows I just drew

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
eyebrows I just drew
they're<00:01:41.159> pretty<00:01:41.400> much<00:01:42.290> triangles<00:01:43.290> but

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
they're pretty much triangles but

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.410 
they're pretty much triangles but
they're<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.770> slightly<00:01:44.490> slanted<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.329> to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
they're just slightly slanted just to

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.719 
they're just slightly slanted just to
tap<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.170> doesn't<00:01:47.070> take<00:01:47.159> very<00:01:47.189> much<00:01:47.549> skill

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
tap in that doesn't take very much skill

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.899 
tap in that doesn't take very much skill
same<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.909> his<00:01:51.090> reverse<00:01:51.509> headband<00:01:52.909> some

same with his reverse headband some
rectangles<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:55.110> triangles<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
rectangles and some triangles and you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.929 
rectangles and some triangles and you
want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> simple<00:01:59.219> line<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.640> his<00:01:59.759> mouth

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939

I<00:02:08.420> pretty<00:02:09.420> much<00:02:09.479> skip<00:02:09.720> step<00:02:09.989> but<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.440> two

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
I pretty much skip step but it's two

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
I pretty much skip step but it's two

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.009 
because I pretty much want my channel to
be<00:02:46.260> dedicated<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.830> my<00:02:47.010> viewers<00:02:47.480> watch<00:02:48.480> all<00:02:48.750> I'm

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.339 
be dedicated to my viewers watch all I'm
nothing<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:51.140> but<00:02:52.140> even<00:02:53.720> if<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.840> really<00:02:55.080> can't

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
nothing so but even if you really can't

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.410 
nothing so but even if you really can't
draw<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.739> will<00:02:55.980> start<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.550> chibi<00:02:56.879> it's

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
draw that will start with chibi it's

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.199 
draw that will start with chibi it's
mostly<00:02:57.659> simple<00:02:57.900> shapes<00:02:58.230> anyway<00:02:58.739> I<00:02:59.010> mean<00:02:59.970> if

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
mostly simple shapes anyway I mean if

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.790 
mostly simple shapes anyway I mean if
you<00:03:00.330> can<00:03:00.480> draw<00:03:00.599> a<00:03:00.629> top<00:03:01.019> hexagon<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.709> do

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
you can draw a top hexagon you can do

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.059 
you can draw a top hexagon you can do
most<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.159> this<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:03.480> pretty<00:03:03.659> much<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:03.989> keep<00:03:04.890> on
