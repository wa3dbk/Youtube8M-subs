00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.160
 actually so here we are in a like 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.290
 a campsite that was abandoned ago 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.870
 greatest thing but it was nice 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.210
 still take on video so everything 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.190
 going on site these wells will wish a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.030
 little trick but good always better 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.400
 that nothing is finally the bubble then 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.400
 that's what we can say it's gone 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.470
 it's everywhere I go so little 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:01:00.330
 cooked 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:01:01.949
 apparently the gas is still there and that 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.350
 it is also of this tube hélène when one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.090
 can see will be young people coming 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.909
 this side as we can see it's 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.549
 really small it's a small 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.909
 part of the campsite that we will put between 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.909
 quotation marks 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.119
 so here if you come a rare thing we have 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.640
 in the rucks we are entitled to a very 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.920
 old baby 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.390
 the party had to be stopped everything is yes 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.880
 when I see that I want to 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.119
 sing cabrel with a cabin at 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.119
 garden background 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.479
 so the toilet 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:07.659
 there's that very rudimentary closed 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.659
 for intimacy 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:17.569
 I think it's been really long 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 that have not come so there she right 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.599
 1-1 motorhomes that were connected to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.599
 a caravan 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.580
 the gas bottles are still there 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.260
 try to go in 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.860
 Well, I do not know how I can do it 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.990
 looks like they were friends 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:01.680
 can be 53 yeah no problem so much 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.680
 do their way this is the big room 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.350
 so I'm still making fun of the bed 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.480
 sailor is good there is something unusual 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.090
 also we put on a bed the ceiling in 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:21.310
 what do you think of this 4th 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.550
 could really and owners there 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.650
 had to exist an amphitheater in full 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.650
 longer jump or died more beautiful 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:46.000
 water at all spider vacuum for not 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.080
 change there behind you the rest of 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.220
 caravans with a hole in the floor 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:04:00.000
 oh yes, it's dubois caravan wood 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.000
 as we read it does not hold masses 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.360
 these auxiliary heaters 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.960
 and there we have the right to a shelter for 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:32.520
 cars that in the correct state we can 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:36.040
 to say a lot but hey it's not far 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.420
 we did a little time 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.730
 not like I said on time 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.980
 always happy to take things 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.080
 like that the abandonment ok there's no big 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.230
 thing that is called in the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.590
 a jargon chips there that makes people laugh 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:56.040
 chips to take a drink again and that's it 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.400
