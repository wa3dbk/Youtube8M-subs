00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 hello my name is sonia and today I like 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 I'm going to teach you how to do these 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.750
 flowers with surprises 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.480
 made with napkins ideal for 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.489
 children's parties so keep that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.980
 right now I explain to you that we need and 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.980
 the procedure to perform them 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.070
 we need paper napkins a 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.010
 toothpick thin tape 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.160
 Gifts candies and jellybeans and a 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.160
 scissors 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.429
 to make this little flower of 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.010
 napkin we can use any 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.440
 paper napkin and in this case I'm going to 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.379
 use this one that is decorated we open the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.030
 napkin and to begin with let's take 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.030
 the corners towards the center 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.250
 we repeat this and we are going to carry 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.250
 again the corners towards the center 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.630
 and now for the third time we are going to take 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.630
 again the corners towards the center 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.640
 now the next thing is to turn it around 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.160
 and we are going to repeat the same thing we are going to 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.580
 bring all the corners to the 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.580
 center 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.570
 and so we get a tiny square 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.810
 let's hold the corners and 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.050
 let's take out from behind 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.610
 this excels 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.610
 we will raise it like this 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.430
 and we take out a petal we're going to do what 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.430
 same with the other three 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.760
 now let's take out 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.760
 you are here back 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.580
 we are going to take them forward 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.430
 and now as you can see we have eight petals 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.640
 now we are going to take out what is left here 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.190
 we are going to 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.370
 put forward the other three 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.370
 as well 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.980
 and we are having this 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.600
 Now let's give it a shape towards 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.530
 down 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.530
 to these from here 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.189
 and these too 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.900
 now with a toothpick we are going to 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.760
 do what 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.760
 some holes like that 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.440
 and we do it in the other three 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.129
 and once all the holes have been made 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.599
 let's fill it with whatever we want 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.170
 that the children are like 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.170
 surprise 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.650
 when we have stuffed we are going to 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.900
 make sure that this can close 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.650
 Now let's find a thin ribbon 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.650
 like this one for example let's cut two 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.680
 chunks 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.730
 and let them on the tips one 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.730
 diagonal cut 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.320
 and once this cut is made, let's move on 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.320
 the tape in this way 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.340
 and now inside the next 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.860
 tape first by the outside 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.920
 and then for the one inside 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.670
 and we have this now let's give this 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.670
 with this one 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.210
 and let's make a small loop here 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.970
 to make it easy to open we do it 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.660
 as a half-tie and now we do what 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.660
 same with the other 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.840
 What we can do now is curl 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.840
 these ribbons 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.360
 and thus it is finished of course it is 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.360
 something very original and to open it 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.840
 It's very simple and we're going like that 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.840
 ribbons 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.440
 and we can already get 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.910
 what we have put 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.210
 in this done the same 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:04.940
 in which it opens very easy 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.940
 and has filled him with jelly beans 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.689
 and this one has not closed because what I've 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.660
 fact is to put a big jelly 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:18.910
 and that's how it is decorating at the same time 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.770
 so I hope you liked this 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.690
 tutorial and to put it into practice it 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.480
 they make super fast these flowers are left 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.610
 very nice and as I said they are 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.580
 ideal for children 's parties to 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.020
