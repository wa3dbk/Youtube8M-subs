00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
that so far so good but they need off my

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
a like but to definitely talk about the

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.070 
a like but to definitely talk about the
game<00:04:30.500> for<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.910> biggest<00:04:32.120> like<00:04:32.510> you<00:04:32.960> know

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
game for the the biggest like you know

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.950 
game for the the biggest like you know
because<00:04:33.560> as<00:04:33.710> you<00:04:33.800> can<00:04:33.919> see<00:04:34.039> on<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.970> EDS<00:04:35.660> it's

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
because as you can see on the EDS it's

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.350 
because as you can see on the EDS it's
like<00:04:36.110> dark<00:04:36.380> it's<00:04:37.370> probably<00:04:37.729> because<00:04:38.030> it<00:04:38.300> is

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
like dark it's probably because it is

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.219 
like dark it's probably because it is
the<00:04:39.289> Forex<00:04:39.680> version<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.520> game

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
the Forex version of the game

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.400 
the Forex version of the game
disappointing

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
disappointing

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.589 
disappointing
yeah<00:04:42.680> but<00:04:43.639> hopefully<00:04:43.940> they've<00:04:44.090> updated<00:04:44.240> it

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
yeah but hopefully they've updated it

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.250 
yeah but hopefully they've updated it
pretty<00:04:44.990> soon<00:04:45.289> yeah
