00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 proceed to weaving our leaflet 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:16.020
 for this we take the wire green 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:19.640
 and string green beads in this way 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.500
 we string green beads 1 meter 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.470
 retreat from the edge of the wire 20 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.380
 centimeters fold in half 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.980
 it turns out such a loop in this 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.950
 the loop we put on our green beads 5 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.879
 centimeters here they are 5 centimeters we them 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 pass into our loop from this side 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.730
 wire tip 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.399
 we twist two turns to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.949
 the beads are not enough sleep now we are evenly 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.730
 distribute beads on both sides of our 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.000
 shelves on this side we also do 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.220
 we are already doing a twist 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 more because it is not one of us 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.520
 our leaflet that's what we did 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.720
 here is such a loop now we put on 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:22.590
 here beads to the main whether daughter until the end 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.860
 beads and do twist exactly one 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.450
 turnover now we have three turns 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.750
 It turned out we do 4 rows in the same way 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.750
 way 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.070
 that's it to him the tips of the wire we 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:48.460
 twist exactly one turn 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.940
 that's what happened with us already 4 rtka 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.920
 It happened here in such a way should be 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.950
 make 11 rows here with us 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.750
 such a leaflet 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.240
 wire that sticks out 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.240
 we wrap it inside and 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:15.410
 we press here for our flower we need 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.410
 3 sheets
