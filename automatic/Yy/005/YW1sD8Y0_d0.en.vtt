Hello and welcome to blogeee !

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.565
Today, we're going to talk about netbook which is a bit particular. 

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:14.028
As we can see, the packaging is a bit different from usual EeePCs.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.467
It's an EeePC 1001HA with a carton packaging.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.433
Why is the packaging so simple compared to usually?

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.359
It's simply because it's the cheapest Asus machine of this product range.

00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:32.922
Currently, for 249 euros, you can have this device

00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:41.442
which looks really like the 1005HA-M and the 1005HA-H we saw in the past.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:48.920
It's delivered with a small warranty card, without any bag.

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:56.473
And here's something different: the surface is carbon type,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.042
with the Eee logo engraved on the surface.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.480
That surface is interesting, because it won't catch fingerprints.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:18.840
It's also delivered with a two-pin plug as usually with Asus.

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.078
There's a drivers DVD and a small manual.

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:39.382
Last but not least: there's a battery which should have been a 2200 mAh battery

00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:42.925
according to what we saw in the past.

00:01:43.057 --> 00:01:48.728
But it's not the case: it's a 4400 mAh Li-Ion battery, similar to those delivered by Asus.

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:55.253
Why 2200? Because that's what Asus said in other countries like Italy for instance.

00:01:56.183 --> 00:02:00.415
Finaly, we've got a 4400 mAh battery and that's a good thing;

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:02.180
the device is now quite interesting.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:08.973
As for the ports and connectors, it's very standard. It's a usual and quite thin Seashell.

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:15.931
There's a standard power supply port, a VGA port,

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:25.035
a USB port just next to the lock port, which is surely not the best thing to use the USB port...

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.066
Then there's a small fan hole, enough for the Atom N270.

00:02:38.338 --> 00:02:43.953
We've still got this matte surface underneath with two speakers.

00:02:44.258 --> 00:02:47.977
We can also see a an access hatch in order to change the main memory.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.888
The access to the main memory is very easy, but for the main memory only.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.824
On the right side, there's a SDHC card reader.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.582
As usually with Asus, it enables to completely hide the card.

00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:04.339
Then you've got the usual audio ports for the headset and the mike.

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:13.514
Then there's two other USB 2.0 ports. And then, one RJ45 ethernet port.

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:21.722
When we open the device, we recognize the keyboard already seen on the previous 1005 series:

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.722
it's a Chocolate keyboard.

00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:25.700
And the greatest surprise is the matte screen!

00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:28.939
The border is really glossy, but the screen is matte.

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:35.229
There's a 0.3 megapixel camera and a Digital Array Mic. The webcam is standard.

00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:48.198
The matte screen is definitely good news for many people.

00:03:50.447 --> 00:04:06.024
We can notice this carbon style a bit everywhere. And the touchpad is perfectly smooth.

00:04:16.556 --> 00:04:25.636
You've got two clicks possible on the touchpad button, which is quite well accessible.

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:52.657
We've got a 10-inch, 1024x600 matte screen, of quite good quality, with a good brightness.

00:04:53.666 --> 00:05:01.355
The Chocolate keyboard is very similar to the 1005's, well built...

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:43.088
The device is equipped with a Wifi n which enables a good connectivity.

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:47.324
And finally, the device is very light.

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:53.707
Without the battery, it weighs less 1 kg.

00:05:54.612 --> 00:06:00.363
Once the battery added, we've got a 1296-gramme device, so less than 1.3 kg.

00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:07.240
The good news is that with the charger, the weight is less than 1.5 kg.

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:12.640
We've got a real mobile and interesting device for 249 euros,

00:06:12.888 --> 00:06:21.734
maybe one of the best current bargains on the netbook market.
