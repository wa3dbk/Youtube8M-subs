00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello my name is hugo park in this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.620
 video we will analyze the trailer of the 4 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.620
 fantastic 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.110
 before starting, it is necessary to clarify that the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.990
 actor miles teller is reed richards kate 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.330
 mara plays her storm jamie bell lo 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.130
 we see how ben green michael jordan da 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.410
 life to the human torch introd and that 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.570
 sees or incarnates a programmer called 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.579
 vÃ­ctor tomÃ¡s who uses as nickname the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.009
 Doctor doom also this film to 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.439
 difference of the previous three games 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.880
 it will be much more realistic and dramatic in 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.160
 regarding the costumes that the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.140
 characters will be something very different from what 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.879
 shown in the comics throughout the 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.620
 advance we can hear a voice in off 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.450
 which speaks mainly of desire 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.920
 unlimited human being to perform 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.050
 new discoveries and 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.270
 consequences that this brings if we read 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.670
 between lines what he wants to tell us is 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.870
 that the movie reed richards will discover 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.640
 a kind of tele machine 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.980
 conveyor and it will result 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.900
 that four people mistakenly acquire 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.820
 different skills in the first 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.680
 moments of the trailer we see a small 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.910
 richards showing the bne green a 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.980
 invention that is intended 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.140
 teleport a toy car later 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.210
 we can see the same experiment as a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.009
 reed richards had designed in his childhood 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.990
 but this time on a much larger scale 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.400
 also you can appreciate people dressed 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.960
 of white between 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.760
 the machine in another scene many 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.250
 people are sitting watching a 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.110
 exhibition we could deduce that it is reed 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.940
 richards who is showing the design 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.790
 from his experiment to the army of 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.860
 us although we can not rule out the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.390
 who is doing the exhibition be of 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.950
 one after having stolen the idea 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.810
 later a smiling one appears 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.640
 richards entering a place that seems 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.800
 have everything he needs to be able to 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.780
 carry out your investigations this one 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.760
 it could be the baxter building in the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.320
 comics here is where the 'four 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.450
 fantastic 'after having formed 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.490
 as a team right away we have a first 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.050
 look at your story in maybe you 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.160
 finds working in a kind of 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.900
 military installation 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.970
 likewise look at a screen that has 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.590
 two rather peculiar characteristics 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.910
 The first is that some 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.190
 coordinates in the lower corner 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.960
 left this ip address in light of 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.090
 a fictional country called to breakdown in 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.160
 the printed this place was ruled by 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.840
 doctor doom and the second is a point 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.240
 red that I would possibly be pointing 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.070
 to that nation it is important to highlight 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.570
 that his storm after acquiring his 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.400
 powers becomes the woman 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.650
 invisible in another moment of the trailer 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.390
 Ben Green appears playing baseball 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.130
 this character is who subsequently 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.210
 will be transformed to death too 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.070
 we see 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.600
 fixing a car this can be the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.730
 same car that appears at full speed 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.920
 at the beginning of the trailer after six 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.110
 subjects dressed in black enter a 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.090
 second machine much more modern than its 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.740
 predecessor we do not know if these were 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.240
 the same people in white that 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.400
 they entered the first machine but 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.740
 we could formulate the theory that 'the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.570
 4 fantastic 'will not acquire their powers 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.010
 in a single trip a part may 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.020
 I got them when they were 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.940
 teleported by the first invention 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.650
 and the other by the second finally 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.840
 we can see the man behind the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.150
 narration we already listen while we see 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.580
 the advance you read the doctor franklin storm 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.770
 played by the rescue actor and in 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.810
 the comics he is the father of jhonny and his 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.640
 store notwithstanding the movie rumors 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 they assure that the latter will be the daughter 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.420
 adoptive of franklin in another take demos 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.220
 to reed richards within the second 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.380
 machine it seems that the experiment comes out 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.270
 pretty bad then later we see 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.340
 richards in very poor condition the place in 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.230
 which is likely to be 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.180
 an unknown dimension called the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.920
 negative zone below we are 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.020
 witnesses of the birth of the mole 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.790
 you can see that literally the character 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.620
 It's a rock then it looks like a store 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.540
 much more blonde than the one shown in a 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.090
 start which means that 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.890
 where his powers will clear his hair in 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.689
 your hands have someone's head 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.219
 that seems to be johnny storm to this 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.319
 last we also see it in a hallway 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.030
 catching on fire in another scene the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.680
 doctor doom demonstrates his 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.939
 powers attacking people who are 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.650
 find in front of him gives the impression 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.209
 that this villain is in the same 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.099
 corridor in which the human torch is 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.959
 set earlier then I went up johnny 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.819
 storm apply their powers the first 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.680
 activates a force field and the second 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.840
 flamethrower is unknown if these 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.609
 are fighting or just showing up 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.590
 to each other their abilities other than 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.180
 he also exhibits his dowries is reed 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.950
 richards in this shot it seems that the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.989
 superhero will be battling the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.489
 negative zone we also see that rifle 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.560
 speak a guy who is tied to a 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.389
 stretcher the most feasible is that it is 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.220
 doctor doom after being caught 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.079
 after committing some criminal act 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.370
 at the end of the trailer we see the group 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.230
 of superheroes in the negative zone 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.120
 seeing a ray of light that he has in his 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.250
 inside a kind of airplane also 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.019
 you can appreciate the mole without pants what 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.300
 which perhaps means that the suit 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.430
 who will use this if he uses some 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.500
 will be so resistant when fighting 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.270
 that would be all for now write the 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.130
 comments what did you think about what was seen 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.840
