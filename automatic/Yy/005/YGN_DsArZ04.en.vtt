00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.089 
in the camp so you can't find enough
drivers<00:01:46.060> okay<00:01:46.929> can't<00:01:47.469> find<00:01:47.679> enough<00:01:47.860> truck

drivers okay can't find enough truck
drivers<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:50.679> a<00:01:50.799> challenging<00:01:51.280> drivers

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729

market according to the article and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.029 
market according to the article and
Swift<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.569> having<00:01:55.929> a<00:01:55.989> higher<00:01:56.229> turnover<00:01:56.619> rate

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
Swift is having a higher turnover rate

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.089 
Swift is having a higher turnover rate
than<00:01:57.250> expected<00:01:58.679> like<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.500> set<00:02:02.739> of<00:02:02.859> drivers

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
than expected like the set of drivers

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.649 
than expected like the set of drivers
shortage<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.879> getting<00:02:04.149> worse<00:02:05.039> as<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:07.149> economy

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
shortage is getting worse as the economy

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.630 
shortage is getting worse as the economy
is<00:02:07.750> getting<00:02:07.899> better<00:02:08.079> I<00:02:08.679> don't<00:02:09.250> want<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.519> make

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
is getting better I don't want to make

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.210 
is getting better I don't want to make
sense<00:02:09.849> of<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.179> but<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:11.079> driver<00:02:11.379> shortage<00:02:11.829> is

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
sense of that but the driver shortage is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.800 
sense of that but the driver shortage is
getting<00:02:12.549> worse<00:02:12.760> as<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.209> economy<00:02:13.630> is<00:02:13.690> getting

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
getting worse as the economy is getting

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.750 
getting worse as the economy is getting
better<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.160> economy<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.489> getting<00:02:15.609> better

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
better so the economy is getting better

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.490 
better so the economy is getting better
so<00:02:16.120> people<00:02:16.450> find<00:02:16.660> another<00:02:16.810> jobs<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.380> know

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
so people find another jobs you know

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.559 
so people find another jobs you know
