00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the vegetable need to be cooked but I

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.370 
the vegetable need to be cooked but I
usually<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.850> first<00:02:30.890> mix<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.910> prawns

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
usually like to first mix up the prawns

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.229 
usually like to first mix up the prawns
so<00:02:34.380> I'm<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.680> go<00:02:34.860> ahead<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.310> toss<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
so I'm going to go ahead and toss in the

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.130 
so I'm going to go ahead and toss in the
prawns<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.370> at<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.209> stage<00:02:39.270> we<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:39.900> just

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
prawns and at this stage we can just

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.509 
prawns and at this stage we can just
turn<00:02:40.319> up<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.830> heat<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.280> little<00:02:42.120> bit<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:43.519> fry

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
turn up the heat a little bit and fry

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.970 
turn up the heat a little bit and fry
these<00:02:44.580> up<00:02:45.000> don't<00:02:45.600> let<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.989> overcook<00:02:46.590> because

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
these up don't let it overcook because

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.309 
these up don't let it overcook because
then<00:02:47.130> they<00:02:47.280> tend<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.610> get<00:02:47.850> hard<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.600> don't

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
then they tend to get hard and don't

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.790 
then they tend to get hard and don't
taste<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.340> good<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:51.510> you'll<00:02:52.019> see<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.620> they

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
taste so good so you'll see that they

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.910 
taste so good so you'll see that they
start<00:02:53.069> turning<00:02:53.519> color<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.470> that's<00:02:55.470> your<00:02:55.709> sign

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
start turning color and that's your sign

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.910
