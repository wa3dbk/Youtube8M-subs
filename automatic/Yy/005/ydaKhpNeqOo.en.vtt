building a race car is a lot of fun

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.740 
building a race car is a lot of fun
but<00:00:08.010> one<00:00:08.309> thing<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.000> plan<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.510> is

once the lip is cut it's easy to bend it
back<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.390> forth<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.720> fatigue<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.289> plastic<00:02:04.770> so

back and forth to fatigue the plastic so

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.990 
back and forth to fatigue the plastic so
you<00:02:05.100> could<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.460> rip<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.819> right<00:02:05.970> off
