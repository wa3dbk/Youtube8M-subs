00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
lockscreen clock I'd go install that so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.940 
lockscreen clock I'd go install that so
then<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> creep<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.060> firm

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
alright then you just restart the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.990 
alright then you just restart the
springboard

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.140 

royal<00:01:26.000> that's<00:01:26.270> done<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.840> change<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.970> there's

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
royal that's done is change so there's

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.810 
royal that's done is change so there's
no<00:01:29.270> clock<00:01:29.600> anymore<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.040> now<00:01:31.250> once<00:01:31.580> you've<00:01:31.729> got
