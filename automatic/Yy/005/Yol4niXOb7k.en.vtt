people<00:00:21.619> might<00:00:22.619> feel<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.699> texture<00:00:24.150> of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
people might feel that the texture of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.630 
people might feel that the texture of
hair<00:00:24.420> gets<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.840> little<00:00:25.019> finer<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.519> best

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
hair gets a little finer so the best

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.310 
hair gets a little finer so the best
thing<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> go<00:00:27.269> find<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.689> good<00:00:28.140> hair

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
microscopic evaluation we call it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.180 
microscopic evaluation we call it
miniaturization<00:00:33.780> study<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:35.010> use<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
miniaturization study we use a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.819 
miniaturization study we use a
microscope<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.969> look<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.780> different<00:00:37.410> areas<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
microscope to look at different areas of

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.280 
microscope to look at different areas of
the<00:00:38.129> scalp<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.329> basically<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.899> look<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the scalp so basically we look at the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
the scalp so basically we look at the
back<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.860> scalp<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.700> look<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> donor

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
back of this scalp and look at the donor

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.830 
back of this scalp and look at the donor
hair<00:00:43.110> which<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> more<00:00:44.390> better<00:00:45.390> quality<00:00:45.809> more

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
hair which is more better quality more

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.200 
hair which is more better quality more
permanent<00:00:46.620> hair<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.610> look<00:00:47.879> at<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
permanent hair and then look at the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.360 
permanent hair and then look at the
recipient<00:00:49.050> area<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> area<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.100> is

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
recipient area or the area that is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.830 
recipient area or the area that is
balding<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.449> look<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.460> percentage<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
balding and look at the percentage of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
balding and look at the percentage of
thinning<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:54.960> miniaturization<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:56.149> anyone

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
thinning or miniaturization if anyone

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
thinning or miniaturization if anyone
has<00:00:57.329> more<00:00:57.600> than<00:00:57.690> 20%<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.440> fine<00:00:58.829> hair<00:00:59.160> or

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
has more than 20% of fine hair or

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.080 
has more than 20% of fine hair or
miniaturised<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.030> at<00:01:00.180> any<00:01:00.359> area<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.960> means

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
miniaturised here at any area that means

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.140 
miniaturised here at any area that means
he<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.210> she<00:01:03.420> has<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> active<00:01:04.680> hair<00:01:04.830> loss<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
he or she has a active hair loss so in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.649 
he or she has a active hair loss so in
order<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.080> use<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> microscope<00:01:08.659> on

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
order to do that I use the microscope on

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.240 
order to do that I use the microscope on
the<00:01:10.080> donor<00:01:10.290> area<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:11.270> evaluate<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
the donor area and evaluate the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.700 
the donor area and evaluate the
thickness<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.400> hair<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.509> same<00:01:15.840> thing<00:01:16.110> with

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
thickness of hair the same thing with

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:29.840 
thickness of hair the same thing with
the<00:01:16.830> front<00:01:19.280> corners<00:01:24.560> top

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.800 

and<00:01:30.350> crown<00:01:31.350> areas<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.450> give<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
and crown areas and that will give me a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.620 
and crown areas and that will give me a
good<00:01:34.229> understanding<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
good understanding of the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.330 
good understanding of the
miniaturization<00:01:37.590> level<00:01:38.160> of<00:01:39.020> somebody's<00:01:40.020> hair

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
miniaturization level of somebody's hair

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.120 
miniaturization level of somebody's hair
that<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:42.320> my<00:01:43.320> patient<00:01:43.650> needs<00:01:43.800> treatment

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that way if my patient needs treatment

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.820 
that way if my patient needs treatment
with<00:01:44.550> medication<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.300> know<00:01:45.510> when<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> start<00:01:46.560> or

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
with medication I know when to start or

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.150 
with medication I know when to start or
whether<00:01:47.010> or<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.700> start<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.410> he<00:01:49.890> or
