on changing what's called the slide

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.039 
on changing what's called the slide
master<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.610> let's<00:00:11.820> suppose<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.780> wanted

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
master so let's suppose that we wanted

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.810 
master so let's suppose that we wanted
to<00:00:13.110> add<00:00:13.380> like<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:13.920> see<00:00:14.190> here<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> bottom

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to add like you see here in the bottom

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.290 
to add like you see here in the bottom
of<00:00:15.089> each<00:00:15.240> slide<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.160> component<00:00:17.609> called

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
of each slide I have a component called

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.480 
of each slide I have a component called
walk<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> different<00:00:19.109> path<00:00:19.350> if<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.100> wanted<00:00:20.340> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
walk a different path if you wanted to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.060 
walk a different path if you wanted to
have<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.720> some<00:00:22.289> other<00:00:22.470> thing<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
very bottom or in every slide and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.179 
very bottom or in every slide and
everything<00:00:25.289> instead<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.980> going

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
everything instead of you going

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.730 
everything instead of you going

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
customizing and changing every single

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.410 
customizing and changing every single
slide<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.429> change<00:00:29.760> what's<00:00:29.970> called<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
slide you can change what's called the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.630 
slide you can change what's called the
slide<00:00:30.689> master<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.160> by<00:00:32.369> going

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
slide master we can do that by going

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.750 
slide master we can do that by going
under<00:00:33.180> view<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.630> then<00:00:34.260> slide<00:00:35.160> master<00:00:37.760> under

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
under view and then slide master under

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.790 
under view and then slide master under
slide<00:00:39.059> master<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.320> where<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:40.620> could

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
slide master this is where we could

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.160 
slide master this is where we could
change<00:00:41.190> any<00:00:41.610> type<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.059> components<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.930> it'll

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
change any type of components and it'll

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
change any type of components and it'll
be<00:00:43.320> changed<00:00:43.800> throughout<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.820> slides<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
be changed throughout all the slides and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.540 
be changed throughout all the slides and
now<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.930> show<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.829> let's<00:00:46.980> say<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.370> want

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
now it's like show so let's say we want

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.130 
now it's like show so let's say we want
it<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> left<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.390> wanted<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
it here on the left we wanted to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
it here on the left we wanted to
customize<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.239> by<00:00:51.239> inserting<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.320> shape<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
customize this by inserting a shape and

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 
customize this by inserting a shape and
we're<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.360> through<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.840> shape<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.440> be

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
we're going through this shape to be

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
we're going through this shape to be
very<00:00:56.100> basic<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.890> give<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.750> different

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
very basic just to give it a different

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
very basic just to give it a different
look<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.199> all<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> slides<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> our<00:01:02.070> slide<00:01:02.460> show

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
look to all the slides in our slide show

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.109 
look to all the slides in our slide show
if<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.899> need<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> change<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> color<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:06.380> and

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
if I need to change the color here and

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
if I need to change the color here and
then<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> very<00:01:09.479> bottom<00:01:09.930> let's<00:01:10.439> say<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.740> want

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
then in the very bottom let's say I want

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.609 
then in the very bottom let's say I want
to<00:01:10.950> insert<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.970> text<00:01:12.330> box<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.259> want<00:01:16.470> this

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to insert a text box and you want this

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
to insert a text box and you want this
to<00:01:16.830> show<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.580> all<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.150> slides<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:23.479> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
to show up in all the slides and of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
to show up in all the slides and of
course<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.409> change<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.130> bullet

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
course you can also change this bullet

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
course you can also change this bullet
number<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.150> let's<00:01:27.390> customize<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.829> let's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
number so let's customize it so let's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
number so let's customize it so let's
assume<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.030> change<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.509> color

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
assume that you want to change the color

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
assume that you want to change the color
of<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.079> bullet<00:01:31.939> click<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> drop<00:01:33.329> down<00:01:34.220> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
of this bullet click on the drop down to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
of this bullet click on the drop down to
the<00:01:35.340> bullets<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> numbering<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.590> let's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the bullets and numbering and then let's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.050 
the bullets and numbering and then let's
say<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.130> want<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.640> bright<00:01:39.030> red<00:01:40.909> okay

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
say we want it bright red okay

notice<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.689> specific<00:01:43.200> bullet<00:01:43.530> has<00:01:43.740> been

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
notice that specific bullet has been

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
notice that specific bullet has been
changed<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.670> let's<00:01:45.030> say<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.479> want<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
changed and let's say that we want it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.130 
changed and let's say that we want it
square<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.899> very

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
square so you can go in in a very

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.130 
square so you can go in in a very
refined<00:01:49.409> way<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.490> modify<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.540> kinds<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
refined way and modify all kinds of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.010 
refined way and modify all kinds of
components<00:01:52.579> throughout<00:01:53.579> your<00:01:54.090> slide<00:01:54.450> master

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
components throughout your slide master

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.039 
components throughout your slide master
let's<00:01:55.890> say<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> title<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.149> every<00:01:57.689> slide

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
let's say that the title on every slide

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
let's say that the title on every slide
of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> same<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.579> keep<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.880> mind<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
of the same kind now keep in mind the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
of the same kind now keep in mind the
same<00:02:00.450> kind<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.960> doesn't<00:02:01.229> change<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.680> every

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
same kind it doesn't change it for every

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.030 
same kind it doesn't change it for every
type<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> slide<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.799> want<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
type of slide out there you want to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.359 
type of slide out there you want to
change<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.579> italics<00:02:06.979> that's<00:02:07.979> where<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
change it to italics that's where you

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.150 
change it to italics that's where you
just<00:02:08.789> simply<00:02:09.300> select<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.899> modify<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.890> any

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
just simply select it modify it so any
