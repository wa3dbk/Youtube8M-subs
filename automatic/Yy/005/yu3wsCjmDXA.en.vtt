computer has four gigs of RAM you need
to<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.979> able<00:01:59.100> you<00:02:00.090> need<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> make<00:02:00.750> sure<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
to be able you need to make sure that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.020 
to be able you need to make sure that
the<00:02:01.229> computer<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.740> able<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.219> run<00:02:02.399> properly<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the server is able to run properly so i

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.770 
the server is able to run properly so i
would<00:02:05.490> not<00:02:05.610> recommend<00:02:05.759> putting<00:02:06.270> any<00:02:06.509> lower

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.380 
than 1024 which is one gigabyte of ram
but<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.170> your<00:02:10.319> computer<00:02:10.709> has<00:02:10.970> four<00:02:11.970> gigs<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
but if your computer has four gigs of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.610 
but if your computer has four gigs of
ram<00:02:12.540> say

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
ram say

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740 
ram say
going<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.040> two<00:02:14.220> gigs<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.879> little<00:02:15.209> bit<00:02:15.330> risky

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
going to two gigs is a little bit risky

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.660 
going to two gigs is a little bit risky
depending<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.170> how<00:02:16.440> many<00:02:16.500> other<00:02:16.860> programs<00:02:17.280> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
depending on how many other programs you

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.390 
depending on how many other programs you
have<00:02:17.819> open<00:02:18.150> at<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.360> moment<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:20.099> would<00:02:20.310> just

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
have open at the moment so I would just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.490 
have open at the moment so I would just
recommend<00:02:20.549> leaving<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.180> at<00:02:21.360> 1024<00:02:22.200> which<00:02:22.379> is

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
recommend leaving it at 1024 which is

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.350 
recommend leaving it at 1024 which is
one<00:02:22.680> gig<00:02:22.890> say<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.580> eight<00:02:23.790> gigs<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.209> want

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
one gig say you have eight gigs you want

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.140 
one gig say you have eight gigs you want
to<00:02:24.420> put<00:02:24.569> four<00:02:24.810> gigs<00:02:25.019> gramp<00:02:25.349> type<00:02:25.769> take<00:02:26.250> 10<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.909> 4

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to put four gigs gramp type take 10 to 4

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.750 
to put four gigs gramp type take 10 to 4
and<00:02:27.299> times<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.900> by<00:02:27.930> 4<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.980> simple<00:02:29.459> very

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and times it by 4 that simple very

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030 
and times it by 4 that simple very
simple<00:02:29.970> math<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.569> does<00:02:30.780> son<00:02:31.019> really<00:02:31.799> it's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
simple math it does son really it's

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
many eventually it will create will just

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.720 
many eventually it will create will just
automatically<00:03:01.739> generate<00:03:02.190> all<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.430> other

server<00:03:03.120> properties<00:03:03.359> plugins<00:03:04.200> everything<00:03:05.010> you

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
server properties plugins everything you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.800 
server properties plugins everything you
need<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:06.030> i'll<00:03:06.209> just<00:03:06.269> explain<00:03:06.480> this

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
need to do so if i'll just explain this

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.630 
need to do so if i'll just explain this
very<00:03:07.049> briefly<00:03:07.349> as<00:03:07.500> well<00:03:07.650> server<00:03:08.370> properties

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
very briefly as well server properties

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.190 
very briefly as well server properties
that's<00:03:09.000> just<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.390> property<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.959> server

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
that's just the property to the server

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.720 
that's just the property to the server
so<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.829> change<00:03:11.069> everything<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.489> want<00:03:11.640> in

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
so you can change everything you want in

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.750 
so you can change everything you want in
there<00:03:12.019> plugins<00:03:13.019> are<00:03:13.230> basically<00:03:13.829> mods<00:03:14.129> but

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
there plugins are basically mods but

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.759 
there plugins are basically mods but
most<00:03:15.359> of<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:15.599> know<00:03:15.659> what<00:03:15.959> these<00:03:16.079> are<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.349> you

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
most of you know what these are and you

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.349 
most of you know what these are and you
can<00:03:16.920> fiddle<00:03:17.400> with<00:03:17.549> all<00:03:17.760> these<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.150> your<00:03:18.239> own

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
can fiddle with all these on your own

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.789 
can fiddle with all these on your own
time<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.750> you'd<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.380> let's<00:03:19.560> go<00:03:19.650> into

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
would recommend keeping it to 55 65

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.759 
would recommend keeping it to 55 65
because<00:03:48.090> then<00:03:48.269> people<00:03:48.690> don't<00:03:49.319> have<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.620> type

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
because then people don't have to type

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
see I am already logged in but if you

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.940 
see I am already logged in but if you
this<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.430> very<00:04:41.580> very<00:04:41.790> tricky<00:04:42.180> part<00:04:42.740> if<00:04:43.740> you

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
this is the very very tricky part if you

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.650 
this is the very very tricky part if you
have<00:04:44.160> telus<00:04:44.640> if<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:44.940> happen<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.420> have<00:04:45.510> the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
have telus if you happen to have the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.350 
have telus if you happen to have the
same<00:04:45.840> rotors<00:04:46.260> me<00:04:46.500> then<00:04:47.130> follow<00:04:47.520> my<00:04:47.760> steps<00:04:48.060> and

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
same rotors me then follow my steps and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.150 
same rotors me then follow my steps and
it'll<00:04:48.540> be<00:04:48.660> all<00:04:48.750> right<00:04:48.780> but<00:04:49.770> if<00:04:49.920> you<00:04:50.040> have

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
it'll be all right but if you have

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.860 
it'll be all right but if you have
anything<00:04:50.340> else<00:04:50.550> then<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.300> would<00:04:51.450> recommend

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
anything else then I would recommend

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.990 
anything else then I would recommend

1065<00:05:30.450> but<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:30.900> can<00:05:31.050> find<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.440> by<00:05:31.500> going<00:05:31.830> up

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
1065 but you can find that by going up

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.630 
1065 but you can find that by going up
there<00:05:32.400> open<00:05:33.030> network<00:05:33.270> preferences<00:05:33.540> and<00:05:37.640> right

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
there open network preferences and right

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.940 
there open network preferences and right
here<00:05:38.820> so<00:05:39.030> this<00:05:39.150> one<00:05:39.360> actually<00:05:39.480> says<00:05:39.900> hit<00:05:40.290> 192

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
here so this one actually says hit 192

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.130 
here so this one actually says hit 192
168<00:05:41.580> 1<00:05:41.810> 86<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.770> would<00:05:44.550> recommend<00:05:44.790> just<00:05:45.180> man

168 1 86 so I would recommend just man

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.970 
168 1 86 so I would recommend just man
manually<00:05:46.860> entering<00:05:47.250> it<00:05:47.430> and<00:05:47.580> type<00:05:47.960> 86<00:05:48.960> now<00:05:49.920> you
