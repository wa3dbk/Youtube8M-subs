and I think that you know and they're

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.450 
and I think that you know and they're
now<00:02:13.470> aware<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> UFC<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.250> they're

watching it down there so I think it's

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.740 
watching it down there so I think it's
going<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.560> be<00:02:17.710> a<00:02:17.760> big<00:02:18.760> success<00:02:18.940> where<00:02:19.330> we<00:02:19.420> go<00:02:19.570> I
