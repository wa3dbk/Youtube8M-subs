00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.630
 high where the regions change 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.100

 like this one of the mezcal in the European but 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.410
 this is what is going to boost and it puts very 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.140
 high Mexican traditions that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.780
 They could look like native old women 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.730
 handcrafted and without losing the flavor of what 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.320
 look and feel without losing character 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.670

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.710

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:39.440

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.330

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.250
 the typical bottle of those soldiers 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.610
 that they carried in their backpacks like 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.350
