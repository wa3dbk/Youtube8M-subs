00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 that is the topic of enlightenment 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.629
 but not only the should bring 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 Bicycling is a concern for my ladies 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.080
 and gentlemen but all the am 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.269
 Road traffic everyone sat 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.880
 namely safer in the saddle if one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.710
 handlebars would always burn a candle 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.310
 according to regulation with a strength of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.380
 At least 10 lux many wheel artists 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.109
 ignore this stubbornly strange 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.510
 is just the brand new wheels without 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.910
 Any lighting can be offered 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.940
 that is another reason why our test starts with 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.890
 a vehicle control one 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 Traffic control of the Potsdam police 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.730
 in the past week just before the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.110
 twilight the custodians have 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.110
 cyclist in sight 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 every fifth works the light 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 not on the bike who is not on time 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.640
 can escape like this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.239
 the cyclist has to pay ten euros 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.239
 pay penalties 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.420
 empty batteries or broken lamps in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.280
 We want a Berlin bike market 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.110
 Know how to get your wire in autumn 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.080
 a question also makes sense for 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.990
 Buyer new colored once stands 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.360
 a basic decision 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 in principle, two options either 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.940
 you take battery and battery enlightenment 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 or you build it all up 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960
 dynamo lighting around 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 Dynamos is the second 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.920
 decision to make either 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.970
 conventional pages dynamo or one 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.619
 which is integrated in the wheel hub 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.390
 when battery light set eliminates the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.490
 Dynamo big disadvantage 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.310
 according to road traffic regulations, they are only 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.929
 for racing bikes, who are allowed on dynamo 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.770
 still needs a lamp 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.960
 decide 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.030
 to choose from halogen lamps or 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.170
 the diodes headlights, however 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.170
 are significantly more expensive 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.320
 how difficult is it to bike with one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.640
 retrofit the lighting system 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.740
 three students of technical 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.070
 college pictures make for us the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.370
 Test look will be a side dynamo with 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.350
 Halogen light on his bike 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.510
 the dynamo costs 20 euros 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.239
 In addition there is a favorable halogen light 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.900
 for 10 euros and a taillight for 20 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.170
 euro total price 50 euro 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.159
 tobias tries it with the hub dynamo 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.290
 the price 55 euro, we also grab 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.750
 to a led light for 40 euros her 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.200
 light beats with 20 euros to book 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.640
 total price 115 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.739
 Afterwards takes over the installation of the battery 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.280
 Not your simple set of light costs 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.280
 eight euros 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.790
 it is not much frills 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.790
 around 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.639
 so i think that you are in here 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.560
 shortest time to build the parts could 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.450
 Let's go with the side dynamo 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.159
 swift progress because a mix bike already 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.959
 the correct bracket is present 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.700
 trickier is the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.769
 cable laying takes even longer 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.480
 tobias he must be dynamo for the name 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.530
 First, his mature to the new 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.530
 pull on the front wheel 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.489
 a few meters further in the lab for 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.829
 Process Automation Testing Professor 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.510
 goldmann and lab engineer with one 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.129
 second test set the electric 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.199
 characteristics and the wear of the 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.139
 two dynamos clear winner in the 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.909
 category of the dynamo name 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.949
 pilawa has much less wear 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.299
 because if i use this friction between rad 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.069
 and have mature that is much better 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.109
 has also stored the higher 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.629
 reliability and he has on everyone 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.180
 fall also the higher efficiency the 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.609
 Names made with your advice turn 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.560
 a turn of the rathenow has that 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.220
 so-called slip between tires and 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.870
 3 degrees 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.940
 that means especially when wet or 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.349
 snow slips the wheel the next test 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.379
 how bright are the different ones 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.329
 lamp types professor goldmann measures the 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.979
 Lighting strength the good news 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.769
 what about illuminance on the 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:12.659
 packaging is correct 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.439
 weakest performance shows that cheap 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.439
 Battery light 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.689
 the halogen lamp or the high quality 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:26.669
 Led light use back to ours 

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:28.949
 students are now building up 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.629
 much longer than an hour on 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.169
 the fastest battery was not 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.969
 Ahead 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.909
 also the pages dynamo is now 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:39.680
 Wired has the hardest job 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:42.300
 tobias with his loading dynamo 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.009
 because I had to do it was difficult 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.469
 already installed and I believe it is 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.340
 very important in which direction this is 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.319
 we went back to plant but went 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.900
 relatively fix and now I'm straight 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.270
 doing the wiring to the creates 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.210
 not so easy 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.529
 Ten minutes, but want that 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.400
 battery is not ready for 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:04.590
 the samples and also the name dynamo 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.960
 lights up perfectly 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:12.180
 Great advice is a lot of time 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.099
 plan if you actually the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.509
 would like to completely rebuild the lighting system 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.479
 the biggest pitfalls at 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.279
 Assemble these were the instructions 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.860
 yours was not very meaningful 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:24.539
 was which parts now in which 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.759
 order belong together so that 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.409
 finally holds well and a bit 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.599
 fumble a little bit think comes 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.029
 also to the result the summary 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.919
 our test the best solution 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:38.039
 is a hub dynamo with a led 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.289
 light with at least 25 lux of this 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.210
 remodeling is more than 100 euro but 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.770
 very expensive 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.810
 If you only have a bit of riding a bicycle, you too 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.860
 with a high quality 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.419
 battery powered light set from 40 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.279
 euro reasonably safe by the 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.189
 Autumn of the hooks are allowed 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.349
 Do not worry though 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:57.379
 at least at the potsdamer police on 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:01.139
 to hope for generosity 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:03.610
 my attitude is this that i am very 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.400
 Satisfied if a bike at all 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.710
 light does not matter if this is now 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.020
 is battery operated or via dynamo 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.310
 the main thing is because of it 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.310
 and most importantly the light works
