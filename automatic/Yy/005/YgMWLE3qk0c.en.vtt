about<00:02:25.030> how<00:02:25.390> Wrangler<00:02:25.870> develops<00:02:26.290> into<00:02:26.440> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
about how Wrangler develops into the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.199 
about how Wrangler develops into the
future<00:02:26.920> there<00:02:27.310> are<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.459> few<00:02:27.640> things<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.120> we

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
future there are a few things that we

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.180 
future there are a few things that we
get<00:02:28.390> constant<00:02:28.870> feedback<00:02:29.080> on<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:29.890> diesel

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
get constant feedback on one is diesel

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.550 
get constant feedback on one is diesel
one<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:30.970> pick<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.540> obviously<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.140> need<00:02:32.500> to

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
one is pick up and obviously you need to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.440 
one is pick up and obviously you need to
be<00:02:32.680> careful<00:02:33.070> when<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.310> take<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.790> vehicle<00:02:34.420> like

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
be careful when you take a vehicle like

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.510 
be careful when you take a vehicle like
wrangler<00:02:34.959> for<00:02:35.110> its<00:02:35.230> next<00:02:35.380> generation<00:02:35.520> but

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
wrangler for its next generation but

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.949 
wrangler for its next generation but
facturing<00:02:36.940> those<00:02:37.180> things<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
facturing those things in and the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.630 
facturing those things in and the
feedback<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.350> we've<00:02:38.590> had<00:02:38.740> right<00:02:39.040> now<00:02:39.370> when

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
feedback that we've had right now when

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.280 
feedback that we've had right now when
we're<00:02:39.790> at<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.030> early<00:02:40.300> stages<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.840> thinking

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
we're at the early stages of thinking

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.990 
we're at the early stages of thinking
about<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.620> next<00:02:41.800> rank<00:02:42.100> was<00:02:42.310> very<00:02:42.489> important

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
about the next rank was very important

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.120 
about the next rank was very important
because<00:02:43.120> then<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:44.080> can<00:02:44.320> think<00:02:44.530> about<00:02:44.860> how

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
because then we can think about how

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.949 
because then we can think about how
we've<00:02:45.310> designed<00:02:45.430> those<00:02:45.940> things<00:02:46.239> maybe<00:02:46.450> into

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
we've designed those things maybe into

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.750 
we've designed those things maybe into
that<00:02:47.110> vehicle<00:02:47.260> program<00:02:47.680> so<00:02:48.220> again<00:02:48.610> we're

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
that vehicle program so again we're

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.260 
that vehicle program so again we're
expected<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.270> in<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.510> feedback<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:50.050> year
