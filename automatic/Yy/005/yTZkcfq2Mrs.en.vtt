00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
what goes on with the other 40 plus

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.850 
what goes on with the other 40 plus
teams<00:02:21.640> that<00:02:21.880> are<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.090> at<00:02:22.209> NC<00:02:22.450> 2<00:02:22.600> a's<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.050> the

teams that are there at NC 2 a's and the
one<00:02:24.040> thing<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.250> we're<00:02:24.520> in<00:02:24.640> control<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.540> is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
one thing that we're in control of is is

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.260 
one thing that we're in control of is is
what<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.470> do<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.980> how<00:02:27.190> we<00:02:27.250> move<00:02:27.520> is<00:02:27.730> how<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:27.940> act
