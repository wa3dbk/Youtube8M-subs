have a mad nine right there that is

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.530 
have a mad nine right there that is
drilled<00:01:31.780> into<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.200> tank<00:01:32.470> here<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.100> here<00:01:33.820> this

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
drilled into the tank here and here this

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.290 
drilled into the tank here and here this
is<00:01:34.720> called<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.050> closed<00:01:35.410> loop<00:01:35.770> most<00:01:36.760> people

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
is called the closed loop most people

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.720 
is called the closed loop most people
build<00:01:37.720> these<00:01:37.930> clothes<00:01:38.290> loops<00:01:38.620> minus<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.460> t

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
in well we have utilized a closed loop

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.400 
in well we have utilized a closed loop
into<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:51.420> closed<00:01:52.420> loop<00:01:52.630> /<00:01:53.850> return<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:55.660> the<00:01:56.110> sump

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
into a closed loop / return to the sump

here I can increase the pressure in the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.600 
here I can increase the pressure in the
tank<00:02:02.380> or<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:03.730> can<00:02:04.440> increase<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.860> amount<00:02:06.550> of

pressure about that fast I could

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.040 
pressure about that fast I could
increase<00:05:11.919> that<00:05:12.249> if<00:05:12.639> I<00:05:13.210> want<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:13.569> waves<00:05:13.779> to

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
increase that if I want the waves to

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.089 
increase that if I want the waves to
happen<00:05:14.379> a<00:05:14.439> little<00:05:14.589> bit<00:05:14.800> faster<00:05:15.419> but<00:05:16.710> all<00:05:17.710> all

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
happen a little bit faster but all all

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.339 
happen a little bit faster but all all
guys<00:05:18.339> I<00:05:18.669> am<00:05:18.819> super<00:05:19.210> pumped<00:05:19.419> I've<00:05:19.810> never<00:05:20.199> seen

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
guys I am super pumped I've never seen

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.700 
guys I am super pumped I've never seen
this<00:05:20.620> done<00:05:20.979> before<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:22.960> think<00:05:23.499> it's<00:05:23.589> a<00:05:23.680> great

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
this done before I think it's a great

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.379 
this done before I think it's a great
idea<00:05:24.039> for<00:05:24.669> people<00:05:25.180> who<00:05:27.029> want<00:05:28.029> to<00:05:28.180> build<00:05:28.270> the

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
idea for people who want to build the

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.450 
idea for people who want to build the
tank<00:05:28.659> like<00:05:28.960> this<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.680> don't<00:05:29.860> have<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.129> option

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
tank like this and don't have the option

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.689 
tank like this and don't have the option
of<00:05:30.550> putting<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.849> sunk<00:05:31.089> below<00:05:31.439> I<00:05:32.439> mean<00:05:33.430> this<00:05:33.639> is

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
of putting a sunk below I mean this is

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.200 
of putting a sunk below I mean this is
just<00:05:33.909> it's<00:05:34.779> amazing<00:05:35.199> guys<00:05:35.729> I'm<00:05:36.729> not<00:05:36.909> trying<00:05:37.060> to

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
just it's amazing guys I'm not trying to

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.629 
just it's amazing guys I'm not trying to
boast<00:05:37.479> or<00:05:37.779> anything<00:05:37.810> like<00:05:38.169> that<00:05:38.319> but<00:05:38.800> this

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
boast or anything like that but this

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.409 
boast or anything like that but this
works<00:05:40.089> so<00:05:40.839> well<00:05:41.259> the<00:05:42.219> amount<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:42.610> flow<00:05:42.909> that

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
works so well the amount of flow that

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.709 
works so well the amount of flow that
comes<00:05:43.689> out<00:05:43.839> of<00:05:43.870> that<00:05:44.020> pipe<00:05:44.379> is<00:05:44.710> just<00:05:45.719> it's

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
comes out of that pipe is just it's

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:51.450 
comes out of that pipe is just it's
ridiculous<00:05:47.379> it<00:05:47.740> actually<00:05:48.580> is<00:05:49.710> probably<00:05:50.710> not

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
ridiculous it actually is probably not

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.029 
ridiculous it actually is probably not
as<00:05:51.669> high<00:05:51.939> velocity<00:05:52.899> as<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.020> mag<00:05:53.289> nine<00:05:53.560> but

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
as high velocity as a mag nine but

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.040 
as high velocity as a mag nine but
attention<00:05:54.879> the<00:05:54.969> quarter<00:05:55.360> so<00:05:55.599> it's<00:05:55.779> probably

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
attention the quarter so it's probably

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.290 
attention the quarter so it's probably
right<00:05:56.289> around<00:05:56.409> nine<00:05:57.370> hundred<00:05:57.849> gallons<00:05:58.210> an

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
right around nine hundred gallons an

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.659 
right around nine hundred gallons an
hour<00:05:58.419> and<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:02.139> probably<00:06:02.469> comes<00:06:02.740> out<00:06:03.009> less<00:06:03.399> than

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
hour and it probably comes out less than

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.980 
hour and it probably comes out less than
I<00:06:03.879> don't<00:06:04.330> know<00:06:04.449> 30<00:06:04.870> seconds<00:06:05.379> you<00:06:05.469> guys<00:06:05.649> saw<00:06:05.969> so
