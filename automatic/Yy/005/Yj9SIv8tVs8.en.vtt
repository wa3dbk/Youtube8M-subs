00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
field is we have natural support angles

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.309 
field is we have natural support angles
at<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.989> 4-3-3<00:02:39.569> some<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.720> weaknesses<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
at a 4-3-3 some of the weaknesses of the

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.030 
at a 4-3-3 some of the weaknesses of the
4-3-3

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
4-3-3

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.920 
4-3-3
and<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:42.909> is<00:02:43.030> where<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.269> have<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.510> decide<00:02:43.780> as

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
and this is where you have to decide as

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.830 
and this is where you have to decide as
a<00:02:43.989> coach<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.970> could<00:02:45.970> potentially<00:02:46.690> be

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
a coach you could potentially be

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.050 
a coach you could potentially be
defending<00:02:47.260> with<00:02:47.379> only<00:02:47.590> seven<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.760> decide

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
defending with only seven if you decide

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.880 
defending with only seven if you decide
to<00:02:49.180> leave<00:02:49.269> three<00:02:49.569> up<00:02:49.690> top<00:02:49.900> then<00:02:50.620> you've<00:02:50.799> only

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
to leave three up top then you've only

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.880 
to leave three up top then you've only
got<00:02:51.160> three<00:02:51.489> midfield<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.450> four<00:02:52.810> defenders<00:02:53.319> so

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
got three midfield and four defenders so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:54.960 
got three midfield and four defenders so
when<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.129> big<00:02:54.280> problems<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.609> have<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.819> deal

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
when the big problems you have to deal

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.960 
when the big problems you have to deal
with<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.239> 4-3-3<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.989> how<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.230> can<00:02:56.379> defend

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
with in a 4-3-3 is how you can defend

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.020 
with in a 4-3-3 is how you can defend
these<00:02:57.970> spaces<00:02:58.329> right<00:02:58.660> here<00:02:59.730> okay<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:00.909> you

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
these spaces right here okay if you

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.849 
these spaces right here okay if you
decide<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:01.480> leave<00:03:01.629> your<00:03:01.810> three<00:03:02.109> forwards<00:03:02.590> up

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
decide to leave your three forwards up

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.550 
decide to leave your three forwards up
top<00:03:03.220> it's<00:03:04.030> pretty<00:03:04.329> hard<00:03:04.629> to<00:03:04.690> do<00:03:04.870> high<00:03:05.079> pressing

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
top it's pretty hard to do high pressing

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.960 
top it's pretty hard to do high pressing
because<00:03:05.890> you<00:03:06.069> don't<00:03:06.250> want<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.519> full<00:03:06.760> backs

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
because you don't want your full backs

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.449 
because you don't want your full backs
disconnected<00:03:07.569> from<00:03:07.629> your<00:03:07.810> back<00:03:07.930> for<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:08.950> high

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
disconnected from your back for so high

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.099 
disconnected from your back for so high
pressing<00:03:09.879> up<00:03:10.000> here<00:03:10.209> dealing<00:03:10.510> with<00:03:10.629> this<00:03:10.720> space

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
pressing up here dealing with this space

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.140 
pressing up here dealing with this space
before<00:03:11.739> bars<00:03:12.099> gonna<00:03:12.190> have<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.489> come<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.670> good<00:03:12.849> 20

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
before bars gonna have to come a good 20

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.449 
before bars gonna have to come a good 20
yards<00:03:13.450> gets<00:03:13.690> disconnected<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.310> big

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
yards gets disconnected it's a big

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.210 
yards gets disconnected it's a big
disadvantage<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.870> how<00:03:17.470> we<00:03:17.530> deal<00:03:17.799> with<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:18.099> we

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
disadvantage so how we deal with that we

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.890 
disadvantage so how we deal with that we
try<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.430> stay<00:03:18.609> nice<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.030> compact<00:03:19.389> as<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.599> unit

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
try and stay nice and compact as a unit

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.920 
try and stay nice and compact as a unit
it's<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.530> good<00:03:20.650> midfield<00:03:21.040> pressing<00:03:21.430> system

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
it's a good midfield pressing system

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.080 
it's a good midfield pressing system
possibly<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.230> balls<00:03:23.440> over<00:03:23.590> here<00:03:23.769> we<00:03:24.760> may<00:03:24.910> have

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
possibly the balls over here we may have

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.490 
possibly the balls over here we may have
to<00:03:25.209> have<00:03:25.299> one<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.569> our<00:03:25.630> tacking<00:03:25.989> appeals<00:03:26.290> come

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
to have one of our tacking appeals come

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.440 
to have one of our tacking appeals come
across<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.459> keep<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.760> ball<00:03:27.910> on<00:03:28.000> this<00:03:28.120> side<00:03:28.359> of

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
across and keep the ball on this side of

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.150 
across and keep the ball on this side of
the<00:03:28.540> field<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:29.380> that's<00:03:29.560> how<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:29.799> deal<00:03:29.950> with<00:03:30.099> a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
the field so that's how we deal with a

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.369 
the field so that's how we deal with a
space<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.669> a<00:03:31.180> 4-3-3<00:03:31.629> that's<00:03:31.959> one<00:03:32.169> of<00:03:32.260> the

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
space in a 4-3-3 that's one of the

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.920 
space in a 4-3-3 that's one of the
certificates<00:03:33.160> significant<00:03:33.639> weaknesses<00:03:34.030> and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
certificates significant weaknesses and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.030 
certificates significant weaknesses and
other<00:03:35.079> weaknesses<00:03:35.530> if<00:03:35.620> you're<00:03:35.739> not<00:03:35.829> careful

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
other weaknesses if you're not careful

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.309 
other weaknesses if you're not careful
is<00:03:36.400> playing<00:03:36.639> with<00:03:36.760> three<00:03:36.970> up<00:03:37.090> front<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:38.079> three

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
is playing with three up front the three

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.460 
is playing with three up front the three
four<00:03:38.590> players<00:03:38.859> can<00:03:39.069> be<00:03:39.220> very<00:03:39.400> static<00:03:40.379> so<00:03:41.379> if

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
four players can be very static so if

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.599 
four players can be very static so if
you're<00:03:41.560> not<00:03:41.650> careful<00:03:41.889> you're<00:03:42.220> playing<00:03:42.430> with

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
you're not careful you're playing with

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.759 
you're not careful you're playing with
one<00:03:42.790> more<00:03:42.970> forward<00:03:43.510> with<00:03:44.139> his<00:03:44.260> back<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.620> goal

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
one more forward with his back to goal

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.890 
one more forward with his back to goal
so<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.549> vertical<00:03:45.819> pass<00:03:46.299> going<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:46.720> feet<00:03:46.870> of

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
so a vertical pass going to the feet of

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.659 
so a vertical pass going to the feet of
the<00:03:47.049> center<00:03:47.290> forward<00:03:47.650> you've<00:03:48.099> got<00:03:48.250> no<00:03:48.400> three

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
the center forward you've got no three

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.879 
the center forward you've got no three
players<00:03:48.970> potentially<00:03:49.510> facing<00:03:50.169> away<00:03:50.530> from<00:03:50.709> the

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
players potentially facing away from the

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.250 
players potentially facing away from the
goal<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:52.480> that's<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.900> could<00:03:53.139> be<00:03:53.230> a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
goal so that's that could be a

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.319 
goal so that's that could be a
significant<00:03:53.829> weakness<00:03:53.919> and<00:03:54.849> all<00:03:55.000> sorts

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
significant weakness and all sorts

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.089 
significant weakness and all sorts
sentences<00:03:55.959> sometimes<00:03:56.379> if<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.650> give<00:03:56.799> players

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
sentences sometimes if you give players

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.270 
sentences sometimes if you give players
positions<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:58.510> can<00:03:58.720> become<00:03:58.989> very<00:03:59.019> static<00:03:59.650> so

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
positions it can become very static so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.000 
positions it can become very static so
you've<00:04:00.430> got<00:04:00.639> winger<00:04:01.269> winger<00:04:01.959> center<00:04:02.590> forward

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
you've got winger winger center forward

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.069 
you've got winger winger center forward
well<00:04:03.579> obviously<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.329> you<00:04:04.629> know<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:04.959> have

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
well obviously you you know if you have

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.180 
well obviously you you know if you have
a<00:04:05.109> winger<00:04:05.379> over<00:04:05.620> here<00:04:05.769> we've<00:04:05.889> only<00:04:06.010> got<00:04:06.160> one

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
a winger over here we've only got one

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.879 
a winger over here we've only got one
player<00:04:06.579> in<00:04:06.699> the<00:04:06.730> box<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.109> weakness<00:04:08.319> so

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
player in the box this is a weakness so

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.259 
player in the box this is a weakness so
it's<00:04:09.040> critical<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.459> we<00:04:09.699> have<00:04:09.760> an<00:04:09.879> attacking

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
it's critical that we have an attacking

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.030 
it's critical that we have an attacking
midfield<00:04:10.599> player<00:04:10.780> now<00:04:10.989> let's<00:04:11.590> make<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.859> box

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040
