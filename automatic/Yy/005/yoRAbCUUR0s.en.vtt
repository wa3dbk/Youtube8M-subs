00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello hello here is mix again from 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.400
 bio cook barbecue season open the weather 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.529
 not so nice is what they show in the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.910
 studio we make potato salad there 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.370
 many varieties made naturally 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.880
 Dominatrix potato salad with a fresh 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.949
 Cucumber really holds for hot summer days 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.310
 perfect for the wiener schnitzel underneath 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.310
 others 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.730
 What do we need for it except the cucumber 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.140
 which we have already shown we need 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.440
 a vegetable stock that we have ever 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.440
 recognized 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.140
 onion no matter what color parsley 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.780
 Now in the spring, there is beautiful 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.390
 above garden very intense it is great 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.820
 naturally salt pepper crisp neutral 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.800
 rapeseed or sunflower oil bit pleased 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.930
 of course, potatoes festkochende 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.379
 potato that is with linda but goes 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.510
 and belana hansa selena what is there 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.760
 But that's it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:09.870
 We start with the marinade first 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.870
 for some mustard comes a bowl 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.120
 mÃ¼hle brÃ¼hl on like to be still warm 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.120
 cooking does not have to be anymore but now 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.080
 pepper from the grinder 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.030
 I have a very rough attitude 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:43.600
 Everyone's thing you can not 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:45.850
 so marx and then that looks a lot of oil now 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.220
 but the mayonnaise salad for 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.270
 example, much weather still needs to be there 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.840
 yes, there is a little bit of something in it 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:02:00.010
 have to play a bit high quality 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:01.360
 we cut oil into the basic marinade 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.860
 now our normal 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.740
 boiled potatoes and quite normal 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.420
 boiled potatoes cook pellets 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.420
 leave and einstein 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.019
 that lasts at the moment because we click 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.760
 let's go away so not finished so 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.129
 stir well 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.739
 so you can also a day before 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.319
 do more in their two hours 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.950
 In any case, next to the potatoes 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.650
 not recording okay we'll do it now 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.069
 with the fresh things on 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.639
 onions 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:39.349
 quite normal I always like to take 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.359
 red i like you from the taste 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.499
 Of course , they are also colored 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.459
 is irritating points 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:50.629
 generously peeled that I take afterwards 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.340
 by the way , also finds out by the way 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.819
 that they are wonderful too 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.069
 Wash vegetable stock well and 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.340
 then you just do not need it 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.340
 throw away 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.310
 if you decide to cut yourself decisively 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.269
 So wanted to search times videos search 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.159
 want there's also from me a few 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:20.049
 and playlist tips and tricks how to 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.159
 vegetables onions intersects among others 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.540
 a little bit better now 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.540
 just now it has fallen apart 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:38.349
 It is also enough for the typical 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.790
 wiener potato salad the fresh cucumbers 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.530
 some stand and corer 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.409
 but these are usually used as her in 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.470
 old recipes recipes where the bowls are still 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.459
 were bitter is one the kernels, the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.310
 you really do not need to know 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.310
 simply cut new groups 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.870
 is cut 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:27.680
 if you google, of course 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:31.720
 make and herbal something bigger 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.720
 diameter must not of course be so great 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.560
 and do not chop wildly 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.780
 I am a friend of sample herbs 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.710
 they are simply more intense in taste 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.199
 and not just do not say so 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.800
 who did it quite early now 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.960
 press or express it so you can 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.470
 dry deadline the us league crash net 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.360
 really gross mischief the whole 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.300
 fold 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.210
 and quite honestly that is although I feel 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.340
 I wish you please down below runs 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.200
 Old German potato salad on this 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.650
 classic with mayonnaise and I have 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.990
 of course, forget what is a practitioner 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.560
 incessantly can also be a white wine vinegar 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:25.550
 it could also be a lemon 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.889
 to add something and here and there 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.360
 finished that happens to me too 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.360
 25 years are just like that
