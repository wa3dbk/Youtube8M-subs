00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.630
 Chapter 5 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.600
 in fact it is reported that there is fornication 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.389
 between you and such fornication as ni 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.990
 even there among the nations that true 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.050
 man has his father's wife 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.210
 and you are bloated and I do not know 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.099
 regretted rather to be 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.970
 removed from among you man 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:28.359
 who committed this fact 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.060
 I for my part although absent in body 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.360
 more present in spirit certainly 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.390
 already judged as if he were present at 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.120
 man who has acted in that way 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.610
 that in the name of our Lord Jesus 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.590
 being you also gathered my 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.070
 spirit with the power of our lord 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.860
 jesus surrender to such man satan 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.899
 for the destruction of the flesh in order to 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.200
 that the spirit be saved in the day 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.540
 of the lord 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.420
 it is not excellent the reason for its 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.149
 boasting 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.150
 do not you know that a little bit of yeast 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.030
 makes all the dough ferment 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.610
 remove the old yeast to be 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.810
 you a new mass as they are 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.700
 free of ferment because actually 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.100
 Christ our Easter has been 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.250
 sacrificed 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.590
 therefore we keep the party not 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.830
 with old yeast or with yeast 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.720
 evil of iniquity but with cakes not 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.210
 fermented of sincerity and truth 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 In my letter I wrote to them that they would stop 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.070
 mingle in the company of fornicators 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.110
 not wanting to say entirely with the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.000
 fornicators of this world or the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.880
 greedy people and people who practice 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.800
 extortion or idol back otherwise 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.410
 you really should get out 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.660
 of the world more now I am 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.910
 writing that they stop mixing in the 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.020
 company of anyone who calling their 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:02.200
 brother is a fornicator , or covetous , or 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.500
 insulting or drunken idolater or that 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.870
 practice extortion not even eating 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.050
 with such a man 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:14.290
 Well, what do I have to do with judging 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.990
 those outside do not judge those of 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.020
 in while God judges those of 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.310
 outside 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.210
 remove the wicked man from among 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.210
 yourselves
