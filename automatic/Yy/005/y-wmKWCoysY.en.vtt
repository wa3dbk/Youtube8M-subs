00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.780 

in<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.230> video<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.740> want<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.010> demonstrate<00:00:02.220> the

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
in this video I want to demonstrate the

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.760 
in this video I want to demonstrate the
auto<00:00:03.149> platform<00:00:03.810> function<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.440> model

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
auto platform function of model

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.340 
auto platform function of model
converter<00:00:05.250> X<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.779> can<00:00:06.899> see<00:00:06.960> I've

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
converter X so as you can see I've

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.790 
converter X so as you can see I've
loaded<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.919> building<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.610> we<00:00:09.120> want<00:00:09.330> to

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
loaded a building and we want to

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.200 
loaded a building and we want to
automatically<00:00:10.800> add<00:00:11.010> platforms<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.969> roofs

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
automatically add platforms to the roofs

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.820 
automatically add platforms to the roofs
of<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.570> building<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.469> land<00:00:13.679> on

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
of this building so that you can land on

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.240 
of this building so that you can land on
it<00:00:14.480> this<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.690> relatively<00:00:16.500> small<00:00:16.650> restaurant

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
it this is a relatively small restaurant

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.400 
it this is a relatively small restaurant
so<00:00:17.550> probably<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.630> building<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.289> would

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
so probably not a building you would

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320 
so probably not a building you would
land<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.189> with<00:00:20.460> your<00:00:20.609> helicopter<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.180> real

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
land on with your helicopter in real

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.429 
land on with your helicopter in real
life<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.109> too<00:00:22.260> demonstrative

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
life but it's just too demonstrative

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.550 
life but it's just too demonstrative
purposes<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> let's<00:00:24.300> start<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.960> attached

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
purposes so let's start the attached

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.560 
purposes so let's start the attached
object<00:00:26.070> editor<00:00:26.810> button<00:00:27.810> over<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.570> then

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
object editor button over here and then

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.049 
object editor button over here and then
in<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:30.929> dialog<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:32.070> select<00:00:32.309> auto

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
in this dialog you can select auto

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.590 
in this dialog you can select auto
platform<00:00:33.750> which<00:00:34.200> will<00:00:34.380> bring<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:36.059> dialog

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
platform which will bring up this dialog

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
platform which will bring up this dialog
here<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:37.890> specify<00:00:38.160> two<00:00:38.640> options

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
here and you can now specify two options

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.160 
here and you can now specify two options
the<00:00:39.840> first<00:00:39.870> one<00:00:40.700> specifies<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.149> normal<00:00:42.960> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the first one specifies the normal of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.650 
the first one specifies the normal of
the<00:00:43.489> polygons<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.640> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> make<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> platform

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
the polygons you want to make a platform

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
the polygons you want to make a platform
from<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> default<00:00:48.629> value<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.200> 1<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
from if it's the default value of 1 that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.279 
from if it's the default value of 1 that
means<00:00:49.950> only<00:00:50.280> flat<00:00:51.030> roofs<00:00:51.510> will<00:00:51.870> be<00:00:52.050> turned

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
means only flat roofs will be turned

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.290 
means only flat roofs will be turned
into<00:00:52.440> platform<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.280> completely<00:00:53.699> flat<00:00:54.059> roofs

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
into platform so completely flat roofs

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
into platform so completely flat roofs
roof<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.620> roof<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.399> sloped

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
roof if the roof is a little bit sloped

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.590 
roof if the roof is a little bit sloped
it<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.809> turned<00:00:58.109> into<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.440> platform

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
it will not be turned into a platform

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.650 
it will not be turned into a platform
the<00:01:00.600> second<00:01:01.199> option<00:01:01.590> allows<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.129> filter

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
the second option allows you to filter

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.600 
the second option allows you to filter
based<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:03.870> material<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.159> look<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.460> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
based on material if we look at this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.520 
based on material if we look at this
object<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.420> example<00:01:06.510> there's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.140> chimney

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
object for example there's a chimney

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.760 
object for example there's a chimney
over<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.430> also<00:01:08.670> has<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.350> flat<00:01:10.350> polygon

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
over here which also has a flat polygon

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.219 
over here which also has a flat polygon
at<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> top<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.479> advertisement

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
at the top or here the the advertisement

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.399 
at the top or here the the advertisement
of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> building<00:01:13.799> also<00:01:14.310> has<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.869> flat<00:01:15.869> yeah

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of the building also has a flat yeah

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
of the building also has a flat yeah
sort<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.799> roof<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.240> want<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> include

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
sort of roof we don't want to include

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.090 
sort of roof we don't want to include
those<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.799> hurt<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
those because that will hurt the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.640 
those because that will hurt the
performance<00:01:20.640> too<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> can't<00:01:21.990> land

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
performance too much and you can't land

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.520 
performance too much and you can't land
on<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:22.979> anyway<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.299> select<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.990> material

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
on them anyway so we select the material

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.710 
on them anyway so we select the material
of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> roof<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.420> press

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of the roof here and then if we press

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.069 
of the roof here and then if we press
run<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.700> nothing<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.630> first

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
run you see nothing because we first

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.840 
run you see nothing because we first

as<00:01:36.180> well<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.130> roof<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
as well and as you see now the roof is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.810 
as well and as you see now the roof is
covered<00:01:39.689> red<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> selected<00:01:41.250> yellow<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
covered red or a selected yellow to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.749 
covered red or a selected yellow to
indicate<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.540> there's<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.840> platform<00:01:43.290> moment

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
indicate that there's a platform moment

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.370 
indicate that there's a platform moment
let<00:01:44.759> me<00:01:44.939> remove<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.509> platform<00:01:45.810> quickly

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
let me remove this platform quickly

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
let me remove this platform quickly
again<00:01:46.970> then<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.119> will<00:01:48.649> rerun<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.040> auto

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
again then we will rerun the auto

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.289 
again then we will rerun the auto
platform<00:01:51.420> function<00:01:51.869> again<00:01:52.680> at<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.729> time<00:01:53.790> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
platform function again at this time I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.410 
platform function again at this time I
will<00:01:55.020> choose<00:01:55.200> an<00:01:55.409> lower<00:01:55.950> value<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.520> normal

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
will choose an lower value for normal

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
will choose an lower value for normal
like<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> said<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.710> means<00:01:59.189> only<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> flat

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
like I said one means only the flat

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.359 
like I said one means only the flat
roofs<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.570> lower<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:02.189> more

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
roofs the lower you make it the more

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.700
