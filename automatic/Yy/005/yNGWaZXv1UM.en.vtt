 do not take this because I think of asturias from his whereabouts of him 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.579
 is losing something that happens in day that are the bears 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.599
 the best we can do is to recover them all 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.849
 - the state project 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.370
 he has been in him on that note from the Iranian fars agency 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.340
 we are preparing so that they can find their first fruits after 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.960
 to win with chestnuts and cherries 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.580
 delegates in the ways a 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.730
 the financial entity explains repucci the 20 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.190
 in Spain the sales of the facebook page 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.690
 another way they are giving 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 of not planting Palestinian mintur trees about three years 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.350
 since we started this project we have planted more than 350 thousand trees 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.330
 fruit trees along the entire Cantabrian mountain range 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.060
 the project even more dull -0 2 has a double objective on the one hand 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.080
 plant fruit trees of curious fruits feed brown bear and in addition 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.600
 contribute to decrease atmospheric 0 2 concentrations is 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.090
 responsible for climate change 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.740
 the truth that the population holdings of the brown bear is very good at present 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.130
 you have an estimated number of about 175 sos in what is all the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.560
 Cantabrian mountain range 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.229
 and year after year we see how more and more are the bears with offspring that we have 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.210
 in these areas 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.600
 I have felt pretty good on a personal level, they are not from the same author 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.820
 let's say of the idea 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.510
 It has been my children who not only give themselves early to stop the money 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.810
 little what is natural is there that tomorrow worry 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749
 like us when the elderly for it
