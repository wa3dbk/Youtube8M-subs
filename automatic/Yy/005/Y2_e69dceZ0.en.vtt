00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 We do not make snails we do 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.710
 Only noble animals say his agent is mine 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.330
 we do everything we had 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.340
 I would have mine earlier 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 However, the clause in the contract was agreed 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.610
 Now that's over, now I'll take it 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.610
 everything is just about every animal 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:28.259
 really everything will happen here 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.259
 recorded oh yes and what about it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.370
 it was natural for us as us 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.170
 then the first patterns on the film 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.809
 have seen each other at first 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.920
 In case we thought we were playing where you were 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.019
 First of all , I'm the one 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.140
 Adolescent hero and he the girl 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.989
 and that would have been first and then 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.550
 came there yes and I think that is 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.110
 Idea was just said that if 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.820
 you already have two such good actors 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.980
 then we want to challenge us and 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.660
 you take something where you can not get it 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.720
 So no one would think so 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.369
 I talk to a fat snail and it 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.080
 was also much has a lot of power 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.880
 cost me to imagine that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.030
 to be too thick slimy 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.850
 it 's against the naked to be naked 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.950
 Therefore, it has come in 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.179
 yes we are cast for both snails 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.679
 and then the director has 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.679
 Decided who is which snail 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.770
 yes he said as I said 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.900
 he implied cracked 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.000
 even increased for 30 to 40 years 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.740
 one with an eye on this role and me 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.080
 just have the evenings in my house 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.720
 and that was my best 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.990
 Day at very slow moving for easy 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:57.960
 many weeks yet played long when the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.960
 the snails eye 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.910
 He always has to be in between 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.619
 Remember what age group is 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.000
 just thinking and if we have that now 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.650
 how we have together 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.140
 made little britain and such 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.030
 stories have themselves over there 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.590
 90-year-old voice over us far 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.700
 get harder lyrics but that was 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.680
 just for another age group 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.290
 That's why you have to be his 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
 personal preferences small moment 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.100
 take back and work with what 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.410
 one has and for the age group find 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.090
 me that perfectly yes it is indeed 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.520
 nice if sven something is just what 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.290
 So all works where you just once 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.550
 with the whole family because otherwise 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.350
 also stupid that you own children 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.700
 and so can only say yes yes that 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.560
 but we must do it by not 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.030
 See what that means, he explains 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 that I could only see that when we did 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.140
 have been around in the old house for a long time and it 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.690
 was indeed this I think this little 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.160
 faux pas at the first silence 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.450
 Keinohrhasen that only from 6 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.250
 was released and many mothers 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.650
 because of the deadly name of hers 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.270
 Girl must explain what a blow 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.110
 that means apple will not 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.110
 I'll say something
