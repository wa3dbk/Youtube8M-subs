pass<00:07:27.290> inside<00:07:28.720> all<00:07:29.720> right<00:07:29.870> so<00:07:30.080> I<00:07:30.140> definitely

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.590 
pass inside all right so I definitely

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.380 
pass inside all right so I definitely
felt<00:07:30.800> that<00:07:30.890> defensive<00:07:31.490> objective

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.390

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.960 
felt that defensive objective
I<00:07:32.590> think<00:07:33.590> drew<00:07:33.800> had<00:07:33.950> like<00:07:34.130> 15<00:07:34.550> points<00:07:34.880> or

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970 
I think drew had like 15 points or

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.660 
I think drew had like 15 points or
