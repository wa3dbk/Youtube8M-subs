00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.940
 hello friends, well, today I want to catch 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.730
 some willow branches to make a for 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.930
 make a video of how to make a root 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.310
 tea with willow leaves I have here this 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.960
 willow and we're going to cut some branches 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.960
 and then let us take home 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.340
 well, we are counting 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 and it is already 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:53.210
 well this will be enough because 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.210
 I need nothing more then 200 grams 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.109
 Well, we have the willow leaves here 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.510
 we have already separated from the branches 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.870
 I left a few to see how it 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.040
 but it's good, they're all here 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.170
 well, clean 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.820
 well this is grabbed from here 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.490
 from behind 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.490
 and against but it is cleaning 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.840
 It is very simple 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.390
 this is a weeping partner 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.160
 Well, it's already 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.469
 now let's take half because in 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.250
 this casserole with water here I've already put 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:42.369
 water I have put two and a half liters 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.479
 then this is for about 5 liters 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.479
 then we throw half nothing 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.180
 and this is why we reserve it for 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.090
 to make another 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.570
 well now this case we are going to put 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.810
 the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.780
 in the game 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.470
 and that is boiling for 15 or 20 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.290
 minutes on medium heat and then once 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.609
 that has finished boiling 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:20.490
 we cover it with a cloth and 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:24.340
 let it sit for 10 or 12 hours 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.610
 well then after being boiling 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.370
 the willow leaves as a quarter of 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.920
 hour 15 minutes then let's remove the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.160
 leaves that are no longer useful for 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.190
 nothing 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.120
 and we are going to leave only what is the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.120
 infusion in the liquid 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.910
 Well, now we've finished 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:14.220
 to remove remove the bag 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.860
 and what we are going to do now is to throw them out 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.860
 to this this plastic bottle 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.560
 and we are going to strain it 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.290
 Well as you can see is already is already 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.420
 fill the bottle 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.069
 we have a bit left over because, as they were 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.540
 two and a half liters for some fit now 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.440
 As you can see, it has changed color to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.560
 make an infusion 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.350
 and well we are going to put a label 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.640
 to have it identified, we do not 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.230
 we put together and we will keep it in the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.790
 because in the fridge until you 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.980
 let's go use 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.239
 I'm going to use it right away because I'm going to 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.430
 make some pink cuttings root 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.750
 willow tea 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.790
 and the refrigerator 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.639
 Well that simple and easy has 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.209
 been doing it 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.739
 I advise you if you have cuttings and you want 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.099
 to do is that you do it because it is 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.199
 very easy and it is very effective well 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:31.520
