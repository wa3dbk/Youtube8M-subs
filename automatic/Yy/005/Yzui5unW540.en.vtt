00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
various fields come in and talk to us

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.989 
various fields come in and talk to us
about<00:01:57.850> their<00:01:58.029> topics<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:58.539> expertise<00:01:59.079> and<00:01:59.380> so<00:01:59.920> I

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
about their topics of expertise and so I

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.190 
about their topics of expertise and so I
had<00:02:00.999> a<00:02:01.029> lot<00:02:01.270> of<00:02:01.299> knowledge<00:02:01.539> about<00:02:01.869> some<00:02:02.079> of

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
had a lot of knowledge about some of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.899 
had a lot of knowledge about some of
those<00:02:02.349> and<00:02:02.770> very<00:02:03.099> little<00:02:03.310> knowledge<00:02:03.579> about

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
those and very little knowledge about

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.459 
those and very little knowledge about
other<00:02:04.090> topics<00:02:04.359> and<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:05.020> thought<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.349> was

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
other topics and I thought that was

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.499 
other topics and I thought that was
really<00:02:05.649> great<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.189> work<00:02:06.369> with<00:02:06.579> peers<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.119> to

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
really great to work with peers and to

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.210 
really great to work with peers and to
work<00:02:07.630> with<00:02:07.779> faculty<00:02:07.959> who<00:02:08.440> were<00:02:08.560> dedicated<00:02:09.130> to

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
work with faculty who were dedicated to

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.559 
work with faculty who were dedicated to
some<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.580> most<00:02:09.759> important<00:02:10.240> issues<00:02:10.539> that

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
some of the most important issues that

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.059 
some of the most important issues that
we're<00:02:10.899> facing<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.319> our<00:02:11.410> healthcare<00:02:11.620> system

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
we're facing in our healthcare system

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.310 
we're facing in our healthcare system
today<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.490> know<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.390> lessons<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.020> we

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
today I know that the lessons that we

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.810 
today I know that the lessons that we
learned<00:02:14.560> in<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.860> healthcare<00:02:15.100> disparities

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
learned in the healthcare disparities

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.730 
learned in the healthcare disparities
course<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.330> stayed<00:02:16.630> with<00:02:16.900> me<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.620> my

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
course have stayed with me and my

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.890 
course have stayed with me and my
classmates<00:02:18.310> throughout<00:02:19.060> our

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
classmates throughout our

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.309 
classmates throughout our
years<00:02:20.379> here<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.250> think<00:02:21.879> what<00:02:22.030> sets<00:02:22.269> us<00:02:22.480> apart<00:02:22.689> in

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
years here I think what sets us apart in

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.899 
years here I think what sets us apart in
the<00:02:23.470> health<00:02:23.650> asperities<00:02:24.159> course<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.790> we

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
the health asperities course is that we

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.960 
the health asperities course is that we
do<00:02:25.120> speak<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.659> cultural<00:02:26.110> competency<00:02:26.829> but<00:02:27.790> then

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
do speak on cultural competency but then

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.089 
do speak on cultural competency but then
we<00:02:28.180> apply<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.959> lot<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.409> medicine<00:02:29.769> can<00:02:29.920> just

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
we apply it a lot of medicine can just

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.170 
we apply it a lot of medicine can just
