00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello my name is gennady my nickname 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.690
 In the game Gopnik, I am the server admins 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.630
 patriot 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.880
 Today I want to tell how to lift 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 records identify player uses in x 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.010
 or not so run a smoke modem with us 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.590
 player kind of he's already banned on the server 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.240
 patriot also banned on steam Mansi 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.000
 using his example we will see how 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.859
 identify plow to make it easier 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 it was done i suggest 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.020
 use console programs here 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.469
 She is this console on the program acts 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.420
 as a way out, that is, we will also see 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:50.390
 opponents behind the walls of drawers and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.390
 other brothers so start browsing 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.670
 there is nothing special here therefore 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.629
 Immediately flush forward that is to not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 delay your time and so minted center 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.790
 the center of the box and run one notice 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.080
 what's in the box this opponent is suggestive 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.270
 through the door we shoot as you see 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.369
 he shouldn't have seen on radar he 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.950
 of course could flash but this 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.619
 it was not enough to look like 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.650
 exactly as he did now look 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.650
 farther 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:39.820
 we see that the network and the enemy 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.820
 this is also the way they see again brought 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:49.520
 the enemy is sitting behind a stone not to shoot 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.780
 manages here already the reaction is not enough 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.780
 to get there 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.760
 so about matt forward we run 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.740
 Here is a very interesting point of his 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.010
 blind he dodges notices that 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.220
 the enemy enters the box Kotelnik 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.680
 knocked out everything can go ahead so look 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.870
 carefully 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.550
 the enemy is standing around the corner he does not move 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.970
 at that time that is on radar he him 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.500
 see can not see what he 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:37.070
 makes aiming 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.070
 once adjusted the scope well and exit 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.830
 what could I know missed that is grandson he 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.630
 and have a grandson he thinks that if he 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.080
 would set the hatton to leave very gently 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.080
 will it not so so squandered on 5 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.050
 so ran 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.320
 I do not know why he turned away from the box 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.820
 visible to his two opponents there 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.900
 thought she was green works other 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.870
 go through so we go array notice two 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.420
 opponents 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.920
 it's dangerous to go better move a little bit 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.900
 gazed as you can see them again through the wall 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.590
 on modelku 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.950
 goes leads once on dragged see not 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.250
 enough aiming oils and 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:41.310
 we are waiting for the enemy run up then 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:44.040
 passes all the cracks and moves back because I 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.490
 quickly already happened that is such 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.690
 small deceptive maneuver was by 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:55.370
 cottage nickname on which ridd fell and 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:59.190
 a shot although he sees it could not 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.440
 kicking there are still many moments where he 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.700
 mace but i think these will be enough 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.280
 to understand how this works 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.500
 console program and how to use it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.590
 define advise advise all admin 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.109
 our servers use this coma 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.230
 command console record haze 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:23.570
 give bans justly because 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:27.210
 Recently, cases have increased 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.540
 banyat masses to crush without leaving the bake ban 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:34.280
 unfounded and unfair 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.280
 Thank you all for your attention
