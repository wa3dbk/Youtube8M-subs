00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
I know very little else about it but I

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.340

actually have my mom's edition of this

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
actually have my mom's edition of this
from<00:01:11.550> when<00:01:11.730> she<00:01:11.760> was<00:01:11.970> around<00:01:12.390> my<00:01:12.600> age<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.170> feel

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
from when she was around my age I feel

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140 
from when she was around my age I feel
like<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.159> big<00:01:14.550> deal<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like this was a really big deal in the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.750 
like this was a really big deal in the
70s<00:01:15.690> but<00:01:16.590> her<00:01:16.710> edition<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.100> pretty<00:01:17.310> banged<00:01:17.550> up

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
70s but her edition is pretty banged up

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.640 
70s but her edition is pretty banged up
and<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.570> sort<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> falling<00:01:19.140> apart<00:01:19.230> a<00:01:19.620> little

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and it's sort of falling apart a little

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.800 
and it's sort of falling apart a little
so<00:01:20.190> I<00:01:20.220> thought<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.850> pick<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.330> since

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
so I thought I would pick this up since

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.570 
so I thought I would pick this up since
once<00:01:22.200> again<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> very<00:01:23.010> cheap<00:01:23.280> find

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
once again this was a very cheap find

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
once again this was a very cheap find
I'm<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.180> sure<00:01:24.300> why<00:01:24.510> this<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.050> big<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
I'm not sure why this was so big in the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
I'm not sure why this was so big in the
seventies<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.190> maybe<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> film

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
seventies is that maybe when the film

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.510 
seventies is that maybe when the film
adaptation<00:01:27.900> came<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.800> it<00:01:28.920> had<00:01:28.950> sort<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
adaptation came out and it had sort of a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.130 
adaptation came out and it had sort of a
resurgence<00:01:30.090> we'll<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.780> theory

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
resurgence we'll go with that theory

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.219 
resurgence we'll go with that theory
because<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.710> actually<00:01:31.920> no<00:01:32.250> idea<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:33.229> this

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
because I have actually no idea but this

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.020 
because I have actually no idea but this
is<00:01:34.350> another<00:01:34.590> book<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.790> nothing

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
is another book that I know nothing

about<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.990> by<00:01:37.110> having<00:01:37.320> heard<00:01:37.620> of<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> quite<00:01:38.010> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
about just by having heard of it quite a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.520 
about just by having heard of it quite a
lot<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.690> guess<00:01:39.690> we'll<00:01:39.870> have<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> wait<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> see

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
lot I guess we'll have to wait and see

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.520 
lot I guess we'll have to wait and see
how<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.780> remarkable

life<00:03:01.540> I'm<00:03:01.840> not<00:03:02.020> sure<00:03:02.230> if<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.950> main<00:03:03.130> character

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
life I'm not sure if the main character

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.880 
life I'm not sure if the main character
is<00:03:03.760> meant<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.120> be<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.630> witch<00:03:05.200> or<00:03:05.470> practice

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
is meant to be a witch or practice

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.150 
is meant to be a witch or practice
witchcraft<00:03:06.040> or<00:03:06.580> anything<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.440> think<00:03:08.890> it

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
witchcraft or anything but I think it

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.630 
witchcraft or anything but I think it
might<00:03:09.400> sort<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.850> more<00:03:10.060> be<00:03:10.210> about<00:03:11.430> her<00:03:12.430> life

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
might sort of more be about her life

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.780 
might sort of more be about her life
having<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.120> deal<00:03:13.500> with<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.800> prejudices<00:03:15.460> and
