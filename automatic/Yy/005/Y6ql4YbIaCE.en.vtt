00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.910
 It should be ready on the ninth of October 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.839
 all TV viewers here in the area still have a normal antenna 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.049
 that will lead you to refer to the screen 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.949
 then will not join the Eurogroup 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.970
 unless you have already procured a set-top box 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.050
 The terrestrial television will be digital on this day 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.279
 dvb-t is the magic word and in mid-september we want in Magdeburg the 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.320
 Last condition created so that the state works well 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.450
 so 150 meters high 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.960
 the transmission tower has been visible for a few months now 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.700
 but the most important element was still missing the actual channels 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.990
 antenna 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.260
 since the beginning of September, the weighty parts were at the feet of the cathedral 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.420
 Manufacturers as well as with other transmitters pile up the company Kathrein 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.120
 but first a look into the holy of holies the electronics and topic 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.250
 in the middle of the month still diligently mounted 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.140
 here, the satellite failed signal either 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.870
 digitized or dvb-s on the VW t5 liiert 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.870
 to be radiated samples from the antenna 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.230
 This creates quite a z 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.680
 through several cooling circuits are the heated air and the technology 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.680
 dissipated 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.440
 and externally attached back country ensure a stable circulation 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.160
 originally, the last parts should already be on the third and fourth of September 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.220
 be mounted on the gate 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.550
 but the helicopter from Switzerland had transmission damage 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.260
 a week later, the weather on the Brocken played crazy so again 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.490
 wait at the Lahn Lorca 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.369
 but on the fourteenth of September it was finally time for the teams 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.500
 On-site equipment Gladbach remains and raised from Russia 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.789
 Schober of the type was often the Swiss company Heliswiss was ready 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.940
 injured antenna carrier was already mounted and now the adapter pulpit was 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 on the line 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.049
 p 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:30.539
 Mounted in about 155 meters higher where the Gemener the pulpit as well 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:34.539
 Lounge can also serve there for around 30 minutes for ascent 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.539
 of the one up there 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.159
 each about one hour lasted that day the assembly and was last 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.129
 the actual antennae flown Rome 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.720
 Meanwhile, the flute is fire and mounted and the sound shows up in 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.999
 its full 162 meters altitude 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.680
 As I said the official start for dvb-t changes union saxony-anhalt is 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.379
 on the third of October 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.730
 fest shipments are sure synonymous already a few days before wanted 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.339
 how well you can receive dvb-t shows this sketch near the transmitter 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:15.239
 lime 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.839
 is enough an indoor antenna 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:20.169
 in the darker areas you need an outside or a 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.409
 Roof antenna and this overview shows which transmitter they currently dvb-t 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.619
 can receive 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:29.469
 unfortunately the open channel is not there yet but what is not is still possible 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.569
 become
