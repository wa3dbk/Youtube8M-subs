00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 hello people you him here and I speak 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.960
 I am always very clear against it 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.400
 subliminal advertising yes and 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.469
 That's why I do the advertising 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.080
 a short trip on the topic in public 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.880
 chewing gum and I'm starting right on time 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.139
 with what I take and why is take 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.949
 I will explain then very briefly 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.789
 and for whom this may be thought 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 I have very good experiences with it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 especially made the last three 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.699
 years and now have with my teeth 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 no problems no pain at all 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.890
 in which discolorations or that I am there 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.170
 what dissolves and I think the chewing gum 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.640
 There is a little secret that carries 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 also to and I can from here 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.829
 patti smith of recommend the chewing gum 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.120
 vegan what's in there of course 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 gluten free and you can also go up 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 the side because of the look very 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.500
 transparent side probably almost exactly 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 can look from which plants 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.289
 what is won and how it is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 cool it 's about how often you take 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.420
 You chewing gum on a daily basis 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.600
 yes average more than once a day 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.549
 namely for this one situation if you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.409
 Essentially I eat out when you go 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.689
 somewhere on the move or if you are the one 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.159
 Do not have a toothbrush in the morning 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.670
 and in the evening you have the toothbrush with you 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.810
 yes, even if you are hiking though 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 If you stop then just now 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 for example, which dried fruit is that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.750
 are you doing after the teeth as clean 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.670
 yes, because you do not want to say that for long 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.320
 want to have somehow plug the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.420
 nice clean and all yours 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.740
 keep mouth moist 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.250
 I did a video again 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.240
 ten tips in general quite the very 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.520
 are very important 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.070
 I could have a look again 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.610
 another video made like toothpaste 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.619
 with you we make our toothpaste easy 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 itself so that it can produce yes 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.710
 also know what's in there 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.240
 but you see I do not want to 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.799
 to the bush so talk 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.640
 just be short tips 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.750
 There are also other cool chewing gum 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.399
 yes with the chewing gum it is anyway 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.219

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.000
 million muslims every day pig 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.649
 eat in the form of chewing gum, as it were 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.550
 they are usually on with 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.170
 gelatin and alone therefore I would 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.730
 generally already on it that respect the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.290
 that it's kinda halfway 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.989
 Reasonable product is we have that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.599
 now out of the way as a vegan 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.730
 Supermarket and vegan shop and that is 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.989
 really cool cool part also have a 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.349
 cool side I have and again 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.290

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.920
 makes the teeth really clean yes more than 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.060
 a per day it's not in the cut anyway 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.880
 and I have that very very good one 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.340
 Experiences and can only do that 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.750
 recommend such a chewing gum always 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.950
 maybe even at the ready 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.170
 cycling if you either through 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.910
 is any dried fruit or 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.069
 somehow something like that you feel like it 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.680
 then pull in a bubble gum again and 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.209
