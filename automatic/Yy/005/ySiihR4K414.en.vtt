up when you know details that that could

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.760 
up when you know details that that could
change<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.989> moment<00:00:35.260> something<00:00:35.410> that<00:00:35.650> would

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
change the moment something that would

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.430 
change the moment something that would
help<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:36.820> have<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:37.090> ability<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.540> be<00:00:38.260> more

aggressive in a ring feel more confident

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.169 
aggressive in a ring feel more confident
so<00:00:41.379> our<00:00:41.470> focus<00:00:41.710> with<00:00:42.070> him<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.280> lot

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
so our focus with him a lot

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.950

what<00:00:55.860> happens<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.400> because<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.720> fast

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
what happens is because it's a fast

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.920 
what happens is because it's a fast
pitch<00:00:58.140> muscle<00:00:58.700> the<00:00:59.700> power<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.480> present<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
pitch muscle the power in the present is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.740 
pitch muscle the power in the present is
therefore<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:01.820> small<00:01:02.820> details<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.390> maddox

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
therefore very small details with maddox

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.190 
therefore very small details with maddox
fast<00:01:03.990> but<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.320> never<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
fast but they never would so you have to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200 
fast but they never would so you have to
compensate<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.830> workout<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> could<00:01:08.700> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
compensate a workout that could that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.550 
compensate a workout that could that
could<00:01:09.270> change<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.780> difference<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.170> fibers

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
could change the difference of fibers

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.310 
could change the difference of fibers
and<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:10.890> least<00:01:11.010> woman<00:01:11.910> equilibrium<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:13.080> he<00:01:13.200> can

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and at least woman equilibrium or he can

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.250 
and at least woman equilibrium or he can
have<00:01:13.760> endurance<00:01:14.760> by<00:01:15.480> the<00:01:15.540> same<00:01:15.810> time<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.230> a

lotion<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> speed<00:01:17.160> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.120> it<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.480> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
lotion is a speed this is it is it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.390 
lotion is a speed this is it is it
better<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> work<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.380> someone<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.130> has

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
better to work with someone that has

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.560 
better to work with someone that has
more<00:01:20.970> fast<00:01:21.300> which<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.890> easier<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.450> when<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
more fast which is easier for when it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
more fast which is easier for when it

if<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:31.880> put<00:01:32.090> more<00:01:32.270> power<00:01:32.450> into<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.870> more

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
if you put more power into it more

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
if you put more power into it more
certain<00:01:34.310> exercise<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.850> increase<00:01:35.120> power

ability<00:01:35.659> for<00:01:36.020> punching<00:01:36.350> power<00:01:36.580> then<00:01:37.580> it's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
ability for punching power then it's

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.490 
ability for punching power then it's
great<00:01:37.940> but<00:01:38.210> then<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.450> also<00:01:38.630> got<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.110> worry<00:01:39.290> so

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
great but then you also got it worry so

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.290 
great but then you also got it worry so
