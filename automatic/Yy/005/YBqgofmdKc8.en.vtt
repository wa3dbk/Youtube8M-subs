high-pressure myth ignores three key

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
high-pressure myth ignores three key
factors<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.120> first<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.600> those<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.140> fact

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
factors the first of those is the fact

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.490 
factors the first of those is the fact
that<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> given<00:00:45.180> size<00:00:45.390> pump<00:00:45.870> if<00:00:46.079> you

that for a given size pump if you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
that for a given size pump if you
increase<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.250> pressure<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.210> reduce

this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> expressed<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> simple<00:00:52.590> equation

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this is expressed in a simple equation

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
this is expressed in a simple equation
that<00:00:53.190> says<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.730> power<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.360> proportional<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that says that power is proportional to

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.939 
that says that power is proportional to
pressure<00:00:56.100> times<00:00:56.850> volume<00:00:57.030> flow<00:00:57.809> rate<00:00:57.920> for<00:00:58.920> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
when it's operated at 90 thousand psi so

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.609 
when it's operated at 90 thousand psi so
you<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> smaller<00:01:24.000> nozzle<00:01:24.350> less<00:01:25.350> cutting

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you get a smaller nozzle less cutting

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.200 
you get a smaller nozzle less cutting

them rapidly through the material to do
the<00:01:59.939> cutting<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> abrasive<00:02:01.710> that's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
