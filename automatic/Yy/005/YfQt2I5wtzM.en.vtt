00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
hefty price tag is he worth it well I

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.310 
hefty price tag is he worth it well I
think<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:09.030> think<00:00:09.420> what<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.719> really<00:00:09.870> just<00:00:10.110> was

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
think I think what it really just was

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.530 
think I think what it really just was
saying<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.550> know<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:12.000> are<00:00:12.120> committed

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
saying is that you know we are committed

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.870 
saying is that you know we are committed
to<00:00:12.570> him<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.469> think<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.009> when<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.490> look<00:00:14.670> at

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
to him and I think that when you look at

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.609 
to him and I think that when you look at
the<00:00:15.000> mountain<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> climb<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the mountain that we have to climb I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.970 
the mountain that we have to climb I
think<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.880> fair<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:19.080> coach<00:00:19.350> feels

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
think that it's fair that a coach feels

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.849 
think that it's fair that a coach feels
that<00:00:20.160> sort<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> commitment<00:00:20.730> from<00:00:21.029> his<00:00:21.210> team

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
that sort of commitment from his team

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.710 
that sort of commitment from his team
how'd<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.890> go<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.640> final<00:00:23.910> stages<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
how'd it go in the final stages of this

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.790 
how'd it go in the final stages of this
negotiation<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.340> with<00:00:27.000> Buffalo<00:00:27.619> on<00:00:28.619> his

were but the idea that we swooped in
with<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.310> new<00:01:29.579> idea<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.509> new<00:01:31.170> role<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> new

with a new idea or a new role or a new

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.719 
with a new idea or a new role or a new
package<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.479> completely<00:01:33.960> wrong<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.490> just

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
package is completely wrong we we just

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
package is completely wrong we we just
kept<00:01:35.939> consistent<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.079> offered<00:01:37.860> him

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
kept consistent with what we offered him

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.459 
kept consistent with what we offered him
in<00:01:38.280> outline<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.390> him<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.810> day<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.319> it

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
in outline to him and day one and it

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.590 
in outline to him and day one and it
wasn't<00:01:40.740> pretty<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:42.149> he<00:01:42.270> knew<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
wasn't pretty I think he knew the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.999 
wasn't pretty I think he knew the
Buffalo<00:01:42.960> situation<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.829> been

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
Buffalo situation could have been

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
Buffalo situation could have been
quicker<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.939> knew<00:01:45.659> he<00:01:45.810> had<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.929> good

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
quicker I knew he had a good

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
quicker I knew he had a good
relationship<00:01:46.289> with<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.009> people<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.520> I

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
relationship with the people there I

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.350 
relationship with the people there I
just<00:01:48.600> kept<00:01:48.780> telling<00:01:49.020> him<00:01:49.259> how<00:01:49.409> my<00:01:50.090> pitch<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
just kept telling him how my pitch to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.949 
just kept telling him how my pitch to

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
him was some people run away from the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
eventually he would come around to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.050 
eventually he would come around to
embracing<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.860> he<00:02:02.429> called<00:02:02.670> us<00:02:02.849> back

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
embracing that so he called us back

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.089 
embracing that so he called us back
yesterday<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.649> first<00:02:04.890> time<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
yesterday and that's the first time that

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.930 
yesterday and that's the first time that
we<00:02:05.340> really<00:02:05.610> knew

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
we really knew

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.210 
we really knew
we<00:02:06.090> were<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:07.230> were<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.410> team<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.980> I<00:02:08.160> think

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
we were we were a team that was I think

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.800 
we were we were a team that was I think
after<00:02:08.490> made<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.940> decision<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.420> he<00:02:09.570> wasn't

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
after made the decision that he wasn't

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.290 
after made the decision that he wasn't
going<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.380> Detroit<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.040> came<00:02:11.850> down<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.030> two

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
going back to Detroit I came down to two

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.530 
going back to Detroit I came down to two
teams<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.980> he<00:02:14.670> came<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.060> us<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
teams and I think that he came to us and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.930 
teams and I think that he came to us and
basically<00:02:15.870> embraced<00:02:16.500> plan<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.550> don't<00:02:17.760> mind

once we made it clear what we were
prepared<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> do<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.620> just

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
prepared to do then it really just

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.310 
prepared to do then it really just
became<00:03:02.160> about<00:03:02.400> convincing<00:03:03.060> him<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.840> fit<00:03:04.140> and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320

right away that you're going to the

right away that you're going to the

about the process putting the pieces
together<00:06:00.549> I'm<00:06:01.319> assuming<00:06:02.319> is<00:06:02.379> it<00:06:02.469> safe<00:06:02.619> to<00:06:02.769> say

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
together I'm assuming is it safe to say

that<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.219> the<00:06:03.399> playoffs<00:06:03.609> while<00:06:03.909> they<00:06:04.029> would

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:04.149 
that the the playoffs while they would

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:06.449 
that the the playoffs while they would
be<00:06:04.269> nice<00:06:04.449> or<00:06:04.659> not<00:06:04.809> sort<00:06:05.259> of<00:06:05.349> an<00:06:05.409> immediate<00:06:05.829> goal

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:06.459 
be nice or not sort of an immediate goal

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:10.109 
be nice or not sort of an immediate goal
right<00:06:06.699> now<00:06:06.759> I<00:06:08.069> think<00:06:09.069> that<00:06:09.129> what<00:06:09.399> we<00:06:09.579> outlined

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:10.119
