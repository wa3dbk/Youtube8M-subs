00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
there's a defender in front of you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.070 
there's a defender in front of you
you're<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.450> make<00:00:15.509> them<00:00:15.719> think<00:00:16.020> you're

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
you're going to make them think you're

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
you're going to make them think you're
going<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.650> way<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.859> then<00:00:17.430> you're<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
going one way and then you're going to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.960 
going one way and then you're going to
switch<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.199> flip-flop<00:00:19.680> basically<00:00:20.250> all

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
switch it the flip-flop basically all

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.529 
switch it the flip-flop basically all
right<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.150> move<00:00:21.689> goes<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:26.330> this<00:00:27.330> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
right so move goes like this this is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.999 
right so move goes like this this is
simple<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.849> another<00:00:29.849> way<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.470> tap<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
simple with it another way I tap it and

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.600 
simple with it another way I tap it and
then<00:00:32.640> hit<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.600> sideways<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:35.100> could<00:00:35.309> also

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then hit it sideways you could also

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.040 
then hit it sideways you could also
launched<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.260> hit<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.530> sideways<00:00:39.050> like

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
launched at it and hit it sideways like

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.549 
launched at it and hit it sideways like
another<00:00:40.320> video<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.710> saw<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:42.149> lunge<00:00:43.020> nothing

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
another video I saw you lunge nothing

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.420 
another video I saw you lunge nothing
just<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.840> do<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:49.430> but

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
just like that I do it like this but

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.090 
just like that I do it like this but
faster<00:00:51.140> alright<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> first<00:00:52.410> part<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.980> this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
faster alright so the first part of this

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.200 
faster alright so the first part of this
move<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:55.620> either<00:00:55.770> hit<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> sideways<00:00:56.969> like

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
move is to either hit it sideways like

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.649 
move is to either hit it sideways like
that<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:59.660> lunge<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.899> side<00:01:00.930> missed<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:04.159> so

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
that or lunge it side missed that so

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.070 
that or lunge it side missed that so
after<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.700> after<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.000> that

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
after you do that after you do that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.620 
after you do that after you do that
you're<00:01:10.080> already<00:01:10.260> halfway<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> move

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
you're already halfway through the move

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
you're already halfway through the move
so<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> next<00:01:12.840> part<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.790> simple

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
so the next part is just a simple

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
so the next part is just a simple
redirection<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> bowl<00:01:17.810> ah<00:01:19.220> it's<00:01:20.220> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
redirection of the bowl ah it's just

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
redirection of the bowl ah it's just
basically<00:01:21.110> when<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.229> moving<00:01:22.500> it'll<00:01:22.830> just

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
basically when it's moving it'll just

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.880 
basically when it's moving it'll just
spread<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.689> side<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.500> foot<00:01:25.710> when

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
spread off the side of your foot when

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.490 
spread off the side of your foot when
you<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.100> your<00:01:26.220> foot<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:27.200> I'll<00:01:28.200> just

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you have your foot like this I'll just

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.429 
you have your foot like this I'll just
slide<00:01:28.950> off<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:30.290> hit<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
slide off of it you can also hit it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.039 
slide off of it you can also hit it
sideways<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.180> won't<00:01:33.390> give<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> as<00:01:33.720> much<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
sideways and I won't give it as much of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.960 
sideways and I won't give it as much of
an<00:01:34.200> effect<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:34.799> if<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.070> knock<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
an effect because if I knock it out of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.660 
an effect because if I knock it out of
it<00:01:36.270> knock<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:36.960> balance<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:40.490> like<00:01:41.490> just

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
it knock it off balance so like just

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.450 
it knock it off balance so like just
like<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.070> together<00:01:44.189> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
like that so to put it all together and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.000 
like that so to put it all together and
slow<00:01:44.939> wow<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.960> like<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
slow wow just like that

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.090 
slow wow just like that
this<00:01:50.640> moon<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.240> simple<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.040> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this moon is really simple and if you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
this moon is really simple and if you
get<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.370> down<00:01:53.550> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.910> do<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.090> super<00:01:54.540> fast<00:01:54.870> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
get it down you can do it super fast and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.340 
get it down you can do it super fast and
it<00:01:55.890> will<00:01:55.980> be<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.490> effective<00:02:00.230> just<00:02:01.230> like

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it will be really effective just like

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.580 
it will be really effective just like
that<00:02:02.090> smooth<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.930> effective<00:02:04.260> if

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that smooth can be really effective if

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.710 
that smooth can be really effective if
you<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> correctly<00:02:05.120> so<00:02:06.120> one<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> best

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
you do it correctly so one of the best

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.030 
you do it correctly so one of the best
