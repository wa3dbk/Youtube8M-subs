 we are in the heart of the val di non 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.710
 surrounded by high cliffs overlooking deep canyons created by 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.349
 incessant work of water erosion 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.549

 it has a particular morphological conformation 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.160
 it appears as a succession of treia plateaus separated by deep 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.080
 dunes of forlì on the bottom of which flow in streams of water 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.079

 mid-nineteenth century 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.680
 it is about 2500 meters of path of which 500 are in the ultrà rock 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.510
 wine among the shit and vegetation of the valley begins the path lawn 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.920

 he walks along this long path from the feeling of being 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.039
 inside the rock as an integral part of the wall that closes above us 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.990
 leaving in some places 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
 an opening of just over a meter in height 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.390
 we meet the guide that will accompany us in the last section from 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.680

 dividing into two 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.370
 the locals have always lived with this chasm 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.089
 building the houses at the edge of the photo 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:48.399
 through a height difference of 75 meters hey 348 steps it is possible to enter 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.489
 a world on leave of extraordinary beauty 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.450
 more and more massages in sachets 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.559

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.609
 allow you to enter a world of lights and shadows
