as a base cream eyeshadows if you do

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.120 
as a base cream eyeshadows if you do
wear<00:01:21.760> them<00:01:21.970> by<00:01:22.750> itself<00:01:22.810> fourth<00:01:23.320> use<00:01:23.650> that<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.070> a

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.940 
wear them by itself fourth use that as a
base<00:01:24.750> they<00:01:25.750> will<00:01:25.780> crease

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
base they will crease

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.370

they<00:01:27.130> crease<00:01:27.430> in<00:01:27.730> about<00:01:27.970> probably<00:01:28.000> two<00:01:28.900> hours

they crease in about probably two hours

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.830 
they crease in about probably two hours
so<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:29.980> don't<00:01:30.220> recommend<00:01:30.490> using<00:01:30.820> these<00:01:31.270> cream

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
so I don't recommend using these cream

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.570 
so I don't recommend using these cream
shadows<00:01:32.230> as<00:01:32.470> a<00:01:32.500> base<00:01:32.770> when<00:01:33.100> you're<00:01:33.220> using<00:01:33.400> it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
shadows as a base when you're using it

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.970 
shadows as a base when you're using it
by<00:01:33.730> yourself<00:01:34.240> maybe<00:01:35.080> with<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.710> primer

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
by yourself maybe with a primer

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.270 
by yourself maybe with a primer
underneath<00:01:36.430> but<00:01:37.390> even<00:01:37.690> then<00:01:37.930> I<00:01:38.230> don't<00:01:39.040> really

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
underneath but even then I don't really

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.790 
underneath but even then I don't really
like<00:01:39.610> this<00:01:39.820> black<00:01:40.240> eyeliner<00:01:40.870> it<00:01:41.350> glides<00:01:41.650> on

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
like this black eyeliner it glides on

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.830 
like this black eyeliner it glides on
really<00:01:41.860> smooth<00:01:42.490> there's<00:01:43.360> been<00:01:43.510> do

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
really smooth there's been do

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.680 
really smooth there's been do
quicklime<00:01:44.350> it's<00:01:45.190> not<00:01:45.430> really<00:01:45.940> soft<00:01:46.270> which<00:01:46.540> I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
quicklime it's not really soft which I

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.160 
quicklime it's not really soft which I
like<00:01:47.080> because<00:01:47.410> it<00:01:47.740> doesn't<00:01:48.100> smudge<00:01:48.400> as<00:01:48.670> easily

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
like because it doesn't smudge as easily

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.130 
like because it doesn't smudge as easily
but<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.800> have<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.220> put<00:01:51.690> another<00:01:52.690> layer<00:01:52.990> on

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
but you do have to put another layer on

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.680 
but you do have to put another layer on
if<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.590> want<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.980> color<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.310> be<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:55.540> then

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
if you want the color to be and then

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.150 
if you want the color to be and then
here's<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.110> brush<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.470> says<00:01:56.590> double-ended

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
here's the brush it says double-ended

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.370 
here's the brush it says double-ended
brush<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.760> you<00:01:57.850> get<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.000> sponge<00:01:58.360> tip<00:01:58.690> on<00:01:58.960> one<00:01:59.140> end

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
brush so you get a sponge tip on one end

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.820 
brush so you get a sponge tip on one end
and<00:01:59.620> the<00:02:00.070> other<00:02:00.100> end<00:02:00.490> is<00:02:00.820> just<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.300> shader<00:02:01.830> it's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
and the other end is just a shader it's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.130 
and the other end is just a shader it's
just<00:02:03.010> like<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.160> shader<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.670> like<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.820> mini<00:02:04.140> Mac

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
just like a shader is like a mini Mac

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.650 
just like a shader is like a mini Mac
