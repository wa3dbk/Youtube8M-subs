00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 these are the five strangest weapons 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.509
 of the world I will focus on this list in 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.519
 name the strangest weapons in your 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.290
 way to guide them I mean all 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.059
 these guns could be considered 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.130
 as strange but what we will see here 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 nothing has to do with not even having 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.029
 gun shape you'll see that some of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.830
 these weapons are nothing more than fantasy 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.630
 of some to control it absolutely 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 everything if you arrive the day in which God 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.529
 low to the world I am convinced that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
 the human being would try to control it already 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.870
 either using laser beams or with 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.640
 boats and whores 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.590
 let's start then it's ready in the position 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.540
 number 5 with ultrasonic weapons 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.250
 before seeing the one that occupies us in this 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.200
 position let's look at the failed attempt by 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.960
 part of the USA to create a ray that 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.610
 causes vomiting in 2007 they tried 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.440
 create a kaleidoscopic pulse with the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.280
 goal of causing vertigo nausea and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.830
 disorientation 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.970
 but after investing 800 thousand dollars it 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.680
 They realized that the weapon was 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.970
 completely useless since for that 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.400
 had effect they needed the 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.480
 target looked at the light fixedly but 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.130
 going to the important thing weapons 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.050
 ultrasonic so they work so 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.580
 very effective although it is true that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.589
 it does not produce exactly the same 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.239
 symptoms that in the previous one these are 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.330
 can classify as sonic grenades 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.190
 mines or nicas or canyons what they do is 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.290
 direct a powerful sound to a target 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.940
 or concrete address with the purpose of 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.070
 cause dizziness and discomfort and if the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.290
 target is close can reach even 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.000
 to damage the eardrums is its purpose 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.980
 as with all non-lethal weapons is 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.150
 control the masses widely used 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.750
 by the British forces and 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.940
 Americans in Iraq 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.720
 in position number 4 we have the pump 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.760
 gay as you hear it in 1994 it was theorized 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.110
 with the idea and in fact it was one of the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.330
 main new ideas for 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.620
 develop non-lethal weapons in the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.060
 document they talked about using a 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.920
 powerful aphrodisiac that could be 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.450
 thrown at the enemy troops causing 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.240
 homosexual behavior among 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.770
 soldiers the weapon was not lethal and fulfilled 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.110
 with the standards but it seemed to them 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.550
 completely unpleasant though 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.290
 it was not because of this description that 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.460
 the weapon did not go any further but because the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.619
 most of the substances that 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.690
 contained were unknown and they parked 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.399
 the idea considered that there were others 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.530
 non-lethal methods better and less 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.300
 unpleasant and leaked reports 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.160
 They showed that they also experimented with 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.540
 the possibility of spraying pheromones 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.310
 of bee to then drop a swarm 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.920
 on the battlefield or hide 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.830
 hives previously also with bombs 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.390
 of bad breath and diarrhea pumps is 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.160
 Funny is true but it 's sad to know 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 who invested almost 8 million 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.660
 dollars in developing all these ideas 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 in position number 3 we have the skunk 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.240
 the future of the weapons of the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 Mass contentions are not the balls 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.690
 of rubber or tear gas but 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.880
 weapons that do not cause absolutely 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.800
 no harm like the one we'll see here or 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.390
 as the active denial system that emits 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.150
 a microwave makes giving the objective 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.470
 an unbearable feeling of heat and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.870
 Skunk sister is used by forces 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.250
 of israel defense the jet that throws 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.110
 they leave everything that touches a very 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.610
 nasty with the addition that takes 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.380
 days to completely remove the smell 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.720
 even after washing you can 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.010
 Stay is the preferred weapon for 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.540
 control the crowd because to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.400
 difference from rubber balls or 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.500
 tear gas does not produce any 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.970
 type of damage remember that although it is 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.769
 very strange you can get to kill 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.690
 a person with a rubber ball in 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.269
 israel for example there have been two children 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.220
 deceased of the skunk said no 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.989
 it's a chemical it's just a liquid 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.430
 that smells bad does not hurt even 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.500
 even if it falls directly in your eye 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.000
 one of the Protestants who was 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.820
 present in one of these frictions 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.920
 He said it 's the first time he's used it 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.510
 is going to put us all sick I saw a 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.360
 child who could not breathe and many 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.769
 other people were vomiting from 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.150
 the second world war began to 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.720
 investigate the creation of stink bombs 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.850
 but 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.500
 at that time they abandoned the idea to 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.180
 two weeks to start 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.820
 in position number 2 we have the 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.230
 sura project with this name is known 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.510
 to one of the machines that control the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.130
 time one of them because there are more with 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.320
 other names like the art if I do not 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.940
 wrong in theory they were created with the 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.620
 purpose of creating hurricanes in 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.300
 anywhere in the world but it 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.459
 they finally used to hinder 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.959
 radio communications many said 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.120
 that the Russian mafia managed to build 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.070
 one of these climate controllers and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.780
 that caused the hurricane katrina thing 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.000
 that you can see on the web twitter words 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.620
 also in other parts like the engineer 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.290
 pedro gaete denounced a series of 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.030
 artificially generated earthquakes 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.500
 but there is no evidence of it in discovery 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.390
 Chanel however talked about the 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.550
 topic and explained that both USA and 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.560
 'Spain included geoengineering or 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.480
 climate control as part of a 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.250
 military program 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.510
 and finally in the position number 1 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 we have the cannons to wash the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.100
 brain as is the human being that ever 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.720
 will get tired of creating and thinking what he does 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.790
 lack provided to control the 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.440
 others before talking about the canyon itself 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.080
 Let's look before what would become a 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.340
 cannon tesla incredibly these cannons 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.630
 of electromagnetic rays is 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.700
 they investigated very thoroughly with which 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.920
 They expected to confuse machinery sensors 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.230
 enemy disable missiles fighters and 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.060
 space rockets but they also thought 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.120
 that with enough power could 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.290
 to even manipulate a person 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.940
 despite all the efforts ever 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.250
 they managed to make it work such and 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.050
 as I thought tesla but of course many 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.780
 they will say yes and that you can also 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.040
 find the plans in the deep web 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.960
 going back a bit to the real world but not 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.490
 much the Russians tried to create a 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.110
 microwave emitter gun with which 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.970
 be able to interfere in the thought 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.130
 human spent decades researching 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.630
 the mind control and the theory that more 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.640
 they liked it was that with the microwaves 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.920
 could interfere in the brain and by 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.420
 so much control that person many 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.400
 They said the investigations were 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.960
 being a success but they soon jumped 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.700
 many voices against to eliminate 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.950
 these practices and that therefore the 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.660
 government will withdraw the funds but the 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.250
 thing does not stay here since many 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.770
 researchers went to states 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.780
 united to continue the investigation and 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.880
 From this point nothing was heard 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.110
 more are the rumors and stories that 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.270
 joined the mk-ultra project 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.520
 and nothing else family subscribe gives the law 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.730
 if you liked a kiss and until 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.730
 soon
