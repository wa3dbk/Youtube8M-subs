00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
reduces ultraviolet rays so you do have

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.310 
reduces ultraviolet rays so you do have

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
right what do you figure that thing

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.930 
right what do you figure that thing
weighs<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.390> would<00:03:00.320> say<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.560> weighs<00:03:00.680> about<00:03:00.940> 350

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
weighs I would say it weighs about 350

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940 
weighs I would say it weighs about 350
400<00:03:02.150> pounds<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.200> with<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.680> roof<00:03:03.830> we're

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
400 pounds is that with the roof we're

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.430 
400 pounds is that with the roof we're
going<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.130> build<00:03:04.660> well<00:03:05.660> yeah<00:03:05.900> with<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.260> roof

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
going to build well yeah with the roof

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.320 
going to build well yeah with the roof
it's<00:03:06.680> probably<00:03:07.070> more<00:03:07.340> yeah<00:03:07.700> five<00:03:08.000> or<00:03:08.150> six

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
it's probably more yeah five or six

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.930 
it's probably more yeah five or six
hundred<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.310> just<00:03:10.430> temporarily

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
hundred so this is just temporarily

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
being back to the plate right using some

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.740 
being back to the plate right using some
strapping<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.940> looks<00:03:17.360> pretty<00:03:17.510> good

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
strapping this looks pretty good

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.380 
strapping this looks pretty good
and<00:03:18.020> then<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:19.070> horizontal<00:03:19.910> piece<00:03:20.090> or<00:03:20.270> the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
and then the horizontal piece or the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.570 
and then the horizontal piece or the
header<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.620> around<00:03:21.830> yeah<00:03:22.220> it's<00:03:22.430> right

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
header is that around yeah it's right

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.430 
header is that around yeah it's right
around<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.850> corner<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.209> we<00:03:23.480> go<00:03:23.630> four<00:03:23.930> by<00:03:24.110> six

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
around the corner that we go four by six

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.180 
around the corner that we go four by six
there<00:03:24.770> we<00:03:24.980> go<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:27.110> this<00:03:27.230> forms<00:03:27.650> our<00:03:27.770> basic

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
there we go and this forms our basic

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.430 
there we go and this forms our basic
structure<00:03:28.700> for<00:03:28.930> supporting<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:30.080> this

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
structure for supporting this and this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.770 
structure for supporting this and this
is<00:03:30.590> all<00:03:30.800> just<00:03:31.340> being<00:03:31.670> tacked<00:03:32.060> together<00:03:32.360> right

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
is all just being tacked together right
