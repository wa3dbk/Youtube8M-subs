00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.800
 file server 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.910
 if you want to learn how to set up a right server see the training video 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.210
 file server with 2008 right 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.250
 we should not talk because we scored points with 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.250
 I'll stay here and add functions 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.190
 I am going to be a web server in rs 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.750
 in the case of the 2008 holy world 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.720
 this and that are already seven points of sale 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.120
 who wants many advantages that the assembly of education systems for 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.010
 sites and some if you have problem you can stop only that site does not arrive 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.110
 for all services 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 he told me that any of the others 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.299
 it's in features will install on dm add necessary features 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.690
 he already had with the web server is who next in the web server that tac 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.779
 providing web and reliable application framework 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.650
 manage the resignation 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.499
 next 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.739
 he has information about the web server including it's theirs 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.739
 which is the seven points and 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:29.489
 she gives me a screen with the country feature can install and that matter that 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.610
 depends a lot on what kind of site you put 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.109
 I want to remember that the professional sound of infrastructure 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.049
 my job is to create an infrastructure with the web designer mdb 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:39.909
 lopes 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.909
 the guy who does pull out with the constant on the spot 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.179
 the dog itself 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.249
 is there the application development 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.930
 that part of africa and tnt 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.389
 be jaime 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.309
 all that part programming 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.089
 here also I can put compatibility with the winner of the 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.089
 reality these points were are there too 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.560
 this packet package just the ftp server that I will discuss after then 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 life with file transfer 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 then it seems pacoton spa custom was close 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.089
 he gives me a summary of everything he chooses 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:22.089
 is there 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.059
 the bright this moment here to remember 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:28.640
 of the two training DVDs on 2007 on the site 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.900
 the glp york training dvd very interesting for you to learn 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:38.809
 various gp resources in year 2008 get out of here the new dvd externally the server 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.279
 of files with 2008 for certain 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.479
 more than three 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.469
 the sporting and divided the use of active servers or 2008 right 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.619
 now is to finish the installation so we are so successful eliminate the 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.619
 fear of everything has been installed 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.889
 close 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.189
 I now have two 16 functions until the file server is already installed and 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.829
 also the web server bias 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.549
 Your click here according to mpf 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.999
 exam shows 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.480
 we will propose that the service has none and does not 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:17.469
 I ask all the steps are only active some assemblers installed in the 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.469
 brazil for you inviting of stops for example 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.370
 the component ac service state component 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.050
 it comes with the pattern stopped after clicking here to start 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.509
 will be a constant in the parts function 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.889
 is available I have other services stopped eg service 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.389
 cpi publication 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.080
 so that I can manage all the server services rs 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.029
 ask me 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.059
 the functions all those salis sapientae a consumerist sides I go 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.869
 now test a server still rudimally constant pattern of rs 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.499
 Can I be here in the browser? 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.849
 I'm going to dictate 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:57.870
 the place 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.949
 after 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.099
 in a note he already shows me 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.939
 a site that has been replaced by the site that the 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.939
 m10 alcino will create with the company 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.990
 I'll show you how this workstation access 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.949
 I think it's a workstation anybody's from the do not do site 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.949
 some people claiming 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:27.930
 I'll enter with a browser 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.729
 I'll be in the address bar the ipÃª of honey the server the name two 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.309
 points -1 8 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:35.629
 point 1 points 5 4 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.339
 the attack on the ies homepage show how the service is fado 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.379
 correctly 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.120
 in a next videotape for one for you 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.999
 how do you put the site when it says so will have yen 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.999
 in other settings with for example fpm 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.490
 remembering that this other 20 hours 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.659
 you see on the website teachers come on point 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.879
 share the knowledge if you walk around a little game
