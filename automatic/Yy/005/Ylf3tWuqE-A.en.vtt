00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
hello guys this is y 0 x 450 and it's

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.089 
hello guys this is y 0 x 450 and it's
been<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> while<00:00:06.720> since<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.259> made<00:00:07.470> my<00:00:07.589> last<00:00:07.740> video

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
been a while since I made my last video

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.100 
been a while since I made my last video
because<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.550> our<00:00:08.610> Lego<00:00:08.880> order<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.780> needed

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
because in our Lego order and I needed

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.629 
because in our Lego order and I needed
to<00:00:10.290> make<00:00:10.469> some<00:00:10.500> money<00:00:10.849> but<00:00:12.679> so<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
to make some money but so this is the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.840 
to make some money but so this is the
base<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.960> far<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.529> hasn't<00:00:16.770> had<00:00:17.039> much<00:00:17.310> more<00:00:17.369> done

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
base so far it hasn't had much more done

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.880 
base so far it hasn't had much more done
to<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.510> did<00:00:19.410> basically<00:00:21.020> you<00:00:22.020> share<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.590> here

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
to it I did basically you share it here

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.279 
to it I did basically you share it here
and<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.900> then<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.050> got<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.619> pop<00:00:26.490> design

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
and up and then I got the pop design

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.160 
and up and then I got the pop design
right<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:29.599> everything<00:00:30.599> else<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.990> pretty

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
right here everything else is pretty

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.139 
right here everything else is pretty
much<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.380> same<00:00:31.679> from<00:00:32.640> put<00:00:33.620> detailing<00:00:34.620> their

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
much the same from put detailing their

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.200 
much the same from put detailing their
and<00:00:36.149> long<00:00:36.690> cement<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.280> getting<00:00:39.000> load

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and long cement up for the getting load

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
and long cement up for the getting load
to<00:00:39.540> get<00:00:39.690> loaded<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.640> gunship<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.050> I<00:00:43.050> got

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
to get loaded on the gunship and I got

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.310 
to get loaded on the gunship and I got
some<00:00:43.469> detailing<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.930> die<00:00:45.930> added

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
some detailing right there and die added

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.110 
some detailing right there and die added
two<00:00:46.469> turrets<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> guys<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.760> seen<00:00:47.940> in

two turrets that you guys have seen in
previous<00:00:48.149> videos<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.320> kept<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.730> i

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
previous videos I kept them because i

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.600 
previous videos I kept them because i
knew<00:00:50.910> i'd<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.420> against<00:00:51.660> um<00:00:52.430> then<00:00:53.430> i<00:00:53.550> just

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
knew i'd use them against um then i just

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.459 
knew i'd use them against um then i just
have<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.690> some<00:00:55.140> battlefield

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the space is I have a little command

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.289 
the space is I have a little command
center<00:01:15.390> back<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> yeah<00:01:17.909> there's

that there's the door that opens up twin

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.429 
that there's the door that opens up twin
into<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.600> there's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> table<00:01:22.430> um<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
into it and then there's a table um and

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.370 
into it and then there's a table um and
I<00:01:25.439> am<00:01:25.619> designing<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.610> new<00:01:26.640> base<00:01:27.150> which<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:27.990> going

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
I am designing a new base which is going

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.190 
I am designing a new base which is going
to<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.759> really<00:01:29.759> cool<00:01:30.060> it's<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
to be a really cool it's going to be a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.280 
to be a really cool it's going to be a
lot<00:01:31.380> better<00:01:31.439> than<00:01:32.210> most<00:01:33.210> bases<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.110> not

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
lot better than most bases but it's not

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.630 
lot better than most bases but it's not
going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> fake<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.579> be

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
going to be a fake it's just going to be

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.569 
going to be a fake it's just going to be
really<00:01:35.880> detailed<00:01:36.740> here's<00:01:37.740> sort<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.250> sketch

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
really detailed here's sort of a sketch

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.340 
really detailed here's sort of a sketch
I<00:01:38.759> drew<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.240> main<00:01:39.630> base<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.939> rocky

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
I drew I have main base here a rocky

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.569 
I drew I have main base here a rocky
mountain<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.280> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> tell

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
mountain and then I'm not going to tell

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.999 
mountain and then I'm not going to tell
you<00:01:44.640> all<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.180> Rocky<00:01:45.360> Mountain<00:01:45.720> they're

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009

you all about the Rocky Mountain they're
just<00:01:47.009> gonna<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.220> something<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:47.579> secret

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I don't know if I'll do one with epic

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.209 
I don't know if I'll do one with epic
music<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.619> want<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> get<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> the

music because I want to get on to the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.740 
music because I want to get on to the
next<00:01:59.460> base<00:02:00.229> but<00:02:01.229> i<00:02:01.530> will<00:02:01.950> try<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:03.390> i<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.659> do

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
next base but i will try and if i can do

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.209 
next base but i will try and if i can do
it<00:02:03.780> quick<00:02:04.020> enough<00:02:04.049> off<00:02:04.409> i'll<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> for<00:02:05.070> you
