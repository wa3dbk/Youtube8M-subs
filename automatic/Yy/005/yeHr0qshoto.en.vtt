properly<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.579> make<00:01:56.759> sure<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> take<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> look<00:01:57.600> at

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
properly so make sure you take a look at

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
properly so make sure you take a look at
that<00:01:57.930> method<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:59.610> once<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that method that I have now once this it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.389 
that method that I have now once this it
gets<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:00.659> combined<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.890> you're<00:02:02.009> gonna<00:02:02.100> take

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
gets all combined then you're gonna take

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.260 
gets all combined then you're gonna take
this<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> put<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.060> into<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.570> yolks<00:02:04.969> then<00:02:05.969> take

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this and put it into the yolks then take

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.419 
this and put it into the yolks then take
your<00:02:06.420> fork<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.899> mash<00:02:07.770> everything<00:02:08.039> together

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
your fork and mash everything together

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.809 
your fork and mash everything together
again<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:10.590> want<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.039> keep<00:02:11.340> going<00:02:11.790> with

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
again you want to just keep going with

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.400 
again you want to just keep going with
this<00:02:12.120> until<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.690> gets<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.080> be<00:02:13.200> like

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
this until it gets to be like

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.090 
this until it gets to be like
a<00:02:13.440> very<00:02:13.770> nice<00:02:14.010> creamy<00:02:14.750> consistency<00:02:16.040> okay<00:02:17.040> so

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
a very nice creamy consistency okay so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.640 
a very nice creamy consistency okay so
that<00:02:17.430> looks<00:02:17.640> good<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.630> nice<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.230> smooth

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.370 
that looks good so it's nice and smooth
and<00:02:20.630> now<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:22.050> add<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.500> relish<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:27.380> if

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you don't want to add the relish in if

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.200 
you don't want to add the relish in if
you're<00:02:31.020> hesitant<00:02:31.530> about<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:32.070> don't<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.030> it

this<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.610> couple<00:03:11.670> different<00:03:12.480> ways<00:03:12.600> now<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.260> have

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
this a couple different ways now I have

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.420 
this a couple different ways now I have
for<00:03:14.520> years<00:03:14.940> used<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.900> spoon<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.740> put<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.100> into

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
for years used a spoon to put this into

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.030 
for years used a spoon to put this into
the<00:03:17.790> eggs<00:03:18.060> but<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:18.720> also<00:03:19.020> do<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.470> with<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.590> piping

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the eggs but I also do it with a piping

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
could just take a spoon and just take

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.900 
could just take a spoon and just take
some<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.990> put<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.650> right<00:03:26.040> into<00:03:26.370> your<00:03:26.730> egg

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
just like that okay and you want to just

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.610 
just like that okay and you want to just
mound<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.660> up<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.900> little<00:03:31.110> bit<00:03:31.260> but<00:03:31.440> not<00:03:31.560> too

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
mound it up a little bit but not too

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.050 
mound it up a little bit but not too
high<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.430> then<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.510> take<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> fork<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:35.730> just

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
high and then I take a fork and I just

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.970 
high and then I take a fork and I just
kind<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.510> make<00:03:37.520> little<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:39.630> know<00:03:39.980> designs

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
kind of make little you know designs

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.250 
kind of make little you know designs
into<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:42.080> nothing<00:03:43.080> real<00:03:43.230> fancy<00:03:45.050> just<00:03:46.050> like

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
into it nothing real fancy just like

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.140 
into it nothing real fancy just like
that<00:03:46.500> because<00:03:46.920> what<00:03:47.459> we're<00:03:47.610> gonna<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:47.970> is

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
that because what we're gonna do is

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.510 
that because what we're gonna do is
sprinkle<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.840> paprika<00:03:49.290> on<00:03:49.620> top<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.130> that<00:03:50.250> and

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
sprinkle the paprika on top of that and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.300 
sprinkle the paprika on top of that and
then<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.820> paprika<00:03:51.090> will<00:03:51.930> hit<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:52.739> all<00:03:53.100> those

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
then the paprika will hit on all those

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.520 
then the paprika will hit on all those
little<00:03:53.489> peaks<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.239> sticking<00:03:54.870> up<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:55.440> you

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
little peaks that are sticking up so you

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
little peaks that are sticking up so you

egg just like that doesn't that look

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.529 
egg just like that doesn't that look
pretty<00:04:36.590> so<00:04:37.590> it's<00:04:37.770> two<00:04:38.070> simple<00:04:38.310> ways<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.699> make

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
pretty so it's two simple ways to make

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.840 
pretty so it's two simple ways to make
it<00:04:40.169> you<00:04:40.470> could<00:04:40.620> do<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.830> without<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.490> relish

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
it you could do it without the relish

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.779 
it you could do it without the relish
with<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.419> relish<00:04:42.780> with<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.740> spoon<00:04:44.039> with<00:04:44.639> the

with the relish with the spoon with the
piping<00:04:45.180> bag<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.660> then<00:04:46.050> what<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.410> like<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.830> do<00:04:46.979> is

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220
