00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
stuff for me on that and then we're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.190 
stuff for me on that and then we're
running<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> blueprint<00:01:57.360> defense<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
running the blueprint defense and I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.289 
running the blueprint defense and I

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.240 
third long we go to waiting to try to
shorten<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.690> field<00:03:10.019> here<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.859> I<00:03:10.950> fork

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
shorten up the field here and I fork

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.190 
shorten up the field here and I fork
down<00:03:11.459> actually<00:03:11.790> did<00:03:12.329> some<00:03:12.540> decent<00:03:12.900> coverage

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
down actually did some decent coverage

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.870 
down actually did some decent coverage
there<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.650> was<00:03:14.010> able<00:03:14.129> to<00:03:14.280> get<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.459> ball<00:03:14.669> back

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
there and was able to get the ball back

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.699 
there and was able to get the ball back
so<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:15.900> if<00:03:15.989> we're<00:03:16.109> able<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.349> stop<00:03:16.530> them

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
so you know if we're able to stop them

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.530 
so you know if we're able to stop them
here<00:03:17.099> or<00:03:17.130> at<00:03:17.430> least<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.819> contain<00:03:18.239> them<00:03:18.450> I

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
here or at least you know contain them I

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.629 
here or at least you know contain them I
feel<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.900> we're<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.169> good<00:03:19.290> shape<00:03:19.349> but<00:03:19.859> he

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
feel like we're in good shape but he

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.129 
feel like we're in good shape but he
definitely<00:03:20.849> did<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.150> good<00:03:21.269> job<00:03:21.329> rolling<00:03:21.959> out

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
definitely did a good job rolling out

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.599 
definitely did a good job rolling out
switching<00:03:22.620> up<00:03:22.709> some<00:03:22.889> of<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.040> plays<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.489> can

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
switching up some of the plays you can

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.339 
switching up some of the plays you can
see<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:24.000> threw<00:03:24.209> an<00:03:24.299> egg<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.660> prat<00:03:24.959> abut<00:03:25.200> he<00:03:25.260> was

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
see we threw an egg a prat abut he was

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.589 
see we threw an egg a prat abut he was
able<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.620> hit<00:03:25.769> us<00:03:25.889> up<00:03:26.010> top<00:03:26.370> so<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:27.329> imperative

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
able to hit us up top so it's imperative

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.539 
able to hit us up top so it's imperative
obviously<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.530> not<00:03:28.709> only<00:03:28.739> score<00:03:29.220> here<00:03:29.430> at

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
obviously that we not only score here at

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.979 
obviously that we not only score here at
least<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.819> field<00:03:30.060> goal<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.389> we<00:03:30.540> waste<00:03:30.780> some

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
least a field goal but we waste some

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.740 
least a field goal but we waste some
time<00:03:31.099> just<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.280> nothing<00:03:32.669> crazy<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.419> happen

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
time just so nothing crazy can happen

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.050 
time just so nothing crazy can happen
towards<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.109> end<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.410> game<00:03:34.940> he<00:03:35.940> was

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
towards the end of the game he was

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210 
towards the end of the game he was
mixing<00:03:36.389> up<00:03:36.540> sending<00:03:36.780> blitzes<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.980> know<00:03:38.099> in

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
mixing up sending blitzes you know in

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.559 
mixing up sending blitzes you know in
coverage<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:38.760> that's<00:03:38.880> one<00:03:39.209> he<00:03:39.389> was<00:03:39.540> uh

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
coverage and that's one he was uh

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.659 
coverage and that's one he was uh
actually<00:03:39.989> run<00:03:40.349> committing<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.069> fortunately

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
actually run committing so fortunately

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.670 
actually run committing so fortunately
for<00:03:41.819> us<00:03:41.849> we<00:03:42.150> were<00:03:42.239> reading<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:43.470> hit<00:03:43.560> the

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
bear and it just leaves too much to the

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.270 
bear and it just leaves too much to the
outside<00:04:00.569> available<00:04:01.079> so<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.919> fourth<00:04:02.129> and
