00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.120
 hello friends this video I bring you as 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.960
 pass applications in turn that day but 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.990
 for elche 5 and samsung galaxy 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.720
 s3 since we have had problems this 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.720
 with several applications that are responsible 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.030
 to pass applications to memory 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.100
 since our choice does not mark 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.020
 romerismo nothing and all that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.930
 good in this case where will be our 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.390
 program that will help us to do it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.210
 the partition is very important to have the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 partition because that's why we could not be 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.930
 spend good game this is the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.570
 program jesus partition once what 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.559
 we unload and install and open the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.680
 part way we open it we wait 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.699
 that they charge good this one was not about 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.640
 these memories of 4 is already 8 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.650
 I also did it and most of all back 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.760
 with one and four is recommended 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.640
 recommendable exists if you have four this one 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.910
 is less than one gigabyte of the partition 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 and if you want 8 or 16 up you can 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.220
 be 2 gigs well let's start we give 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.619
 right click and we give the king moves 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.690
 partition once from this here we 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.030
 will come a bar that we have and the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.009
 megas that we have available in our 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.850
 memory and I have it form is in 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.729
 shoulders in this case is that we can 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.970
 put the equivalent that a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.900
 giga or whatever they want in this case 8 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.900
 3 mb we give in ok and ready 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.390
 they will be here below once 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.360
 this very well will ask us to give you in 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.570
 create partition we give us this will come out 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.130
 little box we give in English 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.190
 well here they will put the name they want 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.910
 how to recognize your second partition I 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.420
 I would put it with this and here we give it in 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.869
 primary and here in row system we put 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.090
 one of these 12 is or stress does not matter 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.260
 only our two anybody I 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 I'll put in two and once we give in ok 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.360
 very good 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.670
 after this we will go in apple and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.880
 we will give in 10 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.500
 let's hope he does this good I just 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
 upload this video because she had it 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.430
 uploaded but a damn the failed program 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.069
 of one recorded the audio this one already had 16 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.599
 reproductions this for those who 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.360
 they were watching it go up another 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.260
 NomÃ¡s time and just run with audio is 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.470
 very well and hopefully they will load 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.030
 I found this, I can do it 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.040
 thanks to several videos this 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.050
 I found how it makes partitions and everything 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.750
 that and a blog that I found comfortable 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.660
 to 0 in a partition 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.780
 plus the rate of good once we all 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.650
 will come out if we put it ok went very well and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.840
 We hope that the program will only be 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.510
 it restarted as well as in 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.220
 once all this has been all 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.220
 we come in closed 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:26.940
 we passed we started once we removed 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.560
 this question sorry 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.470
 let's see we throw this 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.020
 memory that is very important to be 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.060
 name everything because it does not detect it in 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.900
 cable or at least not me but it's very 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.420
 rich 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.260
 I recommend that in adapting well I do not 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.090
 we take out the one from this one 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.090
 and now 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.080
 we go to our phone 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.500
 Well wait for me so little game to not 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.200
 good friends how do you see the ones I made 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.750
 partition already and everything is ready what 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.079
 let's go to the app store and 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.630
 download this program in gmail link 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:26.880
 12v good once we open it 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.770
 and let's wait for it to load 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.380
 this you have been a window 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:37.580
 emergent that they are taught as point 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.580
 before this galleries allow tito and this 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.770
 this is the partition we call the 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.220
 partition we did nothing else these 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.440
 2 x 3 and 2 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.349
 I did with the two we accept 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.300
 it is not that there is in accepting the strength of 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.479
 will come another message that will tell you this 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.550
 that your memory needs I do not know that this 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.650
 sorry I forgot already but it does not matter 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.090
 what you have to do is give it 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.280
 in the options button 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.699
 we have the right to know and 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.790
 more to nibble on more and they'll be 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.740
 below and they give the quick restart a 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.800
 once they have given a resounding resignation 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.230
 we went to restart once restarted 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.100
 we wait 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.100
 and this 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.450
 Not seen 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.840
 sd 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.300
 will charge ready where it will be comfortable 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.479
 highlighted a medium thanks for 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.490
 accept to accept you and see you 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.740
 in the extraction of the dram we arrived 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.729
 in the same internal and for example here 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.879
 we have three applications all the distance 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:53.180
 bulks in our life the truth is not 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.490
 for me nor all this error if you want 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.120
 for example this one we have here we give 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.819
 here nothing more to the card movable 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.669
 well once you do not give in 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:09.349
 move sd card do not give in create 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:11.659
 link and you will leave this and where it says 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:14.509
 all this we give in forgiveness it 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.520
 he turned around and we accept him I care 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:20.300
 accept as we were we give in 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.919
 accept and this the application of two 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.950
 minds or we were united to the headquarters so that 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.840
 had we say in accepting 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.290
 and so you see that it is no longer 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.620
 find is not found we are going to 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.560
 be on the cd 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.400
 and here we do not go back anything 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.350
 we have that the good thing is that it's already happened 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.110
 you do not if nothing disappears in the 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.430
 headquarters do not worry it's already happened and for 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.800
 that you see uncertain that this already have 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.020
 emulated or output information 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.540
 launch and here this partition 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.030
 free sd card data that we did 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.260
 of two gigas I wanted it because it has 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.660
 eight gigas 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.150
 if you of 8 says either as the video 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.930
 well here is everything ready these can 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.600
 burn I hope you liked it point 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.180
 these subscribe like and pass I'll 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:15.120
 leave the change better and good that has 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.120
 been everything until the next and bye
