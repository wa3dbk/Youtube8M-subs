l3 stick up and it will always do it

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.620 
l3 stick up and it will always do it
facing<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:33.390> you're<00:01:33.509> gonna

of roulette you doesn't do this and I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.670 
of roulette you doesn't do this and I
know<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.629> says<00:02:51.780> different<00:02:52.170> control<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
game but for me this always seems to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.490 
game but for me this always seems to
work<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.690> don't<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:54.930> why<00:02:55.080> you'd<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.470> to

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
work so I don't know why you'd want to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
work so I don't know why you'd want to
do<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.830> way<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.550> if<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.390> want<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.599> do<00:02:57.659> it

do that way and if you want to do it

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.540 
do that way and if you want to do it
like<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.260> game<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.459> do

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
like that in the game you have to do

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.800 
like that in the game you have to do
these<00:02:59.700> controls<00:03:00.150> obviously<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:00.690> you're

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
these controls obviously if you're

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.390

facing<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.230> other<00:03:01.349> direction<00:03:01.440> because<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.310> was

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
facing the other direction because I was

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.009 
facing the other direction because I was
fixing<00:03:02.700> right<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.569> will<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.810> how<00:03:03.959> you

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.720 
fixing right that will be how you
obviously<00:03:04.470> have<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.800> opposite<00:03:05.190> way<00:03:05.459> if

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
obviously have to do the opposite way if

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.699 
obviously have to do the opposite way if
you're<00:03:05.849> facing<00:03:06.060> left<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.780> game<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.620> you

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
you're facing left in the game but you

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.800 
you're facing left in the game but you
see<00:03:07.860> here<00:03:08.040> some<00:03:08.190> examples<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.909> Java<00:03:09.480> tit<00:03:09.659> she

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
see here some examples that Java tit she

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.660 
see here some examples that Java tit she
just<00:03:09.989> beats<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.349> defender<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.800> easily<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.580> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
just beats the defender so easily and it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.070 
just beats the defender so easily and it
gives<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:12.390> you're<00:03:12.720> still<00:03:12.870> facing

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
gives you because you're still facing

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.449 
gives you because you're still facing
the<00:03:13.290> same<00:03:13.440> direction<00:03:13.650> you've<00:03:14.099> got<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> lot<00:03:14.430> of

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
the same direction you've got a lot of

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.540 
the same direction you've got a lot of
pace<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.000> you've<00:03:15.209> got<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.330> massive<00:03:16.190> gap<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
pace and you've got a massive gap on the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.190 
pace and you've got a massive gap on the
defender<00:03:17.970> who<00:03:18.060> was<00:03:18.180> previously<00:03:18.420> tracking<00:03:19.050> you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
defender who was previously tracking you

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.930 
defender who was previously tracking you
and<00:03:19.379> you<00:03:20.250> probably<00:03:20.310> seen<00:03:20.640> some<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.879> these

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
and you probably seen some of these

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.339 
and you probably seen some of these
clips<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.239> forward<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.659> wrap<00:03:21.840> there<00:03:22.080> with<00:03:22.230> some

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
clips a forward to wrap there with some

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.589 
clips a forward to wrap there with some
nice<00:03:22.500> skills<00:03:22.830> and<00:03:23.129> then<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.849> last<00:03:24.150> clip<00:03:24.390> here

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
nice skills and then this last clip here

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.880 
nice skills and then this last clip here
job<00:03:24.810> pitched<00:03:25.019> over<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.349> roulette<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.830> to

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
job pitched over the roulette just to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.320 
job pitched over the roulette just to
give<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.190> space<00:03:26.489> from<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.849> keeper<00:03:27.239> and

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
give some space from the keeper and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.390 
give some space from the keeper and
tucks<00:03:27.659> away<00:03:27.810> nicely<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:28.950> mean<00:03:29.069> that's<00:03:29.250> what

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
tucks away nicely and I mean that's what

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.440 
tucks away nicely and I mean that's what
the<00:03:29.489> roulette<00:03:29.730> does<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.150> give<00:03:30.330> you

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
the roulette does you know give you

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.180 
the roulette does you know give you
space<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.260> beats<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> defendants<00:03:32.099> so

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
space and the beats the defendants so

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.759 
space and the beats the defendants so
it's<00:03:32.310> an<00:03:32.400> awesome<00:03:32.610> school<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> learn<00:03:33.299> and<00:03:33.769> the

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
it's an awesome school to learn and the

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.130 
it's an awesome school to learn and the
final<00:03:35.069> skill<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.430> step<00:03:35.790> overs<00:03:36.180> these<00:03:36.780> are

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
final skill is step overs these are

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.869 
final skill is step overs these are
probably<00:03:37.470> my<00:03:37.530> out<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.099> these<00:03:38.250> three<00:03:38.580> feast

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
probably my out of these three feast

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.339 
probably my out of these three feast
this<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.209> my<00:03:39.330> favorite<00:03:39.659> skills<00:03:39.870> they're<00:03:40.110> just

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
this is my favorite skills they're just

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.369 
this is my favorite skills they're just
so<00:03:40.500> easy<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.459> effective<00:03:42.060> only<00:03:42.780> two<00:03:43.110> stars

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
so easy and so effective only two stars

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.869 
so easy and so effective only two stars
so<00:03:43.590> again<00:03:43.830> most<00:03:44.069> players<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.640> you're<00:03:44.760> going

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
so again most players that you're going

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.280 
so again most players that you're going
to<00:03:44.909> use<00:03:45.150> igner<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.629> do<00:03:45.780> these<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.200> think

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
to use igner to do these I think

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.229 
to use igner to do these I think
actually<00:03:46.530> all<00:03:46.680> players<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.340> these<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.730> see

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
actually all players can do these I see

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.039 
actually all players can do these I see
here<00:03:48.420> we're<00:03:48.569> now<00:03:48.629> they're<00:03:48.780> doing<00:03:48.900> them

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
here we're now they're doing them

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.809 
here we're now they're doing them
standing<00:03:49.440> still<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.129> also<00:03:50.310> do<00:03:50.549> step

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
standing still and you can also do step

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.759 
standing still and you can also do step
overs<00:03:51.180> from<00:03:51.599> a<00:03:51.870> running<00:03:52.200> position<00:03:52.319> as<00:03:52.620> well

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
overs from a running position as well

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.619 
overs from a running position as well
it's<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.040> same<00:03:53.220> thing<00:03:53.580> all<00:03:53.790> these<00:03:54.239> skills<00:03:54.510> can

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
it's the same thing all these skills can

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.929 
it's the same thing all these skills can
be<00:03:54.810> done<00:03:54.959> standing<00:03:55.290> or<00:03:55.739> running<00:03:56.069> then<00:03:56.790> on

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
be done standing or running then on

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.660 
be done standing or running then on
these<00:03:57.180> are<00:03:57.360> like<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:58.379> one<00:03:58.650> position<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.549> is

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
these are like on one position this is

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.890 
these are like on one position this is
how<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.819> do<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.420> want<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.569> do<00:04:00.780> the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
how you do it if you just want to do the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.720 
how you do it if you just want to do the
right<00:04:01.049> stick<00:04:01.439> obviously<00:04:02.099> you<00:04:02.220> can<00:04:02.370> do<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.580> with

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
right stick obviously you can do it with

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.339 
right stick obviously you can do it with
just<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> left<00:04:03.239> take<00:04:03.420> these<00:04:03.629> I've<00:04:03.870> only<00:04:04.110> tried

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
just the left take these I've only tried

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.479 
just the left take these I've only tried
these<00:04:04.500> standing<00:04:04.890> still<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.159> don't<00:04:05.370> know<00:04:05.430> if

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
these standing still I don't know if

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.850 
these standing still I don't know if
this<00:04:05.610> works<00:04:05.819> when<00:04:06.000> you're<00:04:06.120> running<00:04:06.239> but

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
this works when you're running but

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.929 
this works when you're running but
together<00:04:07.860> this<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.370> what<00:04:08.519> you're<00:04:08.640> going<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.790> do

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
together this is what you're going to do

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.149 
together this is what you're going to do
in<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.120> game<00:04:09.299> most<00:04:09.629> likely<00:04:10.080> you<00:04:10.500> have<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.739> be<00:04:10.860> you

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
in a game most likely you have to be you

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.300 
in a game most likely you have to be you
have<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.400> do<00:04:11.659> that<00:04:12.720> Plus<00:04:13.290> moving<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
have to do that Plus moving it to the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.310 
have to do that Plus moving it to the
right<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.790> moving<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.450> left<00:04:15.569> and<00:04:15.810> that

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
right and moving to the left and that

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.390 
right and moving to the left and that
gives<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.979> step

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
gives you the step

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.069 
gives you the step
that<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.639> see<00:04:17.850> me<00:04:18.000> do<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.449> in<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:18.720> example

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
that you see me do here in this example

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.140 
that you see me do here in this example
and<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.680> arena<00:04:19.859> but<00:04:20.220> obviously<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.030> you

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and in the arena but obviously if you

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.310 
and in the arena but obviously if you
want<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.389> do<00:04:21.449> it<00:04:21.540> in<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.690> game<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:21.930> have<00:04:22.199> to

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
want to do it in a game you have to

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.040 
want to do it in a game you have to
apply<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.860> game<00:04:23.009> situations<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.900> can

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
apply it to game situations and you can

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.900 
apply it to game situations and you can
see<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.410> by<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.620> exiting<00:04:26.130> over<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.460> skill<00:04:26.699> is

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
see the by the exiting over the skill is

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.420 
see the by the exiting over the skill is
just<00:04:27.150> when<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.449> exit<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.900> is<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:28.320> easy<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.860> be<00:04:29.400> a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
just when you exit it is so easy to be a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.909 
just when you exit it is so easy to be a
defender<00:04:29.970> but<00:04:30.180> in<00:04:30.960> that<00:04:31.199> example<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.680> this

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
defender but in that example that this

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.499 
defender but in that example that this
is<00:04:31.979> what<00:04:32.280> controls<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.820> would<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.090> done<00:04:33.270> by

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
is what controls I would have done by

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.230 
is what controls I would have done by
holding<00:04:33.840> an<00:04:34.560> election<00:04:34.740> trial<00:04:35.220> at<00:04:35.310> l2<00:04:35.460> as<00:04:35.850> well

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
holding an election trial at l2 as well

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.379 
holding an election trial at l2 as well
and<00:04:37.639> you<00:04:38.639> know<00:04:38.759> as<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.000> see<00:04:39.150> from<00:04:39.240> these

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
and you know as you see from these

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.659 
and you know as you see from these
examples<00:04:39.720> here<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.830> beats<00:04:41.070> defenders

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
examples here it just it beats defenders

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.180 
examples here it just it beats defenders
just<00:04:41.910> so<00:04:42.419> easily<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:43.080> mean<00:04:43.530> this<00:04:43.650> example<00:04:43.979> with

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
just so easily I mean this example with

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.379 
just so easily I mean this example with

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
Giovinco you know I didn't use other

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.510 
Giovinco you know I didn't use other
skills<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:46.199> step<00:04:46.500> over<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:46.860> weight<00:04:47.130> like<00:04:47.370> in

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
skills but step over the weight like in

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
that example or completely really

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.260 
that example or completely really
