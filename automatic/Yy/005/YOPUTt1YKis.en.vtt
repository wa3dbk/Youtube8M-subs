00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.130
 hello everyone, I know that time 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.810
 I shoot this video because I 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.439
 constantly do not like as already from my 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.660
 hair 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.329
 but I understand that there is nothing better 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.550
 I will do and will record as it is 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.949
 this is the third week of the experiment I already 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.680
 almost got used to everything but I can not 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.930
 to say that I get up early in the buzz I 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.019
 still suffering but not as much 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.600
 at first but not standing with butterflies in the stomach 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.430
 and i have no great mood since morning 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.840
 but of course I learned from the pros 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.030
 learned to go to bed early you know it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.399
 very important if i sleep till eight then i 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.070
 I get enough sleep like before before 12 this 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.809
 of course very big and cool advantages 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 this week was also supposed to write 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.190
 letter of improbability and learn 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.560
 make plans in the evening that's about 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.660
 plans this is a very cool thing cool 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.820
 practice that I liked 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.770
 especially in the work process that is with 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.320
 pm you write what you have to do 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.810
 tomorrow and you already have such a skeleton 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.850
 the backbone of the action and you will not forget anything 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.880
 it is clear that there is something new that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.890
 it leaves the list but there is a base 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.690
 at the weekend it is also very cool 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.819
 practice because very often we 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.319
 make the weekend we get up think so to us 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.239
 I will not have to do anything. 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.979
 couch and sit vkontakte and in the end 

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:37.349
 weekend pass but mediocre 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.660
 confess and if from the evening to make 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:41.780
 clear plans that you will be off days 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.619
 do it will be so magical 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.050
 motivator that will force you 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.209
 perform anything of these plans more 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.250
 this week we were preparing a report about 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.440
 bloggers and I managed to get to know 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 several famous youtube 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.220
 I can say that they made me 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.239

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.369

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.610
 with Ruslan Usachev appeared on my 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.680

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.069

 it's still all cool and becomes 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.630
 not so tasty and in general I brought 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.670
 a recipe that tastes practically 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.740
 exactly the same as in the pot at the same time 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.450
 It fits perfectly with pasta like sauce 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.230
 perfect for mashed potatoes 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.070
 creeps in general, the recipe is almost 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.410
 on every day 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.860
 elementary delicious necessarily 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.860
 try 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.250
 so we will need 2 chopped 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 bulbs medium sized chicken she 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.010
 me already in seasoning salt and pepper cream 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.810
 milliliters 250 kilogram of champignons 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.760
 frozen so much because 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.560
 they get along very well and two 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.380
 frying pan 1 die warmed up 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.720
 main and 2 smaller for chicken 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.450
 the main pan until golden brown 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.580
 fry wolf then add there 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.200
 Champignon 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.870
 Well, they have already gone there 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:33.590
 now we mix all this thoroughly 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:37.220
 with bow we reduce fire to medium 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.280
 close the lid leave for 15 minutes 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:44.400
 let the stew warm up at this time 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.190
 oil in the next pan and send 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:53.820
 there is roasting our chicken minute suspension 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.150
 each side chicken is ready just 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.300
 turn off the fire and leave it and mushrooms 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.220
 open and hold them on a big fire 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.310
 about ten minutes let a little evaporate 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.030
 moisture so not enough water 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.209
 evaporated 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.209
 add cream whole glass 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.769
 mix all this thoroughly 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.979
 reduce fire a little 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.020
 close the lid and leave another 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.330
 10 minutes to extinguish 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:35.580
 now we need only salt and 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:37.710
 add cinnamon mix and the dish is already 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.060
 almost ready just close 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.280
 lid leave it a little bit 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.750
 to infuse 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.800
 ideally it goes with potato 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.990
 mashed rice 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.610
 I've already even peeled potatoes 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.400

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.990
