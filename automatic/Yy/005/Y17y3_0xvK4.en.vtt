00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to differentiate the galaxy s5 active

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.799 
to differentiate the galaxy s5 active
from<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> current<00:00:31.650> galaxy<00:00:32.099> s5<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.030> well<00:00:33.600> they

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
from the current galaxy s5 and well they

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.090 
from the current galaxy s5 and well they
kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> figured<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.559> they<00:00:34.860> just

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
kind of figured it out they just

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.190 
kind of figured it out they just
launched<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.610> AT&amp;T<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.870> difference

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
launched it on AT&amp;T and the difference

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.709 
launched it on AT&amp;T and the difference
is<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> more<00:00:38.190> ruggedized<00:00:38.910> galaxy

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
