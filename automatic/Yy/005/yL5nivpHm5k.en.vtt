00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.910
 Here is such a flat cutter 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.029
 universal I him all my friends 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.710
 I recommend and use it myself 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.619
 that means you need to start 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.810
 start fixing 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.789
 here is a mount if you can review here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.309
 mount 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.860
 here two such holes two here 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.430
 here and below one is the one still 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.180
 and using the second hole we 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 adjust google talking technical 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 tongue working angle and here is the angle from 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.430
 it depends how we effort 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 work you to slash and need it

 tune to your height if you donâ€™t 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.940
 comfortable to use flat cutter 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.309
 then you need to change this angle 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.939
 experiment it several times 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.979

 I'll show you what you can do. 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 with this flat cutter I have 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.480
 vegetable remains here when I am 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.520
 I need to clean it up 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:30.150
 you have a fungus function 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.990
 ships running here I am again 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.780
 main functions are bidding on if we land 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.500
 no worse than seven centimeters take 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.480
 flat cutter like this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.410
 took it like this turned around and like this 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.990
 by such movements that we are 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:57.840
 loosen the earth deeper and and loosen and not 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:03.820
 it is necessary because I already said that 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:07.150
 turn the earth and do not need it here 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.540
 the main such function when I cook 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:17.280
 beds for planting here so loosened 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.100
 if i need if i need to grind 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560
 pebbles i can break them like this if 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:29.070
 I need to do 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:32.290
 grooves landing I would do so 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.230
 like this 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:41.099
 when she sowed again can they like this 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:44.049
 neatly take and close the ground here 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.930
 further if you don't need a deeper 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.260
 a plant happens when especially under 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.569
 the pick had to be avi baku 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:03:01.260
 drawings i take a flat cut in his hands so 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:06.819
 like a chopper and with such movements I can 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:10.150
 deeper like this 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.329
 steam pins forks chips fool 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.760
 if pieces 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.760
 this deeper gets a boost 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.189
 the window is still like this when we 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.790
 planted seedlings need to do in 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.099
 lune 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.010
 This little flat now 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:39.690
 pull up I make holes like this 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:44.190
 like that and knock out 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.190
 such a bait one second 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:58.890
 two rows like so 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:05.580
 so it turns out I need 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:10.260
 I need to go back 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.970
 put mulch please it is done 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.950
 easy and simple here are these vegetable 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.380
 leftovers 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:23.790
 Stores are not removed they have 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:26.539
 left and in the spring I will remove them like this 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.720
 it remains flowing 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:32.990
 until spring there is still an important moment so his 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.510
 sharpen 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:44.340
 you need to sharpen it here 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:49.620
 This little thing is a working thread and there is 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:54.479
 such a closer one can be indicated under 30 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:58.860
 degrees and then there is a little 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:01.800
 such under 45 m now knitted of course 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.280
 hard to see so you need to sharpen 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:14.550
 at 45 degrees this little corner 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:16.039
 small rent self-sharpening here 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.340
 [music] 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:25.169
 here here I need to rest there but if 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.800
 that's from usually carbon pro 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:34.110
 it is desirable to sharpen another tool 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.599
 I mentioned a notch here such 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.860
 tool 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:43.020
 called especially when i need 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.690
 grind something already need mulch 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.099
 grind and so here I take it now 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:54.780
 here dry stems they are not chopped a 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:58.500
 when I grow up let's say something 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.729
 is green and soft then i'm his 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.009
 so I crush 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:09.199
 like that 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:13.039
 Movement I spill m drug close 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.149
 film turns cooking 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.259
 compost 

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:20.990
 on the beds do not need to rush with these 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:26.539
 styles with foliage with humus right on 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:29.389
 garden beds consults these residues but 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.240
