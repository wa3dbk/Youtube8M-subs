park would do when attendance is low and
that<00:01:53.280> may<00:01:53.909> lead<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.210> some<00:01:55.079> bad<00:01:55.439> situations

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
spared no expense like Jon Hamm and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
spared no expense like Jon Hamm and
wanted<00:02:02.850> them<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.270> then<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.659> wouldn't<00:02:03.869> be

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
wanted them to do then they wouldn't be

like<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.319> only<00:02:10.470> need<00:02:10.679> one

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
like we only need one

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.040 
like we only need one
could<00:02:11.460> be<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> contract<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.810> was<00:02:12.930> I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
could be a contract and what was I

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.280 
could be a contract and what was I
saying<00:02:14.030> with<00:02:15.030> our<00:02:15.120> in-house<00:02:15.450> electrician<00:02:16.140> and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
saying with our in-house electrician and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.630 
saying with our in-house electrician and
we<00:02:16.410> could<00:02:16.560> probably<00:02:16.650> skimp<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.250> benefits

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
we could probably skimp on the benefits

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.730 
we could probably skimp on the benefits
package<00:02:17.790> for<00:02:18.210> our<00:02:18.240> tea<00:02:18.630> person<00:02:18.840> at<00:02:19.110> all<00:02:19.320> and

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
package for our tea person at all and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.560 
package for our tea person at all and
and<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.850> were<00:02:20.940> talking<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.390> bit

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and I know we were talking a little bit

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.500 
and I know we were talking a little bit
about<00:02:21.980> whether<00:02:22.980> or<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.850> authentic

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
about whether or not this is authentic

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.610 
about whether or not this is authentic
and<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:25.200> definitely<00:02:25.950> think<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:27.030> because

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and I definitely think it is because

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.560 
and I definitely think it is because
Jurassic<00:02:28.620> P<00:02:28.860> 2k15<00:02:29.610> doesn't<00:02:30.210> seem<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
Jurassic P 2k15 doesn't seem like the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.300 
Jurassic P 2k15 doesn't seem like the
kind<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.840> guy<00:02:30.990> try<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> pull<00:02:31.770> over<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.920> fast<00:02:32.160> one

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
kind of guy try to pull over a fast one

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.250 
kind of guy try to pull over a fast one
on<00:02:32.370> us<00:02:32.460> but<00:02:32.820> moreover<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.540> think<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.930> think<00:02:34.200> he

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
on us but moreover I think I think he

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.660 
on us but moreover I think I think he
might<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.560> someone<00:02:34.860> who<00:02:34.950> was<00:02:35.010> either<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.280> set

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
might be someone who was either on set

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.040 
might be someone who was either on set
or<00:02:35.820> had<00:02:35.940> access<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.390> someone<00:02:36.630> who's<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.840> set

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
or had access to someone who's on set

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.360 
or had access to someone who's on set
because<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.320> seems<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.830> prop<00:02:38.220> they

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
because this seems like a prop they

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.620 
because this seems like a prop they
would<00:02:38.460> have<00:02:38.550> created<00:02:38.700> for<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.180> what<00:02:39.600> really

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
would have created for it what really

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.510 
would have created for it what really
sells<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.500> me<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.770> those<00:02:40.890> little<00:02:41.070> details

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
sells it for me are those little details

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.100 
sells it for me are those little details
like<00:02:41.700> Jimmy<00:02:42.060> Fallon<00:02:42.480> being<00:02:42.690> there<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> lot<00:02:43.080> of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
like Jimmy Fallon being there a lot of

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
like Jimmy Fallon being there a lot of
things<00:02:43.350> we've<00:02:43.500> seen<00:02:43.650> before

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
things we've seen before

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.910 
things we've seen before

and the American Airlines page because

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.580 
and the American Airlines page because
that<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.610> seamless<00:02:47.880> piece<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.590> product

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
that is just a seamless piece of product

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.040 
that is just a seamless piece of product
placement<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:51.150> know<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.300> movies

nowadays they're all about that I mean
transformers<00:02:54.180> wars<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.420> little<00:02:54.600> more<00:02:54.720> blatant

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
transformers wars a little more blatant

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.790 
transformers wars a little more blatant
but<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:56.130> taking<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.940> subtler<00:02:57.300> route<00:02:57.800> we

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
but this one taking a subtler route we

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.860 
but this one taking a subtler route we
we<00:02:59.130> also<00:02:59.310> saw<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.700> for<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.540> original

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
we also saw that for the original

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.480 
we also saw that for the original
Jurassic<00:03:01.110> Park<00:03:01.440> they<00:03:01.650> had<00:03:01.860> really<00:03:02.130> similar

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
Jurassic Park they had really similar

Jurassic Park they had really similar

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.699 
brochures I believe with the video game
or<00:03:05.190> or<00:03:05.459> with<00:03:05.880> video<00:03:06.180> sales<00:03:06.570> as<00:03:06.930> well<00:03:06.990> as<00:03:07.260> you

or or with video sales as well as you

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.300 
or or with video sales as well as you
know<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:08.130> kind<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.880> fun<00:03:09.120> thing<00:03:09.440> but<00:03:10.440> does

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
know just kind of a fun thing but does

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.030 
know just kind of a fun thing but does
that<00:03:11.340> lead<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.970> legitimacy<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:13.040> copying

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
that lead to the legitimacy or copying

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.699 
that lead to the legitimacy or copying
it<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.540> think<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:16.050> think<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.380> term<00:03:16.560> they

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
it I think it's I think the term they

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.310 
it I think it's I think the term they
want<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.950> go<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:17.280> homage<00:03:18.140> because<00:03:19.140> it's

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
want to go with this homage because it's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.560 
want to go with this homage because it's
paying<00:03:19.560> tribute<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.580> you<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.120> think<00:03:21.450> it's

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
paying tribute to like you I think it's

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.970 
paying tribute to like you I think it's
adding<00:03:21.900> more<00:03:22.050> legitimacy<00:03:22.500> because<00:03:22.680> we've

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
adding more legitimacy because we've

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.370 
adding more legitimacy because we've
seen<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:23.489> style<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:24.150> pamphlet<00:03:24.720> before<00:03:25.050> and

seen this style of pamphlet before and

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.009 
seen this style of pamphlet before and
it's<00:03:25.530> definitely<00:03:25.800> in<00:03:26.010> keeping<00:03:26.459> with<00:03:27.019> Jurassic

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
it's definitely in keeping with Jurassic

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.160 
it's definitely in keeping with Jurassic
Park<00:03:28.260> Canon<00:03:28.800> hmm<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:30.300> let's<00:03:30.510> assume<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.870> it

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
Park Canon hmm so let's assume that it

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.040 
Park Canon hmm so let's assume that it
is<00:03:31.290> real<00:03:31.560> from<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.280> set<00:03:32.550> do<00:03:33.239> we<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:33.840> it

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
is real from the set do we think that it

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.500 
is real from the set do we think that it
was<00:03:34.200> released<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:35.040> purpose<00:03:35.640> or<00:03:35.970> prematurely

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
was released on purpose or prematurely

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.199 
was released on purpose or prematurely
like<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> pretend<00:03:37.440> leak<00:03:37.769> yeah<00:03:38.370> I<00:03:38.610> think<00:03:39.000> this

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
like a pretend leak yeah I think this

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.800 
like a pretend leak yeah I think this
was<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.840> hundred<00:03:40.170> percent<00:03:41.660> disguise

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
was a hundred percent disguise

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.750 
was a hundred percent disguise

for the movies so this is the kind of

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.780 
for the movies so this is the kind of
leak<00:04:26.170> that<00:04:26.530> actually<00:04:27.190> benefits<00:04:27.730> the
