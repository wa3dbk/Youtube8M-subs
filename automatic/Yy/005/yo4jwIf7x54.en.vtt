 hello friends in this video we will see a 

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:06.240
 alternative way to update the 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.490
 prime round 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.260
 well I know there is a way to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 authorize the round in the prime by means 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.570
 of the connectivity kit but apparently 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.490
 sometimes update the hp round 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.189
 prime by means of 15 with the activity 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.289
 it does not work so here I bring you a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.230
 alternative method that is based on the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.660
 information on this page 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.180
 well the first thing that I'm going to summarize 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.009
 the steps that this page follows throughout 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.260

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.050

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.970
 the round in hp well the first thing you should 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.820
 do is download the version of the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.790
 or the latest version that follows the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.140
 of the firmware of the rom of the atp prime 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.060
 in this by clicking here 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.780
 or here depending on the version that you 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.400
 want step number 2 you must perform the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.900
 calculator while pressing the key 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.710

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.600
