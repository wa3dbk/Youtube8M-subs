00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.520
 shorter of difference those I climb 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.500
 every Thursday in this video is going to 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.779
 teach in a fast way like 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.360
 to make a Swiss meringue is a bitumen 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.029
 super easy and serves to decorate 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.980
 cupcakes cakes desserts whatever you want 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.710
 you only need a girl blender 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.899
 medium large 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.899
 [Music] 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.660
 you only need 6 egg whites 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.120
 it has to have absolutely nothing of 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 yolk nothing if not a shred because if not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 you will not get up and also 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.050
 you need 2 cups of normal sugar or 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.140
 standard 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.140
 [Music] 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.850
 put a bain-marie on fire under the whites 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.770
 with sugar you will not put them on fire 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.500
 high because if you are not going to cook 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.750
 light warms and mixes until you see 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 that the sugar dissolves or that already 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 do not feel the sugar granites and 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.370
 Remove from fire 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.700
 [Music] 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.980
 and fines are super clean and dry you're going to 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.650
 Beat everything at high speed with 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.560
 blender until there is something like this 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.170
 at the last it is optional to add the juice 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.530
 of a lemon 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.530

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.090
 You can also use it to decorate 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.160
