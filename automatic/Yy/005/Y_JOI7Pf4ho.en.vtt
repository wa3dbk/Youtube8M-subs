okay<00:00:03.350> let's<00:00:04.350> see<00:00:04.470> let<00:00:04.620> me<00:00:04.650> get<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:05.069> more

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
okay let's see let me get a more

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay let's see let me get a more
interesting<00:00:06.029> planet<00:00:06.450> first<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.080> just

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
interesting planet first this is just

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.330 
interesting planet first this is just
kind<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.649> bear<00:00:07.859> planet<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:13.920> here's<00:00:14.280> my

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
kind of a bear planet so here's my

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.109 
kind of a bear planet so here's my
planet<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.800> like<00:00:16.800> Andrew<00:00:17.130> said<00:00:17.369> there's<00:00:17.730> it's

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
planet and like Andrew said there's it's

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.570 
planet and like Andrew said there's it's
all<00:00:18.420> generated<00:00:18.810> from<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.140> height<00:00:19.380> map<00:00:19.590> which

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
all generated from a height map which

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.370 
all generated from a height map which
gives<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> normal<00:00:21.240> map<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.689> then<00:00:22.170> that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
gives you a normal map and then that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.070 
gives you a normal map and then that
gives<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.890> map<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> controls<00:00:24.300> what

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
gives you a map that controls what

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
gives you a map that controls what
terrain<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.070> detailed<00:00:26.640> textures<00:00:26.939> are

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
terrain or which detailed textures are

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.689 
terrain or which detailed textures are
being<00:00:27.359> used<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:28.800> that's<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> final<00:00:29.279> texture

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
being used and that's the final texture

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.930 
being used and that's the final texture
map<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:31.380> that's<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> final<00:00:31.890> planet<00:00:32.189> I'd<00:00:32.759> like

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
map so that's the final planet I'd like

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.400 
map so that's the final planet I'd like
to<00:00:33.059> show<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.390> little<00:00:33.750> bit<00:00:33.989> about<00:00:34.140> how<00:00:34.380> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
to show you a little bit about how I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.520 
to show you a little bit about how I
actually<00:00:34.649> make<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> planet<00:00:36.110> let<00:00:37.110> me<00:00:37.200> clear<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
actually make a planet let me clear this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.850 
actually make a planet let me clear this
all<00:00:37.710> off<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> most<00:00:40.140> basic<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
all off so the most basic way we have of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
all off so the most basic way we have of
making<00:00:41.070> planets<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.210> put<00:00:42.420> down<00:00:42.590> you

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
making planets is to just put down you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.160 
making planets is to just put down you
know<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> single<00:00:44.010> stamp<00:00:44.660> it<00:00:45.660> gives<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> lot<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
know a single stamp it gives me a lot of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.380 
know a single stamp it gives me a lot of
control<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.579> tedious<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.270> make

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
control but it's really tedious to make

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.790 
control but it's really tedious to make
a<00:00:48.420> whole<00:00:48.629> planet<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.530> since<00:00:49.649> we

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
a whole planet like this and since we

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.139 
a whole planet like this and since we
have<00:00:49.829> four<00:00:50.160> billion<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.059> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
have four billion to go it's going to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.689 
have four billion to go it's going to
take<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> while<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:53.360> it's<00:00:54.360> really<00:00:54.780> much<00:00:55.079> more

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
take a while so it's really much more

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
take a while so it's really much more
efficient<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.760> me<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.680> single

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
efficient for me to put down a single

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.049 
efficient for me to put down a single
tool<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.160> makes<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.579> whole<00:00:59.730> bunch<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
tool that makes a whole bunch of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
tool that makes a whole bunch of
different<00:01:00.120> stamps<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.960> varied<00:01:01.800> in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
different stamps that are varied in

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170 
different stamps that are varied in
orientation<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.409> position<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.970> see<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
orientation and position and you see I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.250 
orientation and position and you see I
could<00:01:06.360> put<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.720> whole<00:01:06.930> bunch<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.170> these

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
could put down a whole bunch of these

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.660 
could put down a whole bunch of these
and<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.590> slightly<00:01:07.799> different<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> get

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and are all slightly different so I get

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.830 
and are all slightly different so I get
a<00:01:08.700> lot<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.909> coverage<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:09.780> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
a lot of coverage and I get a lot of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
a lot of coverage and I get a lot of
variability<00:01:10.260> pretty<00:01:10.619> cheap<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:15.560> can<00:01:16.560> also<00:01:16.710> make

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
variability pretty cheap I can also make

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.820 
variability pretty cheap I can also make
things<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.939> dig<00:01:18.570> into<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.960> height<00:01:19.140> map<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
things that dig into the height map to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.480 
things that dig into the height map to
make<00:01:19.979> oceans<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:23.240> can<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.360> stuff<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.490> both

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
make oceans I can have stuff that both

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850 
make oceans I can have stuff that both
digs<00:01:26.970> into<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.360> terrain<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.350> builds<00:01:28.710> up

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
digs into the terrain and it builds up

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.109 
digs into the terrain and it builds up
on<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> train<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.790> these<00:01:29.880> nifty

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
on the train so I can have these nifty

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.609 
on the train so I can have these nifty
craters<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.259> oceans<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> middle

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
craters that have oceans in the middle

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.179 
craters that have oceans in the middle
if<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.460> more<00:01:35.579> control<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
if I want more control I can have the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.460 
if I want more control I can have the
brushes<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:38.909> move<00:01:39.060> along<00:01:39.329> splines<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.439> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
brushes actually move along splines so I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.670 
brushes actually move along splines so I
can<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.890> long<00:01:41.100> continuous<00:01:41.790> rivers

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.590 

and<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:46.280> can<00:01:46.430> even<00:01:46.610> make<00:01:46.730> brushes<00:01:47.150> that<00:01:47.180> take

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
and I can even make brushes that take

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.840 
and I can even make brushes that take
the<00:01:47.780> base<00:01:48.020> height<00:01:48.290> map<00:01:48.500> as<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> conditional<00:01:49.280> and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
the base height map as a conditional and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.150 
the base height map as a conditional and
so<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.060> can<00:01:50.180> have<00:01:50.410> these<00:01:51.410> brushes<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:51.830> layer

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
so I can have these brushes that layer

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.740 
so I can have these brushes that layer
onto<00:01:52.400> each<00:01:52.640> other<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.180> then<00:01:53.270> kind<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.600> do<00:01:53.720> a

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
onto each other and then kind of do a

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.180 
onto each other and then kind of do a
little<00:01:53.990> inversion<00:01:54.560> thing<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:54.950> get<00:01:55.070> these

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
little inversion thing and you get these

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.260 
little inversion thing and you get these
weird<00:01:55.460> rippling<00:01:55.970> effects<00:01:59.410> and<00:02:00.880> as<00:02:01.880> Andrew

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
weird rippling effects and as Andrew

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.580 
weird rippling effects and as Andrew
mentioned<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.750> is<00:02:02.930> all<00:02:03.050> being<00:02:03.229> done<00:02:03.320> in

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
mentioned this is all being done in

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.469 
mentioned this is all being done in
swarm<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.100> is<00:02:04.220> our<00:02:04.310> particle<00:02:04.700> system<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.450> I

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
swarm which is our particle system so I

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.350 
swarm which is our particle system so I
have<00:02:05.660> really<00:02:06.110> good<00:02:06.229> control<00:02:06.710> over<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:08.000> paths

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
have really good control over the paths

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.820 
have really good control over the paths
that<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.630> particles<00:02:09.020> are<00:02:09.080> taking<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.649> for

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
that the particles are taking so for

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.030 
that the particles are taking so for
example<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.480> system<00:02:12.170> where<00:02:12.350> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
example this is a system where the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.400 
example this is a system where the
particles<00:02:13.490> only<00:02:13.790> make<00:02:13.970> 120<00:02:14.720> degree<00:02:14.990> turns<00:02:15.230> to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
particles only make 120 degree turns to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.570 
particles only make 120 degree turns to
get<00:02:15.530> these<00:02:15.680> cool<00:02:15.890> hexagonal<00:02:16.310> patterns<00:02:18.580> all

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
get these cool hexagonal patterns all

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.280 
get these cool hexagonal patterns all
that<00:02:19.790> means<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.870> make<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.020> lot<00:02:21.230> of

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
that means that I can make a lot of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.380 
that means that I can make a lot of
really<00:02:21.770> cool<00:02:21.950> brushes<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.000> really<00:02:23.239> cool

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
really cool brushes and really cool

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.510 
really cool brushes and really cool
effects<00:02:23.630> for<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.810> planets<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.520> there's

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
effects for the planets that there's

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.070 
effects for the planets that there's
some<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.790> are<00:02:25.910> terrestrial<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.720> there<00:02:26.989> are

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
some that are terrestrial and there are

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.460 
some that are terrestrial and there are
some<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.500> are<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.940> little<00:02:29.420> stranger<00:02:30.140> things

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
some that are a little stranger things

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.570 
some that are a little stranger things
that<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.739> would<00:02:30.830> never<00:02:30.950> actually<00:02:31.160> see<00:02:31.459> on

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
that you would never actually see on

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.150 
that you would never actually see on
earth<00:02:31.610> but<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:32.989> fun<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.739> encounter<00:02:34.130> a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
earth but it's really fun to encounter a

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.729 
earth but it's really fun to encounter a
planet<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.610> has<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.120> stuff<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.500> here's<00:02:36.680> my

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
planet that has this stuff so here's my

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.570 
planet that has this stuff so here's my
steampunk<00:02:37.100> planet<00:02:42.010> here's<00:02:43.010> my<00:02:43.070> baseball

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
steampunk planet here's my baseball

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:53.720 
steampunk planet here's my baseball
planet

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.940 

and<00:02:53.849> then<00:02:54.540> I've<00:02:54.659> got<00:02:54.780> an<00:02:55.019> organic<00:02:55.440> planet<00:02:55.830> as

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
and then I've got an organic planet as

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.750 
and then I've got an organic planet as
well<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.040> get<00:02:59.159> all<00:02:59.190> sorts<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.580> really

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
well so I can get all sorts of really

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.690 
well so I can get all sorts of really
wacky<00:03:00.390> effects<00:03:00.900> with<00:03:01.110> this<00:03:03.980> okay<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.250> now<00:03:05.580> I'd

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
wacky effects with this okay so now I'd

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.860 
wacky effects with this okay so now I'd
like<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.879> show<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.180> actually<00:03:06.540> some<00:03:06.659> of<00:03:06.810> my

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
like to show you actually some of my

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.589 
like to show you actually some of my
favorite<00:03:07.230> finished<00:03:08.069> planets<00:03:08.519> when<00:03:08.670> I've<00:03:08.760> put

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
favorite finished planets when I've put

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.119 
favorite finished planets when I've put
down<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> whole<00:03:09.989> bunch<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.260> tools<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.739> decided

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
down a whole bunch of tools and decided

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.360 
down a whole bunch of tools and decided
that<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.549> planet<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.150> I
