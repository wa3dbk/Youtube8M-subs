say that area hasn't really landed and I

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.230 
say that area hasn't really landed and I

show interest we will continue to build
functionality<00:02:34.160> through<00:02:34.370> voice<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:35.090> using

functionality through voice and using

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.470 
functionality through voice and using
the<00:02:35.510> our<00:02:35.780> gb<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.950> depth<00:02:37.280> cameras<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.030> we'll

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
the our gb and depth cameras and we'll

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.630 
the our gb and depth cameras and we'll
stay<00:02:38.690> focus<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:40.100> giving<00:02:40.490> the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
stay focus on that but giving the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.100 
stay focus on that but giving the
consumers<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.270> choice<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:42.080> pretty<00:02:42.830> critical<00:02:44.110> so

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
consumers a choice is pretty critical so

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.930 
consumers a choice is pretty critical so
I<00:02:45.470> mean<00:02:45.620> that's<00:02:45.800> that's<00:02:46.370> definitely<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> big

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
I mean that's that's definitely a big

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.700 
I mean that's that's definitely a big
change<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.510> know<00:02:47.870> from<00:02:48.320> what<00:02:48.470> we<00:02:48.590> were

charge back during the reveal and sales

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.480 
charge back during the reveal and sales
did<00:02:54.350> seem<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.590> pick<00:02:54.800> up<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.130> know<00:02:55.160> when<00:02:55.400> they

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
did seem to pick up you know when they

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.430 
did seem to pick up you know when they
finally<00:02:55.850> dropped<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.300> which<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.690> course<00:02:56.870> also

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
going to stop being supported but I am

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.090 
going to stop being supported but I am
glad<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.780> they're<00:03:03.170> not<00:03:03.350> trying<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.830> force

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
glad that they're not trying to force

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.970 
glad that they're not trying to force
devs<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:05.150> make<00:03:05.360> use<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:06.050> like<00:03:06.260> they<00:03:06.530> seem<00:03:06.830> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
devs to make use of it like they seem to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.980 
devs to make use of it like they seem to
be<00:03:07.130> doing<00:03:07.490> kind<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.120> early<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.840> was<00:03:08.960> like

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990

they<00:03:09.290> wanted<00:03:09.770> you<00:03:09.950> know<00:03:10.070> everybody<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.730> kind

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
they wanted you know everybody to kind

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.080 
they wanted you know everybody to kind
of<00:03:11.090> roll<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.960> these<00:03:12.590> Kinect<00:03:12.980> features<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.640> so

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
of roll in these Kinect features and so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.870 
of roll in these Kinect features and so
I<00:03:14.120> don't<00:03:14.360> want<00:03:14.690> anybody<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.320> force<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.160> but<00:03:16.760> at

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
I don't want anybody to force it but at

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.330 
I don't want anybody to force it but at
the<00:03:17.030> same<00:03:17.210> time<00:03:17.510> I'm<00:03:17.720> surprised<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:19.220> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
the same time I'm surprised that and I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.100 
the same time I'm surprised that and I
mean<00:03:19.460> this<00:03:19.610> really<00:03:19.970> goes<00:03:20.120> for<00:03:20.360> both<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.630> ps4

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
mean this really goes for both the ps4

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.070 
mean this really goes for both the ps4
and<00:03:21.350> Xbox<00:03:22.120> because<00:03:23.120> they<00:03:23.270> both<00:03:23.390> have<00:03:23.630> cameras

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
and Xbox because they both have cameras

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.020 
and Xbox because they both have cameras
but<00:03:24.260> I'm<00:03:24.350> surprised<00:03:24.740> that<00:03:24.890> more<00:03:25.130> devs<00:03:25.460> aren't

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
but I'm surprised that more devs aren't

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.850 
but I'm surprised that more devs aren't
allowing<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.720> do<00:03:26.840> things<00:03:27.050> like<00:03:27.350> at<00:03:27.620> least

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
allowing you to do things like at least

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.000 
allowing you to do things like at least
scan<00:03:28.250> your<00:03:28.490> body<00:03:28.730> or<00:03:29.120> your<00:03:29.540> face<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.710> put

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
scan your body or your face and and put

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.440 
scan your body or your face and and put
it<00:03:31.130> into<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.640> game<00:03:31.820> I<00:03:31.880> mean<00:03:32.180> they<00:03:32.300> were<00:03:32.360> doing

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
it into the game I mean they were doing

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.960 
it into the game I mean they were doing
that<00:03:32.810> back<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.800> old<00:03:33.830> days<00:03:34.460> of<00:03:34.790> like

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
that back in the old days of like

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.310 
that back in the old days of like
Rainbow<00:03:35.420> six<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.840> know<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.050> could<00:03:36.170> take<00:03:36.260> a

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
Rainbow six you know you could take a

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.060 
Rainbow six you know you could take a
camera<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:37.150> do<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.390> like<00:03:38.690> on<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.080> Xbox<00:03:39.500> 360

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
camera and do that like on the Xbox 360

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.210 
camera and do that like on the Xbox 360
and<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:41.360> I<00:03:41.690> think<00:03:41.840> pretty<00:03:42.350> much<00:03:42.560> all<00:03:42.920> the

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
and and I think pretty much all the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.850 
and and I think pretty much all the
other<00:03:43.250> platforms<00:03:43.880> but<00:03:44.720> maybe<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.710> has

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
other platforms but maybe it has

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.810 
other platforms but maybe it has
something<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.190> do<00:03:46.310> with<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.550> know<00:03:46.670> people

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
something to do with you know people

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.940 
something to do with you know people
scanning<00:03:47.240> in<00:03:47.480> objects<00:03:47.960> that<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.530> know<00:03:48.650> aren't

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
scanning in objects that you know aren't

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.170 
scanning in objects that you know aren't
their<00:03:49.100> face<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.520> course<00:03:49.700> because<00:03:49.940> I'm<00:03:50.060> sure

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
their face of course because I'm sure

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.570 
their face of course because I'm sure
you're<00:03:50.330> gonna<00:03:50.480> have<00:03:50.660> plenty<00:03:50.810> of<00:03:50.990> that<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:52.400> I

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
you're gonna have plenty of that but I

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.860 
you're gonna have plenty of that but I
figured<00:03:52.910> that<00:03:53.090> would<00:03:53.180> be<00:03:53.330> like<00:03:53.510> one<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
figured that would be like one of the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.750 
figured that would be like one of the
most<00:03:53.930> useful<00:03:54.230> game<00:03:54.800> applications<00:03:55.520> you<00:03:55.640> could

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
most useful game applications you could

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.420 
most useful game applications you could
use<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> for<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.510> maybe<00:03:57.440> there's<00:03:57.680> more<00:03:57.920> out

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
use it for and maybe there's more out

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.910 
use it for and maybe there's more out
there<00:03:58.760> but<00:03:58.820> I<00:03:59.030> think<00:03:59.300> and<00:04:00.110> I<00:04:00.500> think<00:04:00.650> a

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
there but I think and I think a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.650 
there but I think and I think a
basketball<00:04:01.490> game<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.850> forget<00:04:02.150> which<00:04:02.300> one<00:04:02.510> that

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
basketball game I forget which one that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.840 
basketball game I forget which one that
it<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:02.900> is<00:04:03.160> really<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.370> only<00:04:04.520> one<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:04.760> I've

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
it is is really the only one that I've

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.340 
it is is really the only one that I've
really<00:04:05.150> heard<00:04:05.360> about<00:04:05.510> doing<00:04:06.020> it<00:04:06.140> where<00:04:06.290> you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
really heard about doing it where you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.830 
really heard about doing it where you
can<00:04:06.530> take<00:04:06.740> your<00:04:07.010> your<00:04:07.340> face<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.880> really<00:04:08.480> scan

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
can take your your face and really scan

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.170 
can take your your face and really scan
it<00:04:09.020> in<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:10.280> know<00:04:10.400> Kinect<00:04:10.730> is<00:04:10.850> one<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.060> those

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
it in you know Kinect is one of those

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.300 
it in you know Kinect is one of those
devices<00:04:11.420> where<00:04:12.080> there's<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.590> sizable<00:04:13.070> crowd

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
devices where there's a sizable crowd

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.610 
devices where there's a sizable crowd
that<00:04:13.640> can<00:04:14.090> find<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.480> use<00:04:14.510> for<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.990> they<00:04:15.200> like<00:04:15.440> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
that can find a use for it they like the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.760 
that can find a use for it they like the
voice<00:04:15.800> features<00:04:16.450> they<00:04:17.450> maybe<00:04:18.020> like<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.560> hand

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
voice features they maybe like the hand

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.289 
voice features they maybe like the hand
controls<00:04:19.190> which<00:04:19.370> I've<00:04:19.520> never<00:04:19.670> found<00:04:20.000> really

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
controls which I've never found really

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.050 
controls which I've never found really
any<00:04:20.540> use<00:04:20.780> for<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.400> also<00:04:22.550> see<00:04:22.850> a<00:04:22.880> lot<00:04:23.000> of

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
any use for but you also see a lot of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.760 
any use for but you also see a lot of
people<00:04:23.300> using<00:04:23.510> it<00:04:23.690> for<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.290> know<00:04:24.410> their

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
people using it for you know their

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.010 
people using it for you know their
uploading<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.700> streaming<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.660> things<00:04:26.840> like

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
uploading and streaming and things like

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.750 
uploading and streaming and things like
that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
that

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.640 
that
but<00:04:28.120> it's<00:04:28.420> also<00:04:28.600> advice<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.290> we<00:04:29.470> knew<00:04:29.590> early

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
but it's also advice that we knew early

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.970 
but it's also advice that we knew early
on<00:04:30.100> didn't<00:04:30.910> have<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.210> be<00:04:31.360> with<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.080> Xbox<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:32.800> did

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
on didn't have to be with the Xbox I did

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.590 
on didn't have to be with the Xbox I did
a<00:04:33.010> video<00:04:33.190> before<00:04:33.520> they<00:04:33.820> announced<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.330> they

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
a video before they announced that they

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.090 
a video before they announced that they
were<00:04:34.660> dropping<00:04:35.140> it<00:04:35.260> saying<00:04:35.500> exactly<00:04:35.710> that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
were dropping it saying exactly that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.980 
were dropping it saying exactly that
saying<00:04:36.670> that<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.090> know<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.480> should<00:04:37.540> be

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
saying that you know it should be

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.600 
saying that you know it should be
dropped<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.560> given<00:04:38.830> an<00:04:38.920> option<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.340> people

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
dropped and given an option to people

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.850 
dropped and given an option to people
because<00:04:39.790> there's<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.780> lot<00:04:41.170> of<00:04:41.320> things<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:41.830> just

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
because there's a lot of things you just

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.430 
because there's a lot of things you just
don't<00:04:42.370> need<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.610> for<00:04:42.850> most<00:04:43.150> games<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:44.170> don't

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
don't need it for most games you don't

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.740 
don't need it for most games you don't
so<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.670> should<00:04:45.850> have<00:04:45.970> really<00:04:46.180> been<00:04:46.210> optional

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
so it should have really been optional

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.900 
so it should have really been optional
from<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.020> very<00:04:47.200> beginning<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.860> I<00:04:48.550> think<00:04:48.760> it's

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
from the very beginning and I think it's

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.580 
from the very beginning and I think it's
one<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.060> those<00:04:49.180> decisions<00:04:49.750> along<00:04:50.230> with<00:04:50.440> the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
one of those decisions along with the

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.240 
one of those decisions along with the
reveal<00:04:50.920> that<00:04:50.980> just<00:04:51.670> helped<00:04:52.120> give<00:04:52.540> Xbox<00:04:53.230> a<00:04:53.560> slow

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
reveal that just helped give Xbox a slow

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.860 
reveal that just helped give Xbox a slow
start<00:04:54.610> out<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> gate<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.240> know<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.630> held

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
start out of the gate you know it held

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.040 
start out of the gate you know it held
them<00:04:56.080> back<00:04:56.110> then<00:04:56.860> along<00:04:57.310> with<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.700> reveal<00:04:58.050> and

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
them back then along with the reveal and

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.040 
them back then along with the reveal and
and<00:04:59.440> then<00:04:59.620> making<00:05:00.100> sure<00:05:00.820> that<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.480> had<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.900> buy

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
and then making sure that you had to buy

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.960 
and then making sure that you had to buy
a<00:05:02.380> system<00:05:02.740> that<00:05:02.920> had<00:05:03.100> this<00:05:03.310> camera<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:03.790> and

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
a system that had this camera in and

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.520 
a system that had this camera in and
when<00:05:04.060> a<00:05:04.090> lot<00:05:04.300> of<00:05:04.390> people<00:05:04.630> didn't<00:05:04.990> want<00:05:05.020> it<00:05:05.320> they

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
when a lot of people didn't want it they

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.740 
when a lot of people didn't want it they
didn't<00:05:05.770> care<00:05:05.950> for<00:05:05.980> it<00:05:06.220> you<00:05:07.180> know<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.540> held

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
didn't care for it you know that held

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.140
