 barbershop that I find incredible 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.230
 they lowered a lot of memories to the 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.480
 memory and not the first one was Santa Claus 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 dream to fit Santa Claus all 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.659
 personal history important because it is 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 tales of the black count nor do I know that he's going to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.980

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.620
 is the hamas and when I knew they were going to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 stand out I wanted to miss seeing this 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.450
 and any event where you put two 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.980
 sheds and have profits is good 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.470
 to see what people like one throws a party 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.770
 for one is going to surprise how little is 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:12.480
 saw because it's all pretty secret and it 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.480
 see that it will be very nice 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.300
 we have the opportunity to be all 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.490
 together to honor the black or as 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.380
 can you say the in my work it's like that 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.100
 it is recognized and at the same time it is 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.840
 to people a different thing something that 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.340
 that generates union in helping each other 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.340

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.039
 all together celebrating because it is a 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.780
 little a profession fashion and that 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.250
 It seems that the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.390
 truth that is very inspiring is very 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.390

 reversal of the negron and in an event 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.490
 when 89 years ago I could not put 5 together 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.390
 in some religion this must exist 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.580

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.810
 surrounded by 20 bartenders who do 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.810
