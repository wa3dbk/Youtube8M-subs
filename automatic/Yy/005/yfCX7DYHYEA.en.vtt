00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.990 
different from a lot of other videos I
do<00:00:18.270> mainly<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.529> box<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.980> huge<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
do mainly because this box is huge so I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.550 
do mainly because this box is huge so I
guess<00:00:21.240> before<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.779> opening<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> box

and see what we've got in here just a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.710 
and see what we've got in here just a
random<00:01:20.250> point<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.670> box<00:01:20.909> has<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> handle<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
random point the box has a handle on the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.789 
random point the box has a handle on the
top<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:23.119> open<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.360> further<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.619> looks

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
top here open that up further it looks

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.370 
top here open that up further it looks
like<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.130> whole<00:01:26.759> thing<00:01:27.170> slides<00:01:28.170> out

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
like this whole thing slides out

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.560 
like this whole thing slides out
sideways<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.909> let's<00:01:30.119> see<00:01:30.329> exactly<00:01:32.270> what<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.390> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
sideways so let's see exactly what is in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.670 
sideways so let's see exactly what is in
here

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.730 

and<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.090> quite<00:01:40.750> an<00:01:40.840> amount<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.200> plastic

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
and that is quite an amount of plastic
