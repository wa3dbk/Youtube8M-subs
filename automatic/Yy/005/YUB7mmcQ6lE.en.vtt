to<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> I'm<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> draw<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> free<00:01:48.990> body

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to do is I'm going to draw a free body

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.680 
to do is I'm going to draw a free body
diagram<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:52.850> sprocket

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
diagram of sprocket

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.969 
diagram of sprocket
alright<00:01:56.690> well<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.530> should<00:01:57.680> be<00:01:57.710> pretty

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
alright well that should be pretty

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.950 
alright well that should be pretty
straightforward<00:01:58.130> let's<00:01:58.940> draw<00:01:59.240> make<00:01:59.750> sure<00:01:59.780> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
straightforward let's draw make sure I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.980 
straightforward let's draw make sure I
stay<00:02:00.050> in<00:02:00.320> frame<00:02:00.620> here<00:02:00.860> okay<00:02:01.010> I'm<00:02:01.190> good<00:02:01.400> um<00:02:01.990> I've

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
stay in frame here okay I'm good um I've

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.930 
stay in frame here okay I'm good um I've
got<00:02:03.050> my<00:02:03.350> sprocket<00:02:03.650> there<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.280> I've<00:02:04.700> got

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
got my sprocket there and I've got

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.570 
got my sprocket there and I've got
moment<00:02:05.510> in<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.229> direction<00:02:06.650> i'll<00:02:07.010> call<00:02:07.310> that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
moment in that direction i'll call that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.719 
moment in that direction i'll call that
moment<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:09.110> i<00:02:09.679> just<00:02:09.979> decided<00:02:10.550> that

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
moment a and i just decided that

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.820 
moment a and i just decided that
counterclockwise<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.840> positive<00:02:12.320> i<00:02:12.380> normally

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
counterclockwise is positive i normally

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.680 
counterclockwise is positive i normally
use<00:02:12.860> counterclockwise<00:02:13.490> positive<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.480> use

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
use counterclockwise positive so use

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.900 
use counterclockwise positive so use
that<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:15.020> as<00:02:15.110> well<00:02:15.140> I've<00:02:16.130> got<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.490> center<00:02:16.850> in

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
that here as well I've got the center in

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.870 
that here as well I've got the center in
there<00:02:17.680> okay<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.830> I've<00:02:18.890> got<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.130> tension<00:02:19.760> in

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
there okay and I've got the tension in

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.340 
there okay and I've got the tension in
the<00:02:20.000> chain<00:02:20.300> now<00:02:20.570> I've<00:02:20.660> got<00:02:20.780> attention<00:02:21.020> there

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
the chain now I've got attention there

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.690 
the chain now I've got attention there
but<00:02:21.440> don't<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.650> any<00:02:21.770> force<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> bottom

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
but don't have any force on the bottom

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.670 
but don't have any force on the bottom
remember<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.630> tension<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.110> chains<00:02:24.500> are

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
remember the tension that chains are

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.110 
remember the tension that chains are
kind<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:25.040> ropes<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.670> pull<00:02:25.910> on<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
kind of like ropes you can pull on a

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.240 
kind of like ropes you can pull on a
chain<00:02:26.390> it's<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.630> very<00:02:26.870> stiff<00:02:27.200> intention<00:02:27.800> you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
chain it's a very stiff intention you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.949 
chain it's a very stiff intention you
can<00:02:28.430> transmit<00:02:28.880> tensile<00:02:29.300> loads<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.750> chain

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
can transmit tensile loads of the chain

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.979 
can transmit tensile loads of the chain
you<00:02:30.440> can't<00:02:31.000> transmit<00:02:32.000> compressive<00:02:32.630> loads<00:02:32.840> of

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
you can't transmit compressive loads of

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.540 
you can't transmit compressive loads of
the<00:02:33.080> chain<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.680> can't<00:02:33.890> push<00:02:34.070> a<00:02:34.100> rope<00:02:34.370> while

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
the chain you can't push a rope while

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.729 
the chain you can't push a rope while
you<00:02:34.670> can't<00:02:34.850> push<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> chain<00:02:35.360> either<00:02:35.739> big

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
you can't push a chain either big

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.830 
you can't push a chain either big
sprockets<00:02:37.280> try<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.580> turn<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.760> way<00:02:38.209> little

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
sprockets try and turn this way little

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.240 
sprockets try and turn this way little
sprog<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.290> going<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.470> want<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.739> try<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:39.980> turn

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
sprog is going to want to try to turn

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.530 
sprog is going to want to try to turn
that<00:02:40.459> way<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.730> means<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.120> part<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.450> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that way that means that part of the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.150 
that way that means that part of the
chain<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.080> tension<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.770> one<00:02:42.980> isn't

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
chain is in tension and that one isn't

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.160 
chain is in tension and that one isn't
ok<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:44.180> one's<00:02:44.360> just<00:02:44.420> sort<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.690> coming<00:02:44.959> along

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
ok that one's just sort of coming along

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.440 
ok that one's just sort of coming along
for<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.470> ride<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:46.910> was<00:02:47.120> really

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
for the ride so if this was really

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.140 
for the ride so if this was really
intention<00:02:48.200> or<00:02:48.380> really<00:02:48.800> in<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.150> really

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
intention or really in a really

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.850 
intention or really in a really
stationary<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.989> was<00:02:51.170> really<00:02:51.560> feeling

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
stationary and I was really feeling

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.040 
stationary and I was really feeling
lucky<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.519> can<00:02:52.970> actually<00:02:53.090> sever<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.750> chain

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
lucky I can actually sever that chain

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.270 
lucky I can actually sever that chain
right<00:02:54.200> there<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.530> everything<00:02:54.709> would<00:02:55.010> hold

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
right there and everything would hold

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.540 
right there and everything would hold
yeah<00:02:56.150> that's<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:56.930> he'll<00:02:57.680> do<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.010> don't<00:02:58.430> try

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
yeah that's not he'll do that don't try

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.340 
yeah that's not he'll do that don't try
this<00:02:58.610> at<00:02:58.760> home<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.630> anyway<00:02:59.870> I've<00:02:59.989> got<00:03:00.170> that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
this at home so anyway I've got that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.990 
this at home so anyway I've got that
look<00:03:00.560> what<00:03:00.799> I<00:03:00.830> need<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.040> do<00:03:01.220> now<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.700> need<00:03:01.760> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
look what I need to do now is I need to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.190 
look what I need to do now is I need to
sum<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.540> moments<00:03:02.570> about<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.380> center<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.739> that

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
sum the moments about the center of that

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.180 
sum the moments about the center of that
sprocket<00:03:06.200> there<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.709> got<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.920> set<00:03:07.070> those

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
sprocket there and I got to set those

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.039 
sprocket there and I got to set those
moments<00:03:07.519> equal<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.030> zero<00:03:08.269> well<00:03:08.540> there's<00:03:08.870> only

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
moments equal to zero well there's only

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.120 
moments equal to zero well there's only
2<00:03:09.530> i've<00:03:10.400> got<00:03:10.640> this<00:03:10.820> little<00:03:11.120> radius<00:03:11.660> here<00:03:12.130> i'll

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
2 i've got this little radius here i'll

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.910 
2 i've got this little radius here i'll
call<00:03:13.430> RA<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:15.019> i've<00:03:15.200> got<00:03:15.230> let's<00:03:15.650> see<00:03:15.739> that's

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
call RA so i've got let's see that's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.490 
call RA so i've got let's see that's
going<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.310> be<00:03:16.400> positive<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.090> MA<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.810> positive

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
going to be positive so MA is positive

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.229 
going to be positive so MA is positive
minus<00:03:19.370> R<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:20.890> times<00:03:21.890> T<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:22.820> has<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.030> equal

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
minus R a times T and that has to equal

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.479 
minus R a times T and that has to equal
zero<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:23.989> what<00:03:24.110> I've<00:03:24.200> got<00:03:24.410> there<00:03:24.680> some<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
zero so what I've got there some of the

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.069 
zero so what I've got there some of the
moments<00:03:25.700> about<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.360> center<00:03:26.630> that<00:03:26.780> sprocket

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
moments about the center that sprocket

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.720 
moments about the center that sprocket
equals<00:03:27.560> zero<00:03:27.739> that's<00:03:28.040> an<00:03:28.220> equation<00:03:28.519> of

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
equals zero that's an equation of

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.000 
equals zero that's an equation of
equilibrium<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:29.630> want<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.290> clean<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.680> up<00:03:30.739> a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
equilibrium I want to clean this up a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.910 
equilibrium I want to clean this up a
little<00:03:31.160> bit<00:03:31.400> all<00:03:31.519> right

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
little bit all right

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.100 
little bit all right
ma<00:03:32.130> equals<00:03:32.730> R<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.709> times<00:03:34.709> T<00:03:35.900> okay<00:03:36.900> I've<00:03:36.989> just

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
ma equals R a times T okay I've just

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.350 
ma equals R a times T okay I've just
moved<00:03:37.319> ma<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.890> other<00:03:38.010> side<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.459> equal

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
moved ma to the other side of the equal

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.059 
moved ma to the other side of the equal
sign<00:03:39.390> so<00:03:39.599> there<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.080> go<00:03:40.110> I've<00:03:40.440> got<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
sign so there you go I've got that the

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.530 
sign so there you go I've got that the
problem<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.580> right<00:03:41.730> now<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.970> only<00:03:42.060> number<00:03:42.510> i

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
problem is right now the only number i

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.120 
problem is right now the only number i
know<00:03:42.660> there<00:03:43.020> is<00:03:43.140> alright<00:03:43.590> that's<00:03:43.800> 50

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
know there is alright that's 50

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.550 
know there is alright that's 50
millimeters<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.330> I've<00:03:45.450> got<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:45.930> equation<00:03:46.290> but

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
millimeters so I've got one equation but

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.320 
millimeters so I've got one equation but
I<00:03:46.620> got<00:03:46.800> two<00:03:47.010> unknowns<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.730> right<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.090> need<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
I got two unknowns all right I need to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.330 
I got two unknowns all right I need to
have<00:03:48.660> as<00:03:48.840> many<00:03:48.989> equations<00:03:49.440> unknown<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.190> what

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
have as many equations unknown so what

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.910 
have as many equations unknown so what
am<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.489> going<00:03:50.610> to<00:03:50.700> do<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:51.569> i<00:03:51.750> could<00:03:51.930> find<00:03:52.170> t<00:03:52.590> i

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
am I going to do if i could find t i

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.440 
am I going to do if i could find t i
could<00:03:53.100> back<00:03:53.280> out<00:03:53.459> all<00:03:53.700> right<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:54.180> would<00:03:54.330> be

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
could back out all right that would be

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.229 
could back out all right that would be
great<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.800> let's<00:03:56.130> see<00:03:56.280> let's<00:03:56.459> call<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.700> this

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
great so let's see let's call that this

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.960 
great so let's see let's call that this
was<00:03:57.420> step<00:03:57.660> one<00:03:57.920> step<00:03:58.920> two<00:03:59.100> well<00:03:59.670> got<00:03:59.940> another

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
was step one step two well got another

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.479 
was step one step two well got another
part<00:04:00.569> here<00:04:00.840> I've<00:04:00.930> got<00:04:01.110> this<00:04:01.230> other<00:04:01.489> sprocket

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
part here I've got this other sprocket

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.640 
part here I've got this other sprocket
let<00:04:02.760> me<00:04:02.880> use<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.540> my<00:04:03.660> second<00:04:04.440> equation

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
let me use that for my second equation

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.860 
let me use that for my second equation
here<00:04:05.190> we<00:04:05.370> draw<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.670> another<00:04:06.269> free<00:04:06.630> body

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
here we draw the another free body

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.830 
here we draw the another free body
diagram<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:08.250> I've<00:04:08.400> got<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.940> moment<00:04:09.569> there<00:04:09.720> i'll

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
diagram and I've got a moment there i'll

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.650 
diagram and I've got a moment there i'll
call<00:04:10.110> mb<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.370> I've<00:04:11.580> got<00:04:11.790> that<00:04:11.910> same<00:04:12.239> tension

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
call mb and I've got that same tension

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.340 
call mb and I've got that same tension
now<00:04:13.080> pointing<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.739> other<00:04:13.890> direction<00:04:14.269> and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
now pointing in the other direction and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.030 
now pointing in the other direction and
I've<00:04:16.350> got<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.889> radius<00:04:17.489> be<00:04:17.850> there<00:04:18.470> okay<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.010> I

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
I've got this radius be there okay so I

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.310 
I've got this radius be there okay so I
know<00:04:20.310> what<00:04:20.489> radius<00:04:20.820> B<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.299> know<00:04:21.540> what<00:04:21.840> mb<00:04:22.169> is

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
know what radius B is I know what mb is

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.080 
know what radius B is I know what mb is
ok<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:23.100> is<00:04:23.250> starting<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.610> shape<00:04:23.880> up

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
ok this is this is starting to shape up

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.570 
ok this is this is starting to shape up
so<00:04:24.900> let's<00:04:25.229> see<00:04:25.880> RB<00:04:27.290> times<00:04:28.290> Tina's<00:04:29.220> going<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.460> go

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
so let's see RB times Tina's going to go

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.219 
so let's see RB times Tina's going to go
in<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.790> counterclockwise<00:04:30.150> direction<00:04:30.360> so

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
in a counterclockwise direction so

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.870 
in a counterclockwise direction so
that's<00:04:31.410> positive<00:04:31.710> according<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.520> my<00:04:32.639> sign

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
that's positive according to my sign

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.790 
that's positive according to my sign
convention<00:04:33.680> minus<00:04:34.680> MB<00:04:35.840> equal<00:04:36.840> 0<00:04:37.200> okay<00:04:37.560> that's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
convention minus MB equal 0 okay that's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.620 
convention minus MB equal 0 okay that's
that's<00:04:38.010> my<00:04:38.160> statement<00:04:38.610> at<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.090> moments<00:04:39.539> about

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
that's my statement at the moments about

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.860 
that's my statement at the moments about
that<00:04:39.960> Center<00:04:40.289> Point<00:04:40.320> are<00:04:41.120> some<00:04:42.120> 20<00:04:42.479> that's<00:04:42.720> in

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
that Center Point are some 20 that's in

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.590 
that Center Point are some 20 that's in
static<00:04:43.229> people<00:04:43.530> they're<00:04:43.680> real<00:04:44.120> okay<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.180> if<00:04:45.479> i

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
static people they're real okay so if i

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.230 
static people they're real okay so if i
wanted<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:45.990> solve<00:04:46.260> for<00:04:46.590> T<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.430> know<00:04:47.700> what<00:04:47.910> RB<00:04:48.210> is

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
wanted to solve for T I know what RB is

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.120 
wanted to solve for T I know what RB is
and<00:04:48.570> I<00:04:48.630> know<00:04:48.690> what<00:04:48.840> MBS<00:04:49.229> but<00:04:49.410> all<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.710> tea<00:04:49.950> is

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
and I know what MBS but all the tea is

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.580 
and I know what MBS but all the tea is
so<00:04:50.880> T<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.450> going<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.810> be<00:04:51.990> M<00:04:52.490> be<00:04:53.720> over<00:04:54.720> let's<00:04:55.289> see

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
so T is going to be M be over let's see

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.830 
so T is going to be M be over let's see
our<00:04:55.890> be<00:04:56.220> right<00:04:57.080> okay<00:04:58.080> well<00:04:58.620> what's<00:04:58.800> what's<00:04:59.280> a

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
our be right okay well what's what's a

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.010 
our be right okay well what's what's a
mb<00:05:00.840> that's<00:05:01.140> going<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.470> be<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:02.220> mass<00:05:03.020> times

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
mb that's going to be that mass times

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.529 
mb that's going to be that mass times
acceleration<00:05:04.440> of<00:05:05.039> gravity<00:05:05.510> times<00:05:06.530> that

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.740 
ok now let's let's make sure we have the
intermediate<00:05:38.370> result<00:05:38.730> there<00:05:38.940> that's<00:05:39.510> going

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
intermediate result there that's going

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.430 
intermediate result there that's going
to<00:05:39.840> be<00:05:40.080> let's<00:05:40.770> see<00:05:41.330> 700<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.450> that<00:05:43.350> was

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
to be let's see 700 and that was

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:54.320 
to be let's see 700 and that was
terrible<00:05:47.270> 730<00:05:49.010> 5.75<00:05:50.010> a<00:05:50.490> new<00:05:51.060> meters<00:05:51.720> or<00:05:52.550> 0.2<00:05:53.550> 50

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
terrible 730 5.75 a new meters or 0.2 50

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.920 
terrible 730 5.75 a new meters or 0.2 50
meters<00:05:54.870> and<00:05:55.140> that's<00:05:55.860> going<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.130> work<00:05:56.340> out<00:05:56.610> to

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.040 

2943<00:06:01.490> movies<00:06:02.490> that's<00:06:02.850> that's<00:06:03.570> a<00:06:03.660> good<00:06:03.870> thing

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
2943 movies that's that's a good thing

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.320 
2943 movies that's that's a good thing
to<00:06:04.110> know<00:06:04.260> so<00:06:04.620> it's<00:06:05.430> important<00:06:05.940> there<00:06:06.090> so<00:06:06.240> I'm

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
to know so it's important there so I'm

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.910 
to know so it's important there so I'm
going<00:06:06.480> to<00:06:06.510> put<00:06:06.570> under<00:06:06.900> line<00:06:07.200> under<00:06:07.500> that's<00:06:07.710> no

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
going to put under line under that's no

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.300 
going to put under line under that's no
need<00:06:08.160> result<00:06:08.610> now<00:06:09.300> I<00:06:09.660> can<00:06:10.620> go<00:06:10.740> back<00:06:10.980> down<00:06:11.010> to

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
need result now I can go back down to

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.850 
need result now I can go back down to
here<00:06:11.790> and<00:06:12.210> I<00:06:12.720> can<00:06:12.870> put<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.230> number<00:06:13.530> i<00:06:13.560> just

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
here and I can put the number i just

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.620 
here and I can put the number i just
calculated<00:06:14.220> into<00:06:14.670> the<00:06:14.940> equation<00:06:15.390> i<00:06:15.480> had

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
calculated into the equation i had

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.390 
calculated into the equation i had
before<00:06:16.700> 0.0<00:06:17.700> 50<00:06:18.480> meters<00:06:19.080> times<00:06:19.380> T<00:06:19.830> which<00:06:20.040> I<00:06:20.190> now

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
before 0.0 50 meters times T which I now

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.400 
before 0.0 50 meters times T which I now
know<00:06:21.710> 2943<00:06:22.940> Newtons<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.120> if<00:06:24.630> I<00:06:24.750> work<00:06:24.960> that<00:06:25.200> up

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
know 2943 Newtons and if I work that up

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.920 
know 2943 Newtons and if I work that up
and<00:06:25.590> stay<00:06:25.830> in<00:06:25.980> frame<00:06:26.220> i<00:06:26.430> am<00:06:26.760> i'm<00:06:27.390> going<00:06:27.600> to<00:06:27.690> get

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
and stay in frame i am i'm going to get

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:36.410 
and stay in frame i am i'm going to get
let's<00:06:28.680> see<00:06:30.380> 147<00:06:31.380> point<00:06:32.630> 15<00:06:34.520> meters<00:06:35.520> ok<00:06:36.360> so

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
let's see 147 point 15 meters ok so

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.630 
let's see 147 point 15 meters ok so
there<00:06:36.690> I've<00:06:36.810> got<00:06:36.840> it<00:06:37.230> so<00:06:37.830> I've<00:06:37.920> done<00:06:38.130> given

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
there I've got it so I've done given

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.030 
there I've got it so I've done given
fine<00:06:38.940> solution<00:06:39.570> a<00:06:39.750> small<00:06:40.020> number<00:06:40.470> that<00:06:40.620> is<00:06:40.800> too

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
fine solution a small number that is too

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.330 
fine solution a small number that is too
that's<00:06:41.220> a<00:06:41.310> lot<00:06:41.340> smaller<00:06:41.760> than<00:06:43.130> that<00:06:44.130> number

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
that's a lot smaller than that number

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.190 
that's a lot smaller than that number
right<00:06:44.610> there<00:06:44.640> that's<00:06:45.000> why<00:06:45.210> this<00:06:45.720> is<00:06:45.810> gearing

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
right there that's why this is gearing

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.230 
right there that's why this is gearing
down<00:06:46.320> this<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:46.950> a<00:06:46.980> mechanical<00:06:47.250> advantage<00:06:47.700> so

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
down this is a mechanical advantage so

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.580 
down this is a mechanical advantage so
this<00:06:48.360> is<00:06:48.510> what<00:06:49.080> a<00:06:49.110> mechanical<00:06:49.560> advantage

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
this is what a mechanical advantage

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.910 
this is what a mechanical advantage
looks<00:06:50.130> like<00:06:50.630> let's<00:06:51.630> talk<00:06:51.840> about<00:06:52.020> now<00:06:52.440> the

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
looks like let's talk about now the

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.520 
looks like let's talk about now the
format<00:06:53.910> here<00:06:54.060> I've<00:06:54.150> got<00:06:54.180> given<00:06:54.540> fine<00:06:54.900> solution

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
format here I've got given fine solution
