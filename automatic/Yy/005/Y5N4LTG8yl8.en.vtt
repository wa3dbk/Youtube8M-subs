research<00:02:50.500> into<00:02:50.829> faerie<00:02:51.549> legend<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.120> folklore

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
and one of the things I found out was

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.270 
and one of the things I found out was
that<00:02:54.250> wearing<00:02:54.790> red<00:02:54.969> can<00:02:55.209> protect<00:02:55.599> you<00:02:55.780> from

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
that wearing red can protect you from

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.360 
that wearing red can protect you from
malevolent<00:02:57.280> fairies<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.290> do<00:02:59.950> tend<00:03:00.220> to

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
malevolent fairies and so I do tend to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.869 
malevolent fairies and so I do tend to
work<00:03:00.519> quite<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> lot<00:03:00.909> of<00:03:01.000> red<00:03:01.180> clothes

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
work quite a lot of red clothes

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.979 
work quite a lot of red clothes
well<00:03:03.879> I've<00:03:03.970> never<00:03:04.090> actually<00:03:04.269> seen<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.629> fairy

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989

but you know what people believe in lots

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.110

of<00:03:08.560> things<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.859> they<00:03:08.950> can't<00:03:09.189> see<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.760> it's

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
of things that they can't see so it's

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.020 
of things that they can't see so it's
better<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.450> be<00:03:10.540> on<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.720> safe<00:03:10.900> side<00:03:10.930> and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
better to be on the safe side and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:34.059 
better to be on the safe side and
protect<00:03:13.030> yourself<00:03:13.389> just<00:03:13.569> in<00:03:13.720> case
