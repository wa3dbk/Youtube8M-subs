00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
themselves in the hole but I think

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.750 
themselves in the hole but I think
Sanchez<00:02:56.989> just<00:02:57.349> is<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> great<00:02:57.829> job<00:02:58.069> of<00:02:58.130> just

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
Sanchez just is a great job of just

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.059

keeping<00:02:58.819> everything<00:02:59.209> in<00:02:59.420> perspective<00:03:00.069> never

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
keeping everything in perspective never

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.140

letting<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.340> highs<00:03:01.489> get<00:03:01.700> too<00:03:01.849> high<00:03:02.000> or<00:03:02.060> too

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
letting the highs get too high or too

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.240 
letting the highs get too high or too
low<00:03:02.239> too<00:03:02.599> low<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.049> think<00:03:03.290> he's<00:03:03.410> like<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.010> said

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
being a young quarterback I think he's

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.449 
being a young quarterback I think he's
done<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.900> very<00:03:05.930> well<00:03:06.170> why<00:03:07.160> do<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.370> think

Sean Greene has had as much of an impact
as<00:03:11.000> quickly<00:03:11.329> as<00:03:11.569> he<00:03:11.690> has<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.170> year<00:03:12.379> when<00:03:12.470> you

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
as quickly as he has this year when you

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.839 
as quickly as he has this year when you
consider<00:03:12.799> he<00:03:13.099> wasn't<00:03:13.400> getting<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.640> ton<00:03:13.819> of

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
consider he wasn't getting a ton of

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.640 
consider he wasn't getting a ton of
carries<00:03:14.299> before<00:03:14.599> Leon<00:03:14.870> Washington<00:03:15.049> got<00:03:15.500> hurt

i just i think is a tribute also to the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.949 
i just i think is a tribute also to the
coaching<00:03:31.430> staff<00:03:31.459> because<00:03:32.120> they've<00:03:32.389> allowed

coaching staff because they've allowed

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.690 
coaching staff because they've allowed
those<00:03:33.560> players<00:03:33.859> to<00:03:34.160> be<00:03:34.280> put<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.609> right

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
position and then it goes to those

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.170 
position and then it goes to those
players<00:03:36.769> because<00:03:37.190> they've<00:03:37.370> had<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.549> skill<00:03:37.940> and

success let's talk about this colts game
the<00:03:42.230> first<00:03:42.410> time<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:43.310> face<00:03:43.639> them<00:03:43.880> brick

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
the first time you face them brick

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.059 
the first time you face them brick
you're<00:03:44.959> only<00:03:45.169> dealing<00:03:45.440> with<00:03:45.650> dwight<00:03:46.040> freeney

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
you're only dealing with dwight freeney

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.190 
you're only dealing with dwight freeney
so<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.790> was<00:03:46.910> half<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.450> great<00:03:47.630> pass-rushing

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200

tandem now that Robert Mathis is back in

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.379 
tandem now that Robert Mathis is back in
the<00:03:50.930> mix<00:03:51.139> how<00:03:51.440> does<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.829> change<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.970> lines

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
the mix how does that change the lines

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.900 
the mix how does that change the lines
approach<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.349> your<00:03:54.919> checklist<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.579> things<00:03:55.639> to

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
approach and your checklist of things to

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.940 
approach and your checklist of things to
do<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.329> try<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.599> make<00:03:57.049> sure<00:03:57.319> that<00:03:57.560> they<00:03:57.829> don't

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
do to try to make sure that they don't

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.920 
do to try to make sure that they don't
get<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.220> hand<00:03:58.489> on<00:03:58.609> Sanchez<00:03:59.150> well<00:03:59.540> again<00:03:59.780> you

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
get a hand on Sanchez well again you

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.349 
get a hand on Sanchez well again you
know<00:04:00.049> that<00:04:00.230> they<00:04:00.380> have<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> great<00:04:00.950> defense

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
know that they have a great defense

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.940 
know that they have a great defense
obviously<00:04:02.359> those<00:04:02.510> are<00:04:02.540> just<00:04:02.750> two<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.739> many

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
obviously those are just two of the many

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.400 
obviously those are just two of the many
players<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:04.669> make<00:04:04.849> up<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.180> roster<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:06.230> as

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
players that make up that roster and as

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.289 
players that make up that roster and as
offensive<00:04:06.889> unit<00:04:07.220> I<00:04:07.489> think<00:04:07.910> will<00:04:08.030> not<00:04:08.150> put

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
offensive unit I think will not put

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.940 
offensive unit I think will not put
together<00:04:08.569> great<00:04:08.870> plan<00:04:09.139> so<00:04:09.410> that<00:04:09.440> we<00:04:09.680> can<00:04:09.829> be

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
together great plan so that we can be

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.009 
together great plan so that we can be
successful<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.790> like<00:04:11.599> I<00:04:11.690> said<00:04:11.750> we've<00:04:11.989> been

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
successful and like I said we've been

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.360 
successful and like I said we've been
we've<00:04:12.380> had<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> lot<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.739> success<00:04:13.160> this<00:04:13.310> year

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
we've had a lot of success this year

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.789 
we've had a lot of success this year
against<00:04:13.880> great<00:04:14.599> pass-rusher<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.500> think

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
against great pass-rusher so I think

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.349 
against great pass-rusher so I think
we're<00:04:16.099> feeling<00:04:16.370> confident<00:04:16.789> what<00:04:16.970> we<00:04:17.090> can<00:04:17.269> do

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
we're feeling confident what we can do

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.819 
we're feeling confident what we can do
against<00:04:17.630> those<00:04:17.780> gentlemen<00:04:18.169> another<00:04:18.620> guy

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829
