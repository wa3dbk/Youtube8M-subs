00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
The fact that the most advanced technology
is revolutionizing the world of beauty is

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.520
something that we already knew. But what we
didn't know up until now is that

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.280
medical advances may also help
to take care of our skin and to improve

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.339
our physical appearance.

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:19.339
A cutting-edge world research project
that is 100% Spanish.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.939
Imagine a personalized beauty
treatment

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.829
that takes care of you from the inside out,
according to what your genetics need.

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.529
A technology that will give you exactly
what your skin needs; capable of

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.180
predicting what you will need in the
future.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.050
Personalized cosmetics are a 
reality nowadays that are derived from

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.310
a small sample of DNA. What we
do is extract a DNA sample

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.430
of 2mL of saliva,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.550
of 2mL of saliva,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.210
and by doing that we are able to
determine 35 SNP's linked to

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.110
cutaneous tendencies,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.630
in order to see what tendency
or risk you personally have

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.090
in order to see what tendency
or risk you personally have

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.620
Once this sample is at the laboratory

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.640
it will indicate how
your skin will evolve over time;

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.250
it will indicate how
your skin will evolve over time;

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.320
deciphering the tendency that your skin
may have with respect to different signs of aging,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.630
like dark spots or flaccidity.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.649
Based on that information,

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.940
a personalized formula is created 
for each person.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.520
a personalized formula is created 
for each person.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.100
In approximately three or four
weeks after having extracted

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.070
In approximately three or four
weeks after having extracted

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.750
the DNA, at that point

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.210
we are able to determine, and give you
your results of the genetic test with your risks

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.910
we are able to determine, and give you
your results of the genetic test with your risks

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.700
and your personalized cosmetic treatment,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.340
which consists of a serum

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.180
that is able to be personalized, thanks to 
the addition of specific boosters to

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.910
the serum base

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.190
the serum base

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.479
based on your test results,

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.960
and finally a cream that helps
to enhance the effects

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.310
of that serum.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.340
Many times we treat the
signs of aging in an incorrect manner.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.930
Discovering the origin of the symptoms is
essential in order to be able to find an adequate

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.130
treatment plan. What especially helps us
is to give our skin

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.549
the solution that it needs

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:08.719
the solution that it needs

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:12.180
What we have seen, for example, have been
people with pronounced wrinkles

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.070
that by using our product,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.620
they have been able to completely diminish the appearance of those wrinkles,
althought there is not an anti-wrinkle active ingredient on it. But what

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.530
we obtain from this are not just
personalized cosmetics,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.669
but rather a lifetime treatment,

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:30.049
considering that DNA is a map that deciphers
the direction that our skin will take

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.039
over the years. It is a lifetime
treatment that takes into account

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.779
over the years. It is a lifetime
treatment that takes into account

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.799
the genetic component
that we talked about earlier

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.279
But it is true that
your lifestyle and

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.689
the environmental circumstances
that surround you

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:46.399
the environmental circumstances
that surround you

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.589
will continue to vary.

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:51.139
Although the product will
continue to be One.Gen,

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.729
it will continue to evolve with you.

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.069
Treatments of the future,

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.919
that are nowadays a reality.
