wanted<00:01:21.479> them<00:01:21.600> anymore<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:21.869> they're<00:01:22.080> all

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
wanted them anymore because they're all

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.480 
wanted them anymore because they're all
shits<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.619> okay<00:01:22.830> I'll<00:01:22.950> take<00:01:23.159> them<00:01:23.340> they're

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
shits on okay I'll take them they're

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
shits on okay I'll take them they're
fucking<00:01:23.759> rare<00:01:23.970> anyways<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.080> those<00:01:25.470> are

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
fucking rare anyways but those are

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
fucking rare anyways but those are
hopefully<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> better<00:01:26.820> Sagittarian<00:01:27.630> beause

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
hopefully the better Sagittarian beause

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
hopefully the better Sagittarian beause
now<00:01:28.020> I'd<00:01:28.380> assume<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.220> really

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
now I'd assume because it's really

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
now I'd assume because it's really
really<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:29.880> obviously<00:01:30.329> compared<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
really good obviously compared the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.289 
really good obviously compared the
Sagittarian<00:01:31.740> beau<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.549> basically<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:33.119> now

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
Sagittarian beau and we basically do now

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.719 
Sagittarian beau and we basically do now
have<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.380> coin<00:01:34.650> flutter<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.220> many<00:01:35.369> people

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
have the the coin flutter as many people

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.069 
have the the coin flutter as many people
have<00:01:35.880> been<00:01:36.000> asking<00:01:36.299> for<00:01:36.540> ever<00:01:36.689> since<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
have been asking for ever since the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
have been asking for ever since the
charkh<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.560> they're<00:01:37.710> probably<00:01:38.130> nothing

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
charkh like they're probably nothing

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.370 
charkh like they're probably nothing
really<00:01:39.210> new<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.720> all<00:01:39.840> thought<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.290> going

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
really new we all thought that was going

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
really new we all thought that was going
to<00:01:40.470> come<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.740> day<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:42.329> only

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to come one day and it has I was only

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.819 
to come one day and it has I was only
one<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.840> thing<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> could<00:01:43.259> say<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
one little thing I could say about that

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.819 
one little thing I could say about that
I<00:01:43.860> believe<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.310> costs<00:01:44.579> 20,000<00:01:45.299> points<00:01:45.829> or

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
I believe it costs 20,000 points or

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.740 
I believe it costs 20,000 points or
20,000<00:01:47.460> tokens<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> only

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
20,000 tokens to get it but it only

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.550 
20,000 tokens to get it but it only
holds<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.880> it's<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.090> 16<00:01:51.450> yeah<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.079> um<00:01:52.350> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
holds up to it's up to 16 yeah so um it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
holds up to it's up to 16 yeah so um it
holds<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.159> 1<00:01:53.399> million<00:01:53.700> total<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.360> 1

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
holds up to 1 million total not 1

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080 
holds up to 1 million total not 1
million<00:01:54.750> GP<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.380> total<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.490> it'll<00:01:56.670> collect<00:01:56.880> up

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
million GP in total so it'll collect up

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
million GP in total so it'll collect up
to<00:01:57.210> 1<00:01:57.329> million<00:01:57.540> GPA<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.229> it'll<00:01:58.439> just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
to 1 million GPA then it'll just

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.539 
to 1 million GPA then it'll just
disappear

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
disappear

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.069 
disappear
which<00:02:00.060> means<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.329> got<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> buy<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.689> once<00:02:00.960> again

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
which means you got to buy it once again

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.990 
which means you got to buy it once again
I'm<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> assume<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.460> first<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:02.880> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I'm going to assume the first time you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.670 
I'm going to assume the first time you
buy<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> item<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> be

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
buy that out the item it's going to be

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.340 
buy that out the item it's going to be
20,000<00:02:05.310> tokens<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.790> second<00:02:06.119> time<00:02:06.299> 40,000<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
20,000 tokens a second time 40,000 and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.619 
20,000 tokens a second time 40,000 and
the<00:02:07.439> third<00:02:07.649> time<00:02:07.920> 60,000<00:02:08.670> tokens<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.149> don't

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the third time 60,000 tokens that don't

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.420 
the third time 60,000 tokens that don't
think<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> goes<00:02:09.929> above<00:02:10.319> 60,000<00:02:10.979> tokens<00:02:11.310> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
think it goes above 60,000 tokens so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.559 
think it goes above 60,000 tokens so
it's<00:02:11.550> kind<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.030> guys<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> guys

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
it's kind of up to you guys if you guys

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.660 
it's kind of up to you guys if you guys
think<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.379> know

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
think you know

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.580 
think you know
2,000<00:02:14.180> tokens<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.660> worth<00:02:14.870> collecting<00:02:15.260> 1

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
2,000 tokens is worth collecting 1

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.809 
2,000 tokens is worth collecting 1
million<00:02:15.890> GP<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.460> would<00:02:16.550> have<00:02:16.640> never

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
million GP that you would have never

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.699 
million GP that you would have never
really<00:02:17.000> picked<00:02:17.180> up<00:02:17.270> anyways<00:02:17.660> let's<00:02:18.440> come<00:02:18.620> up

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
really picked up anyways let's come up

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.320 
really picked up anyways let's come up
to<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.890> guys<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.220> probably<00:02:19.700> wouldn't<00:02:20.150> use<00:02:20.300> it

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
to you guys I probably wouldn't use it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.390 
to you guys I probably wouldn't use it
but<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.380> kind<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.620> making<00:02:21.770> me<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.250> go

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
but this is kind of making me have to go

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.100 
but this is kind of making me have to go
back<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.819> engineering<00:02:23.300> especially<00:02:23.930> for

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
back to the engineering especially for

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.809 
back to the engineering especially for
someone<00:02:24.319> like<00:02:24.410> me<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:24.830> 200<00:02:25.310> million<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:25.670> only

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
someone like me I'm 200 million I only

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.059 
someone like me I'm 200 million I only
had<00:02:25.970> like<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.180> million<00:02:26.480> points<00:02:26.660> left<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.260> used

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
had like a million points left I used

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.530 
had like a million points left I used
all<00:02:28.220> my<00:02:28.250> points<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.850> experience<00:02:29.240> back<00:02:29.390> in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
all my points on the experience back in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.570 
all my points on the experience back in
the<00:02:29.630> day<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.350> know<00:02:30.860> for<00:02:31.100> me<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.550> that

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
the day so you know for me this is that

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.800 
the day so you know for me this is that
you<00:02:31.970> know<00:02:32.060> not<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.240> think<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.510> only<00:02:32.630> way<00:02:32.750> to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you know not I think the only way to

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.210 
you know not I think the only way to
look<00:02:32.930> cuz<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.140> am<00:02:33.260> done<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:33.530> combat<00:02:33.950> but

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
look cuz I am done with combat but

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.800 
look cuz I am done with combat but
cannot<00:02:34.670> do<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.880> guys<00:02:35.060> if<00:02:35.240> you<00:02:35.330> guys<00:02:35.450> wish<00:02:35.720> to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
cannot do you guys if you guys wish to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.590 
cannot do you guys if you guys wish to
do<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.220> construction<00:02:37.600> new

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
do that just like the construction new

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.810 
do that just like the construction new
scroll<00:02:39.410> you<00:02:39.530> can<00:02:39.650> also<00:02:39.770> buy<00:02:40.010> one<00:02:40.190> for<00:02:40.370> crafting

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
scroll you can also buy one for crafting

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.220 
scroll you can also buy one for crafting
which<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.090> guess<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.420> will<00:02:41.540> keep<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.930> leather

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
which I guess you will keep a leather

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
wondering if that's like forever is that

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.290 
wondering if that's like forever is that
just<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.410> once<00:03:03.800> or<00:03:04.040> something<00:03:04.400> because

just like once or something because
ithat's<00:03:05.390> forever<00:03:05.870> it's<00:03:06.050> very<00:03:06.440> well<00:03:06.650> worth<00:03:06.890> it

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
ithat's forever it's very well worth it

ithat's forever it's very well worth it
20k<00:03:07.430> points<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.850> get<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.180> from<00:03:08.390> sinkholes

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
20k points you get that from sinkholes

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.020 
20k points you get that from sinkholes
anyways<00:03:09.140> after<00:03:09.410> doing<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.680> few<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.890> them<00:03:10.040> and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
anyways after doing a few of them and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.880 
anyways after doing a few of them and
then<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.390> basically<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.930> always<00:03:12.260> get<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> card

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
then you basically you always get a card

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.890 
then you basically you always get a card

though this was pretty sweet maybe we

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.050 
though this was pretty sweet maybe we
can<00:03:18.500> not<00:03:18.620> start<00:03:18.860> skipping<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.610> ones<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.000> not

anyways the back nine today obviously we

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.330 
anyways the back nine today obviously we
always<00:03:32.570> just<00:03:32.930> did<00:03:33.079> see<00:03:33.260> ones<00:03:33.470> from<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:34.040> level

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
always just did see ones from like level

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.390 
always just did see ones from like level
four<00:03:34.519> one<00:03:34.730> two<00:03:34.880> like<00:03:35.000> level<00:03:35.269> or<00:03:35.540> 429<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:37.340> you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
four one two like level or 429 so you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.670 
four one two like level or 429 so you
know<00:03:37.549> like<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.850> but<00:03:38.450> I<00:03:38.510> check<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.350> see<00:03:39.530> how

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
know like that but I check to see how

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.350 
know like that but I check to see how
many<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:40.250> think<00:03:40.340> this<00:03:40.549> is<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.730> little<00:03:40.940> bit<00:03:41.030> o<00:03:41.120> P

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
many I think this is a little bit o P

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.569 
many I think this is a little bit o P
but<00:03:41.630> not<00:03:42.290> o<00:03:42.320> P<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> good<00:03:42.860> way<00:03:42.980> in<00:03:43.070> a<00:03:43.160> bad<00:03:43.370> way

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
but not o P and a good way in a bad way

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.150 
but not o P and a good way in a bad way
but<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.329> cost<00:03:44.510> like<00:03:44.750> 300<00:03:45.320> something<00:03:45.560> thousand

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
but it cost like 300 something thousand

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.430 
but it cost like 300 something thousand
tokens<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.700> skip<00:03:46.940> your<00:03:47.090> C<00:03:47.329> ones<00:03:47.600> which<00:03:47.900> is

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
tokens to skip your C ones which is

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.650 
tokens to skip your C ones which is
definitely<00:03:49.070> not<00:03:49.250> worth<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:49.880> any<00:03:50.090> case<00:03:50.420> even

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
definitely not worth it in any case even

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.360 
definitely not worth it in any case even
if<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.989> have<00:03:51.170> like<00:03:51.320> 10<00:03:51.620> million<00:03:51.829> tokens<00:03:52.280> I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
if you have like 10 million tokens I

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.160 
if you have like 10 million tokens I
would<00:03:52.489> still<00:03:52.760> never<00:03:52.970> do<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:53.360> takes<00:03:53.989> like

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
would still never do that takes like

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.690 
would still never do that takes like
less<00:03:54.350> than<00:03:54.530> an<00:03:54.590> hour<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.920> your<00:03:55.040> time<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.370> DC

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
less than an hour of your time to DC

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.640 
less than an hour of your time to DC
ones<00:03:55.940> or<00:03:56.390> somewhere<00:03:57.049> around<00:03:57.140> there<00:03:57.380> from<00:03:57.560> when

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
ones or somewhere around there from when

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.530 
ones or somewhere around there from when
I<00:03:57.680> remember<00:03:57.980> probably<00:03:58.700> faster<00:03:59.180> now<00:03:59.299> with<00:03:59.420> all

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
I remember probably faster now with all

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.229 
I remember probably faster now with all
the<00:03:59.630> extra<00:03:59.900> updates<00:04:00.170> I'm<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:00.410> too<00:04:00.530> sure<00:04:00.739> but

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
the extra updates I'm not too sure but

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.729 
the extra updates I'm not too sure but
yeah<00:04:02.239> it's<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.630> little<00:04:02.780> bit<00:04:02.930> too<00:04:03.140> expensive<00:04:03.350> in

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
yeah it's a little bit too expensive in

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.920 
yeah it's a little bit too expensive in
my<00:04:03.860> opinion<00:04:04.220> 300,000<00:04:05.120> tokens<00:04:05.450> that's<00:04:05.660> that's

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
my opinion 300,000 tokens that's that's

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.259 
my opinion 300,000 tokens that's that's
a<00:04:06.049> lot<00:04:06.260> maybe<00:04:06.769> if<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.010> was<00:04:07.100> 30,000<00:04:07.820> tokens<00:04:08.120> I

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
a lot maybe if it was 30,000 tokens I

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.910 
a lot maybe if it was 30,000 tokens I
could<00:04:08.420> probably<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.989> probably<00:04:09.380> deal<00:04:09.650> with<00:04:09.680> that

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
could probably I probably deal with that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.110 
could probably I probably deal with that
because<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.220> get<00:04:10.370> all<00:04:10.549> those<00:04:10.670> points<00:04:10.880> back

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
because you get all those points back

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.180 
because you get all those points back
anyway<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:11.570> all<00:04:11.900> those<00:04:12.049> tokens<00:04:12.290> back<00:04:12.680> whenever

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
anyway so all those tokens back whenever

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.680 
anyway so all those tokens back whenever
you<00:04:13.459> do<00:04:13.670> all<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.910> extra<00:04:14.120> floors<00:04:14.450> that<00:04:14.570> you're

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
you do all the extra floors that you're

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.150 
you do all the extra floors that you're
going<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.840> be<00:04:14.930> doing<00:04:15.019> after<00:04:15.230> you<00:04:15.590> do<00:04:15.859> your<00:04:15.980> C

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
going to be doing after you do your C

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.909 
going to be doing after you do your C
ones<00:04:16.400> basically<00:04:16.720> but<00:04:17.720> 300<00:04:18.109> thousands<00:04:18.500> quite<00:04:18.890> a

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
ones basically but 300 thousands quite a

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.219 
ones basically but 300 thousands quite a
bit<00:04:19.160> now<00:04:20.090> technically<00:04:20.510> if<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.780> are<00:04:20.900> training

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
bit now technically if you are training

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.849 
bit now technically if you are training
dungeoneering

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
dungeoneering

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.650 
dungeoneering
without<00:04:22.250> things<00:04:22.700> like<00:04:22.789> sinkholes<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.479> daily

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
without things like sinkholes and daily

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.750 
without things like sinkholes and daily
challenge<00:04:24.140> that's<00:04:24.979> probably<00:04:25.280> worth<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.640> for

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
challenge that's probably worth it for

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.990 
challenge that's probably worth it for
you<00:04:25.880> if<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.180> would<00:04:26.330> not<00:04:26.630> really

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
you if you would not really

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.970 
you if you would not really
care<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.510> any<00:04:28.020> tokens<00:04:28.440> at<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.680> ending

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
care to have any tokens at the ending

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.030 
care to have any tokens at the ending
because<00:04:29.730> obviously<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.360> can<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.750> know<00:04:31.040> c-141

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
because obviously you can you know c-141

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.250 
because obviously you can you know c-141

229 which cost I theater or something
thousand<00:04:34.860> tokens<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.520> then<00:04:35.850> whenever<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.360> do

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
thousand tokens and then whenever you do

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.500 
thousand tokens and then whenever you do
for<00:04:36.780> 30<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.320> 60<00:04:37.610> you'll<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.820> way<00:04:38.940> more<00:04:38.970> than<00:04:39.330> 3

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
for 30 to 60 you'll get way more than 3

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.510 
for 30 to 60 you'll get way more than 3
million<00:04:39.690> or<00:04:40.020> 300,000<00:04:40.860> tokens<00:04:41.190> back<00:04:41.340> you'll

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
million or 300,000 tokens back you'll

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.770 
million or 300,000 tokens back you'll
get<00:04:41.640> like<00:04:41.790> five<00:04:42.030> million<00:04:42.270> experience<00:04:42.690> or

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
get like five million experience or

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.480 
get like five million experience or
something<00:04:43.020> like<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.140> which<00:04:43.710> is<00:04:43.740> like<00:04:43.950> 500k

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
something like that which is like 500k

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.190 
something like that which is like 500k
tokens<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.210> can<00:04:45.330> technically<00:04:45.720> never<00:04:45.930> do

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
tokens so you can technically never do

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.920 
tokens so you can technically never do
see<00:04:46.380> ones<00:04:46.590> again<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:48.060> it's<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.570> little<00:04:48.720> bit<00:04:48.810> too

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
see ones again but it's a little bit too

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.600 
see ones again but it's a little bit too
expensive<00:04:49.290> in<00:04:49.560> my<00:04:49.680> opinion<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.160> few<00:04:50.370> cool

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
expensive in my opinion a few cool

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.460 
expensive in my opinion a few cool
updates<00:04:50.820> is<00:04:51.240> you<00:04:51.360> can<00:04:51.510> now<00:04:51.630> search<00:04:51.990> and

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
updates is you can now search and

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.230 
updates is you can now search and
dungeoneering<00:04:52.950> which<00:04:53.250> is<00:04:53.430> pretty<00:04:53.820> nice<00:04:54.000> to

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
dungeoneering which is pretty nice to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.610 
dungeoneering which is pretty nice to
see<00:04:54.420> I<00:04:54.450> never<00:04:54.810> all<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.200> time<00:04:55.350> when<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.530> was

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
see I never all the time when I was

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.810 
see I never all the time when I was
trading<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.100> was<00:04:56.220> running<00:04:56.400> through<00:04:56.700> the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
trading and I was running through the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.370 
trading and I was running through the
entire<00:04:56.910> room<00:04:57.450> for<00:04:57.720> one<00:04:57.870> side<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.200> other<00:04:58.230> side

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
entire room for one side the other side

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.350 
entire room for one side the other side
is<00:04:58.650> like<00:04:58.770> I'm<00:04:59.370> not<00:04:59.520> Serge<00:04:59.790> right<00:05:00.060> now<00:05:00.180> this<00:05:00.240> is

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
is like I'm not Serge right now this is

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.660 
is like I'm not Serge right now this is
annoying<00:05:00.710> so<00:05:01.710> that's<00:05:01.860> pretty<00:05:02.040> cool<00:05:02.310> one<00:05:02.490> thing

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
annoying so that's pretty cool one thing

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.580 
annoying so that's pretty cool one thing
that<00:05:02.880> also<00:05:03.030> an<00:05:03.240> awesome<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.810> if<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.140> guys<00:05:04.260> do

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
that also an awesome is if you guys do

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.410 
that also an awesome is if you guys do
train<00:05:04.890> with<00:05:05.460> cutting<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:05.880> fishing<00:05:06.300> with

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
train with cutting and fishing with

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.900 
train with cutting and fishing with
doing<00:05:06.720> situ<00:05:07.140> method<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.950> cannot<00:05:08.190> do<00:05:08.400> bonfire

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
doing situ method you cannot do bonfire

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.430 
doing situ method you cannot do bonfire
5<00:05:09.210> anything<00:05:09.510> as<00:05:09.630> well<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.050> dungeoneering

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
5 anything as well and dungeoneering

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.320 
5 anything as well and dungeoneering
which<00:05:11.130> doesn't<00:05:11.370> really<00:05:11.460> make<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.640> faster<00:05:12.150> but

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
which doesn't really make it faster but

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.360 
which doesn't really make it faster but
definitely<00:05:12.690> makes<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:13.080> more<00:05:13.410> is<00:05:13.590> cable<00:05:14.130> more

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
definitely makes it more is cable more

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.490 
definitely makes it more is cable more
relaxing<00:05:14.910> I<00:05:15.000> guess<00:05:15.290> because<00:05:16.290> obviously

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
relaxing I guess because obviously

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.530 
relaxing I guess because obviously
whenever<00:05:16.980> you<00:05:17.100> do<00:05:17.220> fire<00:05:17.490> making<00:05:17.730> in<00:05:17.970> situ<00:05:18.510> or

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
whenever you do fire making in situ or

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.630 
whenever you do fire making in situ or
just<00:05:18.960> in<00:05:19.050> dungeoneering<00:05:19.410> at<00:05:19.590> all<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:20.460> make

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
just in dungeoneering at all you make

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.070 
just in dungeoneering at all you make
the<00:05:20.760> fire<00:05:20.970> really<00:05:21.270> really<00:05:21.480> quick<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:21.930> got

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
the fire really really quick so you got

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.300 
the fire really really quick so you got
to<00:05:22.169> kind<00:05:22.260> of<00:05:22.350> pay<00:05:22.500> attention<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.950> it<00:05:23.130> and

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
to kind of pay attention to it and

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.100 
to kind of pay attention to it and
sometimes<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.270> watch<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.600> not<00:05:24.720> sure<00:05:24.930> you're

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
sometimes you watch it not sure you're

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.080 
sometimes you watch it not sure you're
not<00:05:25.200> probably<00:05:25.560> anyways<00:05:25.890> but<00:05:26.850> yeah<00:05:26.940> that's

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
not probably anyways but yeah that's

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.430 
not probably anyways but yeah that's
pretty<00:05:27.240> cool<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.570> thought<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:28.020> know<00:05:28.110> might<00:05:28.410> as

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
pretty cool I thought you know might as

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.320 
pretty cool I thought you know might as
well<00:05:28.590> have<00:05:28.800> some<00:05:28.919> bonfires<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:29.430> there<00:05:29.669> I'm

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
well have some bonfires in there I'm

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.370 
well have some bonfires in there I'm
wondering<00:05:30.660> that's<00:05:30.780> gonna<00:05:30.900> give<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.140> a<00:05:31.200> life

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
wondering that's gonna give you a life

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.930 
wondering that's gonna give you a life
point<00:05:31.680> boost<00:05:31.890> as<00:05:32.250> well<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.490> would<00:05:32.730> imagine

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
point boost as well I would imagine

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.870 
point boost as well I would imagine
probably<00:05:33.480> will<00:05:33.930> because<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.560> don't<00:05:35.550> think<00:05:35.580> it

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
probably will because I don't think it

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.760 
probably will because I don't think it
would<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.690> last<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.169> not<00:05:37.290> least<00:05:37.530> there's

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
would and last but not least there's

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.490 
would and last but not least there's
obviously<00:05:38.370> now<00:05:38.610> also<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:39.180> timer<00:05:39.780> added<00:05:40.260> to<00:05:40.410> your

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
obviously now also a timer added to your

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.990 
obviously now also a timer added to your
dungeoneering<00:05:40.890> floors<00:05:41.280> so<00:05:41.520> once<00:05:41.730> you're<00:05:41.880> in

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
dungeoneering floors so once you're in

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.540 
dungeoneering floors so once you're in
there<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.479> timer<00:05:42.720> starts<00:05:43.200> we<00:05:43.919> no<00:05:44.070> longer<00:05:44.100> have

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
there the timer starts we no longer have

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.740 
there the timer starts we no longer have
to<00:05:44.669> wait<00:05:44.790> till<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.030> ending<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.330> see<00:05:45.479> how<00:05:45.600> long

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
to wait till the ending to see how long

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.570 
to wait till the ending to see how long
the<00:05:45.930> floor<00:05:46.169> is<00:05:46.260> you<00:05:46.410> can<00:05:46.650> just<00:05:46.800> tell<00:05:47.070> how<00:05:47.370> we'll

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
the floor is you can just tell how we'll

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.969 
the floor is you can just tell how we'll
fuck<00:05:47.790> how<00:05:47.940> how<00:05:48.360> long<00:05:49.020> it's<00:05:49.229> been<00:05:49.290> while<00:05:49.800> you're

thing that costs a lot of tokens I would

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.409 
thing that costs a lot of tokens I would
say<00:06:22.200> for<00:06:22.470> things<00:06:22.620> like<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:23.040> obviously<00:06:24.030> it's

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
say for things like that obviously it's

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.060 
say for things like that obviously it's
nice<00:06:24.570> to<00:06:24.720> have<00:06:24.900> that<00:06:25.110> option<00:06:25.290> but<00:06:25.650> that<00:06:25.680> is<00:06:26.040> a

nice to have that option but that is a
lot<00:06:26.190> of<00:06:26.250> tokens<00:06:26.640> I'd<00:06:26.729> rather<00:06:26.850> save<00:06:27.150> my<00:06:27.330> tokens

should might even be a few more oh yeah
there's<00:06:43.000> one<00:06:43.150> for<00:06:43.480> actually<00:06:43.990> training<00:06:44.620> inside

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
there's one for actually training inside

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
earn 5% extra experience so it doesn't

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.780 
earn 5% extra experience so it doesn't
really<00:06:50.500> that<00:06:50.710> big<00:06:50.860> of<00:06:50.950> a<00:06:50.980> deal<00:06:51.220> but<00:06:51.490> I<00:06:51.550> guess

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
really that big of a deal but I guess

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.910 
really that big of a deal but I guess
it's<00:06:51.970> something<00:06:52.180> well<00:06:53.170> I<00:06:53.200> guess<00:06:53.440> one<00:06:53.740> more

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
it's something well I guess one more

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.070 
it's something well I guess one more
very<00:06:54.250> last<00:06:54.490> thing<00:06:54.790> is<00:06:54.820> the<00:06:55.270> other<00:06:55.450> chaotic

something more powerful on my belief of
what<00:07:05.950> I<00:07:06.220> was<00:07:06.370> told<00:07:06.610> the<00:07:06.850> hiss

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
what I was told the hiss

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.360 
what I was told the hiss
0.5%<00:07:09.340> Critch<00:07:10.060> and<00:07:10.360> like<00:07:10.480> 0.25%<00:07:11.290> melee<00:07:12.250> or

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
0.5% Critch and like 0.25% melee or

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.740 
0.5% Critch and like 0.25% melee or
something<00:07:12.790> like<00:07:12.880> that<00:07:12.940> but<00:07:13.480> it's<00:07:13.600> told

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
something like that but it's told

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.390 
something like that but it's told
something<00:07:13.930> like<00:07:14.110> that<00:07:14.320> it's<00:07:14.650> not<00:07:14.800> too<00:07:14.860> much<00:07:15.190> of

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
something like that it's not too much of

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.640 
something like that it's not too much of
a<00:07:15.490> boost<00:07:15.670> but<00:07:16.060> I<00:07:16.420> mean<00:07:16.630> obviously<00:07:17.140> I<00:07:17.200> would

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
a boost but I mean obviously I would

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.990 
a boost but I mean obviously I would
assume<00:07:17.950> those<00:07:18.130> items<00:07:18.400> are<00:07:18.520> not<00:07:18.640> going<00:07:18.880> up

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 
assume those items are not going up

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.540 
assume those items are not going up
because<00:07:19.150> of<00:07:19.450> it<00:07:19.590> but<00:07:20.590> yeah<00:07:20.830> I<00:07:20.860> guess<00:07:21.220> it's<00:07:21.370> kind

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
because of it but yeah I guess it's kind

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.010 
because of it but yeah I guess it's kind
of<00:07:21.580> cool<00:07:21.760> as<00:07:21.880> well<00:07:22.060> but<00:07:22.270> anyways<00:07:22.690> hopefully

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
of cool as well but anyways hopefully

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.660 
of cool as well but anyways hopefully
