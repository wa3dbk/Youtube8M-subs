00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
something underneath the corner

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.180 
something underneath the corner
preferably<00:00:42.240> a<00:00:43.280> trim<00:00:44.280> tool<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:46.530> rag<00:00:46.860> in

between<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.850> I've<00:00:48.090> already<00:00:48.330> got<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> little

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
between it I've already got a little

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.510 
between it I've already got a little
separation<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.830> I<00:00:49.920> kind<00:00:50.130> of<00:00:50.220> stretched

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
separation because I kind of stretched

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.130 
separation because I kind of stretched
it<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:52.520> alright<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.540> is<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:55.050> of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it out alright so this is the kind of

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.650 
it out alright so this is the kind of
trim<00:00:55.350> tool<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:56.120> just<00:00:57.120> picked<00:00:57.330> it<00:00:57.450> up<00:00:57.510> at

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
trim tool I have just picked it up at

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
trim tool I have just picked it up at
autozone<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.380> 10<00:00:58.590> bucks<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
autozone it was like 10 bucks it is a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
autozone it was like 10 bucks it is a
little<00:01:00.390> thick<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.380> head<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.560> it<00:01:01.790> so<00:01:02.790> what<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
little thick at the head of it so what I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.219 
little thick at the head of it so what I
usually<00:01:03.240> do<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.110> wrap<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.039> head<00:01:06.109> in<00:01:07.109> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
usually do is just wrap the head in a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.450 
usually do is just wrap the head in a
microfiber<00:01:07.710> towel<00:01:10.100> try<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.219> do<00:01:11.310> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
microfiber towel try and do this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.910 
microfiber towel try and do this
one-handed<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.499> try<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
one-handed here so you want to try and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.919 
one-handed here so you want to try and
get<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:18.299> towel<00:01:20.899> give<00:01:21.899> as<00:01:21.990> much<00:01:23.630> coverage<00:01:24.630> as

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
get the towel give as much coverage as

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.169 
get the towel give as much coverage as
you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.649> without<00:01:25.829> scratching<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.969> did

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
you can without scratching it like I did

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.639 
you can without scratching it like I did
right<00:01:27.359> there<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.479> other<00:01:30.630> option<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.350> guess

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
right there so the other option I guess

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.969 
right there so the other option I guess
I<00:01:31.859> just<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.219> get<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.460> dust<00:01:32.759> shield<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.979> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I just to get this dust shield off and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.679 
I just to get this dust shield off and
you<00:01:35.579> could<00:01:35.729> probably<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you could probably do that with a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:55.429 
you could probably do that with a
screwdriver<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:39.829> mean<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.399> off<00:01:54.439> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
screwdriver I mean some of it off and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.989 
screwdriver I mean some of it off and
once<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.679> get<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.920> started<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.729> probably

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
once you get it started you can probably

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:13.740 
once you get it started you can probably
use<00:01:57.240> your<00:01:57.389> fingers

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.210 

so<00:02:14.750> now<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.930> dust<00:02:15.200> shields<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.710> completely

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
so now the dust shields is completely

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.220 
so now the dust shields is completely
separated<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.970> should<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.630> theory<00:02:21.080> be

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
separated and you should in theory be

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.760 
separated and you should in theory be
able<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.400> reach<00:02:22.820> underneath<00:02:26.260> pop<00:02:27.260> up<00:02:27.500> this

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
able to reach underneath pop up this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.340 
able to reach underneath pop up this
part<00:02:29.080> which<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.590> another<00:02:30.830> clip<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:33.140> just

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
part which is just another clip it just

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:47.620 
part which is just another clip it just
clips<00:02:33.560> right<00:02:33.830> into<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> actual<00:02:34.550> bezel<00:02:46.630> you

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
clips right into the actual bezel you

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.650 
clips right into the actual bezel you
might<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.110> use<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> little<00:02:48.440> force<00:02:48.770> for<00:02:49.160> it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
might have to use a little force for it

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.890 
might have to use a little force for it
and<00:02:50.660> pull<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:50.990> an<00:02:51.080> upward<00:02:51.470> motion<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.900> that'll

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
and pull in an upward motion and that'll

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.740 
and pull in an upward motion and that'll
take<00:02:54.050> off<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.500> entire<00:02:54.800> Buzzle<00:02:59.500> there's<00:03:00.500> about

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
take off the entire Buzzle there's about

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:11.199 
take off the entire Buzzle there's about
ten<00:03:02.750> or<00:03:02.870> so<00:03:03.050> Clips<00:03:03.380> holding<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.640> that's

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
ten or so Clips holding it in and that's

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.450 
ten or so Clips holding it in and that's
it
