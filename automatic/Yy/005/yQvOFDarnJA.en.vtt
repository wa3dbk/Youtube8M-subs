00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:23.660 

it's<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.839> fun<00:00:16.049> spring<00:00:18.680> shackle<00:00:21.740> shackle<00:00:22.740> in

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
it's a fun spring shackle shackle in

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:32.330 
it's a fun spring shackle shackle in
this<00:00:23.850> way<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.109> brake<00:00:30.170> shows<00:00:31.340> there's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
this way this is the brake shows there's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.040 
this way this is the brake shows there's
another<00:00:32.579> little<00:00:32.790> arm<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> end<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.840> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
another little arm on the end of this is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.250 
another little arm on the end of this is
a<00:00:34.079> rod<00:00:34.350> inside<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:35.969> there's<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> push

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
a rod inside and then there's a push

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260 
a rod inside and then there's a push
thing<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.370> pushes<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> rod<00:00:38.969> down

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
thing like this that pushes a rod down

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.000 
thing like this that pushes a rod down
it<00:00:39.540> shows<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.870> wedge<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> bottom<00:00:40.860> which

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it shows a wedge out at the bottom which

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850 
it shows a wedge out at the bottom which
shoves<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> brake<00:00:42.149> shoes<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> on

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
shoves the brake shoes out like that on

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.979 
shoves the brake shoes out like that on
both<00:00:44.190> sides

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
both sides

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
both sides
let's<00:00:45.989> mechanical<00:00:46.500> brakes<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
let's mechanical brakes this is the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.590 
let's mechanical brakes this is the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
fitment on the steering gear equipment

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.540 
fitment on the steering gear equipment
drag<00:00:52.379> link<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> forked<00:00:55.890> piece<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
drag link to a forked piece here that

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.660 
drag link to a forked piece here that
goes<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> steering<00:00:58.079> spindle<00:00:58.670> like

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
goes here to the steering spindle like

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.229 
goes here to the steering spindle like
that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.540 
that
and<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> goes<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.230> off<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.309> same

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and then it goes also off of that same

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
and then it goes also off of that same
Forge<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> goes<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> tie<00:01:04.350> rod

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
Forge and goes down here to the tie rod

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830 
Forge and goes down here to the tie rod
a<00:01:05.010> tie<00:01:05.760> bar<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.240> goes<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.600> way<00:01:06.689> across

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
a tie bar that goes all the way across

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.740 
a tie bar that goes all the way across
