00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
novice test you just need to do a little

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.520 
novice test you just need to do a little
bit<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.429> the<00:01:23.579> long<00:01:23.759> side<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.329> then<00:01:24.929> usually

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
bit down the long side and then usually

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.889 
bit down the long side and then usually
you<00:01:25.740> come<00:01:26.009> back<00:01:26.219> to<00:01:26.369> top<00:01:26.609> or<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> corner<00:01:27.479> but

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
you come back to top or the corner but

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.569 
you come back to top or the corner but
it's<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.079> good<00:01:28.289> idea<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.710> clean<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.219> horse<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
it's a good idea to clean the horse to

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
it's a good idea to clean the horse to
keep<00:01:29.759> going<00:01:30.060> around<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> short<00:01:30.840> side<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.770> he

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
keep going around the short side so he

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.980 
keep going around the short side so he
stays<00:01:32.249> in<00:01:32.549> balance<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.149> later<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.840> life

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
stays in balance and later on in life

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
stays in balance and later on in life
when<00:01:34.259> he<00:01:34.319> has<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.499> do<00:01:34.829> more<00:01:35.100> counter<00:01:35.549> counter

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
when he has to do more counter counter

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 
when he has to do more counter counter
he's<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.509> expecting<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.590> come<00:01:37.770> back<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> trot

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.690 
stays in a good balance here we have an
example<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.619> young<00:01:58.859> horses<00:01:59.249> medium

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
example of the young horses medium

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.989 
example of the young horses medium
canter<00:02:00.170> opening<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.319> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.639> then

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
canter opening up a little bit and then

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.149 
canter opening up a little bit and then
coming<00:02:03.359> back<00:02:03.389> smoothly<00:02:03.959> and<00:02:04.259> evenly<00:02:04.499> in<00:02:05.039> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
coming back smoothly and evenly in a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
coming back smoothly and evenly in a
nice<00:02:05.340> transition<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.630> showing<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.109> ability

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
nice transition just showing the ability

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.740 
nice transition just showing the ability
to<00:02:07.590> lengthen<00:02:08.190> his<00:02:08.369> frame<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.179> come<00:02:09.479> back

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.740 

here<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.840> see<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> more<00:02:13.260> advanced<00:02:13.740> horse<00:02:14.010> he

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
here we see the more advanced horse he

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.600 
here we see the more advanced horse he
be<00:02:14.840> more<00:02:15.020> direct<00:02:15.500> transition<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> more

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
be more direct transition and a more

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.440 
be more direct transition and a more
dramatic<00:02:16.790> increase<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.110> Lakeman<00:02:18.320> stride

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
dramatic increase in the Lakeman stride

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.930 
dramatic increase in the Lakeman stride
here<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.540> have<00:02:20.690> another<00:02:20.900> example<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:22.640> horse

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
here we have another example this horse

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.420 
here we have another example this horse
again<00:02:23.390> shows<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:24.140> reasonable<00:02:25.100> amount<00:02:25.250> of

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
again shows a reasonable amount of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.030 
again shows a reasonable amount of
difference<00:02:25.910> but<00:02:26.570> would<00:02:27.050> like<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.440> see<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.710> more

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
difference but would like to see it more

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.790 
difference but would like to see it more
and<00:02:28.340> more<00:02:28.480> dramatic<00:02:29.480> but<00:02:29.750> her<00:02:30.230> transition

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
and more dramatic but her transition

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.450 
and more dramatic but her transition
back<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.190> nice<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.700> smooth<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.180> even
