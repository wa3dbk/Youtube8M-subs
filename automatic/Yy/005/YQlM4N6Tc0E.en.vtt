for me I I'm never going to go past
three<00:02:39.700> quarters<00:02:39.730> that's<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.750> that's<00:02:41.080> all

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
three quarters that's so that's all

right here in his backyard I got it I

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.330 
right here in his backyard I got it I
have<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.600> work<00:02:49.750> with<00:02:49.960> is<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.590> I'm<00:02:50.890> slightly

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
have to work with is that I'm slightly

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.400 
have to work with is that I'm slightly
downhill<00:02:51.670> here<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.570> I'm<00:02:52.720> always<00:02:52.930> making<00:02:53.200> a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
downhill here so I'm always making a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.290 
downhill here so I'm always making a
practice<00:02:53.800> swing<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.490> make<00:02:54.670> sure<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.090> feel

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
practice swing to make sure and feel

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.030 
practice swing to make sure and feel
getting<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.720> my<00:02:55.840> finished<00:02:56.230> recall<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.770> relax

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.510 
and when I feel that swing and I can
feel<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.820> hopefully<00:03:01.510> y'all<00:03:01.690> heard<00:03:01.870> that

the impact before the hill or something

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.730 
the impact before the hill or something
might<00:03:25.090> push<00:03:25.300> me<00:03:25.480> off<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.960> if<00:03:26.320> it's<00:03:26.470> just<00:03:26.530> a

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
might push me off and if it's just a

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.160 
might push me off and if it's just a
dead<00:03:26.950> flat<00:03:27.160> light<00:03:27.460> I'm<00:03:27.730> just<00:03:28.000> locking<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.660> boom

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
dead flat light I'm just locking in boom

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.020 
dead flat light I'm just locking in boom
I'm<00:03:29.740> locking<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.190> my<00:03:30.310> swing<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:30.850> flying

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
I'm locking in my swing and flying

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.640 
I'm locking in my swing and flying
finishing<00:03:31.390> here<00:03:31.540> because<00:03:32.020> basically<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.530> I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
finishing here because basically I I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.340 
finishing here because basically I I
base<00:03:33.550> every<00:03:33.850> swing<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.720> think<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.050> success

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
base every swing and I think the success

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.870 
base every swing and I think the success
of<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.590> swing<00:03:35.800> is<00:03:35.950> getting<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> good<00:03:36.580> finish

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
of the swing is getting to a good finish

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.430 
of the swing is getting to a good finish
if<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.330> get<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> good<00:03:37.960> dynamically

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
if you get to a good dynamically

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.320 
if you get to a good dynamically
balanced<00:03:38.770> finished<00:03:39.070> every<00:03:39.310> time<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:40.120> should

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
balanced finished every time you should

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.700 
balanced finished every time you should
be<00:03:40.480> able<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.720> make<00:03:40.900> you'll<00:03:41.170> be<00:03:41.290> making<00:03:41.440> good

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
be able to make you'll be making good

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.780 
be able to make you'll be making good
swings<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.100> you<00:03:42.190> should<00:03:42.370> be<00:03:42.460> hitting<00:03:42.610> good

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
swings and you should be hitting good

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.420 
swings and you should be hitting good
shots<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.270> so<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.320> key<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.830> if<00:03:45.220> you

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
shots and so the key is this if you

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.860 
shots and so the key is this if you
can't<00:03:45.670> get<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> good<00:03:46.120> finish<00:03:46.390> every<00:03:46.630> time

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
can't get to a good finish every time

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.410 
can't get to a good finish every time
then<00:03:47.350> there's<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.800> problem<00:03:48.190> there<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:49.060> would

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
then there's a problem there so I would

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.240 
then there's a problem there so I would
have<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.660> say<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:50.050> based<00:03:50.560> on<00:03:50.709> what<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.070> said

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
have to say that based on what you said

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.949 
have to say that based on what you said
about<00:03:51.310> your<00:03:51.970> feeling<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.510> your<00:03:52.690> driver

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
about your feeling that your driver

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.400 
about your feeling that your driver
swing<00:03:54.270> bob<00:03:55.270> is<00:03:55.480> interfering<00:03:56.080> with<00:03:56.110> is

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
swing bob is interfering with is

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.740 
swing bob is interfering with is
probably<00:03:57.100> creeping<00:03:57.459> into<00:03:57.610> your<00:03:57.970> into<00:03:58.720> your

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
probably creeping into your into your

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.510 
probably creeping into your into your
iron<00:03:59.380> swing<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:00.040> your<00:04:00.100> hitting<00:04:00.280> better

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
iron swing and your hitting better

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.910 
iron swing and your hitting better
drivers<00:04:01.030> than<00:04:01.209> irons<00:04:01.959> then<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.560> would<00:04:02.680> have<00:04:02.800> to

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
drivers than irons then I would have to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.199 
drivers than irons then I would have to
think<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.280> driver<00:04:03.550> swing<00:04:03.790> must<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.180> a

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
think you driver swing must have a

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.030 
think you driver swing must have a
pretty<00:04:04.480> good<00:04:04.630> balance<00:04:04.870> finish<00:04:05.350> whereas

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
pretty good balance finish whereas

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.199 
pretty good balance finish whereas
you're<00:04:06.220> having<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.489> problem<00:04:06.730> getting<00:04:06.820> there

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
you're having a problem getting there

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.449 
you're having a problem getting there
with<00:04:07.390> your<00:04:07.540> irons<00:04:07.840> so<00:04:08.380> I'm<00:04:08.530> going<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:08.980> suspect

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
with your irons so I'm going to suspect

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.460 
with your irons so I'm going to suspect
that<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:10.300> for<00:04:10.570> start<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.050> a<00:04:13.290> always<00:04:14.290> check

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
ball is too far forward and so

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.790 
ball is too far forward and so
consequently<00:04:40.360> you're<00:04:40.900> somewhat<00:04:41.320> behind<00:04:41.650> it

I could be coming out of the shot and

hit it dead left I could I could come

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.540 
hit it dead left I could I could come
out<00:05:09.889> of<00:05:10.099> the<00:05:10.159> shot<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:10.699> top<00:05:11.389> it<00:05:11.599> right<00:05:12.560> I<00:05:12.800> could

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
enough left over here right where I'd

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:20.950 
enough left over here right where I'd
missed<00:05:19.999> the<00:05:20.120> net<00:05:20.300> but<00:05:20.479> I<00:05:20.509> don't<00:05:20.689> want<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.870> hit

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
missed the net but I don't want to hit

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.480 
missed the net but I don't want to hit
it<00:05:20.990> over<00:05:21.110> there<00:05:21.379> this<00:05:21.499> just<00:05:22.069> things<00:05:22.310> in<00:05:22.400> the

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
it over there this just things in the

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.700 
it over there this just things in the
yard<00:05:22.669> there<00:05:22.939> and<00:05:23.120> so<00:05:23.569> or<00:05:23.900> I<00:05:23.930> could<00:05:24.229> actually<00:05:24.349> if

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
yard there and so or I could actually if

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.320 
yard there and so or I could actually if
the<00:05:24.860> balls<00:05:25.069> are<00:05:25.219> too<00:05:25.370> far<00:05:25.580> up<00:05:25.729> there<00:05:25.879> I<00:05:25.909> could<00:05:26.150> I

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
the balls are too far up there I could I

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.450 
the balls are too far up there I could I
could<00:05:26.569> come<00:05:26.749> down<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.229> and<00:05:27.979> bounce<00:05:28.219> it<00:05:28.370> off

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
could come down and and bounce it off

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.249 
could come down and and bounce it off
the<00:05:28.490> ground<00:05:28.819> for<00:05:29.029> us<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:29.360> in<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:29.810> case<00:05:30.050> it

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:30.259 
the ground for us and in that case it

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.800 
the ground for us and in that case it
went<00:05:30.409> right<00:05:30.939> conversely<00:05:31.939> if<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.449> ball

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
went right conversely if the ball

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.450 
went right conversely if the ball
position<00:05:33.259> was<00:05:33.409> back<00:05:33.680> too<00:05:33.949> far

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
position was back too far

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.550 
position was back too far
now<00:05:35.090> I'm<00:05:35.360> going<00:05:35.539> to<00:05:35.629> be<00:05:35.719> too<00:05:35.900> far<00:05:36.080> ahead<00:05:36.259> of<00:05:36.409> the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
now I'm going to be too far ahead of the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.409 
now I'm going to be too far ahead of the
ball<00:05:36.740> so<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:37.039> speak<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.550> in<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.240> ball

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
ball so to speak and in the ball

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.390 
ball so to speak and in the ball
positions<00:05:38.990> back<00:05:39.169> too<00:05:39.409> far<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:39.830> if<00:05:39.949> I<00:05:40.039> come<00:05:40.250> into

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
positions back too far so if I come into

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.159 
positions back too far so if I come into
impact<00:05:40.759> from<00:05:41.270> there<00:05:41.509> I'm<00:05:41.719> gonna<00:05:41.870> have<00:05:42.020> to

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
impact from there I'm gonna have to

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.499 
impact from there I'm gonna have to
steep<00:05:42.409> a<00:05:42.560> descending<00:05:43.460> blow<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.879> I<00:05:44.180> could<00:05:44.389> be

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
steep a descending blow and I could be

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:45.610 
steep a descending blow and I could be
actually<00:05:44.840> if<00:05:44.930> I<00:05:44.990> hit<00:05:45.139> the<00:05:45.229> ball

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
actually if I hit the ball

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.290 
actually if I hit the ball
I<00:05:45.650> could<00:05:46.039> be<00:05:46.099> hitting<00:05:46.339> and<00:05:46.669> basically<00:05:47.150> almost

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
I could be hitting and basically almost

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.999 
I could be hitting and basically almost
sticking<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.750> club<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.139> ground<00:05:48.379> now<00:05:48.949> you

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 
sticking the club in the ground now you

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.800 
sticking the club in the ground now you
know<00:05:49.250> that<00:05:49.490> that<00:05:49.879> in<00:05:50.089> a<00:05:50.180> search<00:05:50.360> swing<00:05:50.659> we

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
know that that in a search swing we

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.540 
know that that in a search swing we
always<00:05:51.080> talk<00:05:51.289> about<00:05:51.319> we<00:05:52.159> want<00:05:52.250> to<00:05:52.400> take

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
always talk about we want to take

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.950 
always talk about we want to take
shallow<00:05:52.849> divots<00:05:53.360> we<00:05:53.449> want<00:05:53.629> the<00:05:53.749> club<00:05:53.900> to

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
shallow divots we want the club to

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.689 
shallow divots we want the club to
ricochet<00:05:54.469> off<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.680> ground<00:05:55.009> that's<00:05:55.460> why<00:05:55.669> I

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
ricochet off the ground that's why I

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.249 
ricochet off the ground that's why I
love<00:05:56.060> hitting<00:05:56.270> off<00:05:56.419> a<00:05:56.449> mat<00:05:56.749> so<00:05:56.930> I<00:05:56.990> could<00:05:57.169> just

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
love hitting off a mat so I could just

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:00.550 
love hitting off a mat so I could just
stand<00:05:57.499> here<00:05:57.620> and<00:05:57.830> just<00:05:58.339> just<00:05:58.699> I<00:05:58.819> can<00:05:59.000> just<00:05:59.560> feel

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
stand here and just just I can just feel

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.619 
stand here and just just I can just feel
that<00:06:00.620> Club<00:06:00.979> just<00:06:01.159> zip<00:06:01.520> off<00:06:01.699> just<00:06:02.180> skip<00:06:02.509> right

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 
that Club just zip off just skip right

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.379 
that Club just zip off just skip right
off<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.960> mat<00:06:03.169> boom<00:06:04.009> because<00:06:04.729> you<00:06:04.909> thought<00:06:05.120> you

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
off the mat boom because you thought you

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.059 
off the mat boom because you thought you
don't<00:06:05.569> you<00:06:05.750> start<00:06:06.020> hitting<00:06:06.319> down<00:06:06.529> too<00:06:06.740> hard<00:06:06.949> on

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
don't you start hitting down too hard on

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.260 
don't you start hitting down too hard on
these<00:06:07.159> things<00:06:07.400> they<00:06:07.520> can<00:06:07.669> actually<00:06:07.909> hurt<00:06:08.029> you

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
these things they can actually hurt you

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.360 
these things they can actually hurt you
just<00:06:08.719> like<00:06:08.870> the<00:06:09.020> ground<00:06:09.259> so<00:06:09.710> we<00:06:09.860> want<00:06:10.069> the<00:06:10.189> ball

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
just like the ground so we want the ball

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.459 
just like the ground so we want the ball
we<00:06:10.909> want<00:06:11.120> thin<00:06:11.389> divots<00:06:11.750> then<00:06:11.960> two<00:06:12.139> wins<00:06:12.289> on

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
we want thin divots then two wins on

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:14.920 
we want thin divots then two wins on
tomorrow<00:06:12.770> so<00:06:13.279> we<00:06:13.430> don't<00:06:13.610> we<00:06:14.389> don't<00:06:14.539> even<00:06:14.689> think

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
tomorrow so we don't we don't even think

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.119 
tomorrow so we don't we don't even think
about<00:06:15.139> hitting<00:06:15.289> down<00:06:15.560> we<00:06:15.710> think<00:06:15.919> about

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
about hitting down we think about

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:17.829 
about hitting down we think about
swinging<00:06:16.399> up<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:16.849> and<00:06:17.089> swinging<00:06:17.449> up<00:06:17.629> works

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:17.839 
swinging up and and swinging up works

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.809 
swinging up and and swinging up works
because<00:06:18.169> why<00:06:18.349> if<00:06:18.740> you're<00:06:18.979> up<00:06:19.099> here<00:06:19.159> you<00:06:19.699> have

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
because why if you're up here you have

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:21.700 
because why if you're up here you have
to<00:06:19.969> go<00:06:20.060> down<00:06:20.360> and<00:06:20.539> hit<00:06:20.659> the<00:06:20.779> ball<00:06:20.930> first<00:06:21.199> but

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
to go down and hit the ball first but

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.010 
to go down and hit the ball first but
down<00:06:21.919> is<00:06:22.159> free<00:06:22.399> right<00:06:22.669> the<00:06:23.539> club<00:06:23.719> will<00:06:23.839> just

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
down is free right the club will just

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.779 
down is free right the club will just
drop<00:06:24.229> straight<00:06:24.379> down<00:06:24.740> but<00:06:25.129> everything<00:06:25.520> after

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
drop straight down but everything after

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.029 
drop straight down but everything after
the<00:06:25.879> ball<00:06:26.060> is<00:06:26.210> not<00:06:26.419> free<00:06:26.659> so<00:06:27.199> as<00:06:27.529> long<00:06:27.770> as<00:06:27.830> you

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 
the ball is not free so as long as you

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.529 
the ball is not free so as long as you
let<00:06:28.159> that<00:06:28.310> fight<00:06:28.580> that<00:06:28.610> thought<00:06:29.029> process<00:06:29.180> in

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
let that fight that thought process in

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:30.820 
let that fight that thought process in
your<00:06:29.629> mind<00:06:29.839> if<00:06:29.930> you<00:06:30.050> want<00:06:30.199> to<00:06:30.289> nip<00:06:30.469> it<00:06:30.589> off<00:06:30.710> the

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
your mind if you want to nip it off the

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.139 
your mind if you want to nip it off the
ground<00:06:31.009> you<00:06:31.490> want<00:06:31.580> to<00:06:31.699> hit<00:06:31.789> those<00:06:31.909> like

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:32.149 
ground you want to hit those like

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:35.350 
ground you want to hit those like
touching<00:06:32.719> gold<00:06:33.050> impacts<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:34.699> ball<00:06:34.909> position

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
touching gold impacts the ball position

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.700 
touching gold impacts the ball position
is<00:06:35.419> critical<00:06:35.899> because<00:06:35.960> again<00:06:36.289> like<00:06:36.439> I<00:06:36.529> said

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
is critical because again like I said

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.559 
is critical because again like I said
getting<00:06:36.949> back<00:06:37.129> to<00:06:37.279> back<00:06:37.490> so<00:06:37.939> if<00:06:38.060> you're<00:06:38.240> here

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 
getting back to back so if you're here

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.089 
getting back to back so if you're here
and<00:06:38.689> you're<00:06:39.050> hitting<00:06:39.229> down<00:06:39.500> too<00:06:39.710> much<00:06:39.860> then

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099 
and you're hitting down too much then

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.409 
and you're hitting down too much then

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
getting so far ahead of the ball that

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.050 
getting so far ahead of the ball that

know trying to get it and try to help it
up<00:06:53.029> maybe<00:06:53.240> you<00:06:53.599> start<00:06:53.839> opening<00:06:53.930> with<00:06:54.199> the<00:06:54.259> face

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
up maybe you start opening with the face

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.839 
up maybe you start opening with the face
they<00:06:54.589> get<00:06:54.740> stopped<00:06:54.949> right<00:06:55.159> and<00:06:55.370> good<00:06:55.580> slice

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
they get stopped right and good slice

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.360 
they get stopped right and good slice
right<00:06:56.120> after<00:06:56.449> that<00:06:56.569> or<00:06:56.839> or<00:06:57.589> you<00:06:57.860> you<00:06:58.129> try<00:06:58.310> to

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
right after that or or you you try to

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.429 
right after that or or you you try to
come<00:06:58.610> backwards<00:06:58.879> to<00:06:59.240> hit<00:06:59.360> the<00:06:59.479> ball<00:06:59.689> and<00:06:59.899> so<00:07:00.379> if

00:07:00.429 --> 00:07:00.439 
come backwards to hit the ball and so if

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:02.529 
come backwards to hit the ball and so if
you<00:07:00.529> stop<00:07:00.710> coming<00:07:01.009> back<00:07:01.189> to<00:07:01.399> it<00:07:01.490> you're<00:07:02.419> gone

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
you stop coming back to it you're gone

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:04.570 
you stop coming back to it you're gone
you<00:07:02.750> could<00:07:02.899> be<00:07:03.050> falling<00:07:04.039> back<00:07:04.190> to<00:07:04.219> the<00:07:04.370> back

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
you could be falling back to the back

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.159 
you could be falling back to the back
foot<00:07:04.879> and<00:07:05.089> you<00:07:05.360> see<00:07:05.509> a<00:07:05.539> lot<00:07:05.690> of<00:07:05.719> people<00:07:06.050> they

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
foot and you see a lot of people they

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.959 
foot and you see a lot of people they
stop<00:07:06.409> back<00:07:06.589> like<00:07:06.769> this<00:07:06.919> that's<00:07:07.519> either<00:07:07.669> ball

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:07.969 
stop back like this that's either ball

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:08.650 
stop back like this that's either ball
position

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
position

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.300 
position
aiming<00:07:08.990> for<00:07:09.320> right-handed<00:07:09.770> too<00:07:09.920> far<00:07:10.130> to<00:07:10.220> the

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
aiming for right-handed too far to the

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.690 
aiming for right-handed too far to the
right<00:07:10.870> so<00:07:11.870> a<00:07:11.900> ball<00:07:12.170> position<00:07:12.590> is<00:07:12.650> critical<00:07:13.220> so

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
right so a ball position is critical so

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.980 
right so a ball position is critical so
we<00:07:13.730> played<00:07:14.000> wedges<00:07:14.300> to<00:07:14.420> the<00:07:14.510> seven<00:07:14.810> in<00:07:14.900> the

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:14.990 
we played wedges to the seven in the

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.080 
we played wedges to the seven in the
middle<00:07:15.110> and<00:07:15.560> then<00:07:16.220> the<00:07:16.310> ball<00:07:16.490> gradually<00:07:16.970> looks

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.090 
middle and then the ball gradually looks

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.190 
middle and then the ball gradually looks
a<00:07:17.180> little<00:07:17.360> forward<00:07:17.630> for<00:07:17.750> the<00:07:17.810> club<00:07:18.020> we<00:07:18.170> have

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200 
a little forward for the club we have

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.250 
a little forward for the club we have
and<00:07:18.560> as<00:07:18.950> the<00:07:19.130> ball<00:07:19.310> goes<00:07:19.550> as<00:07:20.360> the<00:07:20.900> ball<00:07:21.110> goes

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260 
and as the ball goes as the ball goes

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.380 
and as the ball goes as the ball goes
forward<00:07:21.650> you<00:07:21.830> go<00:07:21.980> back<00:07:22.220> your<00:07:22.730> hands<00:07:23.030> your

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.390 
forward you go back your hands your

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.300 
forward you go back your hands your
hands<00:07:23.600> have<00:07:23.750> moved<00:07:23.900> from<00:07:24.080> being<00:07:24.350> pointed<00:07:25.070> to

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
hands have moved from being pointed to

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.860 
hands have moved from being pointed to
hanging<00:07:25.550> it<00:07:25.640> in<00:07:25.700> the<00:07:25.790> center<00:07:26.090> there's<00:07:26.480> forward

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
hanging it in the center there's forward

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.930 
hanging it in the center there's forward
but<00:07:27.020> they<00:07:27.170> will<00:07:27.320> return<00:07:27.710> to<00:07:27.980> Center<00:07:28.370> in<00:07:28.550> your

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:28.940 
but they will return to Center in your

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.850 
but they will return to Center in your
swing<00:07:29.270> because<00:07:29.840> the<00:07:29.990> club<00:07:30.200> will<00:07:30.320> be<00:07:30.470> releasing

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
swing because the club will be releasing

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.790 
swing because the club will be releasing
and<00:07:31.190> and<00:07:31.940> in<00:07:32.150> getting<00:07:32.420> to<00:07:32.510> the<00:07:32.600> ball<00:07:32.780> all<00:07:33.740> right

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 
and and in getting to the ball all right

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.860 
and and in getting to the ball all right
so<00:07:34.700> hopefully<00:07:34.850> this<00:07:35.120> explains<00:07:35.540> everything

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
so hopefully this explains everything

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.660 
so hopefully this explains everything
and<00:07:36.200> I<00:07:36.560> definitely<00:07:36.950> got<00:07:37.190> a<00:07:37.280> feeling<00:07:37.610> that's

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.670 
and I definitely got a feeling that's

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.220 
and I definitely got a feeling that's
probably<00:07:38.000> ball<00:07:38.210> position<00:07:38.630> in<00:07:38.690> this<00:07:38.810> instant

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.230 
probably ball position in this instant

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.950 
probably ball position in this instant
and<00:07:39.350> a<00:07:40.010> and<00:07:40.850> if<00:07:40.970> the<00:07:41.090> ball<00:07:41.300> is<00:07:41.390> too<00:07:41.420> far<00:07:41.720> forward

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
and a and if the ball is too far forward

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.390 
and a and if the ball is too far forward
to<00:07:42.080> back<00:07:42.230> you<00:07:42.410> know<00:07:42.530> you've<00:07:42.770> just<00:07:43.010> heard<00:07:43.130> what

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 
to back you know you've just heard what

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.430 
to back you know you've just heard what
what<00:07:43.850> is<00:07:43.970> going<00:07:44.120> to<00:07:44.150> be<00:07:44.270> those<00:07:44.420> big<00:07:44.630> issues<00:07:44.810> so

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 
what is going to be those big issues so

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.810 
what is going to be those big issues so
when<00:07:45.560> you<00:07:45.620> get<00:07:45.740> that<00:07:45.890> ball<00:07:46.100> position<00:07:46.550> correct

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820 
when you get that ball position correct

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:52.300 
when you get that ball position correct
