seeing right here in fact let me show
you<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.509> trick<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.229> with

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
you a little trick that you can use with

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.950 
you a little trick that you can use with
any<00:01:43.799> camera<00:01:43.939> Ralpha<00:01:44.939> bat<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> little

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
any camera Ralpha bat see the little

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.200 
any camera Ralpha bat see the little
thing<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.470> says<00:01:46.680> shutter<00:01:47.579> speed<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
thing that says shutter speed if you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.880 
thing that says shutter speed if you
raise<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> number<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> longer

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
raise that number to make it longer

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.130 
raise that number to make it longer
whenever<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.149> picture<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.630> your

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
whenever you take a picture now your

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
whenever you take a picture now your
camera<00:01:52.200> will<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.159> several<00:01:53.790> seconds

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
camera will be on for several seconds

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.050 
camera will be on for several seconds
taking<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.380> picture<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> amount<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.969> time

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
taking a picture for that amount of time

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
taking a picture for that amount of time
now<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:57.899> cool<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:58.829> you

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
now this is really cool because what you

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.950 
now this is really cool because what you
can<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> take<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> light<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.659> move<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
can do is take a light and then move it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.359 
can do is take a light and then move it
around<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.350> frame<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.219> actually

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
around the frame and you can actually

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.550 
around the frame and you can actually
record<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:03.360> trails<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.320> people

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
record like trails with that and people

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
record like trails with that and people

people<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.149> oh<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.539> just<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.430> wave

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
people think that oh I just I just wave

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.870 
people think that oh I just I just wave
a<00:02:11.459> flashlight<00:02:11.790> around<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.569> then

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
a flashlight around and then

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.490 
a flashlight around and then
it's<00:02:12.970> done<00:02:13.180> well<00:02:13.510> actually<00:02:13.690> it's<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.290> whole<00:02:14.320> art

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
form in and of itself because there are

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.500 
form in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.860> different<00:02:18.280> types<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.030> lights<00:02:19.330> that
