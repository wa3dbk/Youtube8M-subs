00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.430
 very good everyone here you have gamer with 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:06.680
 all of you and well must players of 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.300
 the function of the carry years 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.040
 previous we explained a little what 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.019
 it was the function that I had inside the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.120
 game let's see a bit how you have 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.789
 that unwrap online and paper 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.619
 fundamental of the one of carrey so 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.880
 let's go to it well good of we got to 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.730
 our line in this case of position in 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.990
 the biggest to not be the topic that 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.930
 we have to go down with the carrier 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.250
 is exactly the function let's go the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.660
 line that we are going to be exactly 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.920
 the same if we carry a character of 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.260
 these characteristics in this case of 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.300
 meat that is trying to get the 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.859
 maximum farme or possible that this 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.769
 get more or less get what 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.030
 maximum of subjects the last blow to the 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.239
 give the last blow what we get 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.190
 it's extra gold, which is why we get 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.989
 more gold then what is this for? 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.030
 you are asking what is it for me 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.309
 can serve then we do it from this 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.229
 way we get the gold for every 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.850
 I jump we kill what we can do 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.649
 is to make the difference between a car and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.019
 good and a bad lane a bad cardio 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.609
 it will take much worse for less than 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.019
 us if we do not know farmar with the 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.699
 last blow then why when 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.890
 let's base what we 're going to have 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.530
 we are a lot of gold 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.030
 to buy objects and the other lane 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.350
 well in case you have not formed well 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.690
 giving the last blow it will have 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.710
 less money and us when we go back 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.970
 to abbas and back to the line we're going to 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.040
 note this difference very many 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.990
 thank you is going to have a lot more damage than the 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.729
 enemy cardio if we have skills 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.410
 to form as well then we can 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.880
 seize perfectly to try 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.100
 give the last blow and lose the number 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.670
 minimum of subjects so to speak 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.500
 to get an idea at minute 10 15 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.330
 we would have to take for us to be 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.820
 well in this case started very late already 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.729
 and not because we have to take a few 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.799
 100 100 bugs pretty pretty well 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.280
 arriving at 10 minutes 15 m there is 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.229
 already have about 100 bugs 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.580
 and that would be a good average for one of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.549
 carrie simply what you have to 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.770
 focus on far will make the last hit 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.759
 as the current metalhead is the one here 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.049
 up with the support that has been 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.509
 In charge of healing you have to 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.280
 focus mostly on farm ea but 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.750
 together against this objective of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 farmar what you have to do too 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.760
 is the one with the other lines that 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.050
 I exposed to the tower and you come here and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.400
 you have to hit the tower like 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.920
 any other character to try 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.750
 destroy it before the enemy its 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.819
 main goal is to win your line 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.900
 great the street and then while you have 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.910
 to do this, you have to do 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.470
 different things among them is the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.750
 illness with the last blow like 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.900
 we are looking to get pretty 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.360
 gold and be able to dominate the line and also 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.340
 well we have to prevent the other 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
 enemy lane have this facility not 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.700
 have this facility to form if 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.350
 we see that the enemy card is approaching 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.760
 here to form a minion so you 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.500
 we can hit a couple of strokes what 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.090
 we can use some skill to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.010
 scare him a little 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.750
 we have to try us winners 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 the maximum load enemy try 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.310
 farmer the minimum 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.740
 and above all try to go recording 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.900
 looking at the line to to destroy the 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.510
 turret and do try to win is that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.870
 line that is the most important thing of the game 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.170
 you can farmar many minions but 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.790
 if things are not going to us like 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.010
 you have to go your line post to 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.130
 final that advantage that you should have 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.959
 at the end of the best player you see another 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.459
 time but you're going to lose a line 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.340
 be quite complicated to recover that 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.849
 difference 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.580
 and well basically that's all that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.560
 You have to do as Carrie looks like 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.590
 the truth is very easy but the truth is 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.390
 that in sante complicated to know how to do 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.400
 all these things the time to piss themselves 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.930
 it's not not too complicated but it's 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.150
 quite complicated if they have me or 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.340
 that is you have to look paste 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.200
 you have to attack and it is that farmar you have 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.370
 that dominate the line 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.140
 you have to have enough things in 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.120
 account when carrie no crybaby 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.580
 it's just trying to make the most 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.920
 enemy enemy but you have to 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.420
 know how to move in all the points of the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.860
 starting you have to know that the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.470
 You must leave the piss to stop 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.440
 then stay far behind respective to 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.450
 another lane you have to try to win the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.430
 voice line to give them an advantage 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.040
 another team and get that the enemy 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.590
 it loses a little money and a little 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.890
 of objects and lowers its potential the truth 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.610
 is that you carles a position that then in 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.440
 the fight to your goal is to do the 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.000
 maximum number of physical damage to all 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.340
 enemies and the truth is that one lane 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.620
 well, it is very much the homelands 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.729
 but very much you can imagine us 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.830
 how much a carry that is good can 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.060
 win a game if the other one is dead 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.060
 the other team does not play excessively 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.660
 more is a team game but a carry 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.300
 it's good to be good to whip 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.639
 enemy so they can not form 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.889
 and that the line wins then it will have a 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.860
 pretty relevant advantage that is going to 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.340
 do a very vast damage in team faith and 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.770
 can make a difference so good 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.270
 I invite you to first of all if not 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.889
 you know farmer then you put in 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.009
 games like this right now without 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.569
 no rivals no impression and you start 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.800
 try to give the last blow has already been 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.720
 said that the average 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.300
 it has to be ten minutes 15 take us 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.420
 well minion for example there would not be 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.250
 wrong 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.560
 and hours that you have that then you put 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.360
 in normal games against enemies 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.040
 to know how to move or if you can arm 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.680
 at a time and win the line so 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.450
 little by little things and learning 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.310
 let's leave here for more than one video 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.010
 excessively long but you've been left 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.600
 more successful the idea you know that 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.940
 Any doubt you can leave it in a 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.620
 story of the video you can give me like and 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.350
 shared video with whomever you want 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:38.360
 so I'll be adult and see you next 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.360
 video see you later
