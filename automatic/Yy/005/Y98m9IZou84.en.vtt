00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
just get in here okay so this is a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.490 
just get in here okay so this is a
sample<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.010> skyn<00:00:50.399> iceland<00:00:51.090> step<00:00:51.750> 1<00:00:52.020> blue

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
sample this is skyn iceland step 1 blue

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.720 
sample this is skyn iceland step 1 blue
clay<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.579> fresh<00:00:53.940> start<00:00:54.210> mask<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.930> then

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
clay this is a fresh start mask and then

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
clay this is a fresh start mask and then
step<00:00:56.730> two<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> activating<00:00:57.930> gel<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.739> i

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
step two is the activating gel so i

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.560 
step two is the activating gel so i
guess<00:00:59.579> i<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> read<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
guess i would have to read the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810 
guess i would have to read the
directions<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:01.710> how<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.730> it

directions on how to use that but it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.080 
directions on how to use that but it
looks<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.449> facial<00:01:04.199> mask<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:05.010> um<00:01:05.309> I've

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
looks like it's a facial mask so um I've

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.460

the<00:04:30.770> only<00:04:30.889> issue<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.669> that<00:04:31.790> it<00:04:31.940> does<00:04:32.120> kind

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
the only issue is is that it does kind

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.450 
the only issue is is that it does kind
of<00:04:32.479> rub<00:04:32.720> away<00:04:32.840> so<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.770> wasn't<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.190> best

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
of rub away so it wasn't the best

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.700 
of rub away so it wasn't the best
eyeliner<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.479> is<00:04:35.870> something<00:04:36.139> that<00:04:36.470> if<00:04:36.590> you

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.529 
first of all they smell like cucumber
but<00:05:09.440> almost<00:05:09.710> in<00:05:09.860> like<00:05:10.010> an<00:05:10.160> not<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:11.240> very<00:05:11.479> good

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
but almost in like an not a very good

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.159 
but almost in like an not a very good
way<00:05:11.810> um<00:05:12.169> it<00:05:12.800> wasn't<00:05:13.120> unbearable<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.840> know<00:05:14.960> it

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
way um it wasn't unbearable you know it

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.990 
way um it wasn't unbearable you know it
just<00:05:15.200> it<00:05:15.530> wasn't<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.039> best<00:05:16.250> sent<00:05:16.610> for<00:05:16.789> me<00:05:16.910> I'd

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
just it wasn't the best sent for me I'd

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.700 
just it wasn't the best sent for me I'd
like<00:05:17.180> them<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.360> smell<00:05:17.750> more<00:05:17.930> clean<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:18.500> less

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
like them to smell more clean and less

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.150 
like them to smell more clean and less
like<00:05:19.070> cucumber<00:05:19.789> and<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:21.530> problem<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:21.979> had

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
like cucumber and the problem that I had

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.500 
like cucumber and the problem that I had
with<00:05:22.310> these<00:05:22.460> was<00:05:22.700> that<00:05:22.820> they<00:05:22.910> did<00:05:23.090> not<00:05:23.120> remove

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
with these was that they did not remove

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.150 
with these was that they did not remove
any<00:05:23.720> of<00:05:23.870> my<00:05:23.990> makeup<00:05:24.349> it<00:05:24.680> did<00:05:24.919> absolutely

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
any of my makeup it did absolutely

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.190 
any of my makeup it did absolutely
nothing<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:25.849> they<00:05:26.000> did<00:05:26.150> not<00:05:26.300> work<00:05:26.510> for<00:05:26.539> me<00:05:26.840> um

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
nothing so they did not work for me um

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.350 
nothing so they did not work for me um
and<00:05:27.979> it<00:05:28.130> just<00:05:28.310> kind<00:05:28.460> of<00:05:28.520> left<00:05:28.700> like<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:28.910> greasy

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
and it just kind of left like a greasy

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.150 
and it just kind of left like a greasy
residue<00:05:29.389> behind<00:05:29.990> so<00:05:30.470> I<00:05:30.500> didn't<00:05:30.950> really<00:05:30.979> care

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
residue behind so I didn't really care

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.600
