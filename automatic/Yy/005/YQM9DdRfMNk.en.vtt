too long everyone you can see that he

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.810 
too long everyone you can see that he
had<00:02:49.060> enough<00:02:49.360> he<00:02:50.350> had<00:02:50.380> enough<00:02:50.920> room<00:02:51.520> on<00:02:51.670> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
had enough he had enough room on the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.370 
had enough he had enough room on the
safety<00:02:52.090> where<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.780> could<00:02:52.989> just<00:02:53.080> bombed<00:02:53.320> up<00:02:53.530> top

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
safety where I could just bombed up top

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.630 
safety where I could just bombed up top
again<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.709> slants<00:02:57.070> in<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.220> middle<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.550> then

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
again to slants in the middle and then

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.100 
again to slants in the middle and then
you<00:02:57.760> have<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.360> keep<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.780> see<00:02:58.989> your

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
you have to you keep the to see your

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:07.440 
you have to you keep the to see your
house<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.470> outside<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.690> wash<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:06.450> yeah

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
house on the outside and wash and yeah

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.970 
house on the outside and wash and yeah
it's<00:03:07.570> inside<00:03:07.900> positioning<00:03:08.410> every<00:03:08.620> time<00:03:08.830> you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
it's inside positioning every time you

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.740 
it's inside positioning every time you
even<00:03:09.130> if<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.340> looks<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.450> might<00:03:10.570> be<00:03:10.600> a

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
even if it looks like it might be a

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.860 
even if it looks like it might be a
little<00:03:10.900> bit<00:03:11.080> close<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:13.330> won't<00:03:13.510> they

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
little bit close and you won't they

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.390 
little bit close and you won't they
won't<00:03:14.050> really<00:03:14.320> be<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.590> position<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:14.980> even<00:03:15.070> hit

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
won't really be in position to even hit

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.870 
won't really be in position to even hit
you<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.590> don't<00:03:17.860> worry<00:03:18.370> about<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:18.850> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
you so you don't worry about like the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.180 
you so you don't worry about like the
hit<00:03:19.090> sticks<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.600> know<00:03:19.959> there's<00:03:20.230> some<00:03:20.440> some

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
hit sticks I know there's some some

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.430 
hit sticks I know there's some some
 in<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:21.850> game<00:03:22.120> where<00:03:22.450> you'll<00:03:23.290> get

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
 in this game where you'll get

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.140 
 in this game where you'll get
hits<00:03:23.680> take<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.010> ball<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.430> balance<00:03:24.820> around

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
hits take the ball like balance around

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.710 
hits take the ball like balance around
and<00:03:25.390> they'll<00:03:25.510> somehow<00:03:25.720> end<00:03:25.989> up<00:03:26.080> with<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:27.720> they

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
and they'll somehow end up with it they

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.110 
and they'll somehow end up with it they
look<00:03:29.080> plenty<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.590> room<00:03:29.769> cover<00:03:30.489> for<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.940> safety

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
look plenty of room cover for the safety

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.199 
look plenty of room cover for the safety
just<00:03:31.420> they<00:03:32.049> just<00:03:32.080> bail<00:03:32.530> out<00:03:32.560> for<00:03:33.040> no<00:03:33.160> reason

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
just they just bail out for no reason

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.670 
just they just bail out for no reason
I'll<00:03:34.209> show<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.480> one<00:03:34.630> more<00:03:34.780> time<00:03:34.989> against<00:03:35.350> this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
I'll show it one more time against this

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.979 
I'll show it one more time against this
and<00:03:36.100> so<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:36.760> guess<00:03:36.910> cover<00:03:37.180> for<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.600> pretty

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
and so I guess cover for is a pretty

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:46.400 
and so I guess cover for is a pretty
popular<00:03:39.820> d<00:03:43.230> all<00:03:44.230> right

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
popular d all right

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.800 
popular d all right
and<00:03:47.410> they<00:03:48.160> can't<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.550> just<00:03:48.850> go<00:03:49.000> use<00:03:49.780> with

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
and they can't really just go use with

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.140 
and they can't really just go use with
that<00:03:50.020> because<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.710> got<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.950> respect<00:03:51.850> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
that because you got to respect the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.730 
that because you got to respect the
slant<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.630> see<00:03:52.840> there<00:03:53.110> that's<00:03:53.440> what<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.650> was

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
slant and see there that's what I was

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.620 
slant and see there that's what I was
talking<00:03:53.890> about<00:03:54.070> sometimes<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.150> safety<00:03:55.450> goes

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
talking about sometimes the safety goes

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.150 
talking about sometimes the safety goes
down<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.080> far<00:03:56.320> that<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.590> can<00:03:56.770> just<00:03:56.920> hit<00:03:57.010> them

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
down so far that you can just hit them

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.430 
down so far that you can just hit them
over<00:03:57.220> top<00:03:57.520> I'll<00:03:58.180> say<00:03:58.390> happens<00:03:58.840> Lewis<00:03:59.200> leg

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
over top I'll say happens Lewis leg

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.950 
over top I'll say happens Lewis leg
thirty<00:04:00.160> forty<00:04:00.640> percent<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.060> time<00:04:01.210> so<00:04:01.900> you

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
thirty forty percent of the time so you

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.720 
thirty forty percent of the time so you
definitely<00:04:02.110> got<00:04:02.350> to<00:04:02.380> look<00:04:02.680> out<00:04:02.770> for<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:03.010> you

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
definitely got to look out for that you

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.360 
definitely got to look out for that you
want<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.750> complete<00:04:05.050> big<00:04:05.380> play<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.710> just

want the complete big play and just

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.430 
want the complete big play and just

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
completely getting out of and

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.890 
completely getting out of and
now<00:04:08.650> I'll<00:04:08.980> just<00:04:09.100> show<00:04:09.250> it<00:04:09.310> against<00:04:09.550> cover<00:04:10.000> 35<00:04:10.660> d

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
now I'll just show it against cover 35 d

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.410

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
waiting for swear somebody to eat he

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.460 
waiting for swear somebody to eat he
didn't<00:04:46.240> bounce<00:04:46.360> on<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.630> sideline<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.260> time

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
didn't bounce on the sideline that time

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.710 
didn't bounce on the sideline that time
as<00:04:47.730> really<00:04:48.730> unusual<00:04:48.850> he<00:04:49.300> pretty<00:04:49.630> much

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
instantly bounces off every time so

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:03.260
