00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
but even with these non-invasive

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.669 
but even with these non-invasive
procedures<00:01:15.969> like<00:01:16.210> Botox<00:01:16.719> for<00:01:16.960> example<00:01:17.320> could

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
procedures like Botox for example could

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.440 
procedures like Botox for example could
still<00:01:17.890> be<00:01:18.009> very<00:01:18.250> expensive<00:01:18.640> have<00:01:19.030> you<00:01:19.090> see<00:01:19.299> the

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
still be very expensive have you see the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.169 
still be very expensive have you see the
prices<00:01:19.659> come<00:01:20.200> down<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:21.310> haven't<00:01:21.609> quite<00:01:21.909> yet

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
prices come down they haven't quite yet

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:23.999 
prices come down they haven't quite yet
but<00:01:22.390> there<00:01:22.570> there<00:01:23.020> are<00:01:23.049> competitors<00:01:23.590> that<00:01:23.950> are

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
but there there are competitors that are

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.859 
but there there are competitors that are
coming<00:01:24.340> out<00:01:24.429> with<00:01:24.490> Botox<00:01:25.299> and<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.570> think<00:01:25.750> we're

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
coming out with Botox and I think we're

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.109 
coming out with Botox and I think we're
going<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.049> see<00:01:26.079> probably<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.799> price<00:01:27.130> war<00:01:27.429> with

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
going to see probably a price war with

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.090 
going to see probably a price war with
Botox<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:28.990> fillers<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.799> things<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.070> that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
Botox and fillers and things of that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.219 
Botox and fillers and things of that
sort<00:01:30.219> in<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.729> future<00:01:31.179> what<00:01:31.869> are<00:01:31.960> some<00:01:32.079> of<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
sort in the future what are some of the

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.319 
sort in the future what are some of the
other<00:01:32.350> things<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.740> people<00:01:33.070> are<00:01:33.159> choosing<00:01:34.060> to

continue<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.140> do<00:01:35.320> right<00:01:35.560> now<00:01:35.770> sure<00:01:36.130> well<00:01:36.640> with

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
continue to do right now sure well with

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.789 
continue to do right now sure well with
this<00:01:37.090> rise<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:37.719> minimally<00:01:38.170> invasive<00:01:38.649> type

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
this rise of the minimally invasive type

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.590 
this rise of the minimally invasive type
of<00:01:38.950> procedures<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.729> know<00:01:39.820> people<00:01:40.179> are<00:01:40.270> really

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
of procedures you know people are really

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.300 
of procedures you know people are really
looking<00:01:40.780> at<00:01:41.020> botox<00:01:41.530> fillers<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:41.920> skin

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
looking at botox fillers and skin

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.039 
looking at botox fillers and skin
treatments<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:42.939> I<00:01:42.969> think<00:01:43.210> so<00:01:43.359> usually<00:01:43.810> things

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
treatments and I think so usually things

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.929 
treatments and I think so usually things
mostly<00:01:44.439> for<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.710> face<00:01:44.890> mainly<00:01:45.490> for<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.700> face

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
mostly for the face mainly for the face

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.029 
mostly for the face mainly for the face
absolutely<00:01:46.659> and<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.840> think<00:01:47.109> when<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.649> comes<00:01:47.679> to

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
absolutely and I think when it comes to

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:49.980 
absolutely and I think when it comes to
Botox<00:01:48.490> I<00:01:48.729> always<00:01:49.060> tell<00:01:49.210> my<00:01:49.329> patients<00:01:49.359> there's

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
Botox I always tell my patients there's

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.630 
Botox I always tell my patients there's
two<00:01:50.229> things<00:01:50.469> that<00:01:50.590> got<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.890> keep<00:01:51.100> in<00:01:51.219> mind<00:01:51.429> to

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
two things that got to keep in mind to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.130 
two things that got to keep in mind to
get<00:01:51.759> more<00:01:51.999> bang<00:01:52.270> for<00:01:52.509> their<00:01:52.569> buck<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.020> that's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
get more bang for their buck and that's

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.630 
get more bang for their buck and that's
number<00:01:53.409> one<00:01:53.590> when<00:01:54.219> you're<00:01:54.340> getting<00:01:54.490> your

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
number one when you're getting your

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.459 
number one when you're getting your
Botox<00:01:55.060> injection<00:01:55.539> always<00:01:55.929> ask<00:01:56.140> how<00:01:56.409> many

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
Botox injection always ask how many

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.289 
Botox injection always ask how many
units<00:01:56.920> you're<00:01:57.310> getting<00:01:57.549> injected<00:01:57.850> because

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
units you're getting injected because

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.969 
units you're getting injected because
we're<00:01:58.780> not<00:01:58.960> measuring<00:01:59.229> Botox<00:01:59.829> and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
we're not measuring Botox and

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.559 
we're not measuring Botox and
milliliters<00:02:00.549> or<00:02:00.670> in<00:02:00.789> syringes<00:02:01.270> so<00:02:01.450> it's

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
milliliters or in syringes so it's

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:02.879 
milliliters or in syringes so it's
important<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:01.990> know<00:02:02.079> how<00:02:02.109> many<00:02:02.409> units<00:02:02.560> and

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:02.889 
important to know how many units and

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.800 
important to know how many units and
number<00:02:03.069> two<00:02:03.249> is<00:02:03.429> when<00:02:03.999> was<00:02:04.210> his<00:02:04.299> botox

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
number two is when was his botox

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.080 
number two is when was his botox
reconstituted<00:02:05.799> when<00:02:06.009> wasn't<00:02:06.369> mixed<00:02:06.639> because

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
reconstituted when wasn't mixed because

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.790
