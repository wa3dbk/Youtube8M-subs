to keep this secure and then I'm only

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.230 
to keep this secure and then I'm only
gonna<00:01:20.070> silicone<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> back<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
gonna silicone this in the back of the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.429 
gonna silicone this in the back of the
cabinet<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.840> leave<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> front<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cabinet and they leave the front and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.010 
cabinet and they leave the front and
free<00:01:22.820> also<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> little<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.720> gonna<00:01:24.810> heat

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
free also it's a little it's gonna heat

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.149 
free also it's a little it's gonna heat
up<00:01:25.110> pretty<00:01:25.170> quick<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.740> actually<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.040> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
up pretty quick so it's actually get it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.740 
up pretty quick so it's actually get it
distribute<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> heat<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> three<00:01:27.540> rods

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
distribute the heat from the three rods

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.020 
distribute the heat from the three rods
pretty<00:01:28.110> evenly<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.650> comes<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.950> even<00:01:29.130> all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
pretty evenly so it comes up even all

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.990 
pretty evenly so it comes up even all
the<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.689> real<00:01:30.840> small<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.189> oven

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the way it's a real small you know oven

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.950 
the way it's a real small you know oven
so<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.329> gonna<00:01:33.509> make<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.810> difference

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
so it's not gonna make a difference

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630 
so it's not gonna make a difference
anyway<00:01:34.350> or<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> bigger<00:01:34.950> winter<00:01:35.189> probably<00:01:35.340> help

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
anyway or a bigger winter probably help

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.660 
anyway or a bigger winter probably help
but<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.530> once<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.799> get<00:01:37.979> those<00:01:38.130> three<00:01:38.340> holes<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
but so once I get those three holes the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
but so once I get those three holes the
back<00:01:38.820> lined<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.270> three<00:01:39.780> holes<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
back lined up three holes in this

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.800 
back lined up three holes in this
drilled<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.829> I'll<00:01:40.950> adjust<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> depth<00:01:41.970> front

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
drilled then I'll adjust the depth front

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
drilled then I'll adjust the depth front
the<00:01:42.899> rear<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.070> I'm<00:01:44.310> gonna<00:01:44.490> finally<00:01:44.700> put

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the rear and then I'm gonna finally put

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.319 
the rear and then I'm gonna finally put
a<00:01:45.000> hole<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:47.700> bolt<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
a hole in this and then bolt it to the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.770 
a hole in this and then bolt it to the
bottom<00:01:50.329> cabinet<00:01:51.329> when<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> could<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
bottom cabinet when you could you

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.330 
bottom cabinet when you could you
silicone<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> drill<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
silicone if you don't want to drill a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
silicone if you don't want to drill a
hole<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.570> easier<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> take<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
hole for me it's easier to take a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.920 
hole for me it's easier to take a
quarter-inch<00:01:55.649> bolting

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
quarter-inch bolting

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.480 
quarter-inch bolting
go<00:01:57.470> through<00:01:57.710> his<00:01:57.860> remember<00:01:58.160> I<00:01:58.220> said<00:01:58.400> they

go through his remember I said they

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.440 
go through his remember I said they
found<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.700> video<00:01:58.940> we're<00:01:59.060> gonna<00:01:59.150> make<00:01:59.270> all<00:01:59.360> the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
found the video we're gonna make all the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.590 
found the video we're gonna make all the
holes<00:01:59.630> first<00:02:00.070> before<00:02:01.070> we<00:02:01.220> start<00:02:01.390> lining<00:02:02.390> with

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
holes first before we start lining with

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.770 
holes first before we start lining with
insulation<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:04.610> I'm<00:02:04.910> going<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.210> come<00:02:05.330> back<00:02:05.450> to

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
insulation so I'm going to come back to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.510 
insulation so I'm going to come back to
show<00:02:06.400> their<00:02:07.400> cuff<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:08.560> make<00:02:09.560> my<00:02:09.740> holes<00:02:09.979> and

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
show their cuff this make my holes and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.450 
show their cuff this make my holes and
then<00:02:11.090> return<00:02:11.680> make<00:02:12.680> sure<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.950> waited<00:02:13.340> all

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.670 

right<00:02:19.460> that<00:02:20.180> phase<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.600> finished<00:02:20.810> as<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.530> can

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
right that phase is finished as you can

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.680 
right that phase is finished as you can
see<00:02:21.800> what<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:21.950> did<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.550> drilled<00:02:23.540> some<00:02:23.630> holes

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
see what I did here I drilled some holes

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.650 
see what I did here I drilled some holes
in<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:23.990> back<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:25.520> run<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.790> cartridge<00:02:26.360> heaters

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
in the back to run the cartridge heaters

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.410 
in the back to run the cartridge heaters
through<00:02:28.810> cut<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.200> drilled<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:31.180> Ivan<00:02:32.180> Ivan

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
through cut and drilled the Ivan Ivan

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.820 
through cut and drilled the Ivan Ivan
secured<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:32.900> yet<00:02:33.080> but<00:02:33.230> cut<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.560> drill<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
secured this yet but cut and drill the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.330 
secured this yet but cut and drill the
aluminum<00:02:34.760> ear<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:36.020> hold<00:02:36.500> these<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.650> place<00:02:36.920> on

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
aluminum ear to hold these in place on

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.430 
aluminum ear to hold these in place on
the<00:02:37.459> silicon<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.000> back<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.360> place<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.870> don't

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the silicon the back in place I don't

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.500 
the silicon the back in place I don't
want<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> metal<00:02:39.890> touching<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.520> casing<00:02:40.970> it's

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
want the metal touching the casing it's

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
want the metal touching the casing it's
getting<00:02:41.720> heated<00:02:41.810> up<00:02:42.050> quicker<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:44.030> then<00:02:45.020> I

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
getting heated up quicker and then I

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.680 
getting heated up quicker and then I
drilled<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.490> like<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.240> got<00:02:47.390> tighten<00:02:47.630> it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
drilled this like so we got tighten it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.060 
drilled this like so we got tighten it
up<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.260> almost<00:02:48.410> forgot<00:02:48.740> about<00:02:48.830> the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
up and I almost forgot about the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.220 
up and I almost forgot about the
insulation<00:02:49.400> material<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:50.150> actually<00:02:50.959> would

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
insulation material I actually would

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.699 
insulation material I actually would
have<00:02:51.260> probably<00:02:52.209> drilled<00:02:53.209> my<00:02:53.360> holes<00:02:53.600> back<00:02:54.440> here

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
have probably drilled my holes back here

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.610 
have probably drilled my holes back here
a<00:02:54.800> little<00:02:54.890> bit<00:02:55.280> higher<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:56.540> really<00:02:57.320> not<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> big

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
a little bit higher but really not a big

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.520 
a little bit higher but really not a big
deal<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:58.010> left<00:02:58.840> plenty<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.900> play<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.110> think<00:03:00.500> I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
deal I left plenty of play I think I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.380 
deal I left plenty of play I think I
only<00:03:00.680> pushed<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.070> off<00:03:01.190> like<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> like<00:03:02.030> an<00:03:02.239> eighth

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
only pushed it off like a like an eighth

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.070 
only pushed it off like a like an eighth
of<00:03:02.480> an<00:03:02.600> inch

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
of an inch

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.020 
of an inch
look<00:03:03.590> straight<00:03:03.890> falling<00:03:04.280> parents<00:03:04.580> purposes

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
look straight falling parents purposes

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.759 
look straight falling parents purposes
only<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.600> make<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.750> difference<00:03:06.080> anyway<00:03:06.350> if<00:03:06.620> it's

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
only to make a difference anyway if it's

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.240 
only to make a difference anyway if it's
straight<00:03:06.980> or<00:03:07.100> not<00:03:08.440> it's<00:03:09.440> an<00:03:09.560> insulation<00:03:09.920> still

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250

straight or not it's an insulation still
needs<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.489> get<00:03:11.110> glued<00:03:12.110> down<00:03:12.380> I'll<00:03:12.680> have<00:03:12.769> the

needs to get glued down I'll have the
glue<00:03:13.100> yet<00:03:13.340> I'll<00:03:13.519> hold<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.760> down<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.940> little

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
glue yet I'll hold it down a little

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.699 
glue yet I'll hold it down a little
further<00:03:14.330> for<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.630> stuffs<00:03:14.840> good<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.080> 2,000

further for the stuffs good to 2,000
degrees<00:03:16.120> direct<00:03:17.120> contact<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:20.090> not

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
degrees direct contact so this is not

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.490 
degrees direct contact so this is not
going<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.570> get<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.750> hot<00:03:20.930> we're<00:03:21.140> looking<00:03:21.350> for

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
going to get the hot we're looking for

it's not gonna keep it there so happy
with<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.280> some<00:03:29.269> aluminum<00:03:29.959> foils<00:03:30.260> on<00:03:30.350> top<00:03:30.500> of

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
with this some aluminum foils on top of

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.220 
with this some aluminum foils on top of
the<00:03:30.820> aluminum<00:03:31.820> is<00:03:31.880> on<00:03:31.970> top<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.390> insulation

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
the aluminum is on top of the insulation

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.560 
the aluminum is on top of the insulation
don't<00:03:33.860> want<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.040> bottom<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.400> get<00:03:34.550> hot<00:03:34.760> even<00:03:35.390> it

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
don't want the bottom to get hot even it

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.270 
don't want the bottom to get hot even it
still<00:03:35.780> if<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:35.959> gets<00:03:36.260> hot<00:03:36.410> as<00:03:36.560> this<00:03:36.800> all<00:03:37.010> become

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
still if it gets hot as this all become

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.470 
still if it gets hot as this all become
moist<00:03:37.370> put<00:03:37.610> another<00:03:37.730> piece<00:03:37.970> in<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.150> bottom

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
moist put another piece in the bottom

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.640 
moist put another piece in the bottom
and<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.600> think<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:38.900> should<00:03:39.110> be<00:03:39.610> sufficient<00:03:40.610> so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
and I think this should be sufficient so

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.530 
and I think this should be sufficient so
at<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:42.739> point<00:03:42.950> here<00:03:43.459> once<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.940> glue<00:03:44.150> shows

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
at this point here once the glue shows

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.680 
at this point here once the glue shows
up<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.580> can<00:03:46.580> glue<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.820> insulation<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.420> inside

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
up I can glue the insulation the inside

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.970 
up I can glue the insulation the inside
I<00:03:47.720> have<00:03:48.019> decided<00:03:48.320> I'm<00:03:48.470> gonna<00:03:48.560> do<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:48.799> on<00:03:48.860> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
I have decided I'm gonna do it on the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.830 
I have decided I'm gonna do it on the
inside<00:03:49.250> even<00:03:49.430> if<00:03:49.610> it's<00:03:49.940> less<00:03:50.150> parts<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.690> just

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
inside even if it's less parts it just

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.270 
inside even if it's less parts it just
could<00:03:50.989> be<00:03:51.019> neater<00:03:51.290> cleaner<00:03:51.410> is<00:03:51.890> be<00:03:52.100> better

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
could be neater cleaner is be better

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
I have bought one on Amazon didn't

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.270 
I have bought one on Amazon didn't
realize<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.660> was<00:05:00.720> 220<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.520> want<00:05:02.700> 120<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:04.280> I

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
realize it was 220 and I want 120 so I

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.070 
realize it was 220 and I want 120 so I
got<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.910> fine<00:05:06.150> actually<00:05:06.419> 220<00:05:06.750> sitting<00:05:06.990> around

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
got a fine actually 220 sitting around

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.620 
got a fine actually 220 sitting around
with<00:05:07.320> no<00:05:07.440> use<00:05:07.680> but<00:05:07.980> once<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.850> 120<00:05:09.240> shows<00:05:09.419> up

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
with no use but once that 120 shows up

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.790 
with no use but once that 120 shows up
I'm<00:05:09.780> not<00:05:09.930> gonna<00:05:10.050> wire<00:05:10.260> that<00:05:10.470> in<00:05:10.590> with<00:05:10.680> this

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
I'm not gonna wire that in with this

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.980 
I'm not gonna wire that in with this
well<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:12.120> know<00:05:12.180> test<00:05:12.479> its<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.720> know<00:05:12.780> how<00:05:12.930> to

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
well you know test its you know how to

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.219 
well you know test its you know how to
get<00:05:13.669> just<00:05:14.669> with<00:05:14.760> this<00:05:14.910> plug-in<00:05:15.180> directly<00:05:16.020> to

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
get just with this plug-in directly to

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.740 
get just with this plug-in directly to
it<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:18.870> that's<00:05:19.530> phase<00:05:19.830> two<00:05:19.890> and<00:05:20.450> next<00:05:21.450> part<00:05:21.630> we

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
it so that's phase two and next part we

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.229 
it so that's phase two and next part we
phase<00:05:21.990> three
