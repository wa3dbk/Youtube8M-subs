00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello to all subscribers today we 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.109
 look at the lego set at number 94 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.889
 63 series 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.889
 monster fighters and this set is called 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.889
 werewolf 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.040
 f1 2012 release 243 vega parts and 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.189
 two minifigures similar set already 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.130
 was produced in 2002 was such a series 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.340
 studios there was a werewolf too 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.699
 the car was also a tree 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:45.920
 but to hell let's look at the packaging 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:49.519
 here it is the front of the package is pretty 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.370
 nice here's the back of the package here 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.930
 seem a small traction function 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.570
 this set in general, everything is clear and 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.640
 so here it is our set I fully assembled 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.059
 I want to say that this is not the smallest 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.909
 set 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.920
 He certainly is not huge but what about the car 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.850
 what's on tree using on enough 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.400
 many details 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.060
 well let's look closer here 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.260
 she's car car looks pretty 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.229
 cute very nice sand color 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.700
 This car resembles those cars that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.700
 were in sets of adventures 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:39.049
 here on top of the hood sits a little 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:42.020
 Toad Toad Toad Toad Toad or Frog 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:47.840
 interestingly done from this part this here 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.610
 all gun and shoved gun and here 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.459
 so you can use a gun and to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.579
 create a car here it is at the tree very 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:59.979
 interesting design this tree is even 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.979
 I'll show it a little later by surprise 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:13.670
 very very nice and asks for 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.700
 kosovo series as you see used 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.019
 very nice details lego very 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.780
 everything is well detailed means what 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.989
 joking them than the action function of this 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.370
 wood 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.560
 here behind there is such a lever 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.720
 we put a minifigure here and then we can 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.760
 to push 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.040
 naturally werewolf minifigure 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.780
 catapulted and jumps on his 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.780
 here is the victim 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.480
 and so now let's look at the mini 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.990
 figures from this set there are only 2 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.880
 This of course a werewolf and this 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.430
 minifigure name is major quinton steel 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.460
 again this character is very similar to 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.690
 me a figure from a series of adventures yes 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.140
 because it looks like 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.140
 archives and here he is our major quinton steel 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:25.730
 pretty pretty face as he 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.020
 have your own accessory 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.750
 here it is the gun and here is the minifigure 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.500
 werewolves for which the gray itself 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:42.330
 It is worth buying this set very much 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.670
 cute werewolf accessories are two 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.270
 here are these claws which by the way of communication 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.270
 quite find 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.620
 complete course instruction is 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.670
 I understand nothing interesting there for myself 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:07.930
 we will not find but maybe we will find a reklamk 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:10.209
 other vita goods at the end of here 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.890
 what minifigures are in different set 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.269
 these two are generally cheap 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.390
 mummy some marsh monster here is our 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.820
 abortion themselves 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.919
 all minifigures are very cute 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.550
 especially now these ghosts i have 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.960
 cast old serikov 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.970
 ankin matte but this set is very 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.470
 Interestingly, I'm thinking of buying myself. 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.310
 to ghost train 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.500
 it's cool ghost train is necessary to 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.750
 moment from what I am selling now 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.720
 I think that the monster fighters series and 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.100
 star wars this is the most interesting yes and 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.650
 there was no such interesting 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.470
 monster fighters minifigures 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.080
 just every minifigure deserves 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.190
 attention and every monster from this series 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.180
 so ask your collection 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.140
 minifigures 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.760
 This is a relatively inexpensive set therefore 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.010
 see for yourself who liked the way 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:07.830
 Of course, buy thanks to everyone 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.830
 followers for viewing all world
