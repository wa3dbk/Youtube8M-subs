is giving out free for the case program

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.080 
is giving out free for the case program
it's<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.750> simple<00:00:22.080> packaging<00:00:22.640> not<00:00:23.640> much<00:00:23.850> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
feeling and it's not what I thought it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.710 
feeling and it's not what I thought it
would<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.590> even<00:01:37.860> when<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.340> um<00:01:38.720> I'll

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
would be and then even when you um I'll

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.690 
would be and then even when you um I'll
go<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:39.990> put<00:01:40.110> eyes<00:01:40.229> before<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.060> case

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
go and put eyes before here in the case

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
go and put eyes before here in the case
and<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> pull<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.689> around<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and you have to pull it around you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
definitely have to pull this around and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.560 
definitely have to pull this around and
then<00:01:48.270> yet<00:01:48.509> me<00:01:48.780> massage<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.290> into<00:01:50.070> place<00:01:50.570> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
then yet me massage it into place you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.639 
then yet me massage it into place you
always<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.170> massage<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:54.060> gets

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
always have to massage it if not it gets

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.300 
always have to massage it if not it gets
really<00:01:55.649> annoying<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:57.560> there<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:59.130> in

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
really annoying but there you go it's in

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
really annoying but there you go it's in
the<00:01:59.460> case<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.939> think<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.960> has<00:02:01.110> all

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
the case and I think and but it has all

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.870 
the case and I think and but it has all
these<00:02:01.409> holes<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.189> course<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.729> see

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
these holes on it and course you can see

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.609 
these holes on it and course you can see
theorem<00:02:03.090> kinda<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> apple<00:02:03.990> logo<00:02:04.170> there

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
theorem kinda see the apple logo there

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
theorem kinda see the apple logo there
and<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.030> pull<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.509> off<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> few<00:02:06.960> minutes

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and I just pull this off a few minutes

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.719
