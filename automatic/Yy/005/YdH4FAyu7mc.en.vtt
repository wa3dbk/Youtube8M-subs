00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.889
 If you want 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.740
 hello to all here however one thing and for you today a product of the 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.229
 jabra brand 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.459
 jabra is this brand that makes blue kits all for the phone 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.349
 portable 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.400
 and so they make headphones handsfree kits and today 

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.859
 I'm going to introduce you to the latest of his hands-free kits 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 I named the jabra kouchner 2 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.630
 we'll get a little closer 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.060
 and of course we will find all the classic functions and others that they 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.660
 may be a little less so with the possibility of dropping out 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.400
 and hang up is normal thing not bad we have the principle of two microphones for 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.090
 alleviate the senses by Asia so we find the sound of the car 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.600
 you will be able to stream music from your smartphone and 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.040
 conversations on the speakers of your turkey what the poseur mirror of 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.670
 inside a small fm transmitter 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.550
 we also manage two phones at the same time 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.200
 voice control and all with a talk time of 14 hours 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.100
 I do not want to linger for a very long time. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 the small unpacking 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.690
 so the box that today opens super easily 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.660
 I do not need the little knife of usual 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.660
 do not be disappointed I think it is to serve again very soon 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.190
 So here we come right away on the left 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.260
 and there you realize that we have a fairly simple product 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.990
 passion and turkish lafayette sabri not all sides 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.720
 so a fairly simple and elegant design a little mat and that will suit 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.720
 I think of most of you 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 so here I galley a little to detach 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 this is almost there 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.130
 so we will be able to discover the accessories provided in the box 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.130
 now the mans do not have thirty-six thousand things 1 but just what 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.490
 switch 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.460
 we also see that behind it is rather empty 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.460
 so we first have a quick start guide as always 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.369
 after 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.579
 head underwater something that looks like this usb cable 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.900
 at the end of the cycle what makes them say to the opponents of hugo chavez 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.929
 on his pc 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.929
 or in the car which is convenient because that's where we will use it 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.689
 I come back now that one produces in itself so as I said all 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.339
 at the time level design and ergonomics at first sight it looks pretty 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:25.129
 simple 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.949
 for a button picks up a close 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.949
 what to adjust the volume some lights here 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.209
 on the side the crisis to reload 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.589
 the stop button 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.799
 and the one that activates the transmission is weak 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.029
 and finally behind you have the clip what will allow you to tie 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:47.389
 sun and that can also seem a bit fragile but we'll see what it 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.959
 gives in the next law the text on the bench
