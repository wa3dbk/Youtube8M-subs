00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 hello so here is the centurion 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:15.389
 is mayia canon not too badly done 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.109
 not too bad to make good build we're going 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.390
 say pretty much normally 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:26.369
 it was obviously planned a system 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:30.060
 motorized on this version there exists 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.850
 the more we still have little tricks 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:42.110
 funny to say that everything is reproduced 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:46.520
 level suspension rubber pad 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.520
 makes everything functional 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.890
 so he's fine 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.900
 if we were not here we could 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:12.330
 almost have the real sound outside of 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:21.210
 the dust so we can see the word 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:27.259
 tons with this big radiator and the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.259
 position getting the cockpit 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:41.160
 that's normally all this is sticking 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:44.850
 but I like to arrange for that 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.899
 does not know at last of power I 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.899
 go find other aveo 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:09.280
 in order to present him the rest of the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.310
 project by hardware quentin is not 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.350
 completed of course it's a project that 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.270
 could possibly break then 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.900
 the turret a pretty big piece with 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.900
 interior 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.130
 shells that are very bad but 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.680
 it was English shells so intended for 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.950
 German enemy mosses well 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.370
 heard so here you have all the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:48.700
 post with the breech assembly 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:57.940
 functional in his ranks a big 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:03:08.080
 event so that's all this is 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:10.350
 covered by canton my rights with the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.989
 doors that go well except that this one 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.040
 finally when I turn a clip then 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.040
 that it works well 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:35.140
 this is again it sticks 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.590
 well I like not to stick so 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.410
 this must be able to get down to 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:04:03.250
 close as it is 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:04:04.630
 we need here I forgot to put in 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.210
 flat career but it does not matter 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:14.310
 for ideas as you will have seen in 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:14.310
 revision and 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.269
 that's how it looks or should be 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:29.970
 present 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:32.180
 another gear when it will be finished charter 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:36.449
 Njawe 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.820
 but hey it's not over and over 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.199
 I lost some small pieces so 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.830
 that I'm doing my best to try to 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.620
 find these striking pieces he was 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.720
 started a few years ago he can 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.760
 just a little bit wait here 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.760
