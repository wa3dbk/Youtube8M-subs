 neither ps4 no xbox the year you do not have 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.369
 a very powerful pc 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:47.909
 I did not intend church, did not intend to buy 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.759
 or the answer is yes 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.039
 obviously it's very worth you 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:57.539
 buy beto 24 from the current consoles 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.549
 total generation s3 or 860 does 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.899
 it's worth it because the game 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.219
 continued the same guy who played 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.479
 battlefield 3 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.830
 as I, for example, I started playing the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.330
 b series of the river né 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.740

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.950
 nanny 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.770
 I then moved to the rebel islands 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.500
 company a foot of compadre 2 battlefield 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.860
 3 played on the consoles 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.120
 then got 3 I did not call the pc 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.550
 in the then since the youth of ps obviously 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.380
 I'm going to play because it 's much better and I'm also 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.750
 that's right 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.370
 and that for example I started now I am 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.860
 playing a lot of pc 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.510
 I really can not go back to play. 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:49.540
 of the ps3 aircraft still a bag in the queue 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 Go and see the ballet that takes you to luxury. 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.820
 for the obviously obviously expensive stories 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.150
 no frills nec cutting we say the 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.600
 things always intense dark of is looks 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.970
 only in the photographic look how bad is it and I 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.250
 I thought a lot, it's logical, it's better 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.560
 human port is to compare the ps3 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.450
 the video game almost ten years a radio 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.250
 old fucking that is compare to the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.530
 pc's today's ball 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.709
 today the pc more or less is very 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.570
 better than ps3 is not sure if you want 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.700
 compare can not compare but you 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.610
 It has to be coherent and it 's mother. 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.360
 obviously you 've already made a mistake or say 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.300
 again 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.820
 You will not buy the ps4 and it will not. 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.310
 buy the xbox one né 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.310
 you do not have a very powerful profile 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.670
 fucking buy on ps3 that I guarantee 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.590
 You that fun is guaranteed games 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.900

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.930
 My game is really fucking good, but I 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.700
 playing here now 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.590

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.680
 have fun with my friends 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.950
 even playing on ps3 then you do not have 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.800
 this is obviously not comparable 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.990
 is sometimes no comparison is and the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.250
 subject does not hit a shot 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.740
 on his ankle to have a shot at the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.530

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.830
 Cot advice to you 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.980

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:28.030
 there were 4 in the courses of the current generation case 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.550
 You will not play on the pc or the sound of the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.350

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.060
