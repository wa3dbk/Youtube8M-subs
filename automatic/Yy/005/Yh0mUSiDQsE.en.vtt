the blue color so you can get it some
different<00:02:02.610> colors<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> belief<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.960> he's<00:02:04.049> got

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
different colors of belief so he's got

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.289 
different colors of belief so he's got
these<00:02:04.380> aluminium<00:02:04.649> sort<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.640> outer<00:02:05.909> shell

these aluminium sort of outer shell

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.059 
these aluminium sort of outer shell
there<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.899> gives<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.409> solid<00:02:07.829> fill

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
there so that gives it that solid fill

this<00:02:36.090> sort<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.330> springy<00:02:36.720> look<00:02:37.530> there<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.040> you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
this sort of springy look there so you

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.770 
this sort of springy look there so you
can<00:02:38.370> simply<00:02:38.670> close<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.030> back<00:02:39.180> up<00:02:39.420> by<00:02:39.569> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
can simply close that back up by just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.140 
can simply close that back up by just
that<00:02:40.020> opening<00:02:40.739> by<00:02:41.160> just<00:02:41.400> closing<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.910> down

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that opening by just closing it down

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.870 
that opening by just closing it down
push<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> all<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.660> way<00:02:42.810> down<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.950> twist<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.610> to

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
push it all the way down and twist it to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.090 
push it all the way down and twist it to
get<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.660> into<00:02:45.780> place<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:46.530> twist<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
get it into place so just twist it and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.890 
get it into place so just twist it and
that<00:02:47.550> will<00:02:47.670> close<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.450> makes<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.810> even

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that will close it so it makes it even

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.080 
that will close it so it makes it even
more<00:02:49.080> compact<00:02:49.680> than<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.459> before<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.000> you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
more compact than it is before so you

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.240 
more compact than it is before so you
can<00:02:51.120> still<00:02:51.420> use<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.019> mode<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.890> can

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
can still use it in this mode you can

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.060 
can still use it in this mode you can
leave<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.489> like<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.390> get<00:02:54.620> extra<00:02:55.620> or

leave you like that but to get extra or

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.070 
leave you like that but to get extra or
better<00:02:56.430> sound<00:02:56.700> quality<00:02:56.790> get<00:02:57.480> get<00:02:57.750> some<00:02:57.930> more

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
better sound quality get get some more

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.960 
better sound quality get get some more
bass<00:02:58.260> out<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.890> can<00:02:58.920> twist<00:02:59.280> untwist<00:02:59.819> it

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
bass out of it you can twist untwist it

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.210 
bass out of it you can twist untwist it
and<00:03:00.360> then<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.410> little<00:03:01.739> bit<00:03:01.800> more<00:03:02.010> sound

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
and then you get a little bit more sound

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.559 
and then you get a little bit more sound
quality<00:03:03.120> out<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.269> it

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
quality out of it

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
so what I'll do is connect this to my

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.250 
so what I'll do is connect this to my
iPhone<00:03:05.459> now<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.850> just<00:03:06.300> give<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.660> try<00:03:07.050> and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
iPhone now and just give this a try and

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.280 
all connected together now so we're
gonna<00:03:11.610> see<00:03:11.880> what<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.269> sounds<00:03:12.600> like<00:03:12.630> we've<00:03:13.080> be

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
gonna see what that sounds like we've be

sir<00:03:13.560> bass<00:03:14.160> pumping<00:03:14.580> too<00:03:14.760> near

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.650 

Wow<00:03:43.830> okay<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:44.670> that's<00:03:45.030> what<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.240> sounds<00:03:45.480> like

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
Wow okay so that's what it sounds like

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.810 
Wow okay so that's what it sounds like
that<00:03:45.900> sounds<00:03:45.930> clean<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:47.340> only<00:03:47.490> thing<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.700> know

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
that sounds clean the only thing I know

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.640 
that sounds clean the only thing I know
is<00:03:47.850> these<00:03:48.210> there's<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.750> lot<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:48.960> vibration<00:03:49.110> from

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
is these there's a lot of vibration from

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.220 
is these there's a lot of vibration from
the<00:03:49.709> device<00:03:50.520> to<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.940> table<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.990> that's

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
the device to the table and that's

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.990 
the device to the table and that's
because<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.650> table<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:52.980> not<00:03:53.190> entirely<00:03:53.550> solid

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
because the table is not entirely solid

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.060 
because the table is not entirely solid
so<00:03:54.750> you'd<00:03:54.930> have<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.080> place<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.500> on<00:03:55.650> a<00:03:55.680> solid

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
so you'd have to place this on a solid

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.890 
so you'd have to place this on a solid
surface<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.760> don't<00:03:57.000> get<00:03:57.090> any<00:03:57.150> vibrations

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
surface so you don't get any vibrations

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.990 
surface so you don't get any vibrations
coming<00:03:58.110> off<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.590> device<00:03:58.890> other<00:03:59.610> than<00:03:59.790> that

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
coming off the device other than that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.449 
coming off the device other than that
the<00:04:00.240> base<00:04:00.780> sounds<00:04:01.170> really<00:04:01.590> solid<00:04:01.950> sounds

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the base sounds really solid sounds

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.650 
the base sounds really solid sounds
really<00:04:02.790> nice<00:04:02.940> as<00:04:03.150> well

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
even the other frequencies like you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.100 
even the other frequencies like you
trebles<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.239> stuff<00:04:06.420> like<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.720> sounds

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
trebles and stuff like that sounds

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.880 
trebles and stuff like that sounds
really<00:04:07.500> nice

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
really nice
