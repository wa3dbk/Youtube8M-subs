from<00:00:09.480> our<00:00:09.660> point<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.990> view<00:00:10.049> is<00:00:10.380> really<00:00:11.070> about

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
from our point of view is really about

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.830 
from our point of view is really about
how<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.639> create<00:00:11.849> products<00:00:12.300> quickly<00:00:12.450> bring

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
how can we create products quickly bring

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.379 
how can we create products quickly bring
them<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> market<00:00:13.260> more<00:00:14.219> quickly<00:00:14.280> how<00:00:15.000> can<00:00:15.299> we

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
them to market more quickly how can we

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.940 
them to market more quickly how can we
take<00:00:15.599> cost<00:00:15.870> out<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.110> our<00:00:16.259> network<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.860> know

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:16.950 
take cost out of our network you know

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.920 
take cost out of our network you know
we're<00:00:17.099> in<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.340> world<00:00:17.640> where<00:00:17.849> data<00:00:18.119> volumes

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
we're in this world where data volumes

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.840 
we're in this world where data volumes
are<00:00:19.140> growing<00:00:19.500> exponentially<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.279> year<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.640> you

are growing exponentially a year on you

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.849 
are growing exponentially a year on you
and<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:21.810> need<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.170> able<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.410> design

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
and we really need to be able to design

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.009

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
use less network resource and in the end

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.569 
use less network resource and in the end

X and more particularly allow us to
create<00:01:01.710> services<00:01:02.340> more<00:01:02.460> quickly<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.629> we

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
create services more quickly because we

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.660 
create services more quickly because we
should<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:04.020> able<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.350> wrap<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> services<00:01:05.430> more

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
should be able to wrap the services more

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
should be able to wrap the services more
dynamically<00:01:06.149> and<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.960> bring<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
dynamically and really bring them to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.890 
dynamically and really bring them to
market<00:01:07.530> without<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.280> traditional

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
market without the traditional

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.210 
market without the traditional
integrating<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.020> every<00:01:10.350> network<00:01:10.619> element<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
integrating to every network element and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
integrating to every network element and
every<00:01:11.369> network<00:01:11.670> box<00:01:11.850> using<00:01:12.600> traffic<00:01:13.049> steering

every network box using traffic steering

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.980 
every network box using traffic steering

as part of the overall service to file

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
as part of the overall service to file
networks<00:01:16.470> should<00:01:17.159> allow<00:01:17.400> us<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
networks should allow us to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
networks should allow us to
individualize<00:01:18.270> products<00:01:18.720> more<00:01:18.869> quickly<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
individualize products more quickly and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
individualize products more quickly and
more<00:01:19.380> readily<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.340> again<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.450> about

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
more readily so again it's really about

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
more readily so again it's really about
how<00:01:22.110> do<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.710> minimal<00:01:23.100> resource<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
how do we use the minimal resource to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.789 
how do we use the minimal resource to
deliver<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.210> product<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> customer<00:01:25.170> without

overhead of integration every time we

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
overhead of integration every time we

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
create a new product we're going to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.580 
create a new product we're going to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
opportunities and really creating

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.520 
opportunities and really creating
solutions<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.119> beneficial<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.750> us<00:01:42.900> but

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
solutions that are beneficial to us but

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
solutions that are beneficial to us but
also<00:01:43.680> build<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> ecosystem<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:44.880> strongly

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
also build the ecosystem more strongly

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.030 
also build the ecosystem more strongly
so<00:01:45.479> we're<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> continue<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.560> explore

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so we're going to continue to explore

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.380 
so we're going to continue to explore
these<00:01:47.220> opportunities<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.000> hopefully

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
these opportunities and hopefully

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.819 
these opportunities and hopefully
they're<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> turn<00:01:49.140> into<00:01:49.290> real<00:01:49.530> products

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
they're going to turn into real products

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.830 
they're going to turn into real products
in<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.100> near<00:01:50.250> future<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:51.329> market<00:01:51.689> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
in the near future the market for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
in the near future the market for
service<00:01:52.200> provider<00:01:52.530> sdn<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.130> still<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.549> early

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
service provider sdn is still very early

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.120 
service provider sdn is still very early
and<00:01:54.630> for<00:01:54.869> us<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.170> extremely<00:01:55.649> important<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and for us it's extremely important to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.609 
and for us it's extremely important to
