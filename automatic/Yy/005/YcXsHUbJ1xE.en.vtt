they're really looking forward to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.630 
they're really looking forward to
applications<00:00:21.680> that<00:00:21.920> were<00:00:22.010> tailored<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.550> the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
applications that were tailored to the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.730 
applications that were tailored to the
netbook<00:00:23.030> and<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.810> developers<00:00:24.320> because<00:00:24.620> they

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
netbook and to developers because they

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.280 
netbook and to developers because they
were<00:00:24.800> looking<00:00:25.040> forward<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.660> reaching<00:00:26.660> their

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
were looking forward to reaching their

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.290 
were looking forward to reaching their
target<00:00:27.680> market<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.250> having<00:00:28.880> any<00:00:29.030> direct

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
target market and having any direct

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.520 
target market and having any direct
distribution<00:00:29.480> channel<00:00:30.110> which<00:00:30.200> they<00:00:30.320> never

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
distribution channel which they never

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.910 
distribution channel which they never
had<00:00:30.770> before<00:00:31.210> on<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.390> network<00:00:32.570> devices<00:00:33.050> so

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
had before on the network devices so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.119 
had before on the network devices so
that's<00:00:34.850> we<00:00:35.059> rolled<00:00:35.239> out<00:00:35.390> at<00:00:35.570> CES<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:36.949> far

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
that's we rolled out at CES and so far

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.329 
that's we rolled out at CES and so far
it's<00:00:37.249> going<00:00:37.399> really<00:00:37.550> well<00:00:37.839> so<00:00:39.129> where<00:00:40.129> did<00:00:40.249> the

inspiration come from I mean did you

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.399 
inspiration come from I mean did you
guys<00:00:42.409> just<00:00:42.530> suddenly<00:00:43.159> say<00:00:43.519> hmm<00:00:44.140> netbooks<00:00:45.140> are

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
guys just suddenly say hmm netbooks are

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.079 
guys just suddenly say hmm netbooks are
kind<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.829> their<00:00:46.010> own<00:00:46.129> special<00:00:46.429> machine<00:00:46.879> they

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
kind of their own special machine they

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.309 
kind of their own special machine they
need<00:00:47.239> their<00:00:47.420> own<00:00:47.449> you<00:00:47.960> know<00:00:48.079> special

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
need their own you know special

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.380 
need their own you know special
ecosystem<00:00:48.980> or<00:00:49.129> did<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:49.579> like<00:00:49.789> where<00:00:49.969> did<00:00:50.300> the

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
ecosystem or did it like where did the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.180 
ecosystem or did it like where did the
idea<00:00:50.420> come<00:00:50.629> from<00:00:50.780> well<00:00:52.179> so<00:00:53.179> of<00:00:53.899> course<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.739> App

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
idea come from well so of course the App

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.369 
idea come from well so of course the App
Store<00:00:55.249> phenomena<00:00:56.059> is<00:00:56.300> very<00:00:56.749> obvious<00:00:56.899> right

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
Store phenomena is very obvious right

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.340 
Store phenomena is very obvious right
and<00:00:57.679> a<00:00:58.100> number<00:00:58.909> of<00:00:59.059> developers<00:00:59.569> engaged<00:00:59.899> right

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
and a number of developers engaged right

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.349 
and a number of developers engaged right
naps<00:01:00.589> for<00:01:00.710> app<00:01:00.949> stores<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.579> value<00:01:02.089> prop<00:01:02.239> is

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
naps for app stores and value prop is

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.620 
naps for app stores and value prop is
their<00:01:02.510> opposition<00:01:03.079> there<00:01:03.469> is<00:01:03.620> quite<00:01:03.949> obvious

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
their opposition there is quite obvious

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.539 
their opposition there is quite obvious
and<00:01:05.630> we<00:01:05.720> looked<00:01:05.900> at<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.290> said<00:01:06.380> well<00:01:06.710> what

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
and we looked at this and said well what

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.609 
and we looked at this and said well what
makes<00:01:07.790> sense<00:01:07.969> for<00:01:08.119> our<00:01:08.540> developers<00:01:09.259> how<00:01:09.409> can

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
makes sense for our developers how can

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.770 
makes sense for our developers how can
we<00:01:09.710> help<00:01:09.890> our<00:01:10.130> developers<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.939> reach<00:01:11.149> netbook

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
we help our developers to reach netbook

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.289 
we help our developers to reach netbook
devices<00:01:12.290> or<00:01:12.799> to<00:01:13.130> reach<00:01:13.280> our<00:01:13.700> devices<00:01:14.000> in

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
devices or to reach our devices in

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.780 
devices or to reach our devices in
general<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.100> netbook<00:01:16.100> popped<00:01:16.369> up<00:01:16.520> as<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
general and netbook popped up as the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.819 
general and netbook popped up as the
most<00:01:16.939> obvious<00:01:17.180> mainly<00:01:17.810> because<00:01:17.960> there<00:01:18.710> aren't

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
most obvious mainly because there aren't

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.130 
most obvious mainly because there aren't
applications<00:01:19.460> there<00:01:19.729> today<00:01:20.030> really<00:01:20.840> well

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
applications there today really well

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.440 
applications there today really well
suited<00:01:21.439> for<00:01:21.469> it<00:01:21.729> lots<00:01:22.729> of<00:01:22.880> devices<00:01:23.270> out<00:01:23.390> there

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
suited for it lots of devices out there

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.840 
suited for it lots of devices out there
people<00:01:24.079> using<00:01:24.380> him<00:01:24.469> for<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:25.159> basics<00:01:25.579> of

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
people using him for the basics of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.330 
people using him for the basics of
internet<00:01:26.390> access<00:01:26.840> an<00:01:27.020> email<00:01:27.289> but<00:01:28.009> not<00:01:28.219> a<00:01:28.250> lot

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340

of<00:01:28.520> software<00:01:28.850> tailored<00:01:29.210> forum<00:01:29.539> so<00:01:29.840> that's<00:01:30.590> why

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
of software tailored forum so that's why

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.920 
of software tailored forum so that's why
it<00:01:30.859> just<00:01:31.159> popped<00:01:31.969> up<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:32.240> okay<00:01:32.479> why<00:01:32.659> don't<00:01:32.719> we

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
it just popped up is okay why don't we

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.260 
it just popped up is okay why don't we
start<00:01:33.409> with<00:01:33.710> Netflix<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.579> then<00:01:34.820> see<00:01:35.030> if<00:01:35.060> we

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
start with Netflix and then see if we

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.420 
start with Netflix and then see if we
can<00:01:35.479> expand<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.439> other<00:01:36.469> devices<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:37.340> the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
can expand to other devices in the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.230 
can expand to other devices in the
future<00:01:37.789> so<00:01:38.359> of<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.780> handsets<00:01:39.289> come<00:01:39.799> next

they'll<00:02:11.580> look<00:02:11.610> for<00:02:11.870> applications<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.050> are

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
they'll look for applications that are

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.350 
they'll look for applications that are
tailored<00:02:13.319> for<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.770> device<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.490> mobile

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
tailored for that device so mobile

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.930 
tailored for that device so mobile
internet<00:02:15.630> devices<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.380> perfect<00:02:16.860> as<00:02:16.980> well<00:02:17.130> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
internet devices we perfect as well a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.360 
internet devices we perfect as well a
lot<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.660> PC<00:02:19.110> applications<00:02:19.709> are<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.190> going

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
lot of the PC applications are not going

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.490 
lot of the PC applications are not going
to<00:02:20.490> naturally<00:02:21.090> work<00:02:21.480> well<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.170> form

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
to naturally work well in that form

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500 
to naturally work well in that form
factor<00:02:22.890> need<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.130> be<00:02:23.220> tailored<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.940> so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
factor need to be tailored for that so

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.690 
factor need to be tailored for that so
an<00:02:24.840> amp<00:02:25.080> up<00:02:25.290> center<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:26.010> has<00:02:26.160> application
