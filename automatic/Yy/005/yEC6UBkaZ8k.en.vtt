00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
hi there one of the training tools that

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.609 
hi there one of the training tools that
we<00:00:25.400> use<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.669> help<00:00:26.480> the<00:00:26.660> athletes<00:00:26.960> get<00:00:27.110> faster

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
we use to help the athletes get faster

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.300 
we use to help the athletes get faster
is<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.220> speedo<00:00:28.579> fire<00:00:28.849> fuse<00:00:29.270> power<00:00:29.960> panel<00:00:30.349> we

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
is the speedo fire fuse power panel we

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.220 
is the speedo fire fuse power panel we
use<00:00:31.460> this<00:00:31.579> in<00:00:31.790> training<00:00:32.149> for<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.419> variety<00:00:33.200> of

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
use this in training for a variety of

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.830 
use this in training for a variety of
different<00:00:34.130> stimulus<00:00:34.790> as<00:00:35.270> you<00:00:35.420> can<00:00:35.540> see<00:00:35.690> by

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
different stimulus as you can see by

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.970 
different stimulus as you can see by
these<00:00:35.899> ones<00:00:36.290> these<00:00:36.440> are<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.590> big<00:00:36.829> ones

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
these ones these are the big ones

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.709 
these ones these are the big ones
there's<00:00:37.280> different<00:00:37.610> sizes<00:00:38.059> Lia<00:00:38.270> master

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
there's different sizes Lia master

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.680 
there's different sizes Lia master
medium-wave<00:00:39.649> Lim<00:00:39.890> Liam<00:00:40.820> as<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.090> medium<00:00:41.450> size

medium-wave Lim Liam as the medium size
on<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.079> that's<00:00:42.200> probably<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.530> size<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.920> suits

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
on and that's probably a size that suits

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
little pygmy hands that you use these

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.099

comfortably<00:01:42.740> by<00:01:43.399> using<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.909> pool<00:01:44.119> boy<00:01:44.299> it's

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
comfortably by using a pool boy it's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.569 
comfortably by using a pool boy it's
actually<00:01:45.439> very<00:01:45.590> rare<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.979> see<00:01:46.039> him<00:01:46.340> without<00:01:46.460> a

however<00:01:51.170> going<00:01:51.560> back<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:51.950> paddles<00:01:52.310> and

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
however going back to the paddles and

however going back to the paddles and
the<00:01:54.140> easiest<00:01:54.560> way<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.799> use<00:01:54.979> them<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.640> for

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
the easiest way to use them is for

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.660 
the easiest way to use them is for
distance<00:01:56.390> per<00:01:56.539> stroke<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.170> we<00:01:58.009> tend<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.399> do<00:01:58.579> it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
distance per stroke so we tend to do it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.700 
distance per stroke so we tend to do it
with<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> poor<00:01:59.210> boy<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.659> the<00:02:00.110> paddles<00:02:00.469> which

with a poor boy and the paddles which
Lin<00:02:00.979> will<00:02:01.130> demonstrate<00:02:01.670> in<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:01.939> second<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:03.500> can

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
Lin will demonstrate in a second you can

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.669 
Lin will demonstrate in a second you can
also<00:02:03.799> use<00:02:04.220> them<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.329> swimming<00:02:05.570> stroke<00:02:05.930> you

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
also use them in the swimming stroke you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.830 
also use them in the swimming stroke you
can<00:02:06.710> also<00:02:07.009> use<00:02:07.429> them<00:02:07.729> with<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.030> fins<00:02:08.300> we<00:02:08.599> tend

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
can also use them with the fins we tend

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.410 
can also use them with the fins we tend
to<00:02:08.959> use<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.319> power<00:02:09.530> paddles<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.220> lot<00:02:10.459> for<00:02:10.729> as

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
to use the power paddles a lot for as

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.900 
to use the power paddles a lot for as
the<00:02:11.569> name<00:02:11.750> suggests<00:02:11.989> power<00:02:12.560> training<00:02:13.010> whereby

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
the name suggests power training whereby

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.210 
the name suggests power training whereby
we<00:02:14.090> use<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> fins<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.440> paddles<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.099> we

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
we use the fins and the paddles and we

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.360 
we use the fins and the paddles and we
swim<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.580> above<00:02:16.880> race<00:02:17.599> pace<00:02:17.930> we<00:02:18.890> sometimes<00:02:19.099> use

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
swim it above race pace we sometimes use

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.460 
swim it above race pace we sometimes use
little<00:02:19.730> yellow<00:02:19.910> beepers<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.930> keep<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.230> stroke

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
little yellow beepers to keep the stroke

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.440 
little yellow beepers to keep the stroke
rate<00:02:21.500> at<00:02:21.890> race<00:02:22.099> rate<00:02:22.400> but<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.000> can<00:02:23.180> swim<00:02:23.360> an

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
rate at race rate but you can swim an

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.240 
rate at race rate but you can swim an
awful<00:02:23.750> lot<00:02:23.870> faster<00:02:24.319> with<00:02:24.470> fins<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:24.860> paddles

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
awful lot faster with fins and paddles

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.740 
awful lot faster with fins and paddles
just<00:02:25.430> imagine<00:02:25.819> see<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.269> scuba<00:02:26.720> diver

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
just imagine see it like a scuba diver

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.979 
just imagine see it like a scuba diver
people<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.220> movies<00:02:28.610> then<00:02:29.180> we<00:02:29.360> can<00:02:29.569> just

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
people in the movies then we can just

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.770 
people in the movies then we can just
with<00:02:30.709> our<00:02:30.830> hands<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.310> our<00:02:31.459> feet<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.569> gives

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
with our hands and our feet so it gives

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.990 
with our hands and our feet so it gives
the<00:02:32.989> body<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.650> extra<00:02:33.920> stimulus<00:02:34.340> its<00:02:34.730> swimming

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
the body and extra stimulus its swimming

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.930 
the body and extra stimulus its swimming
super<00:02:35.450> fast<00:02:36.099> we<00:02:37.099> can<00:02:37.250> also<00:02:37.400> use<00:02:37.730> them<00:02:37.880> for

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
super fast we can also use them for

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.880 
super fast we can also use them for
technique<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.660> terms<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.260> working<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.739> high

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
technique in terms of working a high

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.220 
technique in terms of working a high
elbow<00:02:40.069> catch<00:02:40.489> with<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.790> paddle<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.930> maybe

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
elbow catch with a paddle and maybe

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.130 
elbow catch with a paddle and maybe
alternating<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.549> a<00:02:43.819> thin<00:02:44.299> one<00:02:44.840> fin

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
alternating so you have a thin one fin

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.170 
alternating so you have a thin one fin
and<00:02:45.349> one<00:02:45.620> paddle<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.370> your<00:02:46.430> training<00:02:46.849> that

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and one paddle in your training that

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.720 
and one paddle in your training that
might<00:02:47.630> be<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> fin<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.230> your<00:02:48.530> left<00:02:48.860> foot<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.670> a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
might be a fin on your left foot and a

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.670 
might be a fin on your left foot and a
paddle<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.209> your<00:02:50.239> right<00:02:50.599> hand<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.290> you're

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
paddle in your right hand and you're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.460 
paddle in your right hand and you're
actually<00:02:51.829> working<00:02:52.280> your<00:02:52.870> diagonal<00:02:53.870> strength

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
actually working your diagonal strength

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.870 
actually working your diagonal strength
if<00:02:54.739> you<00:02:54.860> like<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.280> trying<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.579> keep<00:02:55.730> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
if you like and trying to keep the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.090 
if you like and trying to keep the
stroke<00:02:56.150> nice<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.720> balanced<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.440> can<00:02:57.950> also

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
stroke nice and balanced you can also

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.620 
stroke nice and balanced you can also
use<00:02:58.579> these<00:02:58.760> paddles<00:02:59.350> as

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
use these paddles as

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.170 
use these paddles as
I<00:03:01.690> guess<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.380> forearm<00:03:02.770> type<00:03:03.310> drill<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:04.030> is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I guess a forearm type drill this is

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.300 
I guess a forearm type drill this is
something<00:03:04.600> we've<00:03:04.780> been<00:03:04.810> using<00:03:05.440> recently<00:03:05.710> in

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
something we've been using recently in

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.040 
something we've been using recently in
terms<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.790> actually<00:03:07.090> holding<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.630> paddle<00:03:07.810> so

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
terms of actually holding the paddle so

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.170 
terms of actually holding the paddle so
don't<00:03:08.320> put<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.740> fingers<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.850> wrists

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
don't put that fingers and the wrists

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.210 
don't put that fingers and the wrists
into<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.510> straps<00:03:10.840> just<00:03:11.410> holding<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> paddle

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
into the straps just holding the paddle

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.690 
into the straps just holding the paddle
over<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:13.090> end<00:03:13.650> putting<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:15.100> force<00:03:15.430> if

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
over the end putting the the force if

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.970 
over the end putting the the force if
you<00:03:15.820> like<00:03:16.030> through<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> forearm<00:03:17.110> up<00:03:17.530> onto<00:03:17.860> the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
you like through the forearm up onto the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.440 
you like through the forearm up onto the
power<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.490> kind<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.880> increase<00:03:19.210> in<00:03:19.360> the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
power so you kind of increase in the

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.780 
power so you kind of increase in the
area<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> forearm<00:03:20.440> rather<00:03:21.160> than<00:03:21.490> just<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
area of the forearm rather than just the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.640 
area of the forearm rather than just the
hand<00:03:22.000> when<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.690> do<00:03:22.840> swim<00:03:23.140> particularly<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
hand when you do swim particularly the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.680 
hand when you do swim particularly the
freestyle<00:03:24.130> type<00:03:24.370> stroke<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:25.000> lot<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.450> people

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
freestyle type stroke a lot of people

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.060 
freestyle type stroke a lot of people
just<00:03:25.840> think<00:03:25.960> I'm<00:03:26.080> pulling<00:03:26.470> with<00:03:26.680> my<00:03:26.710> hand

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
water and a lot of the time that's the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.560 
water and a lot of the time that's the
for<00:03:32.680> our<00:03:32.710> man<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.430> hat<00:03:33.580> now<00:03:34.120> if<00:03:34.240> we<00:03:34.390> were<00:03:34.510> to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
for our man that hat now if we were to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.120 
for our man that hat now if we were to
hold<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.960> paddle<00:03:35.170> like<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.830> try<00:03:36.010> and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
hold the paddle like this and try and

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.880 
hold the paddle like this and try and
swim<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:37.660> almost<00:03:37.870> like<00:03:38.050> doing<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.350> fist<00:03:38.590> drill

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
swim it's almost like doing a fist drill

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.500 
swim it's almost like doing a fist drill
whereby<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.370> lose<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.910> feel<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.270> water

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
whereby you lose the feel of the water

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.250 
whereby you lose the feel of the water
in<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.840> hand

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
in the hand

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.550 
in the hand
you<00:03:41.680> gain<00:03:41.950> an<00:03:42.370> awful<00:03:42.730> lot<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:42.850> power<00:03:43.810> through

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
you gain an awful lot of power through

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.440 
you gain an awful lot of power through
using<00:03:44.770> the<00:03:45.010> forearm<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.940> that's<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.270> more

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
using the forearm so that's a more

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.090 
using the forearm so that's a more
advanced<00:03:47.050> way<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.260> do<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.710> can<00:03:47.860> do<00:03:47.950> that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
advanced way to do it you can do that

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.010 
advanced way to do it you can do that
again<00:03:48.370> with<00:03:48.580> either<00:03:49.120> just<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.600> pull<00:03:49.810> boy

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
again with either just a pull boy

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.140 
again with either just a pull boy
between<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.500> legs<00:03:50.710> or<00:03:51.040> just<00:03:51.280> swimming<00:03:51.610> or

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
between the legs or just swimming or

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.720 
between the legs or just swimming or
again<00:03:52.480> with<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.780> fins<00:03:53.460> paddlers<00:03:54.460> of<00:03:54.580> this

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
again with the fins paddlers of this

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.790 
again with the fins paddlers of this
size<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.450> power<00:03:55.720> pilot<00:03:56.140> can<00:03:56.260> also<00:03:56.380> be<00:03:56.650> used

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
size so the power pilot can also be used

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.740 
size so the power pilot can also be used
in<00:03:56.950> kick<00:03:57.190> sets<00:03:57.460> you<00:03:57.910> could<00:03:58.090> use<00:03:58.300> it<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.600> all

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
in kick sets you could use it to all

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.090 
in kick sets you could use it to all
might<00:03:58.930> look<00:03:59.020> at<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.230> size<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.650> one<00:03:59.860> I<00:03:59.890> can

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
might look at the size of this one I can

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.280 
might look at the size of this one I can
pretty<00:04:00.580> much<00:04:00.670> sit<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.150> this<00:04:01.270> and<00:04:01.510> serve<00:04:01.750> but

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
pretty much sit on this and serve but

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.040 
pretty much sit on this and serve but
you<00:04:02.440> could<00:04:02.680> actually<00:04:02.830> lie<00:04:03.370> up<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.820> this<00:04:04.050> paddle

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
you could actually lie up on this paddle

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.070 
you could actually lie up on this paddle
like<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.850> sidekick<00:04:06.850> along<00:04:07.180> using<00:04:07.960> this

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
like so and sidekick along using this

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.080 
like so and sidekick along using this
paddle<00:04:08.470> for<00:04:08.650> balance<00:04:09.070> so<00:04:09.730> there's<00:04:09.970> many

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
paddle for balance so there's many

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.690 
paddle for balance so there's many
different<00:04:10.210> ways<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.690> use<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:12.040> speed<00:04:12.340> over<00:04:12.460> by

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
different ways to use the speed over by

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.760 
different ways to use the speed over by
a<00:04:12.730> fuse<00:04:13.030> paddle<00:04:13.390> more<00:04:14.050> than<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.500> than<00:04:14.620> what

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
a fuse paddle more than just than what

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.470 
a fuse paddle more than just than what
it<00:04:14.860> says<00:04:15.070> on<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.250> tin<00:04:15.520> probably<00:04:15.970> now<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.180> guys

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
it says on the tin probably now you guys

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.120 
it says on the tin probably now you guys
would<00:04:16.690> be<00:04:16.810> just<00:04:17.049> as<00:04:17.170> creative<00:04:17.380> as<00:04:17.739> me<00:04:17.890> you<00:04:17.950> can

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
would be just as creative as me you can

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.650 
would be just as creative as me you can
probably<00:04:18.310> go<00:04:18.489> up<00:04:18.609> with<00:04:18.760> another<00:04:19.359> ten

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
probably go up with another ten

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.210 
probably go up with another ten
different<00:04:19.989> things<00:04:20.200> but<00:04:20.380> hopefully<00:04:20.770> that'll

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
different things but hopefully that'll

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.620 
different things but hopefully that'll
