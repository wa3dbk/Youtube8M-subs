00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.139
 Hello 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.809
 I already have a little trate 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.020
 told in one of the videos about very 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 such a brutal and serious knife 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.590
 tactical survival 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 today we will talk about more 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.460
 compact model from the company trate 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 it will also be fixed general fixed this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.170
 done very well by in my opinion 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.350
 even more qualitatively compared to 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.690
 here is such a bigger model let's show 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.579
 it is here let it lie down in principle 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 and the video is useful then he made 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.309
 he has a high enough handle 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 executed in such an interesting drawings yes 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.660
 he used in 10 the same steel 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.399
 8 13 emory is generally the same tactical 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 let's say the cover but she is beautiful and on 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.640
 really blackened a little here 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.589
 as if she was already shabby and in fact 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 really makes me quite pleasant 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.640
 impression of 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.890
 here the carts are carts 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 principle, that is, some 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.560
 significant such deviations here 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 I can not see the descent very slightly concave 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.210
 a little here that adds a little rez 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.500
 given our more than that in itself 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.909
 geometry like similar gives to my 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 look more practical 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.930
 everyday life, that is, they can 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 cut and food and some 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.400
 rope and wood suffer that is 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.060
 This knife is quite practical with him 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.820
 futong construction is very serious 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.549
 it turns out the strength of the handle itself 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 blade here there is a small notch in 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.680
 Basically notching stares, I would 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.210
 said that in hand so here seriously yes but 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.829
 maybe just a little bit of such a prize 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.299
 strength work with your thumb 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.100
 the other side if you take a little knife 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.020
 Accurate grip start really 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.010
 force work to apply the notch 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.890
 it does not interfere with that of course 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.240
 and a big plus a huge hole under 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 lanyard any lanyard here you can 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.140
 hang in principle as the top 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.180
 the handle here is made of metal 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.240
 that is, the futon construction continues and 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.520
 finish these 10 pads then given 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.730
 part of the heel of the blade 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.580
 can heels the blade top handle can 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.710
 seriously knock no problems here 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360
 you won't be drowned with a knife too 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.340
 any problems the only thing is that its 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.030
 the length is generally small and probably will 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:34.060
 for under 1 ha uncomfortable otherwise the knife 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.960
 so very serious in appearance 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.440
 and by 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.260
 feeling in hand about it should 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.990
 must be made of kaydeksa 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.270
 performed quite qualitatively because 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.370
 that they absolutely do not rattle here 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.190
 nowhere lyuftyat here everything is very 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 well like on more than that they are very 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.560
 thin 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.200
 if we unscrew this extra 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.110
 fastening on the belt that you can do without 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.270
 labor even ordinary as you see curly 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.010
 a screwdriver then the knife will turn out like this 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.640
 comfortable to wear here it can 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.700
 fasten on a special rope 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.430
 such as parachute cord, and then put the belt 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.510
 trousers, that is, you get this 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.450
 city fixer which is very easy 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.450
 will be quickly retrieved very conveniently 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.760
 worn due to intelligently thought out them 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.620
 Thin here skydex is so needed and in 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.410
 Overall, in principle, I would not say that 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.110
 very much so thick on the other 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.730
 he has everything in hand 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.430
 strength is the same 10 durable material 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.780
 by again full tank very solidly 4 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.570
 millimeter butt here 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.180
 information here is quite reasonable 0 5 . 6 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:44.350
 millimeters by and large it is quite 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.870
 currently working such fixed for some not 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.090
 the biggest challenges 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.440
 regarding its overall dimensions then this 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.630
 122 millimeters total length 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.850
 about 90 millimeters long blade is not 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.310
 time 85 millimeters cutting length 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.780
 the edges even if this knife had more 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.840
 serious emphasis and he would not be cold 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.480
 which is also a very big plus 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.770
 and if someone does not understand 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.390
 legislation stopped you 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.840
 any employee yes you always 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.290
 can easily justify that not even 90 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.980
 millimeters here length 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.680
 The weight of this knife is 170 grams. 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.230
 again reasonable for such 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.540
 everyday wear and this knife 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.180
 I quite liked the principle 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.490
 I do not know what left is not very pleasant 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.500
 impression is really an acquaintance with 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.440
 older models which need 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.070
 thundering and descents are not done right 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.710
 neatly 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.890
 that is, it is very much like a sight 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.140
 models yes and the quality is several 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.810
 different or quality walks a little 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.600
 before either basically this is the lesser 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.390
 the model is made somewhat more shortly 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.680
 these are two apples i can't tell you but with 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.840
 other side for some of their 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.800
 again a brutal task and a big 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.169
 the model is quite a cope that is 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.020
 some minimal differences on the cart 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.700
 yes it is not so critical actually for 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.630
 those tasks that this knife is put 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.090
 thanks to the company cut the rose 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.550
 giving this knife a review 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.419
 thanks to my subscribers for watching 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.419
 until
