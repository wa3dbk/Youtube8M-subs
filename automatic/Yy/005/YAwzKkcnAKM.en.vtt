area<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> check<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.030> air

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
area that we need to check the air

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.260 
area that we need to check the air
compressor<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.590> water<00:00:46.860> pump<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> the

compressor in water pump and the
alternator<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.469> there's<00:00:49.680> three<00:00:49.829> fluid

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
alternator and then there's three fluid

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.160 
alternator and then there's three fluid
levels<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.850> need<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.090> check<00:00:51.329> we<00:00:51.930> need<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
levels that we need to check we need to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
levels that we need to check we need to
