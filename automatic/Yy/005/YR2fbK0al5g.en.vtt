00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:28.650
 program closes waiting 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.449

 I will show on this example how I decided 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:54.350
 go to the computer information settings 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.680

 let's on except 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:21.390
 I think they need was born on the example of something 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.890
