00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
and the antenna vector I don't know

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.959 
and the antenna vector I don't know
what's<00:02:20.810> up<00:02:20.930> with<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.110> antenna<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.760> just

doesn't<00:02:25.909> want<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.209> roll<00:02:26.359> itself<00:02:27.700> well<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.790> goes

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
doesn't want to roll itself well it goes

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.400 
doesn't want to roll itself well it goes
up<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.510> kinda<00:02:29.750> have<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.870> help<00:02:30.049> it<00:02:30.260> going<00:02:30.530> down

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.350 

and<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.190> can<00:02:35.340> hear<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.700> exhaust<00:02:36.000> very

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
and if you can hear the exhaust very

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.940 
and if you can hear the exhaust very
well

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:57.070 

I<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.090> think<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.360> sounds<00:02:40.510> pretty<00:02:40.810> good

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.920 

check<00:02:57.710> engine<00:02:57.860> light<00:02:58.130> as<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.310> can<00:02:58.490> see<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:59.480> not

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
check engine light as you can see is not

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.800 
check engine light as you can see is not
on<00:03:00.200> at<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.530> moment<00:03:01.060> but<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.150> always<00:03:02.300> does<00:03:02.570> come

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
on at the moment but it always does come

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.410 
on at the moment but it always does come
on<00:03:02.990> once<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.290> car<00:03:03.470> gets<00:03:03.650> warm

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.010 

yeah<00:03:09.050> it<00:03:09.200> has<00:03:09.349> a<00:03:11.050> has<00:03:12.050> 19<00:03:12.500> T<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:14.090> T<00:03:14.120> do<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.750> so

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
yeah it has a has 19 T the T do for so

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.949 
yeah it has a has 19 T the T do for so
it's<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.230> stock<00:03:15.470> housing<00:03:16.040> just<00:03:16.670> bored<00:03:16.910> out<00:03:17.920> I

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
it's the stock housing just bored out I

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.420 
it's the stock housing just bored out I
think<00:03:20.959> that's<00:03:21.110> what<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.410> means<00:03:21.620> either<00:03:21.890> that

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
think that's what that means either that

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.890 
think that's what that means either that
were<00:03:22.550> has<00:03:22.700> different<00:03:23.060> type<00:03:23.180> of<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.600> fan

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
I'm really not sure what else this has

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.100 
I'm really not sure what else this has
