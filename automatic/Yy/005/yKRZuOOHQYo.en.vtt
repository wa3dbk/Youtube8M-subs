00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.619
 what do you think if we start with this 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.170
 Gelatine is very simple and there you 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.850
 I explain gelatin is an ideal dessert 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.170
 because at any time of year it is 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.210
 delicious and more because we're going to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.249
 integrate yogurt other issues is that 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.929
 we can add some fruit so that 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.389
 be more nutritious and also the one 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:48.579
 flavor and a spectacular color I have for 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.929
 here gelatin envelopes remember if 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.729
 you have diabetes you can buy those that 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.799
 they come with sugar substitute and I 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.659
 I bought cherry and peach can be 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.859
 a jelly with mango but really the 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.170
 mango jelly is difficult to 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.969
 find if you find it ahead and you 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.859
 I'm going to teach you a trick to cut your 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.550
 mangoes we need to cut this mango in 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:08.970
 little squares so look, I'm going to cut 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.220
 to the bone and now I 'm going to help with 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.790
 this glass here I have a glass and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.110
 I'm just going to bury it 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.600
 deep on the edge of the glass and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.310
 I'm going to push 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.159
 and now if it's going to be that it's not going to be 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.690
 nothing to chew from the shell to me that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.560
 I love to eat them look at them 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:32.909
 clean 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.890
 and it's the simple way to peel a mango 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.049
 the next step is going to be cut 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.579
 our handle in pictures to be able 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 place if you prefer it can be in 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.780
 slices this is just for question 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.190
 aesthetics so there go 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.190
 and we cut into squares 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.289
 now the next step is going to be water 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.229
 boiling we need the boiling water 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.090
 2 cups of boiling water this depends 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.439
 on how much of that size is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.450
 your mold I do not have a mold for 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.640
 gelatin I'm going to use one that is for 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.200
 cake for pancake be careful of 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.789
 preference that is metal really 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.069
 for gelatins the glass is a 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.660
 nightmare unmold the and good as 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.790
 be annoying pretty big I'm going to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.220
 use two gelatin envelopes but 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.400
 see what instructions are in the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.680
 your jelly box and another question is 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.299
 that not all fruits can be made 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.130
 with the gelatine be careful because there 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.980
 certain fruits that what will happen 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.630
 as with the pineapple the kiwi that is not going away 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.160
 to curdle so if you want to know what 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.230
 fruits and can be used to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.120
 gelatine and what are the ones prohibited by 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.250
 please visit my blog here below is the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.110
 league you can go directly and there you 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.910
 I say that fruits can be used well 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.000
 that in the boiling water I'm placing 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.860
 the powder that we are now going to dilute this 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.860
 very fine powder in boiling water 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.980
 I'm going to teach you a trick so that you 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.510
 gelatine is faster here I have 2 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.490
 ice cups then instead of 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.520
 put cold water , let's put 2 cups 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.280
 ice and dilute gelatin and is the 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.500
 I'm going to place here and now we have 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.960
 to select from which the ice 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.290
 completely disintegrate if you do not 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.569
 stream streams with that gelatin 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.579
 so that your molds are easier to 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.019
 unmold you can use a little oil 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.019
 vegetable or this spray 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.140
 and look what I 'm going to do 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.140
 it is easy or that there are no excesses 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.210
 and gelatin and it's here and 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.040
 immediately it began to curdle so 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.230
 of the ice the melted ice is already 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.230
 and now I'm going to place it in my mold 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.120
 how this jelly got very fast and 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.219
 yours is very watery you can put it 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.900
 the refrigerator about 20 minutes and 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.030
 then when I'm at this point 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.859
 begins to curdle let's add our 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.959
 fruit so I'm going to add the pieces 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.340
 of mango and this is to taste you can 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.290
 add the fruits you want 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.260
 use the gelatin flavors that 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.250
 I want him or gelatins peach am 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.560
 adding mango fruits and cherries 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.110
 here is already integrated my fruit and now 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.300
 let's go to the refrigerator for an hour 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.160
 we make our gelatin with yoghurt 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.950
 and for this to cool well 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.440
 My gelatin has about an hour 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.000
 already in the refrigerator looks and goes and now 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.560
 let's do the second part that goes to 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.250
 bring yoghurt so I'm just going to 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.200
 use two cups of boiling water and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.120
 I'm going to dilute my gelatine envelope 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.760
 these are two gelatin envelopes is a 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.180
 big guy then he wants equivalent to 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.860
 two and let's mix this is jello 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.620
 of cherry and I'm making peach 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.160
 Cherry with mango and I will be so few 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.960
 beers so let's dilute it well 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.150
 once you dilute it let it be 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.070
 cool then if you put the yoghurt like that 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.690
 hot is going to cut you so let's go 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.970
 to let a temperature come 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.160
 environment about five minutes that stays 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.380
 so resting and if you can move it better 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.240
 the heat comes out sooner 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.430
 instead of placing what it says about 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.010
 another two parts of water we will place 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.290
 those of natural yogurt, make sure it is the 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.730
 natural yogurt that does not come sweetened if 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.150
 this can not be too much 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.500
 sweet so the one who is yoghurt plane what 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.870
 I'm here adding 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.060
 and you do not know it's delicious and well 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.060
 nutritious now we are going to mix 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.259
 I will place on the other yoghurt and 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.419
 now let's go back to the 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.919
 refrigerator to let this be 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.919
 ready for about three hours 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.310
 so let me jello all night and a 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.170
 software until we change stations 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.580
 the recipes of laura but what do you think 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.410
 If we unmold it, it's a trick 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.480
 simple remember that we put the 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.910
 then total oil and demold the most 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.500
 easy look what I'm going to do is load 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.050
 my gelatin all the weight of gelatin 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.210
 to one side and look alone they separate 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.000
 if battles for a knife comes out yes 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.030
 pegadito and now if both so so in the 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.390
 moment of truth let's unmold now 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.960
 I have this here my plate and as no more 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.960
 we turn 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.060
 we place 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:16.419
 And now there is our rich 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.000
 gelatin look what cherries delight and 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.210
 mango with peach jelly and then 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.490
 They know that smells the most delicious part see 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.259
 how pretty was ready to serve is 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.690
 excellent for a piñata for a shower 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:30.819
 for the event you have is fine 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.770
 now well-nourished and especially 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.889
 Gelatin is a pretty dessert 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.199
 healthy from a slice to 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.669
