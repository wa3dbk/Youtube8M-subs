00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.300
 welcome to this new episode of the 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.700
 plugin series 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.660
 i am joshua the plug in today is no 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.460
 cit plus chosen from fantasy 2001 tv a 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.400
 plugin that allows us to know who 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.400
 within our server used 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.070
 the plugin is easily downloadable 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.410
 from bucket and I am at the moment 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.079
 using the 179 version that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.360
 works without problems in 17 10 the plug 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.940
 in also a compact subroutine not 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.600
 sheet glass is used to help the plugin 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.900
 main in understanding and not going into 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.430
 conflict with major plugins 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.050
 existing or downloaded time for 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.940
 proceed with the installation 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.530
 all you have to do is move it e 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.720
 copy it to the plug in folder 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.720
 then start the server once 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.000
 finished close it so that they are created from 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.610
 main confin the plug in two rows of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 configuration or the config and anointed 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.830
 xt the txt will appear only after being 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.560
 enter the server at least once 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.350
 since it is nothing more than a lock instead 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.820
 let's see the configurations in 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.040
 which started we can choose if 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.659
 enable notifications if enable the 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.970
 then log the file we saw 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.860
 first then how to call the professor 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.350
 the plugin how to call the file itself 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.600
 for itself and to fix them if the data 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.409
 collected by the plugin should be deleted later 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.240
 time if resistance is right in go 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.950
 hidden to those without permits looking for 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.670
 who to name the commands then we have 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.700
 the immense part of the controls in which yes 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.740
 decide how they will be executed Czech 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.140
 precisely on the players all this part 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.780
 easily customizable from 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.219
 help page on the hackett site then 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.189
 we have strings where it is possible 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.590
 avoid what will appear to you 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.590
 player some compatibility and blocks 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.329
 ignored configuration and this does not 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.050
 I have to see how the plugin behaves 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:13.540
 in game the controls in play yes 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.150
 they reach thanks to the command precisely 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.670
 ncp slash where ncp info chile 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.370
 information on violations therefore on 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.780
 failed checks of the specific player on 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.940
 no you make yourself off 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.730
 It serves precisely to enable or not 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.459
 to remove the notifications player player 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.740
 is used to remove the data saved from 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.659
 cech failed on some players 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.000
 then there is the reload command that reloads 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.630
 the plugin the lag that follow the tests 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.700
 on 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.050
 server version that gives us information 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.910
 on the exceptions version showing the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.850
 exceptions to which the player belongs 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.340
 except that allows us to make the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.290
 given player is not checked 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.420
 for certain checks 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.570
 we can also remove this from him 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.690
 privilege with an except and then we have 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:09.670
 of the reachability commands slash ncp 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.590
 com mans who are nothing but ray ban 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.920
 at the same time, for the kits 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.760
 we can follow times or remove a 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.980
 player 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.470
 the ray analyst has time with whom 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.630
 chris we can see which players 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.490
 will be clicked with the time you can 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.320
 send a message to a player 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.550
 specific and with the dl and we can 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.230
 execute a command with delay now 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.960
 I want to give you some proof 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.520
 practice of the plug-in utility 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.650
 I at this time enabled the flai 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:45.340
 it's not like you can see us allows 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.580
 move and if I continue to use it 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.850
 repeatedly I true that kato and will come 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.040
 notification sent to the pin 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.810
 the same applies for example to the 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.840
 water walking as you can see it doesn't 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.840
 do 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.310
 this pair of tests concludes 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.320
 this little tutorial I invite you to 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.880
 leave a vote and a comment 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.040
 maybe inherent in the plugin you would like 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.209
 see you next time and we will 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.209
 release next week
