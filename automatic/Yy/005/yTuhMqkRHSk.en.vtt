the biggest misconceptions about modern

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.080 
the biggest misconceptions about modern
dance<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.800> it's<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.100> accessible<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.850> feel

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
dance is that it's not accessible I feel

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.210 
dance is that it's not accessible I feel
like<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.679> of<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> forms<00:01:26.100> of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
like it's kind of one of the forms of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
like it's kind of one of the forms of
dance<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.610> people<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.149> too<00:01:27.360> art<00:01:27.570> form

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
dance that people think is too art form

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.380 
dance that people think is too art form
or<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.289> an<00:01:28.830> unattainable<00:01:29.429> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> general

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

or to an unattainable to the general
audience<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.679> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> things<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
audience and so one of the things I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130 
audience and so one of the things I
really<00:01:32.700> appreciate<00:01:32.789> about<00:01:33.179> Diavolo<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
really appreciate about Diavolo is that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840 
really appreciate about Diavolo is that
they've<00:01:34.320> made<00:01:34.500> an<00:01:34.619> effort<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.550> kind<00:01:35.729> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
they've made an effort to kind of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.210 
they've made an effort to kind of
extended<00:01:36.360> into<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.080> spectacular<00:01:37.770> kind

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
extended into more of a spectacular kind

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
extended into more of a spectacular kind
of<00:01:38.429> arena<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.149> so<00:01:39.300> we<00:01:39.390> use<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:39.690> set<00:01:39.899> pieces

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
of arena and so we use these set pieces

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.830 
of arena and so we use these set pieces
and<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:41.429> movements<00:01:41.880> very<00:01:42.060> acrobatic<00:01:42.720> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and the movements very acrobatic and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.570 
and the movements very acrobatic and
really<00:01:43.020> athletic<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:44.009> think<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> kind<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
really athletic and I think it kind of

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.219 
really athletic and I think it kind of
bridges<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.090> gap<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.690> lot<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> people

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
bridges that gap for a lot of people

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.350 
bridges that gap for a lot of people
between<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.670> dancing<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.090> may<00:01:48.210> not

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
between the kind of dancing they may not

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.880 
between the kind of dancing they may not
ever<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.659> interested<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.619> kind<00:01:49.829> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
ever be interested in and I kind of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.039 
ever be interested in and I kind of
dancing<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.490> gets<00:01:50.820> people<00:01:51.090> interested<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
dancing that gets people interested that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.230 
dancing that gets people interested that
it<00:01:52.170> wouldn't<00:01:52.649> ever<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.220> go<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.909> see<00:01:54.060> dance

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it wouldn't ever do go and see dance

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.580 
it wouldn't ever do go and see dance
other<00:01:54.479> way<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.049> don't<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
other way because I don't like to do a

that's<00:03:58.430> like<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.269> said<00:03:59.480> it's<00:03:59.660> just<00:03:59.980> something

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
that's like you said it's just something

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:16.090 
that's like you said it's just something
we<00:04:01.040> have<00:04:01.069> to<00:04:01.280> jump<00:04:01.489> into<00:04:01.639> right<00:04:02.030> away

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.500 

I<00:04:17.049> love<00:04:18.049> structure<00:04:18.680> I<00:04:18.859> love<00:04:19.299> see<00:04:20.299> how

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
I love structure I love see how

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.050 
I love structure I love see how
structure<00:04:21.049> manipulates<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:22.340> human<00:04:22.610> body<00:04:22.850> and

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
structure manipulates the human body and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.360 
structure manipulates the human body and
how<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.870> human<00:04:23.990> body<00:04:24.320> interact<00:04:25.190> with

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
how the human body interact with

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.060 
how the human body interact with
structures<00:04:25.880> with<00:04:26.510> our<00:04:26.720> environments<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:28.040> I

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
structures with our environments so I

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.189 
structures with our environments so I
decided<00:04:28.490> this<00:04:28.970> is<00:04:29.030> it<00:04:29.270> I'm<00:04:29.419> gonna<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.990> of

decided this is it I'm gonna and I of
course<00:04:30.440> love<00:04:30.740> movements<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:32.720> so<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.020> decided

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
course love movements and so I decided

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.310 
course love movements and so I decided
to<00:04:33.470> actually<00:04:33.740> mix<00:04:34.360> structure<00:04:35.360> architectural

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
to actually mix structure architectural

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.820 
to actually mix structure architectural
environments<00:04:37.360> with<00:04:38.360> was<00:04:39.199> the<00:04:39.350> movement<00:04:39.530> in

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
environments with was the movement in

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.100 
environments with was the movement in
the<00:04:39.889> bodies<00:04:40.190> majority<00:04:41.030> of<00:04:41.120> our<00:04:41.180> pieces<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:41.840> have

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
to deal with moving structures some of

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.960 
to deal with moving structures some of
them<00:04:43.550> not

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970

everything<00:04:53.180> has<00:04:53.419> so<00:04:53.660> much<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.870> do<00:04:53.990> with<00:04:54.110> growth

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
everything has so much to do with growth

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.870 
everything has so much to do with growth
from<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.800> beginning<00:04:55.190> of<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.340> piece<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.850> the

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.770 
Hollywood Bowl performing in it is like
amazing<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.930> itself<00:05:09.760> I<00:05:10.760> think<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.449> hasn't

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
amazing in itself I think it hasn't

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.430 
amazing in itself I think it hasn't
quite<00:05:11.840> hit<00:05:12.080> me<00:05:12.139> yet

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
quite hit me yet

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.580 
quite hit me yet
until<00:05:12.800> those<00:05:13.130> seats<00:05:13.460> fill<00:05:13.760> up<00:05:13.940> I<00:05:14.270> I<00:05:15.110> don't

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
until those seats fill up I I don't

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.189 
until those seats fill up I I don't
think<00:05:15.860> it's<00:05:15.949> gonna<00:05:16.039> quite<00:05:16.340> hit<00:05:16.610> how<00:05:17.199> impactful

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
think it's gonna quite hit how impactful

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.440 
think it's gonna quite hit how impactful
it's<00:05:18.380> really<00:05:18.620> gonna<00:05:18.770> be<00:05:18.860> on<00:05:19.250> Diablo<00:05:19.550> as<00:05:20.000> a

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
it's really gonna be on Diablo as a

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.140 
it's really gonna be on Diablo as a
whole<00:05:20.720> I<00:05:20.990> think<00:05:21.380> it's<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:21.979> a<00:05:22.160> taking<00:05:22.729> Diablo

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
whole I think it's just a taking Diablo
