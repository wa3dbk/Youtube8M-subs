let's have a closer look at this cooler

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.179 
let's have a closer look at this cooler
now<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.090> heatsink<00:01:24.630> will<00:01:24.869> fit<00:01:25.170> pretty<00:01:25.920> much

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
now this heatsink will fit pretty much

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.179 
now this heatsink will fit pretty much

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
very important thing with coolers is to

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.730 
very important thing with coolers is to
make<00:05:21.190> sure<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:21.490> they<00:05:21.909> fit<00:05:22.210> in<00:05:22.449> lots<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.349> lots

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
make sure that they fit in lots and lots

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.790 
make sure that they fit in lots and lots
of<00:05:24.099> cases<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.909> this<00:05:25.389> one<00:05:25.780> will<00:05:26.169> remember<00:05:26.530> the

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
of cases and this one will remember the

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.610 
of cases and this one will remember the
height<00:05:27.010> on<00:05:27.159> this<00:05:27.310> is<00:05:27.780> 160<00:05:28.780> millimeters<00:05:29.409> and

the market for Clarence for CPU coolers

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.640 
the market for Clarence for CPU coolers
is<00:05:36.820> around<00:05:37.210> one<00:05:37.449> hundred<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:37.990> sixty-four

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
is around one hundred and sixty-four

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.189 
is around one hundred and sixty-four
millimeters<00:05:39.159> there<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.669> really<00:05:40.030> nothing<00:05:40.389> not

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
to like about this CPU cooler it

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.719 
to like about this CPU cooler it
performs<00:05:44.020> well<00:05:44.229> looks<00:05:44.530> great<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.070> includes<00:05:45.430> a

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
performs well looks great and includes a

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.170 
performs well looks great and includes a
large<00:05:46.470> 140<00:05:47.470> millimeter<00:05:47.860> fan<00:05:48.130> that<00:05:48.430> fan<00:05:48.729> also

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
large 140 millimeter fan that fan also

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.689 
large 140 millimeter fan that fan also
includes<00:05:49.599> a<00:05:49.870> switch<00:05:50.289> so<00:05:50.650> you<00:05:50.710> can<00:05:51.070> control<00:05:51.520> the

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
includes a switch so you can control the

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.270 
includes a switch so you can control the
speed<00:05:52.030> right<00:05:52.690> on<00:05:52.900> the<00:05:53.199> fan<00:05:53.409> of<00:05:53.680> course<00:05:53.979> you<00:05:54.159> can

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
speed right on the fan of course you can

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.520 
speed right on the fan of course you can
just<00:05:54.460> set<00:05:54.610> it<00:05:54.699> to<00:05:54.789> a<00:05:54.820> high<00:05:54.880> speed<00:05:55.090> and<00:05:55.539> then<00:05:56.050> let

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
just set it to a high speed and then let

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.469 
just set it to a high speed and then let
either<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:57.009> motherboard<00:05:57.400> do<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:57.580> job<00:05:57.789> or<00:05:58.060> you

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
either the motherboard do the job or you

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.510 
either the motherboard do the job or you
can<00:05:58.630> have<00:05:58.960> a<00:05:58.990> fan<00:05:59.289> controller<00:05:59.770> that<00:06:00.280> would

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
can have a fan controller that would

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.480 
can have a fan controller that would
also<00:06:00.789> control<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:02.139> speed<00:06:02.440> on<00:06:02.470> this<00:06:02.860> fan<00:06:03.250> so

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
also control the speed on this fan so

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.790 
also control the speed on this fan so
that<00:06:03.789> is<00:06:04.030> completely<00:06:04.419> up<00:06:04.630> to<00:06:04.659> you<00:06:04.990> remember

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
that is completely up to you remember

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.670 
that is completely up to you remember
though<00:06:05.979> if<00:06:06.250> you<00:06:06.940> are<00:06:07.240> doing<00:06:07.810> something<00:06:08.050> CPU

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
though if you are doing something CPU

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.339 
though if you are doing something CPU
intensive<00:06:08.889> you<00:06:09.520> do<00:06:09.820> want<00:06:10.150> to<00:06:10.240> crank<00:06:10.840> that<00:06:11.080> fan

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
intensive you do want to crank that fan

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.520 
intensive you do want to crank that fan
up<00:06:12.099> to<00:06:12.430> make<00:06:12.580> sure<00:06:12.820> that<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.330> CPU<00:06:13.720> remains<00:06:14.229> as

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
up to make sure that the CPU remains as

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.879 
up to make sure that the CPU remains as
cool<00:06:15.070> as<00:06:15.400> possible<00:06:15.880> without<00:06:16.810> a<00:06:16.990> doubt<00:06:17.259> this<00:06:17.830> is
