00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
real part and that's the real key in a

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450 
real part and that's the real key in a
part<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> game<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> know<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.280> all

attitude and I really have to say they
did<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> good<00:00:57.809> job<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.770> their<00:00:58.949> own

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
did a good job with it with their own

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
did a good job with it with their own
mechanics<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> features<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:01.140> only<00:01:01.410> on

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
mechanics with the features not only on

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.260 
mechanics with the features not only on
offense<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.359> defense<00:01:03.870> also<00:01:04.220> like<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:06.090> can

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
offense but on defense also like you can

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.810 
offense but on defense also like you can
on<00:01:06.450> often<00:01:07.049> since<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.470> many<00:01:07.619> different<00:01:08.220> drip<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
on often since so many different drip I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.609 
on often since so many different drip I
think<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> better<00:01:09.479> your<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.020> ball<00:01:10.260> handler

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
think the better your the ball handler

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.010 
think the better your the ball handler
you<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.250> better<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:12.000> arm<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you have the better the more arm you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
you have the better the more arm you
know<00:01:13.460> ability<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:15.060> offensive

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
know ability you have on offensive

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
know ability you have on offensive
determine<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.320> what<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.619> want<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> do<00:01:16.979> with

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
determine on what you want to do with

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.280 
determine on what you want to do with
your<00:01:17.220> dribbling<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.509> ISO<00:01:18.900> motion

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
your dribbling with your ISO motion

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.010 
your dribbling with your ISO motion
moves<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.549> person<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.180> Durant<00:01:21.600> can

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
moves you know a person like Durant can

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
moves you know a person like Durant can
change<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.500> his<00:01:22.530> shot<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> has<00:01:23.939> its

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
change up his shot so much and has its

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
change up his shot so much and has its
almost<00:01:24.810> unstoppable<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.490> him<00:01:26.700> really

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
almost unstoppable I can see him really

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.030 
almost unstoppable I can see him really
not<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.780> him<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.320> players<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
not just him but you know players with a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.740 
not just him but you know players with a
great<00:01:29.310> dribbling<00:01:29.850> move<00:01:30.000> Isaac<00:01:30.180> look<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:30.659> this

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
and I seen the past coming I'm not going

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.940 
and I seen the past coming I'm not going
to<00:03:26.350> pass<00:03:26.560> down<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:27.160> just<00:03:27.190> gave<00:03:27.700> me<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.000> proper

to pass down it just gave me the proper
its<00:03:29.950> defeat<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.700> mechanics<00:03:31.239> are<00:03:31.390> just<00:03:31.420> right

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
its defeat the mechanics are just right

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.390 
its defeat the mechanics are just right
there<00:03:32.170> just<00:03:32.380> right<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.680> don't<00:03:33.010> want<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.250> say

there just right I don't want to say

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.830 
there just right I don't want to say
perfect<00:03:33.910> i<00:03:33.940> don't<00:03:34.150> want<00:03:34.299> to<00:03:34.359> use<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.600> word

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
bumped I can feel the bump and that's

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.130 
bumped I can feel the bump and that's
good<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.609> means<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.299> physics<00:04:04.780> of<00:04:04.900> it

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
good that means that the physics of it

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.840 
good that means that the physics of it
the<00:04:05.739> physics<00:04:06.250> are<00:04:06.370> there<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:06.640> when<00:04:06.760> the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
the physics are there and when the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.759 
the physics are there and when the
physics<00:04:07.269> are<00:04:07.420> there<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.170> gameplay<00:04:08.709> is

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
physics are there and the gameplay is

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.759 
physics are there and the gameplay is
there<00:04:09.069> then<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.329> game<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.600> it's<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.410> good<00:04:11.560> game

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
there then the game is it's a good game

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.410 
there then the game is it's a good game
it's<00:04:12.069> bound<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.430> be<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.609> good<00:04:12.850> game<00:04:13.030> look<00:04:13.299> at

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
it's bound to be a good game look at
