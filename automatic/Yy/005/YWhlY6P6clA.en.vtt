00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.929
 / more friendly is concrete I hope that 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.640
 you are fine because there was also the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.589
 tutorial on how to use the card 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.850
 walsh optics let's take out the passive 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.980
 to the passive what it does is that when 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.780
 we die because we have 7 seconds to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.520
 keep pulling skills the cv that is 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.589
 what you have to unlock first is 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.589
 a ball that can go missing is 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:22.349
 spend very little for 2050 week data 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.419
 of not allocate all work we achieve the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.550
 w is a barrier that is that big 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.279
 like Mars the signal and slows down when 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.689
 they go through it the e is damage per second 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.450
 with an aura that is around us 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.220
 and every time we improve them it makes more 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.920
 damage but spend more mana per second and 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
 the useful hearing the cardboard gap 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 what it does is that all 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 enemies of the game hurt them 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 they reduce reduction to all be where 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.300
 be for the first thing we 're going to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.300
 catch are two pots the ring 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.820
 and the graphic lighthouse 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.739
 let's go to the pits when I have 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.739
 level 6 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.130
 also tell you that it removes it more when 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.260
 only one unit, that is, if we give 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.260
 someone and you are alone with no one around 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.149
 what needs to be done first would be 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.149
 especially the tear 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.340
 the activated and selecting that it fills 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.340
 very fast 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.170
 after making the rod of ages 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.570
 plus 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.940
 the rod of the cities as the hat 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.400
 finish the cane of the archangel that 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.000
 it would be the end of improving the drop to 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.220
 maximum 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.200
 it was to make us gold while 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.270
 we have activated the one that is not going 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.090
 quite a year of Latin we facilitate 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.979
 our focus and the salt scepter with this 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.710
 build you'll see what a lot of cartridge 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.810
 while practicing 242 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.030
 when I have something to teach too 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.030
 how to kill with cartons 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.190
 also what is the q then the and after 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.410
 the wy to enter someone here 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.330
 looking for the 102 would be to throw the w 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.569
 CÃ¡ceres parenthesis to activate its 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.569
 side 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.470
 here I think it's the bar area with 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.350
 stability 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.700
 earn balloons to spend 78 per second and 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.700
 from 20 to 44 degrees 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.760
 and right now 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.329
 trusted 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.319
 that is, here you also want two letters 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.940
 all our departure and you have to have 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.069
 very careful to throw it useful because it is 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.080
 that when he's letting her 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.270
 boat to use down so 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.650
 if it's just ready but you're killed 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.840
 second before the tool is canceled 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.940
 totally bony is exposed to also be 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.310
 completely cancels so try 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.560
 throwing the hiding places was only a little 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.520
 apart even if they do not arrive it will already be 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.530
 you can throw 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.800
 and so you may wish others 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.260
 you can undo a fall from here in 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.350
 The he coming if he dies and that and good 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.300
 now if it was incomplete and has a little 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.890
 of the combo with very good inflation 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.830
 to finish up here we have the build 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.350
 it is the seraphim the routes from zero to 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.330
 zone and at the time of the ages the hat 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.070
 and the visual theater with status and 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.500
 I will hold jce we have our hundreds 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.730
 of apps and we already removed a thousand with the last 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.390
 so the lakers 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.390
 goodbye everybody 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:00.200
 and now I leave you with the masters before 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.700
 to finish the video and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.840
 I in this game used to be more than 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.550
 ape with letters with these in stability 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.260
 at level 18 and a little portability 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.150
 by level 15 ability power to 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.920
 start the magical existence and a little 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.380
 of armor that we never know that we 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.380
 can allow master's degrees also those of 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.170
 ap are these and you can copy them at 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.450
 that you want here I leave you and good 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.980
 this has been all a greeting was dedicated neither 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.880
 in the next tutorial we see ourselves with 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.880
 goodbye graphics
