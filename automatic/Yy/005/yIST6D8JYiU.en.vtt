00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.609
 b 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.890
 that's over 50 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 Motorsport 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250
 over 28 000 m 7 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 the most successful brand 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.510
 and as the smallest independent automotive manufacturer Neuenrade 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 JU 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 a success story undoubtedly 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.110
 APA 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 what is she saving on 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.490
 For one, motorsport was a special form of Porsche for him 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.570
 Forint 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 the insights from the racetrack are 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.780
 from the first Porsche 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.000
 introduced as design and test principles in our vehicles 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.860
 Because of this proximity to racing cars, our customers have always been racing 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 took part 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.860
 initially with modified production vehicles 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.080
 later split apart 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.979
 to the other one has 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.149
 Sporschill support this commitment from the start 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 a principle that never changed 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.219
 therefore, researchers have their car as everyone else 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.209
 well over 2000 St 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.400
 Currently, more than a thousand of them are in use as landlords 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.400
 In addition, they demand research with the twelve brand trophies worldwide 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 most 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.790
 around 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.249
 Motorsport to operate at this high level 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:43.479
 Researchers have a state-of-the-art Motorsport Centro Norte 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.419
 embedded in the development center Weissach not really big but very 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.419
 efficient just typical Porsche 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.499
 racing cars will again be here 9 11 gt3 RSR 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.059
 and the RS Spyder hope 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.710
 I'm TVI usual in the old town production 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.819
 but in a manufactory 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 a completely new way of production for racing cars 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.989
 For this we have the principles of lean production of ours 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.989
 Serial production transferred to the construction of racing cars 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.279
 pte 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.109
 At two flexible the lines build racing mechanics in small well-rehearsed 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:34.760
 team 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.519
 the racing cars on 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.519
 to be back in little Siri 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.579
 along with the 9 11 gt3 cup 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.100
 which are built in conjunction with production in Zuffenhausen 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.279
 arise like that 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.279
 Over 250 races per year 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.269
 Motorsport means for researchers but not only the construction of racing cars 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.959
 but also the intensive support of our racing customers 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.459
 with contact persons for technical questions 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.459
 and of course spare parts 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:12.829
 The Motorsport Logistics Center stores around 25,000 different parts 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:17.689
 from components for the construction of the current race cars to spare parts 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.569
 for racing cars of the last 15 years 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.809
 from dust cover lid bites too concentrated 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:26.809
 makes four point 5 million parts 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.280
 from here the teams are delivered all over the world 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 seven days a week 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.590
 in our sport 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.090
 but below goes far beyond the motorsport center in Weissach 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.379
 Every year researchers are worldwide 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:46.809
 over 100 races 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:50.020
 one supported by the 4th 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.030
 with the use of factory drivers 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.050
 with engineers and mechanics 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.169
 and with a total of 8 race tracks 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.169
 our mobile motorsport centers in the parish hall 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.139
 why we are so dedicated to motorsport 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 because motorsport is also a business for us 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.980
 but also because we are enthusiastic about motor sport nonsense 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:31.680
 the 15th 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.680
 the close connection 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:38.859
 and promptly back
