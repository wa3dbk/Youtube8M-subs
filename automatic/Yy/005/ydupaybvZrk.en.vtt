five-hundred-dollar<00:00:49.020> brick<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.460> big

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
five-hundred-dollar brick that was a big

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.680 
five-hundred-dollar brick that was a big
concern<00:00:52.070> now<00:00:53.070> apparently<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.180> still<00:00:54.480> are

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
concern now apparently they still are

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
concern now apparently they still are
going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.350> whole<00:00:55.500> connect<00:00:56.039> thing

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
going to have the whole connect thing

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.420 
going to have the whole connect thing
where<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> connected

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
where you have to have it connected

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.220 
where you have to have it connected
hopefully<00:00:59.430> they<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.270> remove<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.989> well

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
hopefully they will remove that as well

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.549 
hopefully they will remove that as well
that's<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.070> I'm<00:01:02.160> hoping<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.260> we

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that's what I'm hoping for so that we

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
that's what I'm hoping for so that we
can<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.250> disconnected<00:01:06.229> also<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.409> need

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
can have it disconnected also they need

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
can have it disconnected also they need
to<00:01:07.770> make<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.760> an<00:01:08.939> optional

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to make it so that it's an optional

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.740 
to make it so that it's an optional
thing<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.619> buy<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
thing to buy it because if they do that

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.300 
thing to buy it because if they do that
I<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.470> believe<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.979> they'll<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.220> able

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I really do believe that they'll be able

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
I really do believe that they'll be able
to<00:01:14.549> lower<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> price<00:01:15.270> may<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.659> down<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.140> four

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
to lower the price may be down to four

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
to lower the price may be down to four
hundred<00:01:16.530> dollars<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.939> will

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
hundred dollars and then they will

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.800 
hundred dollars and then they will
really<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.810> able<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> compete<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.860> Sony<00:01:20.810> now

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
really be able to compete with Sony now

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300 
really be able to compete with Sony now

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
is going to be a tough decision I'm an

hate<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.709> connect<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.519> hope<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.150> guys<00:02:39.330> know

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
hate to connect I hope you guys know

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.380 
hate to connect I hope you guys know
that<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.900> put<00:02:40.349> out<00:02:40.380> videos<00:02:40.500> about<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.970> and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
that I put out videos about that and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.289 
that I put out videos about that and
obviously<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.530> hate<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.519> if<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:44.970> remove

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
obviously I hate it so if they remove

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.229 
obviously I hate it so if they remove
that<00:02:45.540> policy<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.349> might<00:02:46.680> be<00:02:46.860> really<00:02:47.280> game<00:02:47.700> right

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
that policy I might be really game right

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.390 
that policy I might be really game right
now<00:02:48.269> though<00:02:48.840> with<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.470> policy<00:02:49.709> still<00:02:50.310> in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
now though with that policy still in

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.339 
now though with that policy still in
place<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.299> fact<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.049> still

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
place the fact that it's going to still

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.250 
place the fact that it's going to still
probably<00:02:52.680> cost<00:02:53.010> five<00:02:53.340> hundred<00:02:53.700> dollars<00:02:54.260> Sony

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
probably cost five hundred dollars Sony

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.350 
probably cost five hundred dollars Sony
is<00:02:55.380> still<00:02:55.769> more<00:02:55.980> appealing<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.150> they<00:02:57.299> were

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
is still more appealing but if they were

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.690 
is still more appealing but if they were
to<00:02:57.480> change<00:02:57.810> any<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.260> those<00:02:58.500> policies<00:02:59.310> maybe

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
to change any of those policies maybe

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.970 
to change any of those policies maybe
have<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.360> couple<00:03:00.780> more<00:03:00.900> exclusives<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.739> look

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
have a couple more exclusives that look

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.759
