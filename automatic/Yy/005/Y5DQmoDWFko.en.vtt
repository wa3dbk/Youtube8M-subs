00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.710
 I need more ammo and starter cheese 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.169
 and cheeses hello and welcome again today 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 I present a new trick here in the 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.930
 transit mode and it would be with the shield to 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.119
 create a barrier with space is worth and 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.710
 would be the part of electricity and 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.390
 good to start what we need is 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.940
 create the shield 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.940
 one we just created it and all that 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.690
 we collect it and now yes that if we 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.329
 we will have to go to the area of the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.860
 electricity to do the trick and 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.420
 once here we will have to place the 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.280
 trap in electricity as it is 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.160
 put there I'll have to create it and put it 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.559
 there and do this what I'm going to do here 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.350
 throw us a little to go and catch 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.240
 quickly the electric trap 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.760
 substitute what is the 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.830
 the shield and throw us fast back 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.870
 so that it comes out as you see the zombies 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.600
 they will be caught 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.310
 and we can enjoy a great trick since 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.200
 our colleague is there and the zombies are not 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.760
 they do nothing to you even pass by 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.700
 side or they pass me by here next and 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.200
 it does not come in Miami or him and the truth 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.329
 is that they are your case 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 it is quite important not to give light 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.689
 because if we give light we are 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.880
 will open the door since we have there 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.439
 side and therefore we will enter by him 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.530
 and the zombies and our companion 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.049
 will die so to welcome the trap 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.119
 electrical what we will have to do 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.770
 will open with the turbine and create the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.569
 electrical trap and re-enter with 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.220
 the turbine because if we give the 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.479
 electricity as I said before then 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.289
 we can not create the barrier 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.289
 correctly 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.270
 and good to be able to take the ammunition and everything 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.979
 that pulling a monkey if we throw can not 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.299
 safely pick up the ammunition and everything 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.990
 that's so try that this in 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.729
 good weapons and nothing this is all I hope 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.810
 that you liked to like and 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.729
 subscribe to motivate 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.729
 but disgusting banesto 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.270
 the corpses 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.570
 and I can get out of trouble
