00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
like suck you in and then you buy it and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
like suck you in and then you buy it and
you're<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.760> oh<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.600> god<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:43.110> did<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you're just like oh my god what did I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.830 
you're just like oh my god what did I
buy<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.550> totally<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.300> worth<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
buy like this was totally not worth the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.139 
buy like this was totally not worth the
money<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.430> thought<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> would<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
money so I just thought it would be a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
money so I just thought it would be a
great<00:00:48.570> idea<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.989> start<00:00:49.410> something<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
great idea to start something like that

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
great idea to start something like that
where<00:00:50.460> I'm<00:00:50.579> giving<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> positives<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
where I'm giving the positives and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
where I'm giving the positives and
negatives<00:00:52.489> about<00:00:53.489> products<00:00:54.530> um<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.730> just<00:00:56.730> don't
