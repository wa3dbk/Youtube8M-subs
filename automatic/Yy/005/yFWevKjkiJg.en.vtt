didn't<00:03:10.470> really<00:03:10.650> see<00:03:10.800> much<00:03:10.920> difference

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
didn't really see much difference

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.610 
didn't really see much difference
between<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.640> two<00:03:11.700> bowling<00:03:12.000> balls<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:13.440> new

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
between the two bowling balls the new

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.670 
between the two bowling balls the new
one<00:03:13.800> red<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.250> little<00:03:14.489> bit<00:03:14.730> earlier<00:03:15.680> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
one red a little bit earlier the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.080 
one red a little bit earlier the
oil-soaked<00:03:17.160> point<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.550> little<00:03:17.640> bit<00:03:17.880> longer

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
oil-soaked point a little bit longer

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.760 
oil-soaked point a little bit longer
just<00:03:18.270> because<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:19.050> had<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> little<00:03:19.410> bit<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.620> oil

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
just because it had a little bit of oil

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.690 
just because it had a little bit of oil
on<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.280> didn't<00:03:20.850> grab<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> lane<00:03:21.270> as<00:03:21.480> quick

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
on it and didn't grab the lane as quick

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.100 
on it and didn't grab the lane as quick
when<00:03:23.700> they<00:03:23.820> got<00:03:24.030> burned<00:03:24.269> up<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.540> little<00:03:24.720> bit<00:03:24.930> I

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
when they got burned up a little bit I

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.050 
when they got burned up a little bit I
noticed<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> new<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.280> really<00:03:26.670> read<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
noticed that the new one really read the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.750 
noticed that the new one really read the
lane<00:03:27.209> really<00:03:27.630> early<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.489> ended<00:03:29.489> up<00:03:29.610> booking

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
lane really early and ended up booking

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.940 
lane really early and ended up booking
about<00:03:30.180> two<00:03:30.450> boards<00:03:30.750> more<00:03:30.989> than<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> oil<00:03:31.620> tough

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
about two boards more than the oil tough

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.150 
about two boards more than the oil tough
one<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:34.080> advantage<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> oil-soaked<00:03:35.010> one

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
one the advantage of the oil-soaked one

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.800 
one the advantage of the oil-soaked one
in<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.340> situation<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.360> doesn't<00:03:36.540> read<00:03:36.780> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
in that situation is it doesn't read the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.780 
in that situation is it doesn't read the
lane<00:03:37.019> as<00:03:37.170> early<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.709> way<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:38.459> can<00:03:38.610> kind

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
lane as early so that way you can kind

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.520 
lane as early so that way you can kind
of<00:03:38.910> keep<00:03:39.540> your<00:03:39.630> line<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> little<00:03:40.200> bit<00:03:40.290> tighter

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
of keep your line a little bit tighter

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.500 
of keep your line a little bit tighter
and<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:41.610> gets<00:03:41.819> down<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> lane<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.209> little<00:03:42.420> bit

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
and it gets down the lane a little bit

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.729 
and it gets down the lane a little bit
more<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.780> actually<00:03:42.900> becomes<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.500> little<00:03:43.620> bit

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
more and actually becomes a little bit

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.910 
more and actually becomes a little bit
more<00:03:44.010> responsive<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.750> friction<00:03:46.140> because

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
more responsive to the friction because

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.370 
more responsive to the friction because
it's<00:03:47.069> not<00:03:47.220> reading<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:47.610> early<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.480> both<00:03:49.170> have

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
it's not reading so early so both have

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.259 
it's not reading so early so both have
its<00:03:49.530> advantages<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.280> disadvantages<00:03:51.060> but

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
its advantages and disadvantages but

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.710 
its advantages and disadvantages but
overall<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.019> was<00:03:52.380> really<00:03:52.440> impressed<00:03:53.040> with<00:03:53.720> how

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
overall I was really impressed with how

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.750 
overall I was really impressed with how
well<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.049> soak<00:03:55.560> one<00:03:55.799> performed<00:03:56.340> against<00:03:56.640> the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
well the soak one performed against the

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.910 
well the soak one performed against the
new<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.150> box<00:03:57.180> one<00:03:57.570> yeah<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.019> was<00:03:58.350> also<00:03:58.769> watching

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
new in box one yeah I was also watching

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.220 
new in box one yeah I was also watching

when<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.500> were<00:04:01.590> on<00:04:01.739> fresh<00:04:02.100> originally

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
when you were on fresh originally

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.220 
when you were on fresh originally
watching<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.209> throw<00:04:03.420> those<00:04:03.570> shots

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
watching you throw those shots

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.050 
watching you throw those shots
it<00:04:04.440> was<00:04:04.560> pretty<00:04:04.829> amazing<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.519> honestly

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
it was pretty amazing I honestly

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.610 
it was pretty amazing I honestly
couldn't<00:04:06.390> even<00:04:06.630> see<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.230> there<00:04:07.410> was<00:04:07.590> a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
couldn't even see that there was a

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.810 
couldn't even see that there was a
difference<00:04:08.070> when<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.250> first<00:04:08.489> started

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
difference when you first started

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.460 
difference when you first started
throwing<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.239> ball<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.750> was<00:04:09.900> crazy<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.410> were

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
throwing a ball it was crazy you were

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.440 
throwing a ball it was crazy you were
lining<00:04:10.680> up<00:04:10.890> with<00:04:10.920> both<00:04:11.190> claws<00:04:11.430> almost<00:04:12.269> on<00:04:12.420> my

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
lining up with both claws almost on my

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.890 
lining up with both claws almost on my
Danika<00:04:13.110> line

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
Danika line

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.080 
Danika line
and<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.560> performance<00:04:15.159> still<00:04:15.370> seemed<00:04:15.760> the

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
and the performance still seemed the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.150 
and the performance still seemed the
same<00:04:16.359> which<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.750> crazy<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.440> think<00:04:17.769> that<00:04:17.859> ball

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
same which is crazy to think that ball

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.370 
same which is crazy to think that ball
was<00:04:18.340> soaked<00:04:18.699> in<00:04:18.910> oil<00:04:19.030> submerged<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:20.049> an<00:04:20.139> hour

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
was soaked in oil submerged for an hour

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.159 
was soaked in oil submerged for an hour
and<00:04:20.799> then<00:04:21.489> pull<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.060> out<00:04:22.150> drill<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:22.870> you

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
and then pull it out drill it and you

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.689 
and then pull it out drill it and you
get<00:04:23.289> that<00:04:23.440> type<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.680> performance<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:24.460> it's

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
get that type of performance so it's

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.700 
get that type of performance so it's
pretty<00:04:24.850> cool<00:04:25.120> yeah<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.960> first<00:04:26.259> time<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.470> threw

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
pretty cool yeah the first time I threw

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.499 
pretty cool yeah the first time I threw
these<00:04:26.800> bowling<00:04:27.130> balls<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.580> actually<00:04:28.150> thought

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
these bowling balls I actually thought

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.980 
these bowling balls I actually thought
they<00:04:28.930> also<00:04:29.139> come<00:04:29.440> one<00:04:29.560> hooked<00:04:29.979> more<00:04:30.220> down<00:04:30.430> lane

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
they also come one hooked more down lane

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.480 
they also come one hooked more down lane
because<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.139> you<00:04:32.500> know<00:04:32.590> how<00:04:32.740> clean<00:04:33.039> it<00:04:33.160> was<00:04:33.310> to

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
because of you know how clean it was to

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.090 
because of you know how clean it was to
the<00:04:33.580> front<00:04:33.820> right<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:35.020> was<00:04:35.380> it<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:35.889> really

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
the front right it was it was really

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.490 
the front right it was it was really
cool<00:04:36.280> that's<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:37.270> see<00:04:37.449> that<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> ball<00:04:38.380> that

cool that's to see that that a ball that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.740 
cool that's to see that that a ball that

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
you soaked in oil actually hooked more

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.629 
you soaked in oil actually hooked more
