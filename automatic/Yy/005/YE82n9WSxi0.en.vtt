00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
actually what I did instead of having

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.480 
actually what I did instead of having
all<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.090> room<00:01:09.890> gosh<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> be

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
all this room gosh this is going to be

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000 
all this room gosh this is going to be
hard<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> explain<00:01:12.170> all<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.380> had<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> lip

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
hard to explain all right I had a lip

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950 
hard to explain all right I had a lip
back<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.000> came<00:01:15.299> down<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> whether

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
back here that came down on to whether

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.520 
back here that came down on to whether
seats<00:01:16.259> were<00:01:16.470> well<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.670> cut<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.330> off

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
seats were well I actually cut that off

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.109 
seats were well I actually cut that off
so<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> sealed<00:01:19.950> portion<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> starting<00:01:20.939> right

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
so the sealed portion is starting right

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
so the sealed portion is starting right
here<00:01:21.150> where<00:01:21.600> those<00:01:21.750> screws<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
here where those screws are and this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.190 
here where those screws are and this
front<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> false<00:01:24.750> front<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
front is actually just a false front I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
front is actually just a false front I
might<00:01:25.380> throw<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.830> sixes<00:01:26.250> or<00:01:26.400> something<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
might throw some sixes or something in

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
might throw some sixes or something in
there<00:01:26.970> something<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:28.170> sealed

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
there something but it's actually sealed

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.130 
there something but it's actually sealed
off<00:01:28.829> right<00:01:29.159> back<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.640> where<00:01:29.850> those<00:01:30.140> screw

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
off right back there where those screw

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
off right back there where those screw
holes<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:32.970> where<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> sealed
