okay<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:02.670> i'm<00:04:03.150> going<00:04:03.270> to<00:04:03.360> go<00:04:03.450> ahead<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:03.660> let

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
okay so i'm going to go ahead and let

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.930 
okay so i'm going to go ahead and let
that<00:04:04.110> dry<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.650> then<00:04:04.860> come<00:04:05.190> back<00:04:05.220> with<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
that dry and then come back with the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.480 
that dry and then come back with the
stamping<00:04:08.240> ok<00:04:09.240> so<00:04:09.300> here<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.810> applied<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.830> top<00:04:11.220> coat

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
stamping ok so here I applied a top coat

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.110 
stamping ok so here I applied a top coat
in<00:04:11.760> case<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.480> mess<00:04:12.870> up<00:04:13.110> on<00:04:13.410> my<00:04:13.709> stamping<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.459> I

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
in case I mess up on my stamping and I

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.110 
in case I mess up on my stamping and I
applied<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.990> liquid<00:04:16.530> latex<00:04:17.010> barrier<00:04:17.519> around<00:04:17.790> my

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
applied a liquid latex barrier around my

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.990 
applied a liquid latex barrier around my
nails<00:04:18.389> so<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.959> stamping<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.709> easier<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> clean

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
nails so the stamping is easier to clean

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.180
