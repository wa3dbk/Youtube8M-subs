00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 so invites you to a warm welcome 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.730
 new video today there are a few times 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.160
 battlefield or origin news 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.309
 you can now battlefield 4 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.780
 play for free for seven days 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.400
 there is no limited version or 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.830
 as well as a demo but you can 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 really the complete game as it is 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 is play and see if there is something for 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.859
 many of you still have it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 not and do not know if it is on her 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.699
 pc is running or if it is so 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 works as it should work 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 at one you can download yourself 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.170
 test the whole thing for seven days 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.329
 works via origin game time 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.129
 this is apparently a new feature where 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.079
 the original people every now and then 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.000
 raushauen full version now it works 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.230
 of course right off with battlefield 4 going on 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 that also some other game 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.530
 in it because it just is not what it's called 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.840
 but this is about battlefield 4 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.219
 that could test in for seven days 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.320
 full scope 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.460
 I would do it all with game time too 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.780
 keep a little in mind 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.399
 maybe he'll come up with that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.050
 or other horny play purely something 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.690
 maybe new and you do not plan 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 if that's what it takes seven days 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.019
 is now really a long time around in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.280
 Battlefield 4 try a lot 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.710
 or play in others 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 some people just play games too 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.939
 only seven days long if done correctly 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.140
 So I searched for it 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.640
 singleplayer game is not really 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.200
 because the gips people is the hewn then 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.049
 in time by even battlefield 4 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.479
 I really think a cool thing that there 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.880
 also because people can take a look 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.799
 especially for the people 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.900
 just do not know if that 's on her 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.369
 pc is running and now just that 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 can get and try that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.170
 and that accordingly if 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 it works or it just mega 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.189
 has fun in picking up 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 can and the cool thing is her 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.909
 synonymous because right at the point 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 continue playing where he left off because 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.290
 the whole thing is saved you are called 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.149
 You can now do this for seven days 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.950
 play through and test and see if 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.600
 what is for you and if you are the one 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.070
 stand ready to play and you have that 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.619
 did not want to buy it now 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.719
 times so expensive meanwhile you can 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.280
 keep playing where you left off 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.820
 write me your opinions 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.070
 this 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.590
 whole action in the comments what 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.909
 possibly with prejudice and what 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.070
 at the end with disadvantages 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.530
 could be there by myself because today's 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.150
 a completely normal evening 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.680
 Battlefield 4 and video 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.750
 I say goodbye now wish you 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.860
 have fun in the bed and then the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.200
 people who do not play it yet 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.760
 Have fun testing and me 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.200
 say goodbye and say to you
