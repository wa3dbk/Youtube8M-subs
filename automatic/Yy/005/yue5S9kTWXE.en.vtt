 there you need what remains is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.190
 to steal families 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.810

 most work lunar cycle version 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.790
 quite rightly so 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.300
 that are small slices 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.490

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.590
