00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the same thing except I think he's going

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
the same thing except I think he's going
to<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.369> more<00:01:29.549> stone<00:01:29.880> first<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:31.439> bit

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

to get more stone first and a little bit
of<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.650> different<00:01:31.920> strategy<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.909> think

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
of a different strategy going on I think

of a different strategy going on I think
his<00:01:33.750> gravy<00:01:34.200> sucks<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:36.380> don't<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.470> another<00:01:38.430> guy

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.770 
pretty simple I can only really build a
watchtower<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.370> compute<00:01:48.670> arrows<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.030> wall<00:01:49.450> a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
watchtower that compute arrows a wall a

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.820 
watchtower that compute arrows a wall a
barracks<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.800> stronghold<00:01:51.340> or<00:01:51.760> more<00:01:51.970> houses

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
barracks a stronghold or more houses

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.430 
barracks a stronghold or more houses
I've<00:01:53.830> kept<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.160> simple<00:01:54.310> because<00:01:54.550> it's<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.270> nap

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
I've kept it simple because it's a nap

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.600 
I've kept it simple because it's a nap
first<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.620> foremost<00:01:56.830> it<00:01:57.130> doesn't<00:01:57.430> need<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.550> be

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
first and foremost it doesn't need to be

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.170 
first and foremost it doesn't need to be
too<00:01:57.820> involved<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:59.440> then<00:01:59.770> also<00:02:00.040> just<00:02:00.250> just<00:02:01.030> has

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
too involved and then also just just has

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.820 
too involved and then also just just has
a<00:02:01.210> bit<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.479> fun<00:02:01.900> gameplay<00:02:02.200> with<00:02:02.530> kind<00:02:02.770> of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
a bit of fun gameplay with kind of

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.060 
a bit of fun gameplay with kind of
competing<00:02:03.280> with<00:02:03.490> other<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.850> eyes<00:02:04.830> there's<00:02:05.830> a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
competing with other a eyes there's a

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.840 
competing with other a eyes there's a
really<00:02:06.430> cool<00:02:06.850> Cano's<00:02:07.410> tuan<00:02:08.410> tuan<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:09.070> matt<00:02:09.550> i

really cool Cano's tuan tuan to matt i

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.420 
really cool Cano's tuan tuan to matt i
really<00:02:10.390> like<00:02:10.600> very<00:02:11.050> challenging<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.770> don't

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
really like very challenging I don't

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.220 
really like very challenging I don't

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
really shy away from challenging games I

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.199 
really shy away from challenging games I
like<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.560> idea<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.950> making<00:02:15.790> something<00:02:16.060> that

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
like the idea of making something that

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.820 
like the idea of making something that
you<00:02:16.390> can't<00:02:16.630> win<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:16.870> your<00:02:17.080> first<00:02:17.230> try<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.770> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
you can't win on your first try that you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.560 
you can't win on your first try that you

skill and it in order to win it I need

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.250 
skill and it in order to win it I need
build<00:02:25.420> another<00:02:25.540> house<00:02:25.780> can<00:02:26.560> go<00:02:26.770> then<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:28.260> think

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
build another house can go then I think

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.420 
build another house can go then I think
the<00:02:29.320> school<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.680> game<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.040> keeping<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the school this game is just keeping a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
the school this game is just keeping a
bit<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.670> moving<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.959> get<00:02:32.110> multiple

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
bit and moving and you get multiple

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.020 
bit and moving and you get multiple
multiple<00:02:32.709> things<00:02:33.100> live<00:02:33.340> interview<00:02:33.640> guys<00:02:33.790> you

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
multiple things live interview guys you

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.580 
multiple things live interview guys you
needed<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.600> build<00:02:34.720> more<00:02:34.870> houses<00:02:35.320> or<00:02:35.530> you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
needed to build more houses or you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.290 
needed to build more houses or you
needed<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.940> more<00:02:37.060> stones<00:02:37.360> forward<00:02:39.300> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
needed to get more stones forward and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.610 
needed to get more stones forward and
all<00:02:40.450> while<00:02:40.690> you've<00:02:40.870> got<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.200> relentless

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
all while you've got a relentless

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.100 
all while you've got a relentless
attacking<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.250> I<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:43.510> is<00:02:43.660> all<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.020> enemies

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
attacking a I that is all the enemies

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.650 
attacking a I that is all the enemies
around<00:02:44.500> you

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.990 

so<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.800> game<00:02:50.950> does<00:02:51.190> start<00:02:51.460> a<00:02:51.580> little<00:02:51.790> bit

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
so the game does start a little bit

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.290 
so the game does start a little bit
slide<00:02:52.270> out<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.630> met<00:02:52.900> where<00:02:53.770> you're<00:02:53.920> kind<00:02:54.070> of

opponents to also get up to your level

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.220 
opponents to also get up to your level
you<00:03:01.060> want<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.270> try<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.480> attack<00:03:01.750> them<00:03:01.930> before

you want to try and attack them before

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.860 
you want to try and attack them before
they<00:03:02.320> can<00:03:02.590> defend<00:03:03.100> themselves<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.790> must<00:03:04.720> have

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
they can defend themselves I must have

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.800 
they can defend themselves I must have
got<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.140> bit<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.100> a<00:03:06.190> simple<00:03:06.790> passive<00:03:07.240> AI<00:03:07.450> at<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
got a bit of a simple passive AI at the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.730 
got a bit of a simple passive AI at the
moment<00:03:08.080> because<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:09.130> IRS<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.640> randomized<00:03:10.150> so

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
moment because the IRS are randomized so

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.470 
moment because the IRS are randomized so
you<00:03:11.740> might<00:03:11.890> get<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.100> passive<00:03:12.490> AI<00:03:12.610> one<00:03:13.000> round<00:03:13.270> at

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
you might get a passive AI one round at

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.250 
you might get a passive AI one round at
a<00:03:13.810> very<00:03:14.050> aggressive<00:03:14.380> AI<00:03:15.130> on<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.550> same<00:03:15.730> level

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
a very aggressive AI on the same level

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260 
a very aggressive AI on the same level
it<00:03:17.260> does<00:03:17.440> happen<00:03:17.680> in<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.310> builder<00:03:18.610> ducks<00:03:19.000> I'm

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
it does happen in a builder ducks I'm

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.650 
it does happen in a builder ducks I'm
gonna<00:03:19.390> do<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.630> quite<00:03:19.810> far<00:03:19.960> away<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:22.390> when<00:03:22.540> you

guy chopping wood will have a little axe

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.620 
guy chopping wood will have a little axe
I<00:03:37.060> can<00:03:37.270> build<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.960> fish<00:03:38.320> build<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:39.210> by<00:03:40.210> the<00:03:40.270> tiling

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
I can build a fish build a by the tiling

the guy gets the debris build a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.550 
the guy gets the debris build a
watchtower<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:43.750> build<00:03:43.990> that<00:03:44.110> just<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:47.500> to

watchtower so build that just to just to

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.760 
watchtower so build that just to just to
get<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.890> enemy<00:03:48.690> we<00:03:49.690> start<00:03:49.900> provoking<00:03:50.170> them<00:03:50.500> to

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
get the enemy we start provoking them to

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.280 
get the enemy we start provoking them to
be<00:03:50.860> honest<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.310> put<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> watchtower<00:03:52.150> there<00:03:52.390> so

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
be honest I put a watchtower there so

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.080 
be honest I put a watchtower there so

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
build one of each types of units and

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.780 
build one of each types of units and
also<00:03:55.630> need<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.959> build<00:03:56.140> another<00:03:56.260> house<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
also need to build another house so I

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.199 
also need to build another house so I
can<00:03:57.910> house<00:03:58.180> those<00:03:58.450> units<00:03:58.810> and<00:04:00.060> then<00:04:01.060> we'll

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
can house those units and then we'll

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.790 
can house those units and then we'll
start<00:04:01.450> finding<00:04:01.959> and<00:04:02.140> probably<00:04:02.500> kill<00:04:02.680> them

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
start finding and probably kill them

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.320 
start finding and probably kill them
pretty<00:04:02.980> quickly<00:04:03.190> because<00:04:03.400> i<00:04:03.760> think<00:04:04.270> i<00:04:04.300> have

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
pretty quickly because i think i have

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.060 
pretty quickly because i think i have
got<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.720> passive<00:04:05.110> AI<00:04:05.260> this<00:04:05.620> round<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.920> is

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
got the passive AI this round this is

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.199 
got the passive AI this round this is
just<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.250> wall<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.580> can<00:04:09.640> actually<00:04:09.760> do<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.000> few

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
just the wall you can actually do a few

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.340 
just the wall you can actually do a few
walls<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:11.260> guy<00:04:11.680> do<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.870> better<00:04:14.050> it's

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
walls that guy do it's better it's

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.310 
walls that guy do it's better it's
pretty<00:04:14.620> easy<00:04:14.770> to<00:04:14.950> use<00:04:15.160> on<00:04:15.340> different<00:04:15.730> maps

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
pretty easy to use on different maps

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.220 
pretty easy to use on different maps
where<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:18.209> really<00:04:19.209> need<00:04:19.390> to<00:04:19.419> war<00:04:19.810> off<00:04:19.930> certain

where you really need to war off certain
areas<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.620> stop<00:04:20.799> them<00:04:20.950> from<00:04:21.010> coming<00:04:21.190> in<00:04:21.459> so

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
areas to stop them from coming in so

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.180 
areas to stop them from coming in so
that's<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.810> soldier<00:04:23.350> type<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.650> class<00:04:23.860> and

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
that's the soldier type of class and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.740 
that's the soldier type of class and
should<00:04:25.000> be<00:04:25.120> coming<00:04:25.360> very<00:04:25.390> soon<00:04:25.810> as<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.460> archer

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
should be coming very soon as the archer

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.940 
should be coming very soon as the archer
dodge<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.990> always<00:04:29.169> good<00:04:29.320> at<00:04:29.440> shooting<00:04:29.830> things

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
dodge is always good at shooting things

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.040 
dodge is always good at shooting things
from<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.130> distance<00:04:30.490> like<00:04:30.669> so<00:04:31.090> maybe<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.930> what

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
from a distance like so maybe that what

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.960 
from a distance like so maybe that what
imagine<00:04:32.410> when<00:04:32.530> he<00:04:32.560> gets<00:04:32.710> close<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.220> the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
imagine when he gets close and the

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.310 
imagine when he gets close and the
warrior<00:04:34.240> when<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.510> gets<00:04:34.630> closer<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.050> in<00:04:35.230> the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
warrior when it gets closer and in the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.920 
warrior when it gets closer and in the
hill<00:04:35.470> start<00:04:35.740> attacking<00:04:35.980> as<00:04:36.280> well<00:04:36.780> placed<00:04:37.780> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
hill start attacking as well placed a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.920 
hill start attacking as well placed a
very<00:04:38.080> good<00:04:39.360> otherwise<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.480> can<00:04:40.600> tell<00:04:40.780> them<00:04:40.870> to

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
very good otherwise you can tell them to

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.000 
very good otherwise you can tell them to
go<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.110> attack<00:04:41.290> someone<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.710> your<00:04:41.770> follow

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
go and attack someone in your follow

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.510 
go and attack someone in your follow
them<00:04:42.160> around

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.769 

so<00:04:46.520> I've<00:04:46.610> definitely<00:04:46.789> got<00:04:47.059> the<00:04:47.119> pass<00:04:47.300> of<00:04:47.479> AI<00:04:47.599> is

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:47.779 
so I've definitely got the pass of AI is

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:49.510 
so I've definitely got the pass of AI is
if<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.110> slow<00:04:48.409> it's<00:04:49.099> slower<00:04:49.279> than<00:04:49.399> normal

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
if it's slow it's slower than normal

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.939 
if it's slow it's slower than normal
which<00:04:49.819> means<00:04:49.849> i<00:04:50.119> can<00:04:50.349> really<00:04:51.349> take<00:04:51.649> my<00:04:51.770> time

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
which means i can really take my time

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.159 
which means i can really take my time
here<00:04:52.249> it's<00:04:52.580> pretty<00:04:52.729> good<00:04:52.939> illustration<00:04:53.629> of

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
here it's pretty good illustration of

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.820 
here it's pretty good illustration of
how<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.319> game<00:04:54.529> goes<00:04:54.770> as<00:04:55.009> well<00:04:58.899> wow<00:04:59.899> it's<00:05:00.679> been

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
how the game goes as well wow it's been

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.339 
how the game goes as well wow it's been
an<00:05:00.949> easy<00:05:01.099> level<00:05:01.459> it<00:05:02.419> is<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.719> first<00:05:02.929> kind<00:05:03.259> of

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
an easy level it is the first kind of

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.679 
an easy level it is the first kind of
level<00:05:04.249> where<00:05:04.369> you<00:05:04.459> see<00:05:04.699> another<00:05:04.879> force<00:05:05.209> so

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:05.689 
level where you see another force so

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.659 
level where you see another force so
it's<00:05:06.349> understandable<00:05:06.559> that<00:05:07.099> it's<00:05:07.309> a<00:05:07.369> simple

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
it's understandable that it's a simple

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.389 
it's understandable that it's a simple
level<00:05:07.939> now<00:05:08.899> if<00:05:09.020> we<00:05:09.080> get<00:05:09.349> probably<00:05:09.830> around<00:05:10.069> one

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:10.399 
level now if we get probably around one

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:12.909 
level now if we get probably around one
hundred<00:05:10.459> or<00:05:10.879> a<00:05:11.119> thousand<00:05:11.959> downloads<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.439> the

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
hundred or a thousand downloads of the

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.850 
hundred or a thousand downloads of the
game<00:05:13.099> will<00:05:13.339> probably<00:05:13.849> then<00:05:14.499> expand<00:05:15.499> it<00:05:15.679> make

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
game will probably then expand it make

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.259 
game will probably then expand it make
it<00:05:15.979> a<00:05:16.039> bit<00:05:16.159> bigger<00:05:16.429> because<00:05:16.759> right<00:05:17.059> now<00:05:17.089> it's

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:17.269 
it a bit bigger because right now it's

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:20.290 
it a bit bigger because right now it's
quite<00:05:17.419> small<00:05:18.009> so<00:05:19.009> it's<00:05:19.429> really<00:05:19.610> if<00:05:19.819> people

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
quite small so it's really if people

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.149 
quite small so it's really if people
respond<00:05:20.689> and<00:05:20.869> like<00:05:21.019> it<00:05:21.229> like<00:05:21.649> the<00:05:21.769> concept

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
respond and like it like the concept

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.079 
respond and like it like the concept
will<00:05:22.429> make<00:05:23.089> it<00:05:23.240> bigger<00:05:23.509> better<00:05:23.839> and<00:05:24.580> a<00:05:25.580> bit

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:26.089 
will make it bigger better and a bit

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:27.609 
will make it bigger better and a bit
more<00:05:26.209> broader<00:05:26.479> as<00:05:26.719> well<00:05:26.869> we<00:05:27.019> can<00:05:27.139> seduce<00:05:27.409> me

00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:27.619 
more broader as well we can seduce me

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:31.029 
more broader as well we can seduce me
you<00:05:27.740> get<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:27.949> really<00:05:28.249> quite<00:05:28.729> easily<00:05:30.039> attack

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
you get it really quite easily attack
