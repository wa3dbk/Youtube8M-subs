pro audial and back with you talking

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.300 
pro audial and back with you talking
about<00:00:18.060> loudspeakers<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.040> the<00:00:20.100> things

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
about loudspeakers and one of the things

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.339 
about loudspeakers and one of the things
we<00:00:20.430> get<00:00:20.520> asked<00:00:20.849> a<00:00:20.910> lot<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.360> about<00:00:21.599> impedance

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
we get asked a lot is about impedance

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.380 
we get asked a lot is about impedance
what's<00:00:22.740> impedance<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.610> how<00:00:23.790> does<00:00:23.849> that<00:00:24.000> refer

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
what's impedance and how does that refer

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
what's impedance and how does that refer
to<00:00:24.509> a<00:00:24.540> loudspeaker<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.290> an<00:00:25.619> amplifier

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
to a loudspeaker and an amplifier

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.900 
to a loudspeaker and an amplifier
well<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.270> impedance<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.910> resistance

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
well the impedance is the resistance

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
well the impedance is the resistance
that<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.270> loudspeaker<00:00:30.960> presents<00:00:31.770> or<00:00:31.980> gives

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that the loudspeaker presents or gives

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.250 
that the loudspeaker presents or gives
to<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.850> amplifier<00:00:33.120> through<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> speaker

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.750 
to an amplifier through the speaker
cable<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:36.270> can't<00:00:37.079> hook<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.470> in<00:00:38.040> general<00:00:38.579> a

much the amplifier thinks it's running

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
much the amplifier thinks it's running
into<00:01:12.600> what's<00:01:12.810> called<00:01:12.899> a<00:01:13.200> dead<00:01:13.439> short<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.130> other

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
into what's called a dead short in other

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.160 
into what's called a dead short in other
words<00:01:14.850> you've<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.360> too<00:01:15.570> much<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.990> load

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
words you've just got too much of a load

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920 
words you've just got too much of a load
on<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> amplifier<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.460> overheats<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> quits

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
on the amplifier it overheats and quits

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
on the amplifier it overheats and quits
working<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> mind<00:01:21.030> your

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
working so you have to mind your

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.180 
working so you have to mind your
impedance<00:01:21.840> when<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> match<00:01:22.470> loudspeakers

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
impedance when you match loudspeakers

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.300 
impedance when you match loudspeakers
and<00:01:23.310> amplifiers<00:01:24.110> usually<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.680> loudspeakers

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and amplifiers usually for loudspeakers

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.990 
and amplifiers usually for loudspeakers
are<00:01:26.460> less<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.090> amplifier<00:01:27.570> channel<00:01:28.820> so<00:01:29.820> with

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
are less on an amplifier channel so with

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
are less on an amplifier channel so with
impedance<00:01:30.479> impedance<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.290> measured<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.890> ohms

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
impedance impedance is measured in ohms

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
impedance impedance is measured in ohms
so<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.330> you<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.600> an<00:01:33.720> amplifier<00:01:34.229> that's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
so when you see an amplifier that's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.510 
so when you see an amplifier that's
rated<00:01:35.010> at<00:01:35.270> 400<00:01:36.270> watts<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.810> 4<00:01:37.170> ohms<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:38.310> that's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
rated at 400 watts at 4 ohms what that's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.330 
rated at 400 watts at 4 ohms what that's
telling<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.990> 2<00:01:40.440> 8<00:01:40.799> ohm
