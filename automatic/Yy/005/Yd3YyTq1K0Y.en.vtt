00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.080 

okay<00:00:04.800> the<00:00:04.950> rolling<00:00:05.250> invert<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:05.760> one<00:00:05.939> of<00:00:06.000> the

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.090 
okay the rolling invert is one of the

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.700 
okay the rolling invert is one of the
most<00:00:07.220> basic<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.730> all<00:00:09.000> contact<00:00:09.630> maneuvers<00:00:10.110> you

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
most basic of all contact maneuvers you

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.820 
most basic of all contact maneuvers you
can<00:00:10.889> see<00:00:11.130> here<00:00:11.550> where<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.600> keep<00:00:13.050> it<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.260> contact

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
can see here where I keep it in contact

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.189 
can see here where I keep it in contact
with<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.280> hand<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:17.180> basically<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.779> let<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
with my hand and basically you let it

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
with my hand and basically you let it
roll<00:00:19.409> across<00:00:19.650> your<00:00:19.949> fingers<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.669> turn

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
roll across your fingers as you turn

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.540 
roll across your fingers as you turn
your<00:00:21.630> hand<00:00:21.839> up<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.409> that<00:00:22.949> should<00:00:23.159> send<00:00:23.429> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
your hand up and that should send the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.970 
your hand up and that should send the
handle<00:00:24.089> rolling<00:00:24.749> down<00:00:25.079> your<00:00:25.349> palm

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
handle rolling down your palm

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.489 
handle rolling down your palm
as<00:00:26.429> the<00:00:26.699> blade<00:00:26.909> falls<00:00:27.329> forward<00:00:27.720> naturally<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
as the blade falls forward naturally and

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.439 
as the blade falls forward naturally and
if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.679> chase<00:00:29.009> it<00:00:29.039> you'll<00:00:29.880> end<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.149> catching

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
if you chase it you'll end up catching

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.190 
if you chase it you'll end up catching
it<00:00:32.120> there<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> rolling<00:00:33.810> invert

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it there you have the rolling invert

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.799 
it there you have the rolling invert
from<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.760> head-on<00:00:35.760> view<00:00:35.789> which<00:00:36.390> makes<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.750> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
from a head-on view which makes it a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
from a head-on view which makes it a
little<00:00:36.899> easier<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.379> see<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.859> also<00:00:38.039> get<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> see

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
little easier to see you also get to see

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
little easier to see you also get to see
the<00:00:38.670> reverse<00:00:39.329> where<00:00:39.719> pretty<00:00:39.989> much<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> just

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the reverse where pretty much you just

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.889 
the reverse where pretty much you just
open<00:00:40.829> your<00:00:40.920> hand<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.250> flip<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.699> back<00:00:41.940> over<00:00:42.210> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
open your hand and flip it back over it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.479 
open your hand and flip it back over it
doesn't<00:00:43.199> take<00:00:43.289> a<00:00:43.320> rocket<00:00:43.410> science<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.190> figure

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
doesn't take a rocket science to figure

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.840 
doesn't take a rocket science to figure
it<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.210> pretty<00:00:45.690> simple<00:00:46.550> from<00:00:47.550> another

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it out it's pretty simple from another

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.669 
it out it's pretty simple from another
angle<00:00:48.179> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> reversing<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
angle you can see that reversing back to

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.650 
angle you can see that reversing back to
a<00:00:49.710> forward<00:00:50.039> grip<00:00:50.370> has<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> lot<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.120> common<00:00:51.390> with

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a forward grip has a lot in common with

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.779 
a forward grip has a lot in common with
a<00:00:51.719> palm<00:00:51.989> spin<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.739> started<00:00:53.129> spinning<00:00:53.339> outward

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
a palm spin you started spinning outward

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.340 
a palm spin you started spinning outward
away<00:00:53.969> from<00:00:54.179> the<00:00:54.269> body<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:54.839> catch<00:00:55.109> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
away from the body and then catch it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.329 
away from the body and then catch it
when<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.589> returns<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.249> a<00:00:56.280> forward<00:00:56.760> grip<00:00:58.339> pretty

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
when it returns to a forward grip pretty

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.930 
when it returns to a forward grip pretty
yeah<00:00:59.609> straight<00:01:00.120> forward<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:02.579> comes<00:01:02.820> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
yeah straight forward it comes to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
yeah straight forward it comes to
contact<00:01:03.449> moves<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.839> trigger<00:01:04.050> flips<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.620> as

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
contact moves the trigger flips about as

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
contact moves the trigger flips about as
basic<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.370> gets

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
basic as it gets

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.070 
basic as it gets
essentially<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.480> start<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:06.960> your

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
essentially you start with your

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.680 
essentially you start with your
fingertips<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.830> ahead<00:01:08.730> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> cross<00:01:09.420> guard

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
fingertips just ahead of the cross guard

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.870 
fingertips just ahead of the cross guard
of<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.930> knife<00:01:10.110> start<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.190> blade<00:01:11.430> tumbling

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of your knife start to blade tumbling

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.950 
of your knife start to blade tumbling
forward<00:01:12.180> chase<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.250> around<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.450> catch

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
forward chase it up and around and catch

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.550 
forward chase it up and around and catch
it<00:01:16.820> here's<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.060> forward<00:01:18.720> took<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> flip<00:01:19.260> at

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it here's the forward took a flip at

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.650 
it here's the forward took a flip at
another<00:01:20.340> angle<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> make<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.510> little

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
another angle just to make it a little

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.780 
another angle just to make it a little
more<00:01:21.810> clear

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.090 

the<00:01:26.690> reverse<00:01:27.020> turn<00:01:27.350> flip<00:01:27.590> well<00:01:27.830> it's

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
the reverse turn flip well it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.370 
the reverse turn flip well it's
essentially<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.030> opposite<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.990> forward

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
essentially the opposite of a forward

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.860 
essentially the opposite of a forward
trigger<00:01:30.620> flip<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.670> really<00:01:32.030> isn't<00:01:32.300> quite<00:01:32.690> the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
trigger flip it really isn't quite the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.270 
trigger flip it really isn't quite the
same<00:01:33.110> because<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.710> fact<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:34.160> have

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
same because of the fact that you have

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.250 
same because of the fact that you have
to<00:01:34.370> move<00:01:34.520> your<00:01:34.640> finger<00:01:35.030> down<00:01:35.330> on<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.990> blade

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
to move your finger down on the blade

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260 
to move your finger down on the blade
give<00:01:36.590> your<00:01:36.800> handle<00:01:37.190> some<00:01:37.370> extra<00:01:37.850> weight<00:01:38.090> and

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
give your handle some extra weight and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.480 
give your handle some extra weight and
it<00:01:38.510> does<00:01:38.720> take<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:38.990> bit<00:01:39.080> more<00:01:39.530> force<00:01:39.920> to<00:01:40.010> start

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
it does take a bit more force to start

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.230 
it does take a bit more force to start
the<00:01:40.610> blade<00:01:40.820> rolling<00:01:42.850> you<00:01:43.850> can<00:01:43.910> pretty<00:01:44.150> much

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the blade rolling you can pretty much

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.340 
the blade rolling you can pretty much
see<00:01:44.570> what<00:01:44.660> I'm<00:01:44.750> talking<00:01:45.110> about

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
see what I'm talking about

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.450 
see what I'm talking about
I'm<00:01:45.770> sure<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:48.140> style<00:01:48.500> invert<00:01:48.980> is<00:01:49.130> one<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.370> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
I'm sure the style invert is one of the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.520 
I'm sure the style invert is one of the
trickier<00:01:49.880> contact<00:01:50.510> moves<00:01:50.780> because<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.380> have

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
trickier contact moves because you have

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.040 
trickier contact moves because you have
to<00:01:51.680> develop<00:01:52.070> an<00:01:52.160> extreme<00:01:52.850> sensitivity<00:01:53.660> with

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
to develop an extreme sensitivity with

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.440 
to develop an extreme sensitivity with
your<00:01:54.260> blade<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:55.430> essentially<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.120> turn<00:01:56.300> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
your blade but essentially you turn the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.480 
your blade but essentially you turn the
blade<00:01:56.690> toward<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.260> inside<00:01:57.680> of<00:01:57.830> your<00:01:57.920> body<00:01:58.190> and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
blade toward the inside of your body and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.950 
blade toward the inside of your body and
as<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.570> release<00:01:59.870> it<00:02:00.250> you<00:02:01.570> guide<00:02:02.570> your<00:02:02.810> hand

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
as you release it you guide your hand
