and I've been working forever since you
think<00:01:18.930> maybe<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:19.799> you've<00:01:19.979> been

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
think maybe just because you've been

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.230 
think maybe just because you've been
actually<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> connect

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
actually like the connect

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
actually like the connect
industry<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.320> point<00:01:22.470> probably<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
industry up to that point probably it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.889 
industry up to that point probably it
certainly<00:01:23.520> didn't<00:01:23.820> pommel<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.210> trust<00:01:24.509> yeah

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
certainly didn't pommel of trust yeah

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.899 
certainly didn't pommel of trust yeah
and<00:01:25.140> also<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.829> fact<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.159> new<00:01:26.280> lands<00:01:26.700> which
