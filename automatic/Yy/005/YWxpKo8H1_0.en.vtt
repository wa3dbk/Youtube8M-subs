00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.830
 this box of small bricks are 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 sold around the world every second and 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.940
 each year it's 19 billion 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.889
 small items that are made and if 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
 in this factory who have the assemblies 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.820
 we could go around five times 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.039
 land tour with pm 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.630
 christiansen the man who knows one 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.630
 radius on the small brick 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.150
 she 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.830
 for a perfect scramble 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.170
 you need a material that is both flexible and 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.860
 heavy duty truck is sucked 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.869
 by pipes 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.960
 it is a very special plastic 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.850
 which since 1963 replaces the acetate of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.220
 cellulose the raw material itself 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.870
 present in the form of granules 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.270
 the outside the truck dumped 25 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.520
 tons of plastic in each silo the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.100
 plastic called abs comes under 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.780
 form of grain and is transferred via its 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.559
 ears that match yes 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.080
 basic colors 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.730
 in fact we have fifty six colors but 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.750
 we mix the bases to have 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.940
 specific colors and then following 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.769
 it goes through these pipes the system of 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.979
 pipes as you see goes through the 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.690
 ceilings they are scattered at the level of 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.550
 all the production machinery is 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.690
 directed according to the types of products that 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.210
 you want to once suck with 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.680
 one of the 770 molding machines 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.650
 granules are melted at a temperature 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.909
 of 230 degrees so the material 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.250
 then looks like a paw of 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.720
 toothpaste 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.670
 knowing that there are two thousand and four 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.440
 hundred different elements the chain of 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.510
 production has many mold 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.300
 who will make from the smallest to the smallest 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.640
 large object the molds are metal 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.609
 very heavy and exerts a pressure of 25 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.600
 to 150 tons according to 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:47.359
 brain all work the same 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.929
 way or almost because in the case of these 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.000
 two machines 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.380
 there is waste that is the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.100
 ties between the elements when this 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.459
 is not in us the brick and the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.229
 surplus is returned to a tube that 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.479
 leads to a machine and that makes it 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.509
 tiny pieces then it's remelted 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.890
 and reintegrated into the dough that will serve 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.629
 the products result very little waste 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.299
 since there is a recycling system 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.920
 however there is a small percentage of 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.209
 lost plastic when cleaning 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.440
 machines to change the color by 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.799
 example on the entire production 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.650
 we have waste of 0 4% 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.209
 materials that can not be reused 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.040
 it is resold for other fabrications 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.859
 who uses materials that can 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.620
 to be heated but back to our 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.750
 bricks or the head this is this name after 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.730
 to have been hit they are chilled 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.239
 on a tatoo and then fall into 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.269
 bins 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.459
 here everything is automated 2 or 3 people 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.349
 on the whole mold factory is taking care 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.150
 of maintenance for the rest it's a 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.609
 programmed robot that takes care of everything 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.829
 when four multicolored corbils are 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.900
 filled an automatic trolley receives 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.430
 the signal and the landmarks he takes them 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.880
 to treadmills for a long 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.489
 trip 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.709
 direction a gigantic warehouse where 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.730
 other robots worthy of a movie of 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.769
 science fiction the classes in this 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.769
 piece one can store 110 thousand boxes 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.269
 in total you can store 424 thousand 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.650
 billboxes the mechanical arm can 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.780
 go get baskets store 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.700
 up to 22 meters high and well 4 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.370
 these robots that works at the pace of 9 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.990
 km hour have two functions it stores 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.280
 the woods and we recover others 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.070
 for export 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.680
 these machines acted on command spotted the 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.450
 Avens through labels she scans 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.040
 the barcode and know the type 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.110
 element enclosed in the trash 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.830
 by the way the color of the box has 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.390
 also its importance the place of the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.850
 boyne only fits the size 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.160
 elements if the elements are small 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.900
 but very heavy it's a small box 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.209
 green that can not pose more than 20 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.100
 kilos then there are elements like 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.930
 tires that are larger is 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.730
 lighter they will then be stored in 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.640
 the largest yellow boxes but 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.200
 the weight is also 20 kg and it's 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.510
 gone for different factories 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.709
 assembly in mexico poland or 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.709
 still in Czech Republic 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.739
 everything you see here is going to be 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.299
 stored on trucks each 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.910
 container will be transported by boat 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.250
 to mexico or to hamburg then by 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.720
 trains all over europe and of course we 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.880
 also has other boxes that will be 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.870
 directed to the other billund on 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.120
 will decorate and pack the pieces and 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.190
 here we are here that the thousands 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.930
 of elements will therefore be assembled a 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.729
 meticulous work especially when 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.360
 are tiny pieces like 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.360
 small hands 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.740
 hands and arms attached 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.509
 together directly just so that 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.919
 children can not tear them away 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:54.930
 elements are so small the 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.669
 children must then assembled 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.930
 the trunk and legs but the arms and 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.159
 hands are mechanically assembled 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.710
 the figurines as we know them 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.740
 today high of 4 cm with bright 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.569
 mobile people appear in 1978 she 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.050
 then displays that little smiley face 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.459
 with the appearance of the pirate in 1989 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.050
 the little men traditionally 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:20.669
 yellow inherits a new series 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.379
 of expressions because we 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.149
 do not belong to any race 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.740
 religion is sir everyone 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.809
 that represents the majority of the 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.759
 population in the world these little 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:32.240
 characters does not look like anyone's 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.349
 specific on earth they are common 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.039
 with the introduction of series 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.449
 themes 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.699
 we introduce the skin color in 99 the 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.800
 first mini white head is luke 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.240
 skywalker and the first black is 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.240
 michael jordan in 2002 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.270
 and the expressions are declined to infinity 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.430
 nothing simpler than they are 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.870
 stamped on the head the decorations of 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.729
 clothes are also made using 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.250
 cash is automatic and verified by 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.509
 the eye of an expert and while our 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.310
 good men look good 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.139
 bricks or other small parts 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.970
 will be assembled for the confection 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.199
 boxes 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.030
 first of all the different parts 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:13.520
 selected arrives in a machine 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.500
 who brings them together but watch out if all 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.169
 seems automated it does not prevent that the 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:21.490
 human touch remains important because the 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.490
 robot can sometimes be wrong 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.569
 this lady checks the packages 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.759
 prepackaged apparently a sachet was 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.900
 too heavy there are five points of 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.610
 control along the line 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.860
 assembly and the computer that's 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.349
 exactly at which level an element of 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.090
 too much has been introduced now she 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:41.970
 check all the content to spot 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.620
 the intruder she removes it and reintroduced 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.690
 the modified set in the line of 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.860
 production 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.479
 when all the little packs stuffed 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.759
 pieces are sealed they are assembled 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.680
 in the same box without having forgotten at 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.509
 beforehand or slip the instructions for use 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.240
 to be able to build more easily 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:59.039
 a rowing a vessel last 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.930
 routine checks history that 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.669
 saint nicolas are not victims of 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.009
 claim because of bad 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:07.440
 surprises in order to pack and send 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.690
 around the world 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.610
 because with all these pieces there are 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.610
 really enough to lose your head 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.610
 at
