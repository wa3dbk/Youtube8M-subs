various ordeals to overcome but not much

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.620 
various ordeals to overcome but not much
in<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> way<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.100> roleplay<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:31.730> hear<00:02:32.730> people<00:02:33.240> say

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
in the way of roleplay I hear people say

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.600 
in the way of roleplay I hear people say
that<00:02:34.080> Dungeons<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.740> Dragons<00:02:34.770> was<00:02:35.250> mostly

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that Dungeons and Dragons was mostly

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.730 
that Dungeons and Dragons was mostly
about<00:02:35.760> going<00:02:36.270> into<00:02:36.420> dungeons<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.140> killing

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
about going into dungeons and killing

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.000 
about going into dungeons and killing
monsters<00:02:38.510> more<00:02:39.510> than<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.140> was<00:02:40.170> about<00:02:40.410> going

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
monsters more than it was about going

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.800 
monsters more than it was about going
around<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.370> city<00:02:41.550> interacting<00:02:42.510> with<00:02:42.660> people

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
around a city interacting with people

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.780 
around a city interacting with people
that<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.290> that's<00:02:43.800> not<00:02:44.070> necessarily<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.610> case

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that and that's not necessarily the case

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.430 
that and that's not necessarily the case
because<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.210> old-school<00:02:45.810> Dungeons<00:02:46.260> and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
because the old-school Dungeons and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.070 
because the old-school Dungeons and
Dragons<00:02:46.470> books<00:02:47.220> did<00:02:47.820> encourage<00:02:48.300> role<00:02:48.720> play

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
Dragons books did encourage role play

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.140 
Dragons books did encourage role play
but<00:02:49.830> that's<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.430> necessarily<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.940> way

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
but that's not necessarily the way

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.950 
but that's not necessarily the way
people<00:02:51.450> did<00:02:51.930> play<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.180> always<00:02:54.750> used<00:02:54.900> to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
people did play and so I always used to

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.880 
people did play and so I always used to
think<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.260> old<00:02:55.440> school<00:02:55.890> gaming<00:02:56.480> was<00:02:57.890> dungeon

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
think the old school gaming was dungeon

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.480 
think the old school gaming was dungeon

based approach you just get sent off
somewhere<00:03:27.930> let's<00:03:28.230> say<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.470> get<00:03:28.920> sent<00:03:29.100> off<00:03:29.250> to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
somewhere let's say you get sent off to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
a different planet in warhammer by fact

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.720 
a different planet in warhammer by fact
there<00:03:33.690> wasn't<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.050> 40,000<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.250> role-playing

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
there wasn't a 40,000 a role-playing

there wasn't a 40,000 a role-playing
game<00:03:35.760> back<00:03:36.270> then<00:03:36.300> let's<00:03:37.170> say<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.440> get<00:03:37.620> sent

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
game back then let's say you get sent

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.780 
game back then let's say you get sent
off<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> distant<00:03:38.310> land<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:40.519> deal<00:03:41.519> with

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
off to a distant land and you deal with

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.190 
off to a distant land and you deal with
your<00:03:41.910> deal<00:03:42.150> there<00:03:42.330> come<00:03:42.630> back<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.019> then<00:03:43.110> you

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
your deal there come back and then you

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.830 
your deal there come back and then you
set<00:03:43.380> off<00:03:43.500> somewhere<00:03:43.890> else<00:03:44.040> my<00:03:44.640> point<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.239> my

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
set off somewhere else my point is my

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.410 
set off somewhere else my point is my
idea<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.500> old-school<00:03:47.459> gaming<00:03:47.820> was<00:03:48.150> never

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
really that there was a lot of role

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.370 
really that there was a lot of role
playing<00:03:50.220> in<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:51.600> I'm<00:03:51.750> not<00:03:51.930> picking<00:03:52.110> that
