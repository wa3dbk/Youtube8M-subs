00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
talked about traditional and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.680 
talked about traditional and
non-traditional<00:00:19.119> intersections<00:00:20.119> but<00:00:20.480> there

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
non-traditional intersections but there

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.859 
non-traditional intersections but there
are<00:00:20.750> also<00:00:20.960> controlled<00:00:21.770> and<00:00:22.100> uncontrolled

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
here we'll see how this type of

here we'll see how this type of
intersection<00:01:25.850> works<00:01:26.360> as<00:01:27.460> I<00:01:28.460> approach<00:01:28.760> this

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
intersection works as I approach this

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.300 
intersection works as I approach this
intersection<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.900> immediately<00:01:30.530> recognize

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
intersection I immediately recognize

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.340 
intersection I immediately recognize
this<00:01:31.580> as<00:01:31.790> an<00:01:31.909> uncontrolled<00:01:32.350> intersection

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
this as an uncontrolled intersection

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.370 
this as an uncontrolled intersection
because<00:01:33.950> there<00:01:34.790> was<00:01:34.970> no<00:01:35.180> traffic<00:01:35.510> sign<00:01:36.049> or

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
because there was no traffic sign or

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.359 
because there was no traffic sign or
traffic<00:01:37.100> light<00:01:37.390> posted<00:01:38.390> here<00:01:38.780> nor<00:01:39.650> was<00:01:40.159> there

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
traffic light posted here nor was there

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.880 
traffic light posted here nor was there
any<00:01:40.490> type<00:01:40.759> of<00:01:40.790> traffic<00:01:41.450> signal<00:01:41.900> that<00:01:42.380> came<00:01:42.680> up

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
any type of traffic signal that came up

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.670 
any type of traffic signal that came up
or<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.159> cross<00:01:43.970> over<00:01:44.240> here<00:01:44.689> containing<00:01:45.259> red

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
or a cross over here containing red

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.320 
or a cross over here containing red
lights<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.280> green<00:01:46.520> lights<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.030> all<00:01:47.119> that

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
lights and green lights and all that

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.590 
lights and green lights and all that
stuff<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.189> typical<00:01:49.600> uncontrolled

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
stuff so this is a typical uncontrolled

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.620 
stuff so this is a typical uncontrolled
intersection<00:01:51.320> now<00:01:52.100> I've<00:01:52.670> pulled<00:01:53.090> into<00:01:53.509> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
intersection now I've pulled into the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.530 
intersection now I've pulled into the
left<00:01:53.900> lane<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:55.369> I'm<00:01:55.579> wanting<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.000> make<00:01:56.180> a<00:01:56.210> left

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
left lane so I'm wanting to make a left

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.600 
left lane so I'm wanting to make a left
here<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.500> what<00:01:57.890> do<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.040> do

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
here so what do I do

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.410 
here so what do I do
well<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.060> must<00:01:59.900> first<00:02:00.350> yield<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.640> all<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.150> cars

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
well I must first yield to all the cars

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.300 
well I must first yield to all the cars

I would like to go back and look at that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.850 
I would like to go back and look at that
exact<00:03:11.820> same<00:03:12.090> intersection<00:03:12.900> from<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.650> different

perspective from the driveway that I
pulled<00:03:16.560> into<00:03:16.770> looking<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.300> bigger

pulled into looking on to the bigger

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.140 
pulled into looking on to the bigger
Street<00:03:19.080> there's<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.010> fundamental<00:03:20.430> rule<00:03:20.880> that's

Street there's a fundamental rule that's

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.420 
Street there's a fundamental rule that's
true<00:03:21.480> about<00:03:21.690> yielding<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.650> right-of-way<00:03:23.100> and

true about yielding and right-of-way and

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.360 
true about yielding and right-of-way and
that<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.060> smaller<00:03:24.480> street<00:03:25.050> or<00:03:25.370> driveway

for it but it's when you stop in this at
this<00:04:55.260> point<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.800> road<00:04:56.479> that<00:04:57.479> you<00:04:57.900> create

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
this point of the road that you create

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.110 
this point of the road that you create
problems<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:58.950> it<00:04:59.040> could<00:04:59.250> become<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.640> ticket

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
problems and it could become a ticket

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.000 
problems and it could become a ticket
because<00:05:00.479> then<00:05:00.900> you're<00:05:01.080> sort<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.380> obstructing

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
because then you're sort of obstructing

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.640 
because then you're sort of obstructing
the<00:05:02.130> flow<00:05:02.160> of<00:05:02.370> traffic<00:05:02.900> now<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.169> you're<00:05:04.620> just

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
the flow of traffic now if you're just

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.480 
the flow of traffic now if you're just
going<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.070> make<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> right-hand<00:05:05.760> turn<00:05:06.410> onto

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
going to make a right-hand turn onto

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.210 
going to make a right-hand turn onto
this<00:05:08.490> road<00:05:08.790> then<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.870> key<00:05:10.080> areas<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.590> look<00:05:11.010> of

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
this road then the key areas to look of

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.030 
this road then the key areas to look of
course<00:05:11.760> are<00:05:11.940> going<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.120> be<00:05:12.180> down<00:05:12.450> here<00:05:12.510> all<00:05:13.080> of

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
course are going to be down here all of

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.279 
course are going to be down here all of
you<00:05:14.160> do<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.550> really<00:05:14.729> well<00:05:15.080> but<00:05:16.080> then

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
you do that really well but then

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.720 
you do that really well but then
sometimes<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:17.460> guy<00:05:17.820> makes<00:05:18.450> a<00:05:18.630> u-turn

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
sometimes this guy makes a u-turn

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.080 
sometimes this guy makes a u-turn
so<00:05:20.420> you've<00:05:20.600> got<00:05:20.780> to<00:05:20.930> check<00:05:20.990> both<00:05:21.470> areas<00:05:22.130> before

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
so you've got to check both areas before

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.810 
so you've got to check both areas before
you<00:05:23.660> can<00:05:23.840> successfully<00:05:24.490> cautiously<00:05:25.490> make

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
you can successfully cautiously make

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.870 
you can successfully cautiously make
that<00:05:26.090> right-hand<00:05:26.390> turn<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:27.520> these<00:05:28.520> are<00:05:28.730> the

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
that right-hand turn and these are the

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.270 
that right-hand turn and these are the
basic<00:05:29.390> rules<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.870> yielding<00:05:30.530> and<00:05:30.710> right-of-way

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
basic rules to yielding and right-of-way

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.960 
basic rules to yielding and right-of-way
when<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.090> comes<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.740> car<00:05:33.740> pulling<00:05:34.580> on<00:05:34.700> to<00:05:34.940> a

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
when it comes to a car pulling on to a

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.000 
when it comes to a car pulling on to a
major<00:05:35.330> road<00:05:35.720> or<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:36.020> bigger<00:05:36.260> Road<00:05:36.590> from<00:05:36.890> a

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
major road or a bigger Road from a

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:51.030 
major road or a bigger Road from a
smaller<00:05:37.340> road

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040
