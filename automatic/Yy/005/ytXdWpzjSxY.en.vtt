00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.699 

today<00:00:00.630> we're<00:00:00.900> showing<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.319> tweak<00:00:01.680> called

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
today we're showing you a tweak called

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.999 
today we're showing you a tweak called
watch<00:00:02.280> board<00:00:02.639> so<00:00:03.510> what<00:00:03.899> this<00:00:04.020> does<00:00:04.230> is<00:00:04.529> it

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
watch board so what this does is it

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.519 
watch board so what this does is it
brings<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.520> Apple<00:00:05.970> watch<00:00:06.089> UI<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.350> home

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
brings the Apple watch UI to the home

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.970 
brings the Apple watch UI to the home
screen<00:00:08.210> so<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.540> quite<00:00:09.750> similar<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.410> a

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
screen so this is quite similar to a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.860 
screen so this is quite similar to a
couple<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.519> other<00:00:11.610> tweaks<00:00:11.969> I've<00:00:12.269> been<00:00:12.480> out<00:00:12.630> so

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
couple of other tweaks I've been out so

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.790 
couple of other tweaks I've been out so
such<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.769> Turnham<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.610> watch<00:00:15.509> spring<00:00:15.960> but

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
such as a Turnham and watch spring but

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.779 
such as a Turnham and watch spring but
this<00:00:16.920> one's<00:00:17.100> actually<00:00:17.279> made<00:00:17.550> by<00:00:17.580> two

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
this one's actually made by two

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.200 
this one's actually made by two
developed<00:00:18.270> by<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.720> developer<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.320> barrel<00:00:20.210> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
developed by the developer of barrel so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
developed by the developer of barrel so
this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> reason<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.710> downloaded

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
this is this is the reason I downloaded

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.089 
this is this is the reason I downloaded
this<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:24.630> definitely<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:26.070> really

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
this one and is definitely really really

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.089 
this one and is definitely really really
cool<00:00:26.660> at<00:00:27.660> tournament<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.560> some<00:00:28.740> errors

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
cool at tournament it have some errors

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.040 
cool at tournament it have some errors
which<00:00:29.279> not<00:00:29.519> showing<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.060> some<00:00:30.269> devices<00:00:30.599> but

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
which not showing up on some devices but

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.630 
which not showing up on some devices but
this<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.439> happened<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.830> any<00:00:32.040> problems<00:00:32.489> with

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this one happened at any problems with

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.990 
this one happened at any problems with
so<00:00:33.230> yeah<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.440> recommend<00:00:35.010> using<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.610> over

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so yeah I recommend using this one over

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900 
so yeah I recommend using this one over
a<00:00:36.030> Turnham<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.219> yeah<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> shows<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:38.879> your

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
a Turnham but yeah so it shows all your

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.260 
a Turnham but yeah so it shows all your
apps<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.170> Apple<00:00:40.469> watch<00:00:40.590> UI<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:42.090> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
apps as like the Apple watch UI you can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.080 
apps as like the Apple watch UI you can
zoom<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.629> now<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.190> launch<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.940> apps

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
zoom in now and you can launch the apps

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750 
zoom in now and you can launch the apps
obviously<00:00:45.690> very<00:00:46.200> easily<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.340> go<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
obviously very easily if we go into the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.560 
obviously very easily if we go into the
settings<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.450> actually<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:49.020> some<00:00:49.410> sense<00:00:50.100> for

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
settings you actually get some sense for

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.970 
settings you actually get some sense for
watch<00:00:51.570> board<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.190> scroll<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:54.980> whereas

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
watch board so if we scroll down whereas

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
watch board so if we scroll down whereas
it<00:00:56.070> watch<00:00:56.250> board<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.750> basically

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it watch board and you can basically

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.020 
it watch board and you can basically
enable<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.680> disable<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.309> which<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.640> quite<00:00:59.850> cool

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
enable or disable it which is quite cool

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
enable or disable it which is quite cool
so<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.329> won't<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.870> keep

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so you won't have to like keep

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
so you won't have to like keep
reinstalling<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.010> tweak<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.430> delete<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
reinstalling the tweak or delete in it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.149 
reinstalling the tweak or delete in it
if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.769> turn

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
if you don't want to use it you can turn

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.490 
if you don't want to use it you can turn
off<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> circle<00:01:05.939> icons<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.350> turn

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
off the circle icons and you can turn

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.750 
off the circle icons and you can turn
off<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.750> icon<00:01:09.750> labels<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
off the icon labels so so that it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280 
off the icon labels so so that it
wouldn't<00:01:11.939> say<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.750> icon<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
wouldn't say that what icon it is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
wouldn't say that what icon it is
underneath<00:01:13.619> which<00:01:14.430> M<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> actual<00:01:15.330> Apple

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
underneath which M on the actual Apple

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.149 
underneath which M on the actual Apple
watch<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.840> can't<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.950> names

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
watch you can't actually see the names

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.940 
watch you can't actually see the names
of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> icons<00:01:17.900> so<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.259> might<00:01:19.439> try<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.650> layer

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
of the icons so I might try that layer

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
of the icons so I might try that layer
and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> icon<00:01:21.299> spacing<00:01:21.479> now

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and then you can do the icon spacing now

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.210 
and then you can do the icon spacing now
I'm<00:01:22.229> not<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.470> sure<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I'm not really sure I don't think you

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
I'm not really sure I don't think you
need<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.400> respring<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.810> gonna

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
need to respring for this so I'm gonna

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.649 
need to respring for this so I'm gonna
see<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.640> don't<00:01:26.880> need<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> respring<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
see now you don't need a respring so it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.240 
see now you don't need a respring so it
does<00:01:27.840> take<00:01:28.110> effect<00:01:28.470> instantly<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
does take effect instantly which is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.960 
does take effect instantly which is
really<00:01:29.579> cool

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
really cool

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.960 
really cool
turn<00:01:30.720> off<00:01:30.840> circle<00:01:31.350> icons<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.759> see

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
turn off circle icons as you can see

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
turn off circle icons as you can see
we've<00:01:33.210> got<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.479> normal<00:01:33.860> iOS<00:01:34.860> icons<00:01:36.890> show<00:01:37.890> icon

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
we've got the normal iOS icons show icon

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.420 
we've got the normal iOS icons show icon
labels<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:40.259> icon<00:01:40.650> labels<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.100> gone

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
labels the icon labels are gone

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.569 
labels the icon labels are gone
so<00:01:41.820> I'd<00:01:42.299> say<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.170> make<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.350> look<00:01:43.649> most<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so I'd say to make it look most like the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.690 
so I'd say to make it look most like the
Apple<00:01:44.880> watch<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.869> would<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.280> with

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
Apple watch it would look like this with

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.289 
Apple watch it would look like this with
icon<00:01:48.119> labels<00:01:48.450> off<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.899> circle<00:01:50.000> icons<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
icon labels off and circle icons and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.609 
icon labels off and circle icons and
maybe<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.500> even<00:01:52.920> closer<00:01:53.280> together<00:01:53.610> so

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
maybe there be even closer together so
