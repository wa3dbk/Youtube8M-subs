right<00:01:19.719> okay<00:01:20.170> why<00:01:20.320> do<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.500> want<00:01:20.649> to<00:01:20.710> do<00:01:20.799> that

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
right okay why do you want to do that

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.190 
right okay why do you want to do that
well<00:01:21.579> when<00:01:21.789> water<00:01:22.030> passes<00:01:22.570> through<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.049> hits

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
well when water passes through and hits

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.870 
well when water passes through and hits
that<00:01:23.289> Ridge<00:01:23.619> it'll<00:01:23.770> roll<00:01:24.070> it'll<00:01:24.490> make<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.640> lot

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
that Ridge it'll roll it'll make a lot

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.580 
that Ridge it'll roll it'll make a lot
of<00:01:24.909> noise<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.539> it<00:01:25.750> also<00:01:25.899> restricts<00:01:26.469> the<00:01:26.560> flow

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
of noise and it also restricts the flow

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.679 
of noise and it also restricts the flow
okay<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:27.700> how<00:01:27.820> much<00:01:27.939> would<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.149> tool<00:01:28.360> like<00:01:28.479> that

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
okay so how much would a tool like that

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.749 
okay so how much would a tool like that
cost<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.259> good<00:01:29.500> quality<00:01:29.890> tubing<00:01:30.340> cutter<00:01:30.520> such

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
cost a good quality tubing cutter such

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.010 
cost a good quality tubing cutter such

the valve or the fitting secure it by
hand<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:05.289> then

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
hand and then

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.560 
hand and then
deciding<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:08.040> a<00:02:08.130> crescent<00:02:08.460> wrench<00:02:08.570> okay

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
deciding it with a crescent wrench okay

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.910 
deciding it with a crescent wrench okay
now<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> fitting<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.710> as<00:02:10.800> good

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
now is that fitting going to be as good

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.100 
now is that fitting going to be as good
as<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> soldered<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.730> yes<00:02:12.570> it's<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:12.900> good

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
as if you soldered it yes it's as good

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.810 
as if you soldered it yes it's as good
its<00:02:13.350> water<00:02:13.590> tight<00:02:13.860> fitting<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
its water tight fitting but the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.730 
its water tight fitting but the
difference<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.660> can<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:16.020> disconnected

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
difference is this can be disconnected

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.530 
difference is this can be disconnected
