00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
in the dark which is more difficult but

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.069 
in the dark which is more difficult but
I<00:00:56.820> feel<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.300> could<00:00:57.480> teach<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.690> more

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
playing in the dark but usually if I'm

playing in the dark but usually if I'm
playing<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> dark<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.430> run<00:01:02.640> out

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
playing in the dark I'm going to run out

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.899 
playing in the dark I'm going to run out
of<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.180> nickel<00:01:03.600> formation<00:01:04.309> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> guys<00:01:05.580> don't

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
of a nickel formation if you guys don't

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.250 
of a nickel formation if you guys don't
know<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.299> that's<00:01:06.600> basically<00:01:06.810> where

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
know what that is that's basically where

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410 
know what that is that's basically where
you<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.409> five<00:01:07.920> defensive<00:01:08.430> backs<00:01:08.610> instead<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you have five defensive backs instead of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.760 
you have five defensive backs instead of
the<00:01:09.750> normal<00:01:10.170> four<00:01:11.689> so<00:01:12.689> instead<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.229> having<00:01:13.439> two

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the normal four so instead of having two

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
the normal four so instead of having two
corner<00:01:14.159> backs<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.580> two<00:01:14.729> safeties<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.900> have

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
corner backs and two safeties you have

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
corner backs and two safeties you have
three<00:01:16.530> corner<00:01:16.860> backs<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> two<00:01:17.369> safeties<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
three corner backs and two safeties or

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.890 
three corner backs and two safeties or
three<00:01:18.509> safeties<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> two<00:01:19.200> corner<00:01:19.500> backs<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
three safeties and two corner backs and

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.050 
three safeties and two corner backs and
I<00:01:21.900> guess<00:01:22.140> I'll<00:01:22.290> talk<00:01:22.409> about<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> play<00:01:23.189> art<00:01:23.430> so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
I guess I'll talk about the play art so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.039 
I guess I'll talk about the play art so
the<00:01:24.390> yellow<00:01:24.630> areas<00:01:25.380> are<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.009> flats<00:01:26.659> on<00:01:27.659> what

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the yellow areas are the flats on what

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.359 
the yellow areas are the flats on what
am<00:01:28.140> i<00:01:28.200> talking<00:01:28.439> about<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.740> yellow<00:01:28.979> areas<00:01:29.340> are

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
am i talking about the yellow areas are

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
am i talking about the yellow areas are
the<00:01:29.700> hooks<00:01:29.909> light<00:01:30.659> blue<00:01:30.869> areas<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> flats

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the hooks light blue areas are the flats

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.149 
the hooks light blue areas are the flats
and<00:01:32.280> my<00:01:33.210> colorblind<00:01:33.750> who<00:01:33.869> knows<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.650> purple

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and my colorblind who knows the purple

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
and my colorblind who knows the purple
areas<00:01:35.579> are<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.329> curl<00:01:36.750> flats<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> dark

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
areas are the curl flats and the dark

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
areas are the curl flats and the dark
blue<00:01:40.200> areas<00:01:40.710> are<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.280> deep<00:01:41.670> zones<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
blue areas are the deep zones so it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.370 
blue areas are the deep zones so it
doesn't<00:01:45.149> matter<00:01:45.329> what<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.720> call<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:46.110> plays

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
doesn't matter what you call your plays

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
doesn't matter what you call your plays
out<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.740> either<00:01:46.979> play<00:01:47.310> type<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.759> formation

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
out of either play type or formation

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:48.800 
out of either play type or formation
menu

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
menu

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.469 
menu
I<00:01:48.840> prefer<00:01:49.710> formation<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.939> makes<00:01:51.149> more

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I prefer formation because it makes more

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.780 
I prefer formation because it makes more
sense<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.930> me<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> my

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
sense to me and because I can get to my

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.460 
sense to me and because I can get to my
plays<00:01:54.060> faster<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:54.840> there's<00:01:55.079> obviously

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
plays faster because there's obviously

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.310 
plays faster because there's obviously
more<00:01:55.710> categories<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:59.689> usually<00:02:00.689> my<00:02:00.990> feel

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
more categories but usually my feel

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.969 
more categories but usually my feel
airplay<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.219> cover<00:02:02.490> three<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
airplay is a cover three because that is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.679 
airplay is a cover three because that is
more<00:02:05.219> safe<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.909> still<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.390> three

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
more safe because I still have three

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.820 
more safe because I still have three
deep<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.860> um<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.539> can<00:02:09.539> also<00:02:09.720> guard<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> middle

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
deep but um I can also guard the middle

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.850 
deep but um I can also guard the middle
relatively<00:02:11.760> well<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.870> here<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.230> looks<00:02:13.290> like

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
relatively well so here it looks like

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
relatively well so here it looks like
the<00:02:14.040> wrong<00:02:14.190> play<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.850> as<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.900> see<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.110> use

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the wrong play and as you can see I use

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.230 
the wrong play and as you can see I use
'red<00:02:16.590> my<00:02:16.740> linebacker<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.610> got<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:17.940> front<00:02:18.060> of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
'red my linebacker and I got in front of

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970 
'red my linebacker and I got in front of
that<00:02:18.330> pass<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.620> guys<00:02:19.740> want

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
that pass and that's what you guys want

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.680 
that pass and that's what you guys want
to<00:02:20.040> do<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.310> want<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.520> make<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.850> reads<00:02:21.090> you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
to do you want to make the reads you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.790 
to do you want to make the reads you
want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:23.060> user<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.210> linebacker<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.990> cut<00:02:25.380> off<00:02:25.560> a

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
want to user a linebacker and cut off a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.530 
want to user a linebacker and cut off a
receiver<00:02:28.220> usually<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.730> earlier<00:02:30.060> seasons

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
receiver usually in the earlier seasons

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.660 
receiver usually in the earlier seasons
people<00:02:30.780> will<00:02:31.050> just<00:02:31.200> run<00:02:31.620> at<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.130> quarterback

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
people will just run at the quarterback

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.790 
people will just run at the quarterback
with<00:02:33.270> their<00:02:33.480> linebackers<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:34.110> tackles<00:02:34.650> their

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
with their linebackers or tackles their

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.680 
with their linebackers or tackles their
ends<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.610> works<00:02:35.910> in<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.210> first<00:02:36.360> couple

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
ends and that works in the first couple

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.690 
ends and that works in the first couple
seasons<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.650> as<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.160> deeper<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.580> deeper

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
seasons but as you get deeper and deeper

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.650 
seasons but as you get deeper and deeper
into<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.240> game

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
into the game

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.000 
into the game
the<00:02:39.870> quarterbacks<00:02:40.380> start<00:02:40.650> getting<00:02:40.890> their

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the quarterbacks start getting their

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.949 
the quarterbacks start getting their
passes<00:02:41.340> off<00:02:41.490> more<00:02:41.700> quickly<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.330> get

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
passes off more quickly and you get

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.690 
passes off more quickly and you get
burned<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:43.950> actually<00:02:44.100> how<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.459> get

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
burned so that's actually how you get

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.090 
burned so that's actually how you get
better<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:46.260> start<00:02:46.470> getting<00:02:46.709> burned<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
better is you start getting burned and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.790 
better is you start getting burned and
then<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.520> learn<00:02:47.850> how<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.090> adapt<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.590> again

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
then you learn how to adapt but again

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.729 
then you learn how to adapt but again
the<00:02:49.950> cover<00:02:50.130> three<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.670> as<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.810> can<00:02:51.930> see<00:02:51.989> cover

the cover three and as you can see cover

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.250 
the cover three and as you can see cover
three<00:02:53.010> even<00:02:53.280> stops<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.730> run<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.260> assuming

three even stops the run and assuming

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.690 
three even stops the run and assuming
that<00:02:55.560> they<00:02:55.650> get<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.890> ball<00:02:56.040> back<00:02:56.070> which<00:02:56.520> they

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
that they get the ball back which they

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.460 
that they get the ball back which they
do<00:02:56.760> I'll<00:02:57.120> still<00:02:57.660> be<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.840> defense<00:02:58.230> which<00:02:58.440> is

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
do I'll still be on defense which is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.590 
do I'll still be on defense which is
good<00:02:58.800> because<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.910> don't<00:03:00.060> want<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.390> show<00:03:00.510> you

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
it up still gonna go at the cover three

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.130 
it up still gonna go at the cover three
because<00:03:07.680> they<00:03:07.860> seem<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.459> really<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:09.140> plays

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
because they seem to really like plays

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.580 
because they seem to really like plays
with<00:03:10.350> three<00:03:10.590> riders<00:03:10.800> ride<00:03:11.370> receivers<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.590> like

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
with three riders ride receivers I like

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.910 
with three riders ride receivers I like
it<00:03:13.739> when<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:14.130> talk<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:15.120> um<00:03:15.770> spinning<00:03:16.770> white

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
it when I can talk but um spinning white

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.759 
it when I can talk but um spinning white
we<00:03:17.040> looked<00:03:17.250> at<00:03:17.780> never<00:03:18.780> no<00:03:19.080> one<00:03:19.230> ever<00:03:19.380> makes<00:03:19.590> it

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
we looked at never no one ever makes it

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.479 
we looked at never no one ever makes it
out<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.160> alive<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.980> think<00:03:22.980> EA<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
out of it alive I think EA is the

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.170 
out of it alive I think EA is the
deadliest<00:03:23.940> weapon<00:03:24.299> there<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:24.750> go<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.790> I'm

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
deadliest weapon there we go so I'm

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.520 
deadliest weapon there we go so I'm
still<00:03:27.420> gonna<00:03:27.510> come<00:03:27.690> out<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:28.019> cover<00:03:28.230> three

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
still gonna come out in a cover three

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.729 
still gonna come out in a cover three
because<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:30.600> what<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.989> Steelers<00:03:31.500> seem

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
because that is what the Steelers seem

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.750 
because that is what the Steelers seem
to<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.130> in<00:03:32.880> this<00:03:33.299> live<00:03:33.510> event<00:03:33.690> but<00:03:34.670> usually<00:03:35.670> I

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
to like in this live event but usually I

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.750 
to like in this live event but usually I
just<00:03:35.970> scoop<00:03:36.239> my<00:03:36.360> safe<00:03:36.570> my<00:03:37.110> linebacker<00:03:37.760> back

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
just scoop my safe my linebacker back

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.170 
just scoop my safe my linebacker back
ever<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.239> slightly<00:03:39.799> so<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.610> get<00:03:41.850> a

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
ever so slightly so that I can get a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.080 
ever so slightly so that I can get a
better<00:03:42.780> start<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:44.489> wide<00:03:44.730> receiver

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
better start on the wide receiver

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.940 
better start on the wide receiver
because<00:03:45.330> linebackers<00:03:46.019> aren't<00:03:46.260> as<00:03:46.350> fast<00:03:46.620> and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
because linebackers aren't as fast and

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.130 
because linebackers aren't as fast and
it's<00:03:47.760> fourth<00:03:47.970> down<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.420> they<00:03:48.630> are<00:03:48.750> down<00:03:48.930> by

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
it's fourth down and they are down by

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.870 
it's fourth down and they are down by
eight<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.560> they<00:03:49.680> obviously<00:03:49.799> have<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.340> go<00:03:50.610> for

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
eight so they obviously have to go for

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.930 
eight so they obviously have to go for
it<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:52.470> I'm<00:03:52.830> gonna<00:03:53.010> change<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.370> up<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.640> dime

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
it so I'm gonna change it up to a dime

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.330 
it so I'm gonna change it up to a dime
which<00:03:54.360> means<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.840> will<00:03:54.959> now<00:03:55.110> have<00:03:55.410> six

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
which means you will now have six

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.690 
which means you will now have six
defensive<00:03:56.940> backs<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:58.070> I'm<00:03:59.070> going<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.519> run

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
defensive backs and I'm going to run

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.410 
defensive backs and I'm going to run
another<00:04:00.150> cover<00:04:00.480> three<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:02.030> I'm<00:04:03.030> still<00:04:03.299> gonna

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
another cover three and I'm still gonna
