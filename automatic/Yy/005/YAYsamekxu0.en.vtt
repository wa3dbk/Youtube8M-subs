hey guys this is the giant centipede the
contract<00:00:05.210> at<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.390> moment<00:00:06.720> I'm<00:00:07.049> using<00:00:08.330> gold

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
contract at the moment I'm using gold

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.919 
contract at the moment I'm using gold

the fourth and fifth level of strength

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.460 
the fourth and fifth level of strength
um<00:00:16.609> that<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.820> pretty<00:00:18.060> much<00:00:18.180> necessary<00:00:18.539> for

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
um that is pretty much necessary for

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.519 
um that is pretty much necessary for
completing<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.460> quest<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.960> giant

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
completing this quest the giant

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.420 
completing this quest the giant
centipedes<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.820> difficult<00:00:25.189> at<00:00:26.189> least

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
centipedes are very difficult at least

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.419 
centipedes are very difficult at least
they<00:00:26.580> were<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.880> me<00:00:27.260> there<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.769> were<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
they were to me there they were like the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.189 
they were to me there they were like the
strongest<00:00:29.699> enemies<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> game<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
strongest enemies in the game and I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.959 
strongest enemies in the game and I
think<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.769> might<00:00:31.980> still<00:00:32.340> even<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.790> trouble

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
think I might still even have trouble

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
think I might still even have trouble
killing<00:00:33.300> them<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:37.050> find<00:00:37.410> them<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
killing them now so you find them in the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.990 
killing them now so you find them in the
area<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:40.219> bridge<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.579> fairytale<00:00:42.480> ruins

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
area of the bridge and fairytale ruins

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.119 
area of the bridge and fairytale ruins
um<00:00:45.000> there's<00:00:45.870> no<00:00:46.020> specific<00:00:46.289> spot<00:00:46.829> where<00:00:47.039> they

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
um there's no specific spot where they

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
um there's no specific spot where they
will<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.489> they'll<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:48.000> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> pop<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.570> out

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
will be they'll just kind of pop up out

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.689 
will be they'll just kind of pop up out
of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> ground<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.899> now<00:00:52.309> if<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.370> use

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
of the ground like that now if you use

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.850 
of the ground like that now if you use
your<00:00:53.879> group<00:00:54.090> style<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.350> time<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
your group style and you time it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.729 
your group style and you time it
perfectly<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.750> can<00:00:57.750> stop<00:00:58.079> them<00:00:58.320> from<00:00:58.440> going

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
perfectly you can stop them from going

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.830 
perfectly you can stop them from going
into<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.219> ground<00:01:01.699> um<00:01:02.699> honestly<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:03.570> in

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
into the ground um honestly I think in

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.620 
into the ground um honestly I think in
this<00:01:03.989> video<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.920> fighting<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.450> at

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this video and the fighting like for at

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.060 
this video and the fighting like for at
once<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.080> something<00:01:09.200> yeah<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.950> have

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
once or something yeah so when you have

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.550 
once or something yeah so when you have
a<00:01:11.100> lot<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.670> use<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.869> group<00:01:13.080> style<00:01:13.350> with

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
a lot of them use the group style with

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
a lot of them use the group style with
the<00:01:13.680> silver<00:01:14.010> sword<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:15.110> it's<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.320> too<00:01:16.619> bad

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the silver sword it's it's not too bad

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.749 
the silver sword it's it's not too bad
but<00:01:18.290> they're<00:01:19.290> pretty<00:01:20.070> tough<00:01:20.340> even<00:01:20.580> though

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
but they're pretty tough even though

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.510 
but they're pretty tough even though

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
when they come out of the ground that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.490 
when they come out of the ground that

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
for experience these guys would be a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.570 
for experience these guys would be a
good<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.619> these

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
good way to do it because I think these

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.620 
good way to do it because I think these
guys<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.989> basilisks<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.360> maybe<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
guys and the basilisks and maybe the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.390 
guys and the basilisks and maybe the
wyvern<00:02:13.019> still<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.300> there<00:02:16.050> are<00:02:16.470> some<00:02:16.950> there<00:02:17.280> are

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
wyvern still so there are some there are

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.820

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
here but either way once you kill four

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.259 
here but either way once you kill four
you<00:02:27.510> bring<00:02:27.780> them<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.200> elven<00:02:28.830> armor<00:02:29.310> he<00:02:30.030> is

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
you bring them to the elven armor he is
