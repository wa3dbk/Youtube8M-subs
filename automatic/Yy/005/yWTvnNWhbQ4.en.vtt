with<00:04:23.789> Phil<00:04:23.970> on<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.240> one<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:25.160> don't<00:04:26.160> think<00:04:26.430> that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
with Phil on this one I don't think that

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.040 
with Phil on this one I don't think that
the<00:04:26.729> mask<00:04:26.940> freaks<00:04:27.210> are<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.419> way<00:04:27.509> to<00:04:27.539> go

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
the mask freaks are the way to go

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.290 
the mask freaks are the way to go
I<00:04:28.080> do<00:04:28.740> feel<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.310> bodybuilding<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:29.940> leading

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
I do feel the bodybuilding is leading

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.439 
I do feel the bodybuilding is leading
them<00:04:31.229> in<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.680> wrong<00:04:31.830> direction<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.419> don't

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
them in the wrong direction and I don't

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.290 
them in the wrong direction and I don't
think<00:04:33.979> that<00:04:34.979> we<00:04:35.100> can<00:04:35.280> really<00:04:35.340> attribute<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
think that we can really attribute the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.640 
think that we can really attribute the
growth<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:38.009> sport<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.780> masteries<00:04:40.289> and

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
growth of the sport to the masteries and

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.939 
growth of the sport to the masteries and
so<00:04:41.810> that's<00:04:42.810> really<00:04:43.080> all<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.350> have<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.620> say<00:04:43.800> about
