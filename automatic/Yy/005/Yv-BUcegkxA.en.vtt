00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
will give it a flip we will use the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.770 
will give it a flip we will use the
technique<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.250> showed<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.640> with<00:02:38.209> looking

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.630 
point I'm going to leave the eggs a bit
I'm<00:02:46.970> going<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.270> let<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.540> set<00:02:47.930> up<00:02:48.140> if<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:49.100> continue

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
I'm going to let it set up if I continue

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.330 
I'm going to let it set up if I continue
to<00:02:49.790> stir<00:02:50.060> we'll<00:02:50.390> have<00:02:50.600> scrambled<00:02:51.200> eggs<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.040> I'm

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
to stir we'll have scrambled eggs so I'm

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.630 
to stir we'll have scrambled eggs so I'm
leaving<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.730> egg<00:02:52.880> set<00:02:53.240> up<00:02:53.420> now<00:02:54.370> shaking<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
leaving the egg set up now shaking the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.490 
leaving the egg set up now shaking the
eggs<00:02:55.760> around<00:02:55.910> there's<00:02:56.750> not<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> whole<00:02:57.260> lot<00:02:57.470> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
eggs around there's not a whole lot of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.199 
eggs around there's not a whole lot of
movement<00:02:57.890> which<00:02:58.400> will<00:02:58.550> make<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.760> harder<00:02:59.180> to

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
movement which will make it harder to

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.630 
movement which will make it harder to
flip<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.620> what<00:03:01.250> I'm<00:03:01.340> going<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.670> do<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:03.520> sneak<00:03:04.520> a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640
