00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.940

 which I cook I get once 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.050
 two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 pieces therefore 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.780
 get up before you start cooking 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:08.680
 cupcakes and we definitely put the oven on 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.020
 175 degrees and bake muffins 20 30 minutes 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 you can do them when they are already covered 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.800
 such a crust pulls out I usually 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.130
 always check it never for a while 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.520

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.660
 very airy light and heavy and 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.470
 gentle therefore one who is on a diet calmly 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.470
 can afford 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.150
 look of vitesse 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.360
 and the child did not rise very quickly 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.770
 because the dough is very light and very 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:24.940
