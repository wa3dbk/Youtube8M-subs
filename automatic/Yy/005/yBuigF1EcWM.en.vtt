00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
supports it too but basically you got to

supports it too but basically you got to
start<00:01:09.550> with<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.730> graphics<00:01:10.120> card<00:01:10.330> well<00:01:10.750> I

start with the graphics card well I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.300 
start with the graphics card well I
would<00:01:11.050> assume<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:11.350> one<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:12.010> got<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.190> check

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
would assume that one you got to check

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.470 
would assume that one you got to check
to<00:01:12.400> make<00:01:12.430> sure<00:01:12.550> the<00:01:12.700> graphics<00:01:13.030> card<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.270> have

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
to make sure the graphics card you have

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.070 
to make sure the graphics card you have
as<00:01:14.010> HDCP<00:01:15.010> support<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:16.150> its<00:01:16.300> digital<00:01:16.720> output

you're probably doing 640 by 480 if you

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.140 
you're probably doing 640 by 480 if you

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
slice off comm if you want to spend a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
slice off comm if you want to spend a
little<00:01:48.010> money<00:01:48.160> on<00:01:48.280> some<00:01:48.430> software<00:01:48.760> although

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
little money on some software although

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.520 
little money on some software although
do<00:01:49.480> they<00:01:49.540> have<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.690> Mac<00:01:49.870> version<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.290> this<00:01:50.380> I

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
do they have a Mac version of this I

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.140 
do they have a Mac version of this I
want<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.740> say<00:01:50.830> they<00:01:50.950> do<00:01:51.010> actually<00:01:51.610> they<00:01:52.090> do

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
want to say they do actually they do

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.660 
want to say they do actually they do
maybe<00:01:52.930> not<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.350> could<00:01:53.560> be<00:01:53.620> wrong<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:54.010> know<00:01:54.460> they

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
maybe not I could be wrong I know they

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.020 
maybe not I could be wrong I know they
have<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.790> PC<00:01:55.090> version<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.690> we're<00:01:56.650> on<00:01:56.800> iTunes<00:01:57.190> it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
have a PC version so we're on iTunes it

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.570 
have a PC version so we're on iTunes it
will<00:01:58.210> work<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.510> anything<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.590> PC<00:02:00.040> it<00:02:00.370> will

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
will work with anything on a PC it will

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.910 
will work with anything on a PC it will
just<00:02:00.790> make<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.180> whole<00:02:01.330> issue<00:02:01.570> vanish<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.830> you

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
just make the whole issue vanish so you

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.770 
just make the whole issue vanish so you
could<00:02:03.070> have<00:02:03.220> say<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.970> graphics<00:02:04.570> card<00:02:04.630> that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
could have say a graphics card that

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.600 
could have say a graphics card that
doesn't<00:02:05.080> supply<00:02:05.230> an<00:02:05.380> HD<00:02:05.680> CP<00:02:05.950> protected<00:02:06.370> signal

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
doesn't supply an HD CP protected signal

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.160 
doesn't supply an HD CP protected signal
out<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:07.120> could<00:02:07.240> have<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.360> monitor<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:08.020> has

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
out you could have a monitor that has

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.010 
out you could have a monitor that has
all<00:02:08.440> analog<00:02:08.890> inputs<00:02:09.280> whatever<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.720> software

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
all analog inputs whatever that software

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.660 
all analog inputs whatever that software
will<00:02:11.230> fix<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.530> problem<00:02:11.800> but<00:02:11.890> that's<00:02:12.129> spending

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
will fix the problem but that's spending

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.100 
will fix the problem but that's spending
some<00:02:12.790> money<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.720> say<00:02:13.840> yeah<00:02:13.989> because

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
some money to do it and say yeah because

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.259 
some money to do it and say yeah because
there's<00:02:14.319> basically<00:02:14.650> there's<00:02:15.430> an<00:02:15.579> annual<00:02:15.730> feed

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
there's basically there's an annual feed

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.660 
there's basically there's an annual feed
out<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:16.750> any<00:02:16.959> DVD<00:02:17.379> if<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:18.040> were<00:02:18.189> using<00:02:18.459> it

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.550 
protected path isn't there what happens
next<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.480> they<00:02:47.690> could<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.840> say<00:02:48.019> off<00:02:48.140> that

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
next so they could just say off that

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.410 
next so they could just say off that
protect<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.130> digital<00:02:49.430> pathway<00:02:49.760> isn't<00:02:50.000> there<00:02:50.120> it

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
just isn't going to work yeah look up

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.430 
just isn't going to work yeah look up
your<00:02:52.040> graphics<00:02:52.430> your<00:02:52.910> GPU<00:02:53.269> modules<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:54.350> know

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
your graphics your GPU modules you know

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.199 
your graphics your GPU modules you know
and<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.220> can<00:02:55.340> still<00:02:55.489> return<00:02:55.640> though<00:02:55.880> if<00:02:56.030> it

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
and if you can still return though if it

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.259 
and if you can still return though if it
turns<00:02:56.420> out<00:02:56.540> your<00:02:56.690> GPU<00:02:57.290> does<00:02:57.590> do<00:02:58.069> HDCP<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.150> your

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
turns out your GPU does do HDCP and your

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.449 
turns out your GPU does do HDCP and your
monitor<00:02:59.420> doesn't<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.830> easiest<00:03:01.069> thing<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.280> do

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
monitor doesn't the easiest thing to do

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.920 
monitor doesn't the easiest thing to do
is<00:03:01.489> if<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.760> still<00:03:01.970> can<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:02.330> turn<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.810> get

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
is if you still can but turn it and get

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.320 
is if you still can but turn it and get
a<00:03:02.959> new<00:03:03.140> one<00:03:03.290> it's<00:03:03.830> painful<00:03:04.250> as<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.340> sounds<00:03:04.610> it

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
a new one it's painful as that sounds it

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:36.180 
a new one it's painful as that sounds it
is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.300 

I

00:03:41.310 --> 00:04:17.500 

Oh

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:30.680 

make<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.580> because

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.909 

I<00:04:30.720> hold<00:04:31.500> up<00:04:31.919> for<00:04:32.280> one<00:04:32.580> more<00:04:32.970> drink<00:04:33.540> before<00:04:34.050> a
