00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that if you do runs train run trains

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.899 
that if you do runs train run trains
they're<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> ones<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.430> linger

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
they're going to be the ones that linger

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
they're going to be the ones that linger
behind<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.900> that's<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> ones<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.250> you're

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
behind and that's the ones that you're

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
behind and that's the ones that you're
eventually<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> run<00:01:30.030> into<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> that's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
eventually going to run into so that's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.780 
eventually going to run into so that's
why<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.920> ahead<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.220> shoot<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
why I go ahead and shoot them with the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
why I go ahead and shoot them with the
ray<00:01:32.970> gun<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.479> them<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
ray gun and get them out of the way if I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.100 
ray gun and get them out of the way if I
can<00:01:34.590> now<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.400> they're<00:01:35.549> slow<00:01:35.970> zombie<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> there

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
can now if they're slow zombie and there
