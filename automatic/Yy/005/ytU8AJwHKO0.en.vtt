from this dairy will process to our
garage<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.579> just<00:01:14.880> use<00:01:15.689> every<00:01:16.289> last<00:01:16.560> bit<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
garage I just use every last bit and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.249 
garage I just use every last bit and
basically<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.479> we're<00:01:18.720> doing<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
methane gas off of it and then we're

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.870 
methane gas off of it and then we're
still<00:01:24.030> using<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.990> liquid<00:01:25.140> portion<00:01:25.679> of<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.159> for

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
still using the liquid portion of it for

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.630 
still using the liquid portion of it for
fertilizing<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:27.689> crops<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.399> the

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
much though okay this is just our

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.850 
much though okay this is just our
collection<00:02:43.120> pit<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.840> not<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.230> digester

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.190 
collection pit this is not the digester
at<00:02:44.980> all<00:02:45.099> all<00:02:45.819> all<00:02:46.209> we're<00:02:46.629> doing<00:02:46.870> here<00:02:47.080> is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
at all all all we're doing here is

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.020 
at all all all we're doing here is
collecting<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.890> menorah<00:02:48.220> from<00:02:48.459> everywhere

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
collecting the menorah from everywhere

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.300 
collecting the menorah from everywhere
in<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.360> dairy<00:02:49.629> system<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:51.010> from<00:02:51.220> here

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
in the dairy system and then from here

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.150 
in the dairy system and then from here
we<00:02:52.180> pump<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.660> over<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.230> digester<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.040> we

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
we pump it over to the digester and we

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.070 
we pump it over to the digester and we
pump<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.489> over<00:02:54.760> there<00:02:54.910> we<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.269> float<00:02:55.720> set

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
pump it over there we have the float set

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.259 
pump it over there we have the float set
so<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.709> pumps<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.129> over<00:02:57.430> about<00:02:57.610> five<00:02:57.910> or<00:02:58.120> six

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
so it pumps it over about five or six

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.830 
so it pumps it over about five or six
times<00:02:58.660> a<00:02:58.900> day<00:02:59.400> without<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.790> digester<00:03:01.390> system

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840

how the Mannar go is why don't we follow
the<00:04:05.769> flow<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.489> say<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.720> it's<00:04:07.959> just<00:04:08.230> heat

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
the flow so to say so it's just heat

the solid matter that's become the bed
what's<00:04:24.130> replacing<00:04:24.340> your<00:04:24.669> sawdust<00:04:25.030> this<00:04:25.449> is

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
what's replacing your sawdust this is

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.219 
what's replacing your sawdust this is
the<00:04:26.050> solid<00:04:26.289> portion<00:04:27.220> that<00:04:27.400> we<00:04:27.520> pull<00:04:27.789> off<00:04:28.229> well

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
the solid portion that we pull off well

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.760 
the solid portion that we pull off well
it<00:04:30.120> creates<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.210> really<00:04:31.419> fine<00:04:31.900> material<00:04:32.620> and

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
it creates a really fine material and

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.189 
it creates a really fine material and
that's<00:04:32.949> and<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.669> other<00:04:33.880> thing<00:04:34.449> that<00:04:34.750> makes<00:04:35.080> it

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
that's and the other thing that makes it

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.529 
that's and the other thing that makes it
so<00:04:35.440> valuable<00:04:35.620> for<00:04:36.009> bidding<00:04:36.580> for<00:04:36.820> cows<00:04:37.120> it's

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
so valuable for bidding for cows it's

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.110 
so valuable for bidding for cows it's
ninety-nine<00:04:38.139> percent<00:04:38.320> pathogen-free<00:04:39.190> so

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
ninety-nine percent pathogen-free so

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.540 
ninety-nine percent pathogen-free so
it's<00:04:40.330> it's<00:04:40.660> true<00:04:40.900> Campos<00:04:41.410> I<00:04:41.680> noticed<00:04:42.039> over<00:04:42.280> at

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
it's it's true Campos I noticed over at

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.980 
it's it's true Campos I noticed over at
the<00:04:42.699> barn<00:04:42.970> when<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.330> were<00:04:43.449> scooping<00:04:43.870> you

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
the barn when you were scooping you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.770 
the barn when you were scooping you
didn't<00:04:44.199> bother<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.500> pick<00:04:44.680> any<00:04:44.889> of<00:04:45.039> that<00:04:45.220> up<00:04:45.430> but

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
didn't bother to pick any of that up but

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.749 
didn't bother to pick any of that up but
not<00:04:46.780> if<00:04:47.020> i'm<00:04:47.169> picking<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:47.560> out<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:47.979> it<00:04:48.099> no

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
not if i'm picking this out is it no

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.029 
not if i'm picking this out is it no
it's<00:04:48.940> interesting<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.660> done<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.259> like

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
it's interesting you done it just like

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.320 
it's interesting you done it just like
it<00:04:51.070> feels<00:04:51.460> like<00:04:51.610> it's<00:04:51.820> gone<00:04:51.970> through<00:04:52.180> some

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
it feels like it's gone through some

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.089 
it feels like it's gone through some
kind<00:04:52.479> of<00:04:52.570> a<00:04:52.660> cleaning<00:04:53.050> process<00:04:53.530> like<00:04:53.830> it's<00:04:53.979> the

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
kind of a cleaning process like it's the

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.129 
kind of a cleaning process like it's the
heat<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.180> takes<00:04:55.360> care<00:04:55.599> of<00:04:55.630> everything<00:04:55.960> I

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
heat and it takes care of everything I

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.900 
heat and it takes care of everything I
mean<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.770> doesn't<00:04:57.070> stick<00:04:57.250> your<00:04:57.430> hands<00:04:57.669> and

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
mean it doesn't stick your hands and

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.450 
mean it doesn't stick your hands and
it's<00:04:58.000> odorless<00:04:58.180> right<00:04:58.990> so<00:04:59.620> should<00:05:00.190> we<00:05:00.220> check

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
it's odorless right so should we check

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.189 
it's odorless right so should we check
out<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:00.669> electronics<00:05:01.419> on<00:05:01.570> this<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:02.020> yeah

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
out the electronics on this and yeah

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.409 
out the electronics on this and yeah
yeah<00:05:02.440> yeahs<00:05:03.009> energy<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.520> Micah's<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:03.910> offer<00:05:04.330> to

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
yeah yeahs energy of Micah's I offer to

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.119 
yeah yeahs energy of Micah's I offer to
produce<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.930> result<00:05:05.139> yes

the<00:05:07.580> last<00:05:07.849> step<00:05:08.149> is<00:05:08.389> pretty<00:05:08.989> much<00:05:09.199> where<00:05:09.589> the

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:09.709 
the last step is pretty much where the

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:12.369 
the last step is pretty much where the
manure<00:05:10.039> hits<00:05:10.399> the<00:05:10.610> fan<00:05:10.849> a<00:05:11.149> methane<00:05:12.110> gas
