00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:12.910
 Then I used yarn iphone ipod touch etc 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.120
 I think I'd like to do video editing. I use this free video editing application. 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.250
 is 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.250

 There is an icon called Projects, so tap this 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 Then there is still a project in it, but it will go out, so a new project 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.970
 make 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.970
 Please tap the + mark on the upper right 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.130
 Then it's quite new and subtle 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:52.620
 Project is completed 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:54.120
 If you go from top to bottom, this is the video that is written in the bo timeline here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 I will put a video 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.440
 There is a title to be given next, so 8 telops will be added here 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.750
 It is bgm 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.250
 First of all 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 To the video 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:14.680
 I will put a video in the time column of the video 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.680
 Do this because there is a + mark on the far right of the video timeline 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:23.299
 This time 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.299
 Tap this video library floor because already more than taking 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:33.800
 If you really do 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:36.130
 Since Well Well the video that you have taken are displayed in a list favorite 8 videos to choose from among these 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.370
 I will 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 This time 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.900
 And so it's festive 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.890
 I will try 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:52.120
 Otherwise , after the video enters Tamura, cancel the upper left once 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.120
 Return to timeline 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:01.650
 When you return to the timeline, a video of the festival you selected earlier 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.960
 It appears as a blue bar at the head of the video timeline 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.770
 If you slide this to the side 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.790
 And the part that hangs on this yellow line 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.540
 Overwintering on this upper left 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.430
 It shows 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:25.990
 As you move forward and backward, the above video will go ahead and forward 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:28.790
 In just the hard very to edit and become this about long video 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.380

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.140
 The timeline below is a yin item chart 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.230
 It is possible to shorten or lengthen 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.750
 I will bring it to the point where it is just right 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.940
 Next this video 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:52.610
 8 because it is too long 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:57.530
 I think it is better to edit one cut in about 3 to 5 seconds 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:02.420
 Let's shorten this video to about 3 seconds 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:10.080

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:15.560

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.560
 I will keep it short and long 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.020
