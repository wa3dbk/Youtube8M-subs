00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 play notes learning with the center 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.780
 spicker hello and welcome 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.940
 here is franz teacher of piano playing 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 come today you get a lot 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.890
 effective tool is helping you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.529
 the notes easier and faster too 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.109
 learn very playfully while you new ones 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 songs and plays a fruit then makes 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.260
 the piano is even more fun 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 Here he is currently around spicker this 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.529
 later you can practice while practicing 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.050
 lay your notes 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.510
 always if you do not know a note 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.940
 you can easily check and the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.940
 to find out the notes by spelling out 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.940
 for example this note cdef 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.570
 it would be pretty difficult all notes 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.750
 to memorize all at once 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 that is not necessary you all imprint 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.210
 cs well and learn that notes 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.449
 alphabet all other notes you can 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.460
 then find out by spelling 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.570
 Now I show you like this tower 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.619
 is built 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.850
 here you see a scale and the c 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.130
 in doors conclusions 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.280
 one calls this c also that one 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.810
 deleted c we have several cs 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.970
 and you have to differentiate somehow 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.240
 can and so that means that a 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.960
 Find deleted c by typing 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.000
 I the next ccdefghc 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.180
 So here is the next higher c 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.579
 that is that two deleted c now 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.909
 I write that underlaid 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.820
 the two deleted c and then do 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.149
 I continue to spell cdef with that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.340
 gh c 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.100
 and then I have the very high c and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.969
 that's the trinity c and that 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.140
 I write about the other two cs 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.399
 so now i have here for the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.270
 violin key already a nice 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.469
 small red tower built 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.450
 now I do the same for the 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.220
 left hand 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 there we have a c again and that is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.310
 even the deleted cs is the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.220
 same 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.010
 key on the piano that is important that you 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.450
 you notice that this c in july 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.390
 key with the stroke through the one 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.250
 deleted c and the subject crossed out 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.360
 Allen key is also that one 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.720
 deleted c so the same button 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.550
 now the hartz has to spell chf 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.300
 pdc now I have the next 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.780
 deeper c this is called the little toe 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.380
 and I write about this little toe 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.400
 now that a deleted cmb key 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:53.010
 and then I'll spell it 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:56.580
 continue chg fdc 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.870
 then I have the very deep c and that 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.630
 is the big c 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.750
 that will come back to the others 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.780
 both cs so now i have this here 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.580
 big c the little toe that one 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.069
 Painted 10 again that one 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.299
 painted c that two deleted c 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:19.440
 and the three deleted c and this cs 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:23.510
 on top of each other these cs form ours 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.400
 c tower and if you look at this cs a text 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.880
 then you will spell out by a lot 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.160
 quickly learn the notes with this work 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.380
 You can speak the cs easily 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.519
 inculcate 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.700
 So here in the middle we have that 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.190
 a deleted c as already said that 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.880
 cmb key and the zebra key 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.980
 it's the same key on the piano 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.859
 pianists call this c that 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.590
 keyhole c why the keyhole 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.299
 c at this point or approximate 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.680
 this place is the 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.980
 keyhole and there you can 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.780
 shut off the piano or the piano 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.000
 then we have here the 2 deleted c 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.639
 and this two c is located c 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.799
 in the second space from above 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.709
 counted here is the first space 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:14.220
 here is the second space you 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.729
 So can notice that two deleted 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:22.049
 c is in the second space 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:24.430
 counted from the top and c becomes the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.840
 German almost equally pronounced 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.630
 That's why it's a really great kind of help 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.120
 then we have here the 3 deleted c 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.460
 and the trio c is on the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.630
 second help from above 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.240
 maybe you already noticed 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.470
 this system is a mirror image 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.720
 put the head the highest c stands 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.550
 on the second helm above and that 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.070
 deepest c stands on the second 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.800
 help lines down and the two 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.310
 deleted c in the middle here is in 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.009
 second intermediate from above and the 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.759
 small toe are two interspaces of 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:09.070
 down so in principle it is in bad 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.820
 Just keep eating on the food 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.169
 So the little toe is in the head 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:20.009
 second space counted from below 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.949
 and the big c is on the second 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:26.580
 Helps from below 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.770
 Now I'll show you the cs on the piano 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.620
 how you see are the black keys 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.909
 on the keyboard in two groups and three 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.639
 arranged 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.120
 two black three black two 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.159
 black three black and so on 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.870
 to the left of a two group we have 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.030
 the cdu 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.190
 which is now that a painted teeth 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.960
 or the keyhole c or you can 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.320
 also say the middle 10 because it is 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.200
 located in the middle of the keyboard 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.150
 So here we have the lock 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.660
 So it's on the left side of the castle 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.350
 So the hardest is going on 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.150
 then spell up to the next one 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.150
 ccp bfgt 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:14.369
 So we have two conversations too 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.369
 keep it up 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:23.399
 chc and the three deleted c and for 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:27.539
 do the bass key and vice versa 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:27.539
 the book stable backwards 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.270
 the little toe and on it goes ch 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.810
 the big goal 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.660
 yes, with the theory we are now through 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.460
 Now it's time for practical application 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.980
 below this video you will find a link 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.500
 on my website there you can see the c 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.770
 download tus kicker now for free 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.570
 and it would be best to start printing right away 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.120
 and use the center in the daily 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.280
 Practice the piano if you do that regularly 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.090
 you will soon make the notes fluid 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.220
 can read 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.050
 I wish you a lot of fun with it and 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.120
 say goodbye with warm regards 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.120
 from the piano teacher franz fischer
