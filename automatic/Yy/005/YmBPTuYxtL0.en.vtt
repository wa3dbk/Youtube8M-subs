I<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.950> don't<00:03:09.310> really<00:03:09.550> know<00:03:09.730> how<00:03:09.850> there's<00:03:10.000> going

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
I I don't really know how there's going

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.480 
I I don't really know how there's going
to<00:03:10.210> work<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.630> guess<00:03:11.140> judging<00:03:11.560> from<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.980> icon<00:03:12.340> to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
to work I guess judging from the icon to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.220 
to work I guess judging from the icon to
the<00:03:12.550> left<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.210> headset<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:13.960> we're<00:03:14.110> going

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
the left it's a headset so we're going

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.770 
the left it's a headset so we're going
to<00:03:14.320> be<00:03:14.470> having<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:15.100> give<00:03:15.280> someone<00:03:15.580> like<00:03:16.000> verbal

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
to be having to give someone like verbal

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.480 
to be having to give someone like verbal
directions<00:03:16.990> saying<00:03:17.710> you<00:03:17.830> know<00:03:17.950> turn<00:03:18.220> left

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
directions saying you know turn left

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.820 
directions saying you know turn left
here<00:03:18.670> turn<00:03:18.910> left<00:03:19.120> up<00:03:19.270> there<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.320> think<00:03:20.590> that

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
here turn left up there and I think that

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.800 
here turn left up there and I think that
knowing<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.400> map<00:03:21.580> is<00:03:21.880> going<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.360> be<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.510> very

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
knowing the map is going to be a very

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.690 
knowing the map is going to be a very
important<00:03:23.560> part<00:03:23.740> of<00:03:23.890> winning<00:03:24.190> this<00:03:24.370> mode

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
important part of winning this mode

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.880 
important part of winning this mode
sounds<00:03:25.600> like<00:03:25.690> rally<00:03:25.930> mode<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.470> going<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.770> be

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
sounds like rally mode is going to be

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.860 
sounds like rally mode is going to be
kind<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.190> like<00:03:27.340> random<00:03:28.090> objectives<00:03:28.630> or

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
kind of like random objectives or

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.210 
kind of like random objectives or
something<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.860> have<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.070> get
