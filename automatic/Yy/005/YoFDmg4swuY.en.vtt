00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.950
 or the cycles and caquetá of these and 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.360
 I hope you are very well today we are going with 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.280
 a special video that we're going to talk about 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.690
 on average instead of advised to take 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.090
 black stockings that do not need that 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.619
 tips because we take them all we're going 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.330
 to try to bet on color socks 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.860
 during this fall this winter we are going to 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.810
 that's why I do not want us to be super 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.060
 radicals let's get green with 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.800
 nice pretty look I'm going to make a 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.789
 bet on colors that are more 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.099
 available 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.449
 let's choose how strange that I do not 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.400
 very weird because I like everything a bit in 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.660
 downtown well here the color blue 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.240
 marine well be it the way of 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.190
 combine it a little differently but so 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.440
 marine another color that I like very much 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.000
 is the purple color purple my 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.920
 figures here says this example of 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.690
 purple maybe others that look garnet 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.730
 but in reality they were also purple 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.050
 come in the tent of the dwellings another 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.820
 very season color which is the color 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.710
 mustard why not add the stockings 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 shown to your blog and then the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.580
 Garnet color is burgundy we have 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.350
 seen that it is a very intendencia color is 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.330
 great also to put it in the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.590
 legs and then a marcel rush that does not 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.210
 I have average now but we have you 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.400
 returned that besides' not deciding mind 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.960
 what I did not face is this 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.740
 color as green bottle which is a color 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.850
 is beautiful 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.860
 the stockings can also be left 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.329
 really very nice so if I leave you 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.799
 with the putting of color is that this as 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.299
 for this journalist we are no longer going to 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.040
 the looks good as you see me I'm 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.170
 pretty classic because there is no opt 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.460
 for a look more for more mature people 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.320
 that I also have among followers that 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.479
 they are mature I climbed slowly with this 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.130
 I have 40 or 50 years of this for example 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.020
 I'm wearing because not a skirt 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.970
 pencil type in camel color making the 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.369
 color combination proposal that 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.229
 just for example combine camel or 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.330
 color for example mustard along with 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.130
 garnet or burgundy and sell and sell those 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.810
 synonyms and now we're going to add the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.979
 navy blue you'll see how pretty 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.630
 all three colors are left 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.920
 combined together as you see well put 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.420
 tries that if it is in plan it tolerates that the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.979
 base I love has some details is 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.899
 as well built you are of mind in 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.909
 you take and look with the back as 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.860
 it dyes is not very beautiful the truth 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.330
 these types of jackets I love 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.130
 when we take to is a pro skirts of 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.380
 high - waisted such as not equal diaz 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.729
 a low skirt and a short jacket like 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.979
 that remains is processing half 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.630
 of the exposed torso did not add you 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.490
 just some necklaces and as I said 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.080
 the navy blue color also on the feet 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.909
 because it's a color that I like a lot 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.769
 navy blue camel and normal keyboards with 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.420
 is with this couplet and so that students 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.410
 that too plastic in terms of 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.360
 colors to add for 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.610
 a bag a more radiant color like 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.740
 it can be a mustard, not an animal color 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.260
 first colored and you will see how it gives 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.580
 a different touch we go with the second 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.810
 what you see again as a follow 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.790
 combining the same colors to 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.160
 incorporate some mustard stockings 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.750
 combined with a garnet dress and I'm going 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.820
 put on some shoes in a color like 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.440
 knot a light brown color also like 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.600
 I told you before the previous look that 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.160
 combines very well together but the one that says 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.080
 It is brown or you know that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.850
 also in the marinas of this range that 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.380
 we do not leave the colors true 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.790
 Well, for example, could you go 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.560
 very good a navy blue shoe but 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.910
 good for changing a bit about the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.010
 previous look let's add it now 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.930
 this shoe in this color to accentuate 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.490
 a little the waist to give it a little 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.350
 that decided to put on this belt that 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.570
 also curiously has some stones 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.100
 he swam makes a rag with the mustard 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.570
 of the stockings to finish adding 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.130
 sun here so that I already told you that the 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.110
 I bought a market or instance and in 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.000
 new york that I worked I did it so that 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.220
 you go in some very interesting things and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.620
 this maxi half bag in garnet color 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.880
 very seasonally we are going to put last 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.150
 look where I wanted to look for 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.280
 navy blue tights 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.750
 with a few different colors to 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.400
 that we usually face the sea ​​with 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.170
 navy or summary for example with 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.519
 brown that is also very good but 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.730
 I want to mix your marine with others 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.730
 colors 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.620
 or beige and navy blue with a color 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.510
 nude or roses stick to take away a 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.980
 little bit of sophistication with this 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.810
 somehow this lack of gauze 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.090
 just add the magic shirt 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.409
 white on top and totally doing it 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.909
 much more then let's continue 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.470
 adding layers here starts to be a 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.450
 July that you peel and you have to go well 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.400

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.540

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.250
 what I like well this color and 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.349
 making and color combinations stick 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.579
 pink for not with purple color than other 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.409
 color is also great this 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.900
 combination in the ix if you like to open 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.329

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.189

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.689

 normal shoes like this and so on 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.370
 It looks like staying with the couplet 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.840
 pink and purple underwater submarine 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.169
