00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.309
 good morning to our users is a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.070
 day the stretch served a question 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.740
 very focused on the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.030
 problem of blocking the activity 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.150
 what is the boiler block 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.650
 technically the campaign block is 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.710
 nothing but 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.480
 let's say a block generated by a 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.869
 some element of security that is 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.710
 present inside for the boiler is 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.670
 so let's say so use 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.470
 a number of gender causes 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.410
 no 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.170
 the boiler today the modern boilers have 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.570
 on board a bit like our cars 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.640
 a series of sensors that are used for 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.050
 check some parameters through 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.340
 these sensors can be his name 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.340
 pressure switches and more 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.380
 the control unit determines whether the boiler 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.290
 can continue to work or should 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.010
 blocking then blocking 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.530
 boiler is generated by these sensors in 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.840
 field however due to a 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.330
 malfunction sometimes that the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.790
 malfunction can be a simple one 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.950
 lack of pressure on the plant of 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.890
 heating can sometimes be a 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.630
 pressure switch that does not check more than us 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.759
 oni both pressure and snipers 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.250
 circuit in which it is inserted 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.770
 and then the boiler from a block then 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.619
 when an inter ready technician intervenes 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.610
 at home of the customer as he moves from 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.700
 search for 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.740
 the cause the fault finding is the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:49.100
 first thing that is done in the chain 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.470
 of the fault occur precisely which 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.780
 are and what could be the sensors 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.120
 or the devices they sent into 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.320
 block the boiler they gave 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.729
 information to the electronic card 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.490
 to block the new boilers on average 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.190
 in the event of a failure of a damage block 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.580
 of the error codes through these 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.700
 color codes already there is a first track 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.840
 a guideline on which to orientate 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.670
 then obviously the expert technician 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.730
 ballard evaluate the path to do 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.709
 so he tried to exclude as he went 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.440
 all the devices in the field 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.959
 free instrumentation was available 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.930
 and then replaces it at 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.910
 restore normal operation e 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.210
 what is the best way to contact 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.150
 manufacturers 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.220
 if you have a boiler block it is a lot 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.960
 simple just call us 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.480
 toll-free number 800 13 58 53 to request 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.280
 also a simple information and also 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.270
 make a first attempt to unlock it 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.830
 manual via phone without ours 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.380
 technician must necessarily be 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.260
 necessarily go to yours 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.400
 home thanks to so much for the hands 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.400
 of the sis held to all
