this material right here it seems kind

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.080 
this material right here it seems kind
of<00:03:46.040> kind<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.099> thick<00:03:47.400> or<00:03:47.579> something<00:03:47.909> like<00:03:48.030> that

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
of kind of thick or something like that

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.270 
of kind of thick or something like that
maybe<00:03:48.419> maybe<00:03:48.629> tough<00:03:48.959> or<00:03:49.169> something<00:03:49.319> but<00:03:50.159> it

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
maybe maybe tough or something but it

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.710 
maybe maybe tough or something but it
just<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.579> me<00:03:50.699> it<00:03:50.819> seems<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.090> this<00:03:51.359> would<00:03:51.540> just

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
just to me it seems like this would just

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.270 
just to me it seems like this would just
crease<00:03:52.790> crazy<00:03:53.959> like<00:03:54.959> it<00:03:55.229> would<00:03:55.319> be<00:03:55.440> bad<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:56.069> have
