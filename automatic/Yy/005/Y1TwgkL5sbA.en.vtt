00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
was always segue and off to the the evil

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.850 
was always segue and off to the the evil
side<00:03:03.640> if<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.970> will<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.780> yeah<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.380> be<00:03:05.770> as

horrible as I can

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.880 
horrible as I can
I<00:03:06.730> guess<00:03:07.090> because<00:03:07.720> we<00:03:07.810> spend<00:03:08.020> 95%<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.709> day

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
I guess because we spend 95% of the day

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.670 
I guess because we spend 95% of the day
off<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.730> set<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.420> more<00:03:10.630> time<00:03:10.870> as<00:03:11.080> as<00:03:11.319> Tom

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
off the set is that more time as as Tom

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.979 
off the set is that more time as as Tom
and<00:03:11.830> Daniel<00:03:12.130> Andrew<00:03:12.459> Pereira<00:03:12.790> rather<00:03:13.780> than

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
and Daniel Andrew Pereira rather than

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.840 
and Daniel Andrew Pereira rather than
Draco<00:03:14.260> Harry<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.800> so<00:03:14.950> forth<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.400> yeah<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.580> don't

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
Draco Harry and so forth so yeah I don't

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.250 
Draco Harry and so forth so yeah I don't
think<00:03:16.090> our<00:03:16.270> friendships<00:03:16.690> are<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.870> bit<00:03:16.989> stronger

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
think our friendships are a bit stronger

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:27.230 
think our friendships are a bit stronger
than<00:03:17.380> our<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.860> hate<00:03:18.280> for<00:03:18.489> each<00:03:18.550> other
