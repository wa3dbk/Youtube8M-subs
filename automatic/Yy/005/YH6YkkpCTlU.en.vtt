00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
you need to know about picking your

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.840 
you need to know about picking your
first<00:00:02.820> lock<00:00:03.090> in<00:00:03.389> less<00:00:03.780> than<00:00:03.959> five<00:00:04.140> minutes<00:00:04.850> all

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
first lock in less than five minutes all

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.070 
first lock in less than five minutes all
right<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.359> first<00:00:06.509> thing<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:06.960> need

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
right so the first thing that you need

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.750 
right so the first thing that you need
to<00:00:07.170> know<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.440> what<00:00:07.649> type<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.859> lockpick<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.550> use

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
to know is what type of lockpick to use

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.959 
to know is what type of lockpick to use
this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.769> only<00:00:10.950> lockpick<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.790> need

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
this is the only lockpick that you need

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.509 
this is the only lockpick that you need
to<00:00:12.420> pick<00:00:12.599> 80<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.590> 90<00:00:13.889> percent<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.309> locks

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
to pick 80 to 90 percent of the locks

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.340 
to pick 80 to 90 percent of the locks
you'll<00:00:14.759> ever<00:00:14.880> encounter<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.630> believe<00:00:16.170> it's

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
you'll ever encounter I believe it's

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.189 
you'll ever encounter I believe it's
called<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.859> half<00:00:17.130> diamond<00:00:17.460> lockpick<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.990> got

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
called a half diamond lockpick and I got

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.120 
called a half diamond lockpick and I got
it<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.859> south<00:00:20.730> where<00:00:21.020> lockpick<00:00:22.020> say<00:00:22.260> it's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
it in this south where lockpick say it's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.740 
it in this south where lockpick say it's
full<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> bunch<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> objects<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
full of a bunch of the objects that you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.900 
full of a bunch of the objects that you
probably<00:00:25.050> will<00:00:25.470> never<00:00:25.619> use<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.580> only<00:00:26.789> other

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
probably will never use the only other

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
probably will never use the only other
thing<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.269> need<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.960> tension<00:00:28.320> wrench<00:00:28.680> or

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
thing you need is a tension wrench or

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620 
thing you need is a tension wrench or
torsion<00:00:29.310> wrench<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.300> also

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
torsion wrench and that was also

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.260 
torsion wrench and that was also
included<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> kit<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.910> only<00:00:32.910> other<00:00:33.030> thing

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
included in the kit the only other thing

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.450 
included in the kit the only other thing
you<00:00:33.390> need<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> pick<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.899> lock<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.829> lock<00:00:35.010> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
you need to pick a lock is a lock and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.310 
you need to pick a lock is a lock and
it's<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.870> lock<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it's so I think the right lock is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's so I think the right lock is
important<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.340> easiest<00:00:38.790> way<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> select<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
important the easiest way to select the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.850 
important the easiest way to select the
lock<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.170> by<00:00:40.350> looking<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> keys<00:00:42.739> when<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
lock is by looking at the keys when you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
lock is by looking at the keys when you
look<00:00:44.040> at<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> locks<00:00:45.239> key<00:00:45.600> you'll<00:00:45.870> notice<00:00:46.140> peaks

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
look at a locks key you'll notice peaks

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.130 
look at a locks key you'll notice peaks
and<00:00:46.590> valleys<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:48.090> closer<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.840> together

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and valleys the closer they are together

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.069 
and valleys the closer they are together
across<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.100> line<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:51.180> easier<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> lock<00:00:51.899> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
across the line the easier the lock is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.049 
across the line the easier the lock is
going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> pick<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:53.399> example<00:00:53.760> these<00:00:53.910> are

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
going to be a pick for example these are

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to be a pick for example these are
all<00:00:54.180> pretty<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.780> straight<00:00:54.960> line<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
all pretty much in a straight line the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.459 
all pretty much in a straight line the
valleys<00:00:56.250> are<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> same<00:00:57.360> level<00:00:57.469> it's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
valleys are all at the same level it's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
valleys are all at the same level it's
an<00:00:58.620> easy<00:00:58.770> lock<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> pick<00:00:59.399> if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.750> this

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
an easy lock to pick if you look at this

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.830 
an easy lock to pick if you look at this
key<00:01:01.489> you'll<00:01:02.489> notice<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> deep<00:01:03.539> valley

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
key you'll notice there's a deep valley

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.920 
key you'll notice there's a deep valley
and<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:05.580> other<00:01:05.760> valleys<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.330> higher<00:01:06.510> than<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and the other valleys are higher than it

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
and the other valleys are higher than it
this<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> bit<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.250> difficult<00:01:08.460> lock<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this is a bit more difficult lock to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.960 
this is a bit more difficult lock to
pick<00:01:12.860> this<00:01:13.860> lock<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.760> bit<00:01:14.880> in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
pick this lock is a little bit in

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.219 
pick this lock is a little bit in
between<00:01:15.270> those<00:01:15.479> two<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:15.960> still<00:01:16.080> going

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
between those two but it's still going

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
between those two but it's still going
to<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.380> difficult<00:01:16.830> because<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.460> valleys<00:01:17.880> are

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to be difficult because the valleys are

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.070 
to be difficult because the valleys are
not<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> same<00:01:18.930> level<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> after<00:01:21.720> examining

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
not at the same level so after examining

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.450 
not at the same level so after examining
these<00:01:22.229> keys<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.770> lock<00:01:23.040> would<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
these keys this lock would be the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
these keys this lock would be the
easiest<00:01:23.670> one<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> pick<00:01:24.180> when<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
easiest one to pick when you go to the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.899 
easiest one to pick when you go to the
store<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.680> usually<00:01:25.979> see<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> keys<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
store you can usually see the keys in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520 
store you can usually see the keys in
the<00:01:26.939> packaging<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.689> try<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:27.990> pick<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the packaging so try to pick one that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.789 
the packaging so try to pick one that
has<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.770> nice<00:01:29.400> easy<00:01:29.880> key<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:31.229> first<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799

has a nice easy key the first thing you
want<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.189> when<00:01:32.579> picking<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> lock<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.299> insert

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
want to do when picking a lock is insert

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
want to do when picking a lock is insert

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.260 
the tension wrench into this part of the
Kegel<00:01:36.920> alright<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> lower<00:01:38.700> part<00:01:39.030> if

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
Kegel alright it's in the lower part if

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.469 
want to be able to have access to the
pins<00:01:42.930> using<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> actual<00:01:44.220> picks<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
pins using the actual picks so the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.170 
pins using the actual picks so the
tension<00:01:45.810> wrench<00:01:45.990> goes<00:01:46.140> below<00:01:46.560> those

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
tension wrench goes below those

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.639 
tension wrench goes below those
depending<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> lock<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.930> either<00:01:49.170> needs<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
depending on the lock it either needs to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.560 
depending on the lock it either needs to
turn<00:01:49.799> clockwise<00:01:50.250> or<00:01:50.670> counter<00:01:50.909> clockwise<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
turn clockwise or counter clockwise in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.270 
turn clockwise or counter clockwise in
the<00:01:51.630> case<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.229> most<00:01:52.380> padlocks<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.159> go

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the case of most padlocks you can go

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.069 
the case of most padlocks you can go
either<00:01:53.490> way

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
either way

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.510 
either way
okay<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.259> technique<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.740> called<00:01:55.829> raking<00:01:56.399> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
okay this technique is called raking is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
okay this technique is called raking is
kind<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.850> shotgun<00:01:57.299> approach<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.930> not

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
kind of the shotgun approach it's not

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.539 
kind of the shotgun approach it's not
very<00:01:58.320> precise<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.040> will<00:01:59.130> open<00:01:59.250> most

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
very precise but it will open most

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.940 
very precise but it will open most
padlocks<00:02:00.149> pretty<00:02:00.479> easily<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> quickly<00:02:01.079> so

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
padlocks pretty easily and quickly so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
padlocks pretty easily and quickly so
you<00:02:02.610> insert<00:02:02.939> your<00:02:03.119> pick<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.689> pointy

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you insert your pick with this pointy

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
you insert your pick with this pointy
side<00:02:04.200> facing<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.649> pins<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
side facing the pins all the way to the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.180 
side facing the pins all the way to the
back<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> lock<00:02:06.649> once<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:07.920> there

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
back of the lock once it's back there

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.499 
back of the lock once it's back there
you<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> apply<00:02:08.640> tension<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.390> your

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
you want to apply tension with your

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.420 
you want to apply tension with your
torsion<00:02:09.899> wrench<00:02:10.129> and<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.160> apply<00:02:11.459> more<00:02:12.090> than

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
torsion wrench and you apply more than

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.699 
torsion wrench and you apply more than
normally<00:02:12.849> when<00:02:13.180> you're<00:02:13.299> picking<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.719> lock<00:02:13.930> the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
normally when you're picking a lock the

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.880 
normally when you're picking a lock the
more<00:02:14.890> precise<00:02:15.250> method<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.569> want<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.959> put

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
more precise method then you want to put

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.589 
more precise method then you want to put
your<00:02:17.980> finger<00:02:18.340> on<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.579> part<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.060> pic<00:02:19.269> to

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
your finger on this part of the pic to

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.319 
your finger on this part of the pic to
leverage<00:02:20.159> leverage<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.459> tip<00:02:21.700> up<00:02:21.879> against<00:02:22.180> the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
leverage leverage the tip up against the

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.349 
leverage leverage the tip up against the
pins<00:02:22.569> while<00:02:23.469> you're<00:02:23.620> applying<00:02:23.709> tension<00:02:24.359> here

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
pins while you're applying tension here

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.750 
pins while you're applying tension here
and<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.709> tension<00:02:27.189> wrench<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.519> want<00:02:27.700> to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
and with the tension wrench you want to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.849 
and with the tension wrench you want to
pull<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.299> straight<00:02:28.510> out<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.170> rake<00:02:29.469> it<00:02:29.650> across

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
pull it straight out and rake it across

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.440 
pull it straight out and rake it across
the<00:02:30.099> pins<00:02:30.310> that's<00:02:30.609> why<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:30.879> called<00:02:31.000> raking

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the pins that's why it's called raking

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.080 
the pins that's why it's called raking
and<00:02:32.139> when<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.349> do<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.709> you'll<00:02:33.579> feel<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.909> pop

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
and when you do this you'll feel it pop

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.879 
and when you do this you'll feel it pop
and<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:36.159> lock<00:02:36.370> will<00:02:36.609> open<00:02:40.409> all<00:02:41.409> right<00:02:41.469> so

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
and the lock will open all right so

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.849 
and the lock will open all right so
that's<00:02:42.010> how<00:02:42.159> you<00:02:42.310> make<00:02:42.909> a<00:02:42.939> padlock<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.859> it's

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
that's how you make a padlock and it's

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.679 
that's how you make a padlock and it's
the<00:02:45.010> easiest<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.700> quickest<00:02:46.060> way<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.209> pick<00:02:46.480> any

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
the easiest and quickest way to pick any

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.379 
the easiest and quickest way to pick any
lot<00:02:46.870> depending<00:02:47.739> on<00:02:47.889> how<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.159> keys<00:02:48.579> are<00:02:48.970> set<00:02:49.239> up

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
lot depending on how the keys are set up

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.229 
lot depending on how the keys are set up
that<00:02:50.379> may<00:02:50.650> or<00:02:50.799> may<00:02:50.919> not<00:02:50.950> work<00:02:51.370> as<00:02:51.639> easily<00:02:51.790> as<00:02:52.120> it

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that may or may not work as easily as it

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.270 
that may or may not work as easily as it
did<00:02:52.389> for<00:02:52.720> me<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.109> a<00:02:53.139> fairly<00:02:53.409> easy<00:02:53.560> lot<00:02:54.069> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
did for me this is a fairly easy lot to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.399 
did for me this is a fairly easy lot to
pick<00:02:54.459> more<00:02:55.239> difficult<00:02:55.689> locks<00:02:55.900> would<00:02:56.109> require

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
pick more difficult locks would require

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.170 
pick more difficult locks would require
a<00:02:56.470> little<00:02:56.799> more<00:02:56.919> practice<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.639> time<00:02:57.849> and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
a little more practice and time and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
a little more practice and time and
there's<00:02:58.900> different<00:02:59.230> methods<00:02:59.319> for<00:02:59.590> doing<00:02:59.889> it

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
there's different methods for doing it

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.409 
there's different methods for doing it
as<00:03:00.069> well<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.579> if<00:03:00.790> you're<00:03:00.909> interested<00:03:01.359> in

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
as well so if you're interested in

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.509 
as well so if you're interested in
seeing<00:03:01.599> another<00:03:01.840> video<00:03:02.200> about<00:03:02.469> a<00:03:03.219> different

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
seeing another video about a different

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.979 
seeing another video about a different
method<00:03:03.790> for<00:03:03.819> picking<00:03:04.180> locks<00:03:04.389> that<00:03:04.659> make<00:03:04.840> it

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
method for picking locks that make it

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.520 
method for picking locks that make it
more<00:03:05.079> difficult<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:06.060> deadbolts<00:03:07.060> liked<00:03:07.750> this

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
more difficult like deadbolts liked this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.930 
more difficult like deadbolts liked this
video<00:03:08.919> and<00:03:09.189> I<00:03:09.280> might<00:03:09.489> make<00:03:09.609> it<00:03:09.840> thank<00:03:10.840> you
