other openings are exactly open there on
the<00:01:37.530> bottom<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.520> microphone<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
the bottom for the microphone and the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.670 
the bottom for the microphone and the
u.s.<00:01:40.650> mini<00:01:40.920> USB<00:01:41.130> plug<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> overall<00:01:43.380> fits

u.s. mini USB plug and overall fits

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.880 
u.s. mini USB plug and overall fits
nicely<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.820> only<00:01:45.000> thing<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.299> does<00:01:45.590> cover<00:01:46.590> up

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
nicely the only thing that does cover up

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.700 
nicely the only thing that does cover up
up<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.990> should<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.350> been<00:01:49.380> down

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
up here this should have been down

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190 
up here this should have been down
further<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:51.299> there<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.869> another

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
further down because there is another

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.789 
further down because there is another
mic<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.229> that's<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
mic as you can see here so that's the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.980 
mic as you can see here so that's the
only<00:01:56.040> difference<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.149> I've<00:01:57.509> noticed<00:01:57.899> that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
only difference on and I've noticed that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.020 
only difference on and I've noticed that
I've<00:01:58.200> been<00:01:58.350> testing<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.399> don't<00:01:59.969> know

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I've been testing this out I don't know

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.190 
I've been testing this out I don't know
if<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.149> has<00:02:00.299> anything<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.079> but

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
if this has anything to do with it but

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.469 
if this has anything to do with it but
but<00:02:01.619> by<00:02:01.890> having<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.250> microphone<00:02:03.119> plugged<00:02:04.079> up

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
but by having that microphone plugged up

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.950 
but by having that microphone plugged up
it<00:02:06.479> doesn't<00:02:08.750> let<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
it doesn't let you

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.730 
it doesn't let you
it<00:02:11.770> doesn't<00:02:12.130> let<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.690> kind<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.840> muffles<00:02:14.590> up

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
it doesn't let you kind of muffles up

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.510 
it doesn't let you kind of muffles up
the<00:02:14.890> background<00:02:15.670> noise<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:17.680> might<00:02:17.890> be<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> I

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
the background noise so it might be a I

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.160 
up / party perfectly but I do notice let
me<00:05:04.970> see<00:05:05.300> if<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.080> needs<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.440> slide<00:05:06.680> in<00:05:06.920> but<00:05:07.220> i

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
me see if it needs to slide in but i

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.610 
me see if it needs to slide in but i
think<00:05:09.170> is<00:05:09.320> about<00:05:10.160> it<00:05:10.310> but<00:05:10.820> as<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.150> can<00:05:11.300> see<00:05:11.620> if

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
think is about it but as you can see if

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.070 
think is about it but as you can see if
you're<00:05:12.800> really<00:05:13.060> perfectionist<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:14.780> lines

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
you're really perfectionist this lines

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.190 
you're really perfectionist this lines
up<00:05:15.290> really<00:05:15.560> nice<00:05:15.890> here<00:05:16.310> so<00:05:17.300> does<00:05:17.510> over<00:05:17.750> here

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
up really nice here so does over here

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.750 
up really nice here so does over here
and<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:18.470> other<00:05:18.650> side<00:05:18.920> but<00:05:19.040> then<00:05:19.250> as<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.580> can

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
and this other side but then as you can

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.470 
and this other side but then as you can
see<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.180> has<00:05:20.450> a<00:05:20.810> very<00:05:23.230> minor<00:05:25.090> shortness<00:05:26.090> here

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
see it has a very minor shortness here

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.940 
see it has a very minor shortness here
so<00:05:27.260> the<00:05:28.010> V<00:05:28.310> or<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:30.260> know<00:05:30.380> you'd<00:05:30.560> like<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.740> be

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
so the V or you know you'd like to be

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.340 
so the V or you know you'd like to be
have<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:31.520> perfect<00:05:32.030> case<00:05:32.150> but<00:05:32.420> it<00:05:32.690> has<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.110> do

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
have a perfect case but it has to do

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.930 
have a perfect case but it has to do
probably<00:05:33.680> more<00:05:33.860> because<00:05:34.130> this<00:05:34.250> is<00:05:34.430> more<00:05:34.670> for

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
probably more because this is more for

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.770 
probably more because this is more for
me<00:05:35.090> for<00:05:35.300> their<00:05:35.560> international<00:05:36.560> galaxy<00:05:37.070> s2<00:05:37.780> but

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
me for their international galaxy s2 but

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
me for their international galaxy s2 but
if<00:05:39.350> you<00:05:39.470> really<00:05:40.960> not<00:05:41.960> worried<00:05:42.170> about<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.440> it

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
if you really not worried about that it

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.850 
if you really not worried about that it
actually<00:05:42.830> fits<00:05:43.670> really<00:05:43.940> nicely<00:05:44.240> in<00:05:44.540> it

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
actually fits really nicely in it

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.680 
actually fits really nicely in it
actually<00:05:45.860> that's<00:05:46.160> hardly<00:05:46.610> any<00:05:46.910> thickness<00:05:47.330> to

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
actually that's hardly any thickness to

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.710 
actually that's hardly any thickness to
it<00:05:47.720> keeps<00:05:48.290> a<00:05:48.410> very<00:05:48.530> minimal<00:05:49.570> there's<00:05:50.570> the

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
it keeps a very minimal there's the

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.440 
it keeps a very minimal there's the
opening<00:05:51.080> butcher<00:05:51.410> and<00:05:52.190> again<00:05:52.460> as<00:05:52.730> you<00:05:53.120> can<00:05:53.270> see

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
opening butcher and again as you can see

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.690 
opening butcher and again as you can see
that<00:05:53.480> other<00:05:54.050> mic<00:05:54.320> it<00:05:54.560> is<00:05:54.770> covered<00:05:55.160> up<00:05:55.340> here

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.980 
can see where the mic is at underneath
there<00:06:05.480> so<00:06:06.410> there's<00:06:07.160> a<00:06:07.250> power<00:06:07.720> and<00:06:08.720> the<00:06:08.810> others
