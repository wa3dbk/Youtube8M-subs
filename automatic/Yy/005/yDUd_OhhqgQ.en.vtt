 walk with all objects or at all 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:33.500
 except the lock tools that can wait I 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.500
 were looking for a little 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:43.609
 in short, it's the tools we're going to say that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.929
 fout armor tools So here 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.909
 down first you need a jam 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.359
 anything depends on what you 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:53.929
 want to duplicate 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.920
 so wait for my minecraft very little 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.320
 here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.379
 you take what you want me I 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 take diamond and they end you there 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.670
 you need 2 minimum it is necessary that your 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.290
 comment is empty and you need the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.390
 diamond in the first box of 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.500
 the inventory beating is what is it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.960
 that they must be found so 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.950
 for that flat after you have them 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.780
 two diamonds then you go on the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 second box and you long press 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.429
 on the second box and it'll come out a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.920
 diamond you are harvesting it trimmed and if 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.560
 I harvest not indifferent and then the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.750
 time it does not come out of others so 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 you think well to harvest otherwise it does not 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.509
 will not walk and that's where it works and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.330
 so you see I can make it flat 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.180
 flat dish 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.610
