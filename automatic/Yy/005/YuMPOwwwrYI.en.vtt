00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.450
 hello i'm from the ballerinas and 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.880
 we have our video for the song 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.050
 megavolt quite a lot of questions have come what 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.410
 do you have there with your gaps 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.410
 made 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.160
 a great effect that no 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590
 crazy makeup not rocket science, the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.060
 are gaps tattoos and different than in 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.009
 We can give you other tutorials 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.079
 correct the insider tips and tricks 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.759
 betray how they hold the whole evening 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.649
 and you look great because we have the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.960
 easy to use constantly at concerts 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.570
 even use when we sing and exactly 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.010
 know how to use them what needs 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.540
 because you ever tinker 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.400
 In any case , you need one 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.170
 Nail scissors with the beautiful fine 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.059
 Contours can cut for the lips 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 you also need, for example 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.020
 cotton pads could also be one 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.609
 take up sponge or loaf paper 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.129
 each one consumed something with her 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.570
 absorb liquid can it can also 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.160
 be a rag there but whatever 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.149
 The best thing is water 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.890
 can absorb 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.660
 You also need to feel one 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.070
 not necessarily is but is better 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.720
 one of our secret tips and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.700
 tricks are also possible without filling but better 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.490
 would be one and not to forget 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.470
 you need tattoos and the ones you want 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.539
 from tracy factory because they have the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.679
 internet are the biggest selection and are 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.679
 also most unfavorable 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.960
 if you are a co-initiator 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.229
 I decided then he grabs it 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.920
 very carefully because the foil 350th 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.200
 break away and then break here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.479
 very carefully from this stencil the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.700
 lips out now it's about that 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.789
 Tattoos in the right size to bring 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.140
 that means these are pretty tall and you 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.459
 you have to cut off so much that you're right 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.530
 to fit on your lips 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.600
 It is important what I recommend 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.390
 necessarily prefer a bit more to it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.549
 let everything cut off too much because of that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.079
 rest you can then fold later and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.579
 nobody will see that during this time 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.479
 then again one has a lot of cuts 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.009
 very narrow lips 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.009
 acting yes rather unappealing 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.599
 resistance we make it a bit 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.430
 unlike in other tutorials there was 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.840
 It made me so that the corners first 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.030
 We will cut it off 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.860
 not because I've lid 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 that's really easy to suffer 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.030
 directly along the longitudinal side 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.680
 cut and cut out the corners 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.510
 So it really is in the lips too 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:35.709
 form we are that it over here 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:37.150
 stands and that must rather wm-cut off 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.799
 a little less than that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.000
 otherwise maybe the tattoo is broken 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.049
 and now simply hold again country 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.340
 with me is in any case still one 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.780
 there is still room for a bit of space 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.549
 what is not important from the lips 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.079
 Creaming is best if you have before 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.540
 creamed morning have again right 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.250
 removed with make up remover and mine 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.750
 Geheimtipp is just such a small one 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.079
 Rag or a towel take what 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.239
 is dry and the lips again so 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.220
 rub dry and a little 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.049
 a bit rough if you do that 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.760
 then I can assure you that 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.920
 lip tattoos really really good 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.630
 hold and shine the whole night 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.730
 now it's best to wait 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.510
 Prepare because it must be the same 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.819
 go fast so stand correctly 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.159
 We make a nice job 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.950
 have to be very happy with then 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.019
 I pull off the film dry hands 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.540
 recommend the lower lip first 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.769
 doing it a bit easier 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.030
 and there I can go that much wrong 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.739
 means best with the lower one already 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.930
 practice with the upper then perfect 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.790
 sits and now it has to be very fast 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.220
 the cotton pads are ready to go 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.200
 I'll put it nice and wet 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.799
 then slowly the paper under 10 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.799
 Let's go 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.910
 number one managed now 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.410
 Dab dry with a cloth for something 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.730
 it could be shifted now completely 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.210
 fast if you are old for easy 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.210
 certify 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.400
 For example, at the corners you always have to 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.400
 take care that you still possible 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.889
 Nice corner, I'll sit there too 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.840
 recommending is really when moistening 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.330
 the lips always in the middle begin 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.070
 so nice the wet sponge or the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.419
 cotton pads next to start in the middle 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.250
 and then work slowly outward 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.340
 then we'll take the upper one 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.220
 lip we are now practiced foil 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.870
 start drawing off now must be back 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.340
 start walking fast in the middle and 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.340
 then work outside with the cotton pads 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.860
 it is done but we have to do it now 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.810
 Also take a few actions with it 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.110
 it really lasts the whole evening 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.580
 In any case, pat dry and dry again 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.960
 so that the whole holds the whole evening 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.590
 I recommend you if it is now 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.710
 bit dried is taking him in 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.210
 that 's the hot stage world so 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.650
 really cold air is because 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.510
 do not heat it up as well 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.760
 It's more like we're running 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.470
 filled the whole thing really too 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.030
 dry so the whole thing has to be done once 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.060
 have been properly dried 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.330
 So the whole evening stops 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.330
 it's 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.590
 now have actually done it 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.430
 Now it's just a little bit more 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.229
 have patience 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.669
 I recommend maybe half now 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.220
 hour to drink nothing 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.870
 maybe not too bad too 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.340
 lick or something when you are on 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.780
 a party want to drink something then 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.250
 Simply best from a straw 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.479
 nothing can go wrong then 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.139
 that usually does not go 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.240
 problem 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.740
 Often one has the feeling that the whole 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.289
 maybe it dissolves a bit or 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.389
 but that does not happen so it is said 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.770
 deceive one thinks of us loses itself 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.020
 and still it lasts the whole evening 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.610
 you will notice that at the latest if 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.830
 you try it the next morning 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.539
 many are yours to replace 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.159
 a little oil and make up remover too 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.860
 take with it the whole again 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.210
 Get down and then you will 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.979
 first notice how stuck that actually 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.389
 has held and that you can not do any 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.810
 must worry about the whole evening 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.520
 lay 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.069
 I hope you had fun with ours 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.870
 tutorial and you have to do the beautiful 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.219
 lips on it just comes to me 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.910
 our concert and then we can 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:19.570
 looked at each other 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.570
 megavolt
