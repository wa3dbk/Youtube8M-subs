so this is how i'm wearing it and you're
going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> see<00:00:13.139> how<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.320> got<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:13.950> point<00:00:14.250> um

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
going to see how I got to this point um

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.290 
going to see how I got to this point um
but<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:16.020> love<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.859> way<00:00:16.980> came<00:00:17.310> out<00:00:17.520> when<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> tried

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
but I love the way came out when I tried

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.320 
but I love the way came out when I tried
it<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.510> relaxed<00:00:19.109> hair<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.619> did<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.460> look<00:00:21.270> like

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it on relaxed hair it did not look like

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.630 
it on relaxed hair it did not look like
this<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.439> guess<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> fullness<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
this so I guess the fullness of the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.720 
this so I guess the fullness of the
natural<00:00:23.789> hair<00:00:24.119> helps<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.630> few<00:00:25.590> tips<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.430> can

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
natural hair helps a few tips that I can

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
natural hair helps a few tips that I can
give<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.960> things<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.439> will<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.710> next

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
time you have to let them dry a hundred

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.610 
time you have to let them dry a hundred
percent<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.480> mine<00:00:33.809> were<00:00:34.110> dry<00:00:34.380> about

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
percent I think mine were dry about

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.740 
percent I think mine were dry about
ninety-five<00:00:35.309> percent<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.030> then<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.660> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
ninety-five percent and then one in the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.709 
ninety-five percent and then one in the
back<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.680> don't<00:00:38.579> know<00:00:38.670> what<00:00:39.180> happened<00:00:39.210> there

if you can let them dry thoroughly after

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.939 
if you can let them dry thoroughly after
I<00:00:47.450> did<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.200> damp<00:00:50.129> dry<00:00:50.550> hair<00:00:50.850> um<00:00:51.149> I

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
I did them on like damp dry hair um I

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.130 
I did them on like damp dry hair um I
went<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> sleep<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.690> next<00:00:54.719> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
went to sleep and then the next this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
went to sleep and then the next this
morning<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.770> did<00:00:55.829> two<00:00:56.160> under<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.399> dryer<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
morning I did two under the dryer for

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.220 
morning I did two under the dryer for
about<00:00:57.239> 45<00:00:57.719> minutes<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:59.840> sitting<00:01:00.840> under<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
about 45 minutes so sitting under the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.310 
about 45 minutes so sitting under the
dryer<00:01:01.430> definitely<00:01:02.430> helps<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.140> have

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
dryer definitely helps or if you have

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.070 
dryer definitely helps or if you have
time<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.869> whole

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
time to you know like if you get a whole

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
time to you know like if you get a whole
day<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.320> guess<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.010> dry<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.490> I'm

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
day I guess for it to dry so I'm

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.969 
day I guess for it to dry so I'm
definitely<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.720> try<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:10.020> again<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
definitely going to try this again and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.810 
definitely going to try this again and
as<00:01:11.549> far<00:01:11.760> as<00:01:11.820> preserving<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> goes<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.290> mean<00:01:13.820> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
as far as preserving it goes I mean you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.270 
as far as preserving it goes I mean you
could<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.290> bonnet<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.159> whatever

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
could put a bonnet one it or whatever

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
could put a bonnet one it or whatever
but<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> it's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
but it's going to get so much and it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.330 
but it's going to get so much and it's
probably<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> lose<00:01:19.710> some<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> curl

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
probably going to lose some of the curl

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
probably going to lose some of the curl
you<00:01:20.970> could<00:01:21.119> probably<00:01:21.360> try<00:01:21.750> putting<00:01:22.170> flexi

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you could probably try putting flexi

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.450 
you could probably try putting flexi
rods<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.460> mean<00:01:24.439> whatever<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.430> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
rods on it I mean whatever you can do to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
rods on it I mean whatever you can do to
preserve<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:27.180> stay<00:01:27.509> tuned<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
preserve it I'm stay tuned to see the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
preserve it I'm stay tuned to see the
products<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.400> used<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.759> what<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.030> whole

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
products that I used and what my whole

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.390 
products that I used and what my whole
process<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.170> how<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> got<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.130> point

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
process was and how I got to this point

00:01:32.400 --> 00:02:16.900 
process was and how I got to this point
okay

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.910 

the
