00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 now instead of flush we travel 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.830
 to ponteareas in the province of 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.259
 pontevedra because we have to talk 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.300
 very and very clear with the runner-up of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.349
 Spain of asphalt rallies that is not 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.349
 other than alberto meira 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.939
 how about don alberto meira the dew 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.770
 working a little bit a little bit 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.520
 teach would study 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.520
 we go 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.129
 in your workshop here tell us what are you doing 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.980
 days worked by cars 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.100
 worked a little bit with the workshop 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.860
 street cars rally cars and then 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.199
 a little bit also buying and selling that is what 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.870
 that helps a little bit to survive the 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.430
 workshop I'm looking at something very 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.949
 nice good guess very special 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.530
 for you too and well there is some 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.170
 jewel was the first car that we started to 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.390
 running 99-2000 was the first time that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.940
 we ran and are still active today 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.339
 how do you get that with a lot 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.000
 sacrifice with the help of many friends 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.070
 and as a sponsor and the truth that I want 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.530
 difficult this year 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.850
 not posing very much to continue with 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.650
 turning the truth that we're going to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.900
 try to make the Galician championship and 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.450
 some proof of the national thanks to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.190
 8 sponsor that exists this year was 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.410
 incredible not the first season that 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.570
 you made the whole national 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.090
 you managed to achieve that your championship by 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.070
 above good of the swords that are 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.420
 always giving over cars 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.270
 higher, such as, for example, 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.100
 the porches and the r4 was there sending 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.100
 and tightening the monsoon nuts 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.619
 it was clear that it was going to be impossible to 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.770
 keep up with the pace not because of the quality of the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.229
 car that was the potential and the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.630
 budget above all but good I 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.909
 I was clear that with roberto méndez in my 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.909
 preparer that we knew we carry two 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.460
 years working in the car 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.460
 and that their fruits would come 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.010
 now with the theme of the ere 5 and others 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.680
 Roberto Mendez Bueno has the r 4 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.319
 They have the porches but they say that the r 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.080
 4 are cars I had planned to leave 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.200
 a number 5 but good the other day 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.379
 talking to Roberto we do not have it 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.280
 we are not clear if the arga 5 goes to 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:39.190
 be very superior to reading 4 being 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.040
 as long as 5 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.000
 we will see 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.069
 and if they run the risk we do not know a day 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.329
 today what this team are going to do and 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.329
 above all reliable 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.270
 and you were to go for it 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.170
 well let's try it we know it's going 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.660
 to be difficult especially there with Ivan and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.120
 with something else I think it's going to be a year 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.100
 very nice above all to have rivalry 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.240
 healthy with friends 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.240
 and see what happens 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.150
 those race cars we do here in 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.810
 the workshop that we have here on the right 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.430
 alberto good, this is a car 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.340
 mythical nou from here of galicia this was 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.280
 a new 4 the first one that came for 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.220
 Spain that was five times champion 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.720
 Galician and in his day of German castrillón 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.960
 Y 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:46.210
 and good by chance we bought it 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.420
 to a friend and good is at home and 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.270
 and it's renting from time to time and going 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.740
 taking out is taking out its brightness for 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.710
 help us to run living too 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.350
 very nice things out there things that 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.340
 we have there so here we have a clio a 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.800
 clio sport of a pilot from Catalonia who 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.770
 the truth we made a change we did not 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.890
 we sold a new 9 that we had and 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:16.930
 we collected this clip had a kit 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.330
 earth and asphalt and for I do not know what to do 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.040
 change and try to sell it for some 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.170
 national pilot and sisi could not do 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.200
 some ground race or 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.450
 resistance today and talking about 9 how was 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.420
 rockets suárez in madrid and alberto 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.350
 acosta and I knew the car is 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.770
 superior but we come to the end 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.770
 of the season 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.259
 running thanks to roberto the race 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:45.180
 we have to do with a head but I 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.099
 I hit the car and the bottom 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.379
 could run this season for the 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.979
 roof he deserved he ran more than us 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.979
 without anything else 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.020
 and you still have illusions to me 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.759
 would like to know as what dreams 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.009
 would remain to meet or what is it that you 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.180
 I would like to make you say so 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.099
 So I still have not gotten me 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.280
 I would love it to be a championship 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:27.870
 Spain of rallies but last year what 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.259
 We did and you realize it 's super 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.780
 difficult and that everything moves for money 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.389
 by relationships and by many desires that 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.830
 have to be very difficult to get to 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.319
 lose the illusion at some point by 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.030
 that sort of thing if this long - awaited the 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.190
 Galician is because he lost a little bit the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.300
 illusion in fact we work a little bit 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.879
 the theme of the sponsors but 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.069
 On one hand I prefer not to Galician 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.840
 complicate my life is with the 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.210
 Galician federation with the fans 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.220
 Galician that really helps you a lot 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.599
 and not complicate my life Alberto you 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.539
 you have a good team is fine 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:06.360
 positioned you have means but there are others 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.650
 pilots who work with large teams 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.199
 that is yours is a private initiative 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.569
 so to speak but then the 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.250
 championships are full of poses or of 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.990
 pilots that are backed and moss by 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.470
 example occurs to me the case of acs m 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.599
 now they announce that xevi pons is going to run 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.949
 with a 5 rocket ere still not known 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:25.440
 but good they will continue to support 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:29.300
 the world to the spice is in the air what 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.300
 it seems to you in this type of equipment 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:35.520
 the truth is that I think this man 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:38.460
 well 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.560
 is wrong not 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.400
 a Galician gentleman is supporting a 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.800
 bunch of pilots out of their land and 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.020
 then the real pilot who started 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.599
 supporting therefore this year it seems that what 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.490
 leaves out of court 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.410
 the only one who has had a title not if 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.860
 the only thing that has got a title of 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.510
 all the pilots that he has that leaves him 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.210
 a little bit 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:06.870
 out of wave in principle you see that 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:09.960
 sold the car and good businessmen 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.900
 here Galicians and usually go through other 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.000
 teams like nupel and such that they support 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.950
 people outside the Galician are not worth 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.080
 it must be that we speak Galician will have to 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.750
 speak Catalan 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.030
 and good for that are making them 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.900
 own and how we look for the 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:29.159
 life here in galicia we will continue like this 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.319
 good alberto meira a pleasure to chat 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.539
 with you an uncle a pilot who has 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.490
 sought life for 14 years 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.870
 starting to run with tiny cars 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.159
 and that nowadays he has one of the 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.840
 leading cars 

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:42.840
 thank you very much to assist us we are going 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.250
 to stop working and nothing to hope 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:50.699
 I'd like to see you in rolls with that 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:52.409
 enclosure me too if it's better 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:57.080
 then there is at least try 

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:57.080
 earn it again worth it until then
