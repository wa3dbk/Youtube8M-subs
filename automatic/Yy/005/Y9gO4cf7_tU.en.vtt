00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.340
 with the armor 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.049
 we go with the distribution of pieces 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.319
 we started first with the parts of 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.590
 plastic that are the helmet the shoulder pads 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.629
 the bissex cores 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.540
 the pieces that rest on their feet 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.680
 the metal parts comes to be the chest 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.420
 the skirt the arms the mulberry trees and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.920
 legs 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.050
 well I give you vintage rating 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:50.070
 18.5 I do not know why band 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.740
 and included in the shoulder pads those horns 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.730
 this armor is supposed to figure 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.260
 was going to be faithful to the armor version 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.739
 anime 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.530
 but there is something curious because behind the 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:10.000
 box of the figure you see help without those 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.930
 horns 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.180
 for example in this photo you can see here 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:21.360
 the shadow does not have any none 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.360
 same here 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.830
 so 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.530
 this will lower your points as it is 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.270
 for me it is not as faithful faithful to the anime 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.200
 but in spite of that not 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.260
 it does not stop being showy and nice this 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.190
 figure of capi city with me well 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.190

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.290

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.230
 Capricorn still without the pieces that 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.630
 we have a golden tone and everything from 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.420

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.740
