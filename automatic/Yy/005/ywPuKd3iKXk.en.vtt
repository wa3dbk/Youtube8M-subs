so being an athlete prior to being run

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.480 
so being an athlete prior to being run
over<00:03:21.370> has<00:03:22.270> been<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.510> blessing<00:03:22.990> and<00:03:23.080> a<00:03:23.140> curse

over has been a blessing and a curse

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.190 
over has been a blessing and a curse
because<00:03:24.490> for<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> very<00:03:25.180> long<00:03:25.420> time

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
because for a very long time

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.890 
because for a very long time
I<00:03:26.230> wasn't<00:03:26.830> able<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.190> leave<00:03:27.430> bed<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.090> was<00:03:28.630> glued

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
I wasn't able to leave bed I was glued

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.990 
I wasn't able to leave bed I was glued
to<00:03:28.960> a<00:03:29.140> costume<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.680> bag<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.160> wound<00:03:30.400> back<00:03:30.700> and

to a costume a bag and a wound back and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000 
to a costume a bag and a wound back and
so<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:32.050> had<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.710> choice<00:03:32.980> I<00:03:33.490> can<00:03:34.200> be<00:03:35.200> still<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.950> be

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
so I had a choice I can be still and be

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.490
