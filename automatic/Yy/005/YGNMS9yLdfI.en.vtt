00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.800
 Excuse me in the middle of nowhere

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.980
 I tried to do that revenge whether to make meringue with food processor 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.110
 But 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:25.550
 Some of you who watched the video, is that time of the first time? 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.820
 That it if there is a First Well various causes to the other in its center you wish to put you 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.570
 Various in the comments 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.640
 Laozi can do it for me 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.540
 Well, I'm improving it and I've come to the Ma's Revenge match, but it's also the result. 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.390
 You watched the channel 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.000
 Well then 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.350
 It is casually this now 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.879
 Food processor 6 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.950
 It is in something this Well Kedomo I was watching description tone 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.079
 In that 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.289
 That 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.680
 Those who have seen the production line of the genre or how to use 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.440
 Well the treble says 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.600
 Well that 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.330
 It will teach you how to put meat and vegetables in the corner and make it easy to do. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.850
 But there is also 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.330
 In it 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.330
 Do you see 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.720
 Can you understand 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.110
 Do not use for whipping raw cream egg white 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.550
 It is say was each other big time is a note 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.159
 I say it should not be possible 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.120
 It is to say 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.510
 For example Mars 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.870
 I say that I can not do it 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.780
 I think there are things that depend on things 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:52.440
 Well if you have a chance to buy another food processor someday 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:59.730
 There is no such thing at all right now, but as revenge at that time 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:02.570
 It 's hard to stop this fight because it is a one-sided loss here 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.570
 I would like to receive
