00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.290
 let's go to the sports to see vicente 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.650
 hospital very good good children 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.259
 federico good 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.750
 tell me your version of the final and the 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.429
 world first place at the end I 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.230
 I think a pretty murky party during the 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.410
 first 90 minutes is true with 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.900
 chances for Argentina spoiled by 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.539
 an equal that was frankly fail 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.089
 as in his winning days there we have 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.759
 seen not many years ago yesterday 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:33.730
 Higuain is capable of failing so that neither 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.430
 baby would be in the crib, that is already 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.710
 that's how it is not that it endorses or whether 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.409
 Wayne then scored goal is weird is 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.629
 very difficult the highway to create 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.729
 chances are now ideal to fail 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.229
 Goal chances are also an exact 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.909
 Well, yesterday, higuaín was 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.500
 frankly fallon and I read messi that 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.869
 again he was the player of 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 field that less ran in Argentina than 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:57.909
 those who played the 120 minutes if not 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.320
 they could be reserving for those 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.610
 because it's already finished global so 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.460
 We do not know what is being reserved for 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.189
 but for the olympic games of the river 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.080
 for that it's not going to be sprinters for 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.689
 represent argentina they were going to go to 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.810
 win at the moment how is everything 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.070
 trap they will put 100 meters but in 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.540
 the 60 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.980
 and win messi 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.620
 you will see or say that there are not 110 left and that 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.610
 they have stopped at 100 and there are more and 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.620
 that will win messi that will come limping 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.930
 yesterday when it seemed that we were going to 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.440
 the penalties in 112 appeared mario 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.120
 götze that has managed to make a milestone 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.490
 in this world cup getting a goal 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.140
 after not having made a good 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.120
 performance nor in the game yesterday when 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.680
 it was when he jumped onto the pitch 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.900
 horrific horrible durán has made a 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.940
 horrific world because yesterday it becomes 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.010
 in historical in historical player for 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.040
 Germany the legend for the Germans 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.750
 with that goal in 112 germany gets 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.790
 his fourth world title and by the way 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.680
 becomes the first European team in 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.259
 to win in South America something that had not been 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.030
 got before so germany 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.650
 got scored but the striking thing is that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.080
 I think they gave messi that was one 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.910
 of the worst of the party they gave him the 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.920
 award for the best player in the world 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.870
 we will also go global the hoop better 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.760
 player of the world golden ball but yes 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.860
 not nothing a kick in a pot played 10 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.290
 minutes in the first part and there 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.680
 ended month and we will explain it from a 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.680
 shape 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.310
 in no way explains explains that I 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.870
 not everything is based on the fact that this prize is 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.489
 sponsored by adidas is true that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.829
 adidas is German but you can see that he has 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.599
 Primate more in his image that is leo 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.420
 messi the money they deposit in leo 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.519
 messi to give him to compensate is 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.930
 inexplicable really that the Argentine 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.090
 has taken the title of best 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.909
 player of this world cup he has been 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.950
 one of the worst in Argentina 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.140
 of the world cup of argentina I think it's a 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.030
 regulate precisely in Argentina that has 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.829
 there was a game like Mascherano that has 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.420
 got a spectacular world cup if 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.730
 you go in a final is good there are some 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.260
 little known Enzo Perez to me has 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.940
 seemed like I 've also done a world 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.500
 that the normal thing is to give the title to 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.569
 team someone from the champion team like 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.239
 thomas müller or even before or toni 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.760
 kross or I would have given it to the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.370
 goalkeeper or for me the superiority of 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.290
 Germania was in not yesterday and except in 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.530
 the end the end and the cross I did not see it 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.930
 they did not cover it very well or did not have their 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.300
 gold day they marked it very well because 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.490
 the Argentines and the clubs 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.370
 that already has its beautiful of burn ea 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.580
 wife that they are killing him before his 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.950
 eyes and the referee saw it with the cheekbone 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.530
 broken he got six kicks in the 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.630
 ankle two in the shin now german 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.540
 that is let's go up a drum for 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.129
 football 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.569
 a game in which two teams play and 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.969
 Germany always wins good 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.099
 say that yesterday German this of the 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.590
 bad German parties have to say that 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.629
 he only managed to make a great 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.069
 performance in the mineirao against Brazil 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.439
 because Germany has been criticized 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.750
 also throughout the serial by the 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.900
 absence of quality and of brilliant would be 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.299
 you also pay and helped her pretty much you know 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.069
 the team that to me now that it's over 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.799
 that I liked the World Cup 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.750
 colombia england on the terreta that 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.019
 it was through the back door it went like 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.090
 us but hey there are ways of can 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.910
 go miserably like Spain and you can 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.130
 go playing one in england I loved it 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.530
 be the first two games lost 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.240
 but he could perfectly win the two and 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.590
 besides playing and also very very well 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.759
 If you highlight that England was the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.259
 first of change means that it is 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.770
 that in this world cup there has been no one 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:43.289
 has arrived a something of colombia something of 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.060
 German no longer a lot and has the ministry 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.449
 but but there has not been anything is 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.729
 very bad world 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.879
 and frankly good and here in fichamos 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.770
 today, today, it seems that the 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.479
 negotiations with the bayern of Munich 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.529
 by toni kross because you have to say that 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.080
 everyone assumes that all or 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.819
 crochet is signed last night even this 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.099
 that is so fashionable that you have to 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.800
 start to repudiate social networks a 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.270
 called fake officially announced 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.400
 the signing of toni kroos for the real 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.990
 Madrid but until now it has not been 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.639
 closed that signing and there is agreement with 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.819
 the player but with Bayern Munich 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.009
 not good but the margin of the bayern is 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.139
 limited because each has one year 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.789
 guardiola how is it so bad this was still 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.560
 to have him on the bench but it's 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.999
 unexplainable is a player and we are going to 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.289
 see how much it comes out of the bayern but it's going to 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:29.020
 play in real Madrid good and the 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.169
 It is true that it is going to the 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.060
 psg to the country to the sister in di Maria and 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.259
 then bless james or not good there 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.550
 there is one important thing that is of the 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.020
 fair play financial el paris saint 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.939
 germain has already spent 50 million in 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.499
 david luis the chelsea player and 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.879
 now he does not have much more room to 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:44.860
 sign an angel di Maria because the 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.639
 remedy to ask 60 million euros for 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.039
 angel di maría 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.749
 we must burn 70 for the other one because 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.110
 less better that it does not end up being 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:53.200
 taste 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.080
 it is not clear if he wants to continue or not 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.850
 he wants to leave only knows everyone 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.200
 well let's see what happens to 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.120
 starting tomorrow 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.740
 starts in the preseason and real 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.780
 madrid-barça very well very well very well 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.210
 start football really be no longer 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.610
 more scams no more golden ball no more 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.220
 extensions can sleep lie down the 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.500
 our today that well thanks vicente

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.760
 days and this pattern is then maintained the 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.760
