00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
it's a three cylinder engines as

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.139 
it's a three cylinder engines as
everybody<00:00:45.409> knows<00:00:45.620> they<00:00:46.159> do<00:00:46.219> have<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:46.789> sort

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
everybody knows they do have that sort

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.629 
everybody knows they do have that sort
of<00:00:47.210> on/off<00:00:47.659> hesitation<00:00:48.409> which<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.519> know<00:00:49.609> I

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:49.639 
of on/off hesitation which you know I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.189 
of on/off hesitation which you know I
guess<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.059> inherent<00:00:50.510> with<00:00:50.629> something<00:00:51.019> that's

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
guess is inherent with something that's

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.169 
guess is inherent with something that's
it's<00:00:51.499> not<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.649> twin<00:00:51.889> it's<00:00:52.069> not<00:00:52.159> four<00:00:52.489> runs<00:00:53.120> a

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
it's not a twin it's not four runs a

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.579 
it's not a twin it's not four runs a
balance<00:00:53.510> shaft<00:00:53.719> otherwise<00:00:54.139> the<00:00:54.289> thing<00:00:54.469> it'd

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
balance shaft otherwise the thing it'd

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.039 
balance shaft otherwise the thing it'd
probably<00:00:54.710> vibrate<00:00:55.339> itself<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:55.819> pieces<00:00:56.059> but

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:57.049 
probably vibrate itself to pieces but

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:58.509 
probably vibrate itself to pieces but
it's<00:00:57.229> a<00:00:57.409> it's<00:00:57.440> an<00:00:57.739> interesting<00:00:57.920> bike<00:00:58.219> like

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
it's a it's an interesting bike like

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.759 
it's a it's an interesting bike like
it's<00:00:58.699> got<00:00:58.940> a<00:00:59.239> hell<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.959> lot<00:01:00.109> of<00:01:00.199> power<00:01:00.379> that

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
it's got a hell of a lot of power that

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.240 
it's got a hell of a lot of power that
runs<00:01:01.010> from<00:01:01.219> about<00:01:01.399> 4,000<00:01:02.269> to<00:01:02.420> 6,000<00:01:03.049> rpm<00:01:03.469> once

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
runs from about 4,000 to 6,000 rpm once

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.910 
runs from about 4,000 to 6,000 rpm once
you<00:01:04.369> get<00:01:04.549> out<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.789> that<00:01:04.960> 4,000<00:01:05.960> zone<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:06.649> not

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
you get out of that 4,000 zone it's not

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.730 
you get out of that 4,000 zone it's not
too<00:01:07.100> bad<00:01:07.280> between<00:01:07.579> three<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.119> four<00:01:08.740> really
