any other ones outside of that no there
is<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.410> have<00:02:43.599> go<00:02:44.599> like

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.610

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
then go EBG it stays on that a little

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.740 
then go EBG it stays on that a little
longer

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.670

would<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:08.870> lift<00:04:08.989> that<00:04:09.049> rate<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:14.200> okay<00:04:15.200> then

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
would just lift that rate so okay then

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.159 
would just lift that rate so okay then
we<00:04:16.190> move<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.400> E<00:04:16.549> major<00:04:16.850> again<00:04:19.930> let<00:04:20.930> me<00:04:20.989> play

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
we move to E major again let me play

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:36.580 
we move to E major again let me play
what<00:04:21.290> we<00:04:21.320> just<00:04:21.440> did

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.320 

so<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.190> get<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.430> stay<00:04:37.580> on<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.790> cords<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.090> little

so you get to stay on the cords a little

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.580 
so you get to stay on the cords a little
