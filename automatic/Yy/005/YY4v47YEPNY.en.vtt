00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.929 

so<00:00:19.599> yesterday<00:00:19.840> we<00:00:20.080> used<00:00:20.470> this<00:00:20.859> jig<00:00:21.250> and<00:00:21.820> the

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:21.939 
so yesterday we used this jig and the

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.909 
so yesterday we used this jig and the
table<00:00:22.269> saw<00:00:22.420> to<00:00:22.480> create<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.960> outside<00:00:23.380> cup<00:00:23.680> of<00:00:23.800> a

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
table saw to create the outside cup of a

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.470 
table saw to create the outside cup of a
ball<00:00:24.130> and<00:00:24.460> then<00:00:24.580> when<00:00:24.699> use<00:00:24.820> this<00:00:24.970> jig<00:00:25.240> with<00:00:25.449> a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
ball and then when use this jig with a

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.659 
ball and then when use this jig with a
spike<00:00:25.930> with<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:26.349> gear<00:00:27.070> in<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.430> create

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
spike with the gear in it to create

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.069 
spike with the gear in it to create
spirals<00:00:28.270> along<00:00:28.539> that<00:00:28.720> exterior

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
spirals along that exterior

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.050 
spirals along that exterior
circumference<00:00:29.650> and<00:00:30.279> it<00:00:30.369> looked<00:00:30.550> really<00:00:30.730> cool

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
circumference and it looked really cool

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.790 
circumference and it looked really cool
but<00:00:31.840> today<00:00:32.050> we're<00:00:32.259> going<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:32.439> do<00:00:32.529> something<00:00:32.710> a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
but today we're going to do something a

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.840 
but today we're going to do something a
little<00:00:32.860> different<00:00:33.309> I'm<00:00:33.430> going<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.670> show<00:00:33.820> you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
little different I'm going to show you

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.880 
little different I'm going to show you
how<00:00:34.120> you<00:00:34.180> can<00:00:34.390> make<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.600> bowl<00:00:34.839> on<00:00:35.080> this<00:00:35.230> jig<00:00:35.589> the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
how you can make a bowl on this jig the

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.439 
how you can make a bowl on this jig the
outside<00:00:36.280> shape<00:00:36.519> of<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:36.760> ball<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.120> add<00:00:37.239> some

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
outside shape of a ball and add some

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:38.970 
outside shape of a ball and add some
details<00:00:37.870> with<00:00:38.079> some<00:00:38.260> different<00:00:38.620> features

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
details with some different features

00:00:38.980 --> 00:01:04.369 
details with some different features
attachments<00:00:39.730> so<00:00:40.420> let's<00:00:40.570> get<00:00:40.720> started

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.570 

well<00:01:05.379> that's<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.770> first<00:01:05.979> time<00:01:06.159> I<00:01:06.190> used<00:01:06.460> the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
well that's the first time I used the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.660 
well that's the first time I used the
router<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:07.030> do<00:01:07.180> this<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:08.860> not<00:01:09.130> impressed

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
router to do this and I'm not impressed

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.800 
router to do this and I'm not impressed
I<00:01:09.729> like<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.060> table-saw<00:01:10.600> much<00:01:11.590> better<00:01:12.810> if

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
I like the table-saw much better if

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.510 
I like the table-saw much better if
there<00:01:13.960> was<00:01:14.080> more<00:01:14.290> tear<00:01:14.560> out<00:01:14.740> it<00:01:15.100> was<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.250> lot

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
there was more tear out it was a lot

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.240 
there was more tear out it was a lot
more<00:01:15.550> aggressive<00:01:15.880> than<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:17.440> table<00:01:17.650> saw<00:01:17.950> was

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
more aggressive than the table saw was

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.249 
more aggressive than the table saw was
and<00:01:18.670> I've<00:01:18.970> sanded<00:01:19.210> this<00:01:19.479> out<00:01:19.720> quite<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.020> bit

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
and I've sanded this out quite a bit

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:21.899 
and I've sanded this out quite a bit
already<00:01:20.440> I<00:01:20.920> know<00:01:21.400> something<00:01:21.700> you're<00:01:21.790> thinking

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
already I know something you're thinking

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.790 
already I know something you're thinking
right<00:01:22.210> now<00:01:22.300> he<00:01:22.630> should<00:01:22.840> have<00:01:22.930> slowed<00:01:23.140> down<00:01:23.170> I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
right now he should have slowed down I

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.520 
right now he should have slowed down I
tried<00:01:24.490> that<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.940> slowed<00:01:25.330> it<00:01:25.360> down<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.899> about<00:01:26.020> 60

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
tried that I slowed it down to about 60

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.149 
tried that I slowed it down to about 60
rpm<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.340> it<00:01:28.270> was<00:01:28.509> more<00:01:29.350> aggressive<00:01:29.649> than<00:01:30.009> it

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
rpm and it was more aggressive than it

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.190 
rpm and it was more aggressive than it
is<00:01:30.310> now<00:01:30.490> it<00:01:30.670> was<00:01:30.790> much<00:01:31.000> harder<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.420> control<00:01:31.750> the

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
is now it was much harder to control the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.279 
is now it was much harder to control the
the<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.430> lever<00:01:33.640> action<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.869> faster

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
the the lever action on it the faster

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.139 
the the lever action on it the faster
speeds<00:01:35.560> actually<00:01:35.770> was<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.399> lot<00:01:36.670> easier<00:01:37.030> to

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
speeds actually was a lot easier to

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.139 
speeds actually was a lot easier to
control<00:01:37.539> in<00:01:37.750> them<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.429> end<00:01:39.640> grain<00:01:39.789> is

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
control in them and on the end grain is

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.150 
control in them and on the end grain is
when<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.360> got<00:01:40.600> real<00:01:41.200> bad<00:01:41.350> tear<00:01:41.710> out<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.070> I'm

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
when I got real bad tear out and I'm

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.410 
when I got real bad tear out and I'm
sure<00:01:42.340> I<00:01:42.369> could<00:01:42.610> try<00:01:42.789> a<00:01:42.820> couple<00:01:43.060> of<00:01:43.149> different

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
sure I could try a couple of different

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.240 
sure I could try a couple of different
pits<00:01:43.570> maybe<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.840> bulb<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.380> would<00:01:44.800> probably<00:01:45.130> help

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
pits maybe a bulb it would probably help

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.029 
pits maybe a bulb it would probably help
with<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:46.300> again<00:01:46.509> first<00:01:46.990> one<00:01:47.200> play<00:01:47.920> with

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
with that but again first one play with

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.639 
with that but again first one play with
that<00:01:48.190> in<00:01:48.340> future<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:49.929> did<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.229> because<00:01:50.410> I

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
that in future and I did this because I

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:51.990 
that in future and I did this because I
thought<00:01:50.800> you<00:01:51.310> know<00:01:51.399> there<00:01:51.550> might<00:01:51.640> be<00:01:51.700> some<00:01:51.910> of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
thought you know there might be some of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.310 
thought you know there might be some of
you<00:01:52.119> who<00:01:52.149> are<00:01:52.240> interested<00:01:52.630> in<00:01:52.690> doing<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:53.110> but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
you who are interested in doing this but

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.930 
you who are interested in doing this but
would<00:01:53.619> be<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:54.100> little<00:01:54.429> bit<00:01:54.520> nervous<00:01:54.729> about

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
would be a little bit nervous about

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.460 
would be a little bit nervous about
using<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.360> table<00:01:55.660> saw<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.840> make<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:56.229> shape

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
using the table saw to make this shape

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.320 
using the table saw to make this shape
but<00:01:57.039> if<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.220> see<00:01:57.399> my<00:01:57.520> last<00:01:57.700> video<00:01:57.880> where<00:01:58.179> he

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
but if you see my last video where he

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.960 
but if you see my last video where he
took<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.690> where<00:01:58.990> we<00:01:59.080> use<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.380> table<00:01:59.679> saw<00:01:59.970> it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
took the where we use the table saw it

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.310 
took the where we use the table saw it
took<00:02:01.149> two<00:02:01.390> minutes<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.899> make<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.170> outside

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
took two minutes to make the outside

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.460 
took two minutes to make the outside
shape<00:02:02.800> on<00:02:03.069> a<00:02:03.459> bowl<00:02:03.849> of<00:02:04.060> hardwood<00:02:04.599> now<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.349> is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
shape on a bowl of hardwood now this is

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.320 
shape on a bowl of hardwood now this is
a<00:02:05.500> mix<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.920> hardwood<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.399> softwood<00:02:06.759> it's<00:02:07.179> got

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
a mix of hardwood and softwood it's got

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.000 
a mix of hardwood and softwood it's got
old<00:02:07.539> black<00:02:07.899> walnut<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.530> cedar<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.399> and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
old black walnut and cedar in it and

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.050 
old black walnut and cedar in it and
this<00:02:12.010> took<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.250> lot<00:02:12.340> longer<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.760> was<00:02:12.910> about

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
this took a lot longer this was about

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.510 
this took a lot longer this was about
7-8<00:02:13.510> minutes<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.920> know<00:02:15.040> raising<00:02:15.250> that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
7-8 minutes of you know raising that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.729 
7-8 minutes of you know raising that
router<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:16.000> slowly<00:02:16.270> into<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.050> cut<00:02:17.560> make

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
router but slowly into it to cut make

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.770 
router but slowly into it to cut make
that<00:02:17.920> cut<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:18.730> anyway<00:02:18.970> now<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.510> we've<00:02:19.630> got

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
that cut but anyway now that we've got

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.809 
that cut but anyway now that we've got
the<00:02:19.900> shape<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.410> want<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.040> do<00:02:21.130> some<00:02:21.340> details<00:02:21.700> and

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
the shape I want to do some details and

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.130 
the shape I want to do some details and
I<00:02:21.880> wanted<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.209> show<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.630> feature<00:02:22.870> I'd

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
I wanted to show you this feature I'd

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.830 
I wanted to show you this feature I'd
added<00:02:23.440> right<00:02:23.560> here<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.459> just<00:02:24.580> uh<00:02:24.840> this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
added right here this is just uh this

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.390 
added right here this is just uh this
adds<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.230> little<00:02:26.500> increments<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.250> have

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
adds a little increments that I have

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.220 
adds a little increments that I have
stop<00:02:27.640> positions<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.270> can<00:02:28.420> put<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.599> pin<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:28.840> here

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
stop positions I can put a pin in here

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.930 
stop positions I can put a pin in here
and<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.620> will<00:02:29.770> stop<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.220> at<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> certain<00:02:30.550> point

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
and that will stop it at a certain point

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.670 
and that will stop it at a certain point
and<00:02:31.209> what<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> want<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.379> with<00:02:32.530> this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and what I want to do with this

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.110 
and what I want to do with this
particular<00:02:32.860> Bowl<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.550> I'd<00:02:33.670> like<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.940> put<00:02:34.090> a

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
particular Bowl is I'd like to put a

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.510 
particular Bowl is I'd like to put a
band<00:02:34.450> around<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.440> outside<00:02:35.860> edge<00:02:36.099> of<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
band around the outside edge of it and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.540 
band around the outside edge of it and
then<00:02:36.610> add<00:02:36.730> some<00:02:36.910> details<00:02:37.300> underneath<00:02:37.599> it's

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
then add some details underneath it's

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.190 
then add some details underneath it's
okay<00:02:39.550> I've<00:02:39.700> added<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.150> pen<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.599> my<00:02:40.720> eleven

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
okay I've added a pen in my eleven

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.140 
okay I've added a pen in my eleven
position<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.310> what<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.580> will<00:02:42.700> do<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.940> just

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
position and what that will do is just

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.970 
position and what that will do is just
stop<00:02:43.450> me<00:02:43.660> when<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.870> get<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.230> certain<00:02:44.500> point<00:02:44.800> it

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
stop me when I get to a certain point it

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.619 
stop me when I get to a certain point it
won't<00:02:45.040> let<00:02:45.190> me<00:02:45.250> go<00:02:45.340> any<00:02:45.610> further<00:02:45.879> so<00:02:46.540> I'll

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
won't let me go any further so I'll

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.140 
won't let me go any further so I'll
raise<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.989> router<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.440> I'll<00:02:47.590> take<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:48.150> one

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
raise the router in I'll take a one

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.000 
raise the router in I'll take a one
single<00:02:49.569> pass<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.989> maybe<00:02:50.080> take<00:02:50.319> off<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.560> quarter

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
single pass and maybe take off a quarter

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.619 
single pass and maybe take off a quarter
inch<00:02:51.190> or<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.550> so<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.360> it'll<00:02:52.540> be<00:02:52.599> a

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
inch or so so that is it it'll be a

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.150 
inch or so so that is it it'll be a
raised<00:02:52.900> ban<00:02:53.230> up<00:02:53.410> on<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.770> and<00:02:53.890> then<00:02:54.040> we'll

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
raised ban up on that and then we'll

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:10.090 
raised ban up on that and then we'll
switch<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.400> our<00:02:54.610> next<00:02:54.819> position

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.230 

okay<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:11.190> throwing<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.520> little<00:03:11.610> finish<00:03:12.060> on

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
okay I'm throwing a little finish on

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.420 
okay I'm throwing a little finish on
here<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:13.380> two<00:03:13.500> reasons<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.950> wanted<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
here for two reasons I wanted the

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.980 
here for two reasons I wanted the
bandwidth<00:03:14.880> really<00:03:15.090> wasn't<00:03:15.240> showing<00:03:15.540> up<00:03:15.750> very

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
bandwidth really wasn't showing up very

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.170 
bandwidth really wasn't showing up very
well<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.470> this<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.250> band<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.760> cut

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
well and this is the band we just cut

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.050 
well and this is the band we just cut
here<00:03:18.540> along<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:19.560> edge<00:03:19.800> that's<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.850> little

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
here along this edge that's a little

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.300 
here along this edge that's a little
raised<00:03:21.330> band<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.020> we<00:03:22.890> could<00:03:23.010> add<00:03:23.130> some

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
raised band and we could add some

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.980 
raised band and we could add some
details<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:23.880> some<00:03:24.210> cross<00:03:24.420> sectioning

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
details to that some cross sectioning

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.060 
details to that some cross sectioning
just<00:03:25.200> by<00:03:25.350> using<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.920> pin<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.550> there's<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:28.070> right

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
just by using the pin up there's a right

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.130 
just by using the pin up there's a right
here<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.340> have<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.640> wheel<00:03:29.970> on<00:03:30.240> here<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.690> has

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
here I have a wheel on here that has

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.140 
here I have a wheel on here that has
indexing<00:03:31.800> points<00:03:32.250> where<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.430> can<00:03:32.610> put<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> pin<00:03:33.030> in

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
indexing points where I can put a pin in

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.060 
indexing points where I can put a pin in
it<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.390> that'll<00:03:33.600> stop<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.530> then<00:03:34.800> we<00:03:34.920> could

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
it and that'll stop it and then we could

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.130 
it and that'll stop it and then we could
put<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.250> different<00:03:35.640> bin<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.360> bring<00:03:36.990> it

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
put a different bin in and just bring it

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.780 
put a different bin in and just bring it
down<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.709> could<00:03:38.010> cut<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.490> little

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
down and we could cut a little

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.940 
down and we could cut a little
incremental<00:03:39.600> grooves<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.380> along<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:40.590> ban

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
incremental grooves and along that ban

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.380 
incremental grooves and along that ban
or<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.310> whatever<00:03:41.490> we<00:03:41.730> wanted<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.000> with<00:03:42.239> it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
or do whatever we wanted to with it

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.120 
or do whatever we wanted to with it
maybe<00:03:42.540> add<00:03:42.750> another<00:03:42.930> detail<00:03:43.350> inside<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.920> band

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
maybe add another detail inside the band

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.699 
maybe add another detail inside the band
to<00:03:44.310> make<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:45.120> kind<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.390> set<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.660> off<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:46.680> really

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
to make to kind of set it off but really

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.620 
to make to kind of set it off but really
what<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.070> want<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.310> show<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.550> next<00:03:47.820> is<00:03:48.180> we're

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
what I want to show you next is we're

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.600 
what I want to show you next is we're
gonna<00:03:48.720> add<00:03:48.900> some<00:03:48.930> details<00:03:49.470> down<00:03:49.709> here<00:03:50.190> using

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
gonna add some details down here using

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.910 
gonna add some details down here using
another<00:03:50.880> system<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:52.230> have<00:03:52.320> for<00:03:52.739> this

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
another system that I have for this

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.380 
another system that I have for this
that's<00:03:53.400> really<00:03:53.580> kind<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.030> cool<00:03:54.180> little

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
that's really kind of a cool little

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.110 
that's really kind of a cool little
thing<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.930> also<00:03:55.380> does<00:03:55.770> instead<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
thing it also does instead of like the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.790 
thing it also does instead of like the
the<00:03:57.150> jig<00:03:57.540> yesterday<00:03:57.959> where<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.170> cut<00:03:58.380> those<00:03:58.560> long

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
the jig yesterday where I cut those long

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.130 
the jig yesterday where I cut those long
spirals<00:03:59.790> all<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> way<00:04:00.180> across<00:04:00.480> here<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:00.900> one

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
spirals all the way across here this one

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.920 
spirals all the way across here this one
will<00:04:01.709> cut<00:04:01.920> shorter<00:04:02.340> spirals<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.780> make

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
will cut shorter spirals so you can make

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.680 
will cut shorter spirals so you can make
different<00:04:04.290> shape<00:04:04.530> spirals<00:04:05.420> just<00:04:06.420> with<00:04:06.570> this

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
different shape spirals just with this

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.780 
different shape spirals just with this
one<00:04:06.900> simple<00:04:07.170> thing<00:04:07.560> one<00:04:08.130> simple<00:04:08.459> jig<00:04:08.640> I'm

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
one simple thing one simple jig I'm

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.340 
one simple thing one simple jig I'm
going<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.000> set<00:04:09.600> up<00:04:09.630> on<00:04:09.900> here<00:04:10.080> I'm<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.290> to

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
going to set up on here I'm going to

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.990 
going to set up on here I'm going to
show<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.770> second<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.610> instead<00:04:11.940> of

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
show you in a second so instead of

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.880 
show you in a second so instead of
having<00:04:12.180> those<00:04:12.450> big<00:04:12.630> long<00:04:12.930> spirals<00:04:13.530> going<00:04:13.590> all

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
having those big long spirals going all

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.180 
having those big long spirals going all
the<00:04:13.980> way<00:04:14.010> around<00:04:14.480> they're<00:04:15.480> kind<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.750> shorter

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
the way around they're kind of shorter

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.440 
the way around they're kind of shorter
diagonal<00:04:17.190> spirals<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.760> come<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.060> along<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
diagonal spirals that come up along the

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.599 
diagonal spirals that come up along the
piece<00:04:18.660> here<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.250> we're<00:04:20.250> going<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.400> do<00:04:20.489> that

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
piece here and we're going to do that

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.650 
piece here and we're going to do that
here<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.090> it<00:04:21.540> should<00:04:21.660> be<00:04:21.690> fun<00:04:23.180> okay<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.360> put<00:04:24.450> a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
here so it should be fun okay so I put a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.600 
here so it should be fun okay so I put a
screw<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.020> at<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.560> eleventh<00:04:26.040> position<00:04:26.130> and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
screw in at the eleventh position and

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.260 
screw in at the eleventh position and
the<00:04:26.820> for<00:04:27.030> position<00:04:27.600> here<00:04:28.760> what<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:29.910> does<00:04:30.120> it

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
the for position here what that does it

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.390 
the for position here what that does it
just<00:04:30.300> restricts<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.020> movement<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.680> can't<00:04:32.280> go

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
just restricts the movement I can't go

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.250 
just restricts the movement I can't go
any<00:04:32.550> farther<00:04:32.880> than<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> 11<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.900> can't<00:04:34.110> come

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
any farther than the 11 and I can't come

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.070 
any farther than the 11 and I can't come
any<00:04:34.380> closer<00:04:34.620> than<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.010> four<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:36.810> then<00:04:36.990> I'll

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
any closer than the four so then I'll

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.170 
any closer than the four so then I'll
install<00:04:37.470> this<00:04:37.650> guy<00:04:37.890> right<00:04:38.190> here<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.640> this

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
install this guy right here and this

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.480 
install this guy right here and this
just<00:04:39.210> sits<00:04:39.600> on<00:04:39.720> top<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.169> that<00:04:40.290> hoop<00:04:40.650> this<00:04:41.220> just

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
just sits on top of that hoop this just

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.240 
just sits on top of that hoop this just
sits<00:04:41.669> on<00:04:41.760> top<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.180> that<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:43.410> gear<00:04:43.710> system<00:04:43.950> we

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
sits on top of that the gear system we

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.920 
sits on top of that the gear system we
use<00:04:44.490> yesterday<00:04:44.970> for<00:04:45.150> cutting<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.479> spirals

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
use yesterday for cutting the spirals

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.010 
use yesterday for cutting the spirals
I've<00:04:46.320> just<00:04:46.590> removed<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.220> track<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.850> I've<00:04:48.810> got

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
I've just removed the track and I've got

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.200 
I've just removed the track and I've got
a<00:04:49.260> pin<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.890> there<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.729> I<00:04:50.760> can<00:04:50.940> put<00:04:51.120> in

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
a pin in there that I can put in

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.240 
a pin in there that I can put in
different<00:04:51.330> incremental<00:04:51.870> positions<00:04:52.410> along

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
different incremental positions along

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.940 
different incremental positions along
this<00:04:53.580> field<00:04:53.910> here<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:55.229> what<00:04:55.350> happens<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.830> when

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
this field here so what happens is when

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.750 
this field here so what happens is when
I<00:04:55.979> pull<00:04:56.250> down<00:04:56.280> on<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:57.979> it<00:04:58.979> turns<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.700> whole

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
I pull down on this it turns this whole

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.430 
I pull down on this it turns this whole
assembly<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:00.479> that<00:05:00.780> turns<00:05:01.020> out<00:05:01.200> both

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
assembly and that turns out both

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.950 
assembly and that turns out both
slightly<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.130> I<00:05:02.160> can<00:05:02.430> cut<00:05:02.660> spirals<00:05:03.660> in<00:05:03.840> the

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
slightly so I can cut spirals in the

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.080 
slightly so I can cut spirals in the
side<00:05:04.200> for<00:05:04.229> a<00:05:04.560> detail<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.100> aren't<00:05:05.550> as

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
side for a detail that aren't as

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.580 
side for a detail that aren't as
dramatic<00:05:06.690> as<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.990> ones<00:05:07.169> that<00:05:07.260> we<00:05:07.410> cut

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
dramatic as the ones that we cut

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:39.430 
dramatic as the ones that we cut
yesterday<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:10.770> let's<00:05:10.890> fire<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.130> up

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.680 

that<00:05:40.280> looks<00:05:40.460> like<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.610> really<00:05:40.880> cool<00:05:41.060> detail<00:05:41.330> on

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
that looks like a really cool detail on

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.720 
that looks like a really cool detail on
this<00:05:41.810> vault<00:05:42.140> but<00:05:42.770> if<00:05:42.890> I<00:05:43.010> wanted<00:05:43.280> to<00:05:43.340> add<00:05:43.550> I'll

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
this vault but if I wanted to add I'll

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.580 
this vault but if I wanted to add I'll
just<00:05:43.940> touch<00:05:44.270> more<00:05:44.510> detail<00:05:44.930> or<00:05:45.080> maybe<00:05:45.230> look<00:05:45.470> at

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
just touch more detail or maybe look at

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.960 
just touch more detail or maybe look at
making<00:05:45.890> me<00:05:46.130> make<00:05:46.370> it<00:05:46.400> look<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:46.670> bit<00:05:46.700> more

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
making me make it look a bit more

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.180 
making me make it look a bit more
complicated<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.840> just<00:05:48.320> simply<00:05:48.620> drop<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:48.860> down

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
complicated I just simply drop it down

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.340 
complicated I just simply drop it down
one<00:05:49.250> pin<00:05:51.220> and<00:05:52.220> that<00:05:53.060> moves<00:05:53.330> my<00:05:53.510> position<00:05:54.050> over

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
one pin and that moves my position over

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.540 
one pin and that moves my position over
here<00:05:54.380> roughly<00:05:55.360> about<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.510> just<00:05:57.170> over<00:05:57.320> half<00:05:58.280> inch

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
here roughly about a just over half inch

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.440 
here roughly about a just over half inch
of<00:05:58.700> 5/8<00:05:59.180> of<00:05:59.300> an<00:05:59.420> inch<00:06:00.700> and<00:06:01.700> I<00:06:02.000> could<00:06:02.180> create<00:06:02.390> a

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
of 5/8 of an inch and I could create a

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:58.419 
of 5/8 of an inch and I could create a
second<00:06:02.840> line<00:06:05.320> coming<00:06:06.320> up<00:06:06.470> next<00:06:06.680> to<00:06:06.860> it

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:58.429 

00:06:58.429 --> 00:07:00.649 

okay<00:06:59.429> guys<00:06:59.639> so<00:06:59.849> once<00:07:00.029> again<00:07:00.300> thanks<00:07:00.629> for
