00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.800 

the<00:02:41.410> funny<00:02:41.620> thing<00:02:41.890> about<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.250> bimbo<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.810> that

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the funny thing about the bimbo is that

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.430 
the funny thing about the bimbo is that
it<00:02:44.050> just<00:02:44.650> has<00:02:44.830> five<00:02:45.400> watts<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:47.020> difference

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
it just has five watts so the difference

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.309 
it just has five watts so the difference
between<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:48.010> one<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.580> original

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
between this one and the original

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.229 
between this one and the original
British<00:02:50.319> one<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.280> British<00:02:51.459> one<00:02:51.760> only

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
British one is that the British one only

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.820 
British one is that the British one only
could<00:02:52.420> reach<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.840> sound<00:02:53.080> like<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.470> at<00:02:53.739> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
could reach a sound like this at the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.040 
could reach a sound like this at the
high<00:02:54.099> volume<00:02:54.370> level<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.480> can<00:02:55.660> get<00:02:55.870> the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
high volume level and you can get the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.160 
high volume level and you can get the
sound<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.300> heard<00:02:58.510> from<00:02:58.720> all<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.019> old

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
sound that you heard from all the old

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:25.970 
sound that you heard from all the old
records<00:02:59.380> at<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.069> very<00:03:00.519> very<00:03:00.819> low<00:03:01.150> volume<00:03:01.569> level

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.949 

the<00:03:26.980> fattest<00:03:27.489> possible<00:03:28.030> sound<00:03:28.269> at<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.659> lowest

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
the fattest possible sound at the lowest

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.170 
the fattest possible sound at the lowest
volume<00:03:29.200> that's<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.129> great<00:03:30.370> thing<00:03:30.610> about<00:03:30.819> having

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
volume that's a great thing about having

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.440 
volume that's a great thing about having
this<00:03:31.390> one<00:03:31.750> at<00:03:32.200> home<00:03:32.500> or<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:34.239> smaller<00:03:34.989> clubs<00:03:35.290> and

this one at home or in smaller clubs and
that's<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.540> thing<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:38.019> never<00:03:38.379> experienced

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
that's the thing I never experienced

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.759 
that's the thing I never experienced
with<00:03:39.580> another<00:03:39.879> end<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.900> I've<00:03:41.019> played<00:03:41.200> before

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
with another end that I've played before

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.949 
with another end that I've played before
and<00:03:41.860> you<00:03:42.340> have<00:03:42.489> all<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.790> dynamics<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.510> these

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
and you have all the dynamics of these

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.830 
and you have all the dynamics of these
cool<00:03:44.230> old<00:03:44.470> amps<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.670> can<00:03:45.910> switch<00:03:46.299> down<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.720> a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
cool old amps and I can switch down to a

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:57.240 
cool old amps and I can switch down to a
single<00:03:47.200> coil<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.769> have<00:03:56.069> go<00:03:57.069> through

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
single coil and have go through

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:17.789 
single coil and have go through
humbucker
