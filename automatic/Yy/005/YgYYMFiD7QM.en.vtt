it<00:02:15.020> goes<00:02:15.170> from<00:02:15.350> thin<00:02:15.650> bars<00:02:15.950> too<00:02:16.400> wide<00:02:16.670> back<00:02:17.209> to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
it goes from thin bars too wide back to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.470 
it goes from thin bars too wide back to
thin<00:02:17.660> sleep<00:02:18.590> blades<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:20.950> these<00:02:21.950> circles<00:02:22.490> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
thin sleep blades and these circles the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.510 
thin sleep blades and these circles the
circle<00:02:23.870> circuitry<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.650> always<00:02:24.980> really<00:02:25.190> cool

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
circle circuitry is always really cool

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.490 
circle circuitry is always really cool
against<00:02:26.420> several<00:02:26.690> different<00:02:27.080> ones<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.350> those

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
against several different ones of those

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.140 
against several different ones of those
they<00:02:27.800> look<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.220> can<00:02:28.370> map<00:02:28.520> them<00:02:28.640> overlapping

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
they look we can map them overlapping

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.410 
they look we can map them overlapping
each<00:02:29.480> other<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:31.489> you'll<00:02:31.730> see<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> lot<00:02:32.239> on

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
each other this you'll see a lot on

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.300 
each other this you'll see a lot on
things<00:02:32.720> like<00:02:32.989> ghost<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.470> shell<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.980> know

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
things like ghost in the shell I know

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.010 
things like ghost in the shell I know
some<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.850> levels<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.390> Metal<00:02:35.660> Gear<00:02:35.690> Solid

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
some of the levels in Metal Gear Solid

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.770 
some of the levels in Metal Gear Solid
add<00:02:36.709> these<00:02:37.220> especially<00:02:37.940> towards<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.390> end<00:02:38.420> and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
add these especially towards the end and

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.110 
add these especially towards the end and
I<00:02:38.870> always<00:02:39.080> just<00:02:39.380> love<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.250> aesthetic<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.880> them

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
I always just love the aesthetic of them

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.540 
I always just love the aesthetic of them
but<00:02:41.500> never<00:02:42.500> was<00:02:42.770> really<00:02:43.010> able<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.370> see

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
but never was really able to see

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.300 
but never was really able to see
anything<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.290> duplicated<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.590> effect<00:02:46.010> but

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
anything that duplicated that effect but

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.630 
anything that duplicated that effect but
now<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.950> we<00:02:49.040> got<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:50.950> they<00:02:51.950> have<00:02:52.220> some<00:02:52.430> bar

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
now now we got it they have some bar

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.370 
now now we got it they have some bar
codes<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.180> here<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.390> think<00:02:53.510> I'll<00:02:53.810> throw<00:02:54.080> one<00:02:54.230> of

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
codes in here I think I'll throw one of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.840 
codes in here I think I'll throw one of
those<00:02:54.470> on<00:02:54.739> yours<00:02:55.150> cyborg<00:02:56.150> herb<00:02:56.660> it's<00:02:57.019> the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.360 

little<00:03:01.850> things<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.959> gives<00:03:03.080> us<00:03:03.200> cool<00:03:03.470> little

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
little things is it gives us cool little

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.180 
little things is it gives us cool little
designs<00:03:05.090> like<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:06.170> kind<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.530> kind<00:03:07.040> of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
designs like this just kind of kind of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.470 
designs like this just kind of kind of
cool<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.400> throw<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.760> bunch<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.060> them<00:03:08.150> up<00:03:08.300> on<00:03:08.450> a

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
cool to throw a bunch of them up on a

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.120 
cool to throw a bunch of them up on a
page<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:08.989> see<00:03:09.140> what<00:03:09.290> kind<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.560> designs<00:03:09.920> you

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
page and see what kind of designs you
