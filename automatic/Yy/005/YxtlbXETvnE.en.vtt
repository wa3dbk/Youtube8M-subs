bad<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:09.880> let's<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.209> look<00:02:11.550> requesting

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
bad so let's have a look requesting

bad so let's have a look requesting
overlooked<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:13.510> think<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.170> pretty<00:02:14.350> much<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.680> say

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
overlooked I think it pretty much is say

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.130 
overlooked I think it pretty much is say
that<00:02:15.070> running<00:02:15.220> tasks<00:02:15.730> look<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.330> data

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that running tasks look it's just data

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.220
