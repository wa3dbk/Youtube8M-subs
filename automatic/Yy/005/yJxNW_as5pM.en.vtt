playing a lot of Steam games lately and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.620 
playing a lot of Steam games lately and
there's<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.490> few<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.969> I'd<00:00:12.120> rather<00:00:12.330> use<00:00:12.599> a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
there's a few that I'd rather use a

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.220 
there's a few that I'd rather use a
joystick<00:00:13.549> gamepad<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.820> don't<00:00:15.420> have<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> 360

controller<00:00:16.260> which<00:00:16.890> would<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.300> obviously<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
controller which would be obviously the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.019 
controller which would be obviously the
easier<00:00:18.779> choice<00:00:19.279> simply<00:00:20.279> because<00:00:20.580> most<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
easier choice simply because most of the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.279 
easier choice simply because most of the
games<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.689> plug<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.960> play<00:00:22.109> with

the d-pad left to bring up the menu or

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.020 
the d-pad left to bring up the menu or
scoreboard<00:06:08.560> so<00:06:09.070> as<00:06:09.310> you<00:06:09.430> can<00:06:09.520> see<00:06:09.580> this<00:06:09.820> is<00:06:10.000> a

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
scoreboard so as you can see this is a

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.630 
scoreboard so as you can see this is a
lot<00:06:10.360> more<00:06:10.690> like<00:06:10.900> a<00:06:10.930> PlayStation<00:06:11.530> game<00:06:11.640> not

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
lot more like a PlayStation game not

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.320 
lot more like a PlayStation game not
that<00:06:12.820> that's<00:06:12.910> better

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
that that's better

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.890
