totally control
defensively<00:00:10.310> very<00:00:10.720> wise<00:00:11.720> we<00:00:12.020> gotta<00:00:12.200> get

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
defensively very wise we gotta get

defensively very wise we gotta get
better<00:00:12.559> run<00:00:13.309> protection<00:00:13.940> is<00:00:14.510> twofold<00:00:15.139> you<00:00:15.469> are

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
better run protection is twofold you are

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.290 
better run protection is twofold you are
in<00:00:15.770> continuing<00:00:16.279> the<00:00:16.340> basketball<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.060> gym

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
in continuing the basketball the gym

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.440 
in continuing the basketball the gym
floors<00:00:18.250> then<00:00:19.250> I<00:00:19.279> basically<00:00:19.670> in<00:00:19.910> there<00:00:20.029> earlier

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
floors then I basically in there earlier

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.679

intestinal all at the rim at the apex at

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.540 
intestinal all at the rim at the apex at
the<00:00:23.810> rim<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.259> I<00:00:24.410> think<00:00:24.500> those<00:00:24.800> two<00:00:24.860> areas<00:00:25.189> are

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
the rim so I think those two areas are

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.540 
the rim so I think those two areas are

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
games and eating right getting inside

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.040 
games and eating right getting inside
there<00:01:56.280> whenever<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.880> Michelle

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.840 

we<00:02:03.050> take<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.230> very<00:02:03.500> our<00:02:03.710> scientific<00:02:04.460> approach

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
we take a very our scientific approach

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.210 
we take a very our scientific approach
to<00:02:07.119> we<00:02:08.119> use<00:02:08.300> various<00:02:08.660> forms<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.350> tracking<00:02:09.830> and

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
to we use various forms of tracking and

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.760 
to we use various forms of tracking and
analytics<00:02:10.720> Shinedown<00:02:14.620> consistent<00:02:15.620> with

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
analytics Shinedown consistent with

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.300 
analytics Shinedown consistent with
measures<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.460> were<00:02:16.670> closed<00:02:16.910> Claire<00:02:17.750> loans<00:02:18.310> etc

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
measures of were closed Claire loans etc

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.360 
measures of were closed Claire loans etc
etc<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.050> get<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> feel<00:02:21.500> for<00:02:21.830> mother<00:02:22.010> out

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
etc so we can get a feel for mother out

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.250 
etc so we can get a feel for mother out
of<00:02:22.430> those<00:02:22.730> moving<00:02:23.060> left<00:02:23.300> moving<00:02:23.480> right<00:02:23.840> by

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
of those moving left moving right by

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.550 
of those moving left moving right by
whatever<00:02:25.040> I'm<00:02:25.280> idea<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.540> know<00:02:26.780> when<00:02:27.200> levels

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
whatever I'm idea so we know when levels

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.410 
whatever I'm idea so we know when levels
we<00:02:27.740> target<00:02:29.620> those<00:02:30.620> are<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.830> most<00:02:30.950> important

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
we target those are the most important

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.880 
we target those are the most important
situation<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.600> we<00:02:32.750> worked<00:02:32.990> on<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.350> far<00:02:33.380> again

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
situation that we worked on so far again

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.320 
situation that we worked on so far again
noise<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:35.030> know<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.360> had<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.850> last<00:02:37.850> year's

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
noise you know we had in last year's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.050 
noise you know we had in last year's
game<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.560> think<00:02:39.920> every<00:02:40.310> single<00:02:40.640> time<00:02:40.820> you'd

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
game so I think every single time you'd

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.050 
game so I think every single time you'd
step<00:02:41.270> out<00:02:41.450> there<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:41.840> those<00:02:42.280> final<00:02:43.280> 25<00:02:43.790> later

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
step out there do those final 25 later

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.330 
step out there do those final 25 later
games<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:45.020> it's<00:02:45.440> very<00:02:45.650> important<00:02:46.070> for<00:02:46.100> us

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
games that it's very important for us

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.950 
games that it's very important for us
that<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.640> need<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> do<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.600> guy<00:02:47.750> like

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
that we need to do it can a guy like

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.750 
that we need to do it can a guy like
blue<00:02:48.140> help<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.530> situation<00:02:48.830> yeah<00:02:49.430> maybe
