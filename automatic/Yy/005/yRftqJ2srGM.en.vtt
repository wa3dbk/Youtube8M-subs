vehicles<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.960> thing<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.409> little

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
vehicles the one thing that's a little

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
vehicles the one thing that's a little
unique<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.100> well<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.670> also<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:54.149> what's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
unique as well as we also have what's

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.780 
unique as well as we also have what's
called<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.720> electronic<00:01:55.710> braking<00:01:55.950> distribution

called a electronic braking distribution

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.240 
called a electronic braking distribution
that<00:01:56.909> works<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> ABS<00:01:57.899> brakes<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.649> what

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
that works with the ABS brakes and what

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.359 
that works with the ABS brakes and what
that<00:01:59.430> does<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.860> controller<00:02:01.860> brake

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
that does for you is a controller brake

like that
and<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:09.239> basically<00:02:09.619> redistributes<00:02:10.619> the

that<00:02:15.840> way<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.049> could<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> maximum<00:02:16.909> you

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
that way you could get the maximum you

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.089 
that way you could get the maximum you
know<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.180> breaking<00:02:18.569> stop<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.260> we'll<00:02:19.950> go

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
know the breaking stop on that we'll go

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.089 
know the breaking stop on that we'll go
ahead<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.280> open<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.390> hatch<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.840> show<00:02:22.019> you

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
ahead and open up the hatch and show you

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.100 
ahead and open up the hatch and show you
now<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.159> cs7<00:02:23.909> does<00:02:24.090> offer<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.569> pretty<00:02:24.900> good
