00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.980
 you have cuckoo in new delhi where it's 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.690
 almost the same hello to all this asphalt 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.219
 I hope you like my intro 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 who tears up we left for a 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.119
 new video so still a little 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.590
 rather special video since there it will be 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.760
 just to introduce you a little bit 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.890
 project with my eca flip and then so I 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.420
 will make me a new character end 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.039
 rather take a new character 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.930
 and so that's going to be the theme of this 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.539
 video 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.480
 so my character for the moment so 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.210
 I managed to buy him one 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.100
 cape living object a cape I know 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.380
 what is the name of the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.620
 capers alive that's that's the one 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.079
 against the class and with this character 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.059
 then I start to get back even when not 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.610
 cam ache at 23 million cammas is 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.340
 not bad at all and if we will see by 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.829
 example in my age dvd trophy bar 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.350
 it's not bad at all 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.079
 I mounted forger I'm finally up 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.180
 level 100 shieldsman ago 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.600
 two three days so after to me and 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.859
 to make a name and 7 years of hard work and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.380
 so it will still not bad 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.329
 trophies in hd so will 45 million of 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.079
 karats waiting so I hope to be at 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.569
 60 million kama by the end of the 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.950
 week 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.560
 so we'll see the choice between two 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.179
 characters that I will present to you 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.670
 these two characters there for now 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.439
 are not this done at all so go 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.869
 I'll have to do it with the 60 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.950
 million carats that I hope to have 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.240
 by the end of the week so the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.520
 first character that I can 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.869
 resume his phoenix invokes sorry for 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.909
 the pseudo rotten it was still 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.159
 a long time ago a savoie of a fire 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.259
 invokes that is level without three so 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.630
 it was so I had mounted 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.579
 the intelligence on this character there for 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.950
 installing it pops up so that's what 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.840
 I'm a little annoyed I'll have to do 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.060
 the transfer and that's a bit long and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.109
 then it will be expensive against this 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.090
 character there still a lot 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.590
 more they are written but for those 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.649
 who can not read I go to the sites 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.349
 and so there is little of his fashion ensures falé 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.630
 on dofus in general invocations and 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.370
 in the evening it'll be a very good support 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.440
 for the caf bed not even that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.150
 for feline placements the sting 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.189
 motivating care 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.629
 successes they are not made suddenly 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.310
 I'll have to redo the dungeons 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.189
 all that so it's going to be easy to climb 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.030
 then it'll be pretty interesting 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.099
 it'll give me a bit of a challenge 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.269
 it is a character to ride at least 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.280
 level out of 50 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.810
 a game mode that will change my team 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.879
 book that is going to be not too tchité not 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.230
 too nagging and the stuff is going to be no 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.650
 too expensive at the start since it goes to me 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.879
 have to a level of stuff unparalleled hic 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.409
 the disadvantages a skin color 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.970
 very pale I do not know what had me 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.590
 taken at the time I had done white like 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.620
 a cloth looks like a zombie is going to have 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.299
 I change that he does not have a job 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.579
 it's annoying he has no profession so 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.889
 not a lot of pod so the transfer 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.519
 for jiva of until fall who is 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.620
 necessary 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.659
 a low enough level of the blow it will not go 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.000
 can be very very useful at the start 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.939
 in the team is still seen that it's a 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.010
 os to even oda it's going to be support not 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.450
 of rocks because there I went up typing 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.889
 crack time but hey he's not going 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.139
 knock very very hard even with a lot 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.129
 of intelligence it will not be the goal and 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.139
 it is especially that we will have to wait 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.489
 a week before the transfer because if I 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.769
 did not deceive me at the time it was like 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.370
 it was necessary to wait until Tuesday for a 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.989
 transfer 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.430
 so I could not put it in my 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.709
 videos before next Tuesday the second 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.099
 character that I can take back so 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.440
 it's 0 san it was my word sadida terre 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.659
 gold oil benefit is that it is already 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.230
 level 161 ie at the same level 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:40.060
 that my that my and caf the ip 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.590
 he already has two level trades without the 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.419
 alchemist profession and the job I go 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.340
 tribute so that's absolutely not 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.459
 negligible because it's going to make me 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.389
 already 2000 3000 pad with more trades 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.129
 since he's gone 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.690
 füle strong it will do me a lot 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.239
 of peeps it can be a very character 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.010
 helpful another benefit is that 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.919
 I already had good character thing 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.280
 the lt perchaud in force in luck and in 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:05.229
 agility fate preferred multiple brambles 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.000
 so he has already made some success 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.120
 but not so much so that I can 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.459
 continue to rise thanks to success 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.819
 advantages and disadvantages, therefore , of 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.039
 union so there is little of St. Didace 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.840
 urfa relay on dofus in general so that 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.609
 it's like sam oda unless 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.159
 obviously we take off the boots it's 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.610
 filled with salida so invocations 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:29.639
 helpful the slowdown pm with 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.699
 the overpowering slowdown p 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.349
 with the crazy it can give pm with 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.639
 the inflatables and then it heals so 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.129
 in short, it's really perfect 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.050
 good support for flimm cases so 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.029
 that's like the sam oda same level 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.289
 that my and case he will be able to put some 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.849
 major trophies it's not 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.120
 negligible because if I take my 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:51.360
 os to the same oda i will be forced to 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.219
 to have that normal enough trophies 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.110
 good rock under it's not huge but 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.789
 it's not too bad he type in zone 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.490
 with multiple brambles that's perfect 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.430
 he's mostly already on far lille has already 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.379
 two level trades without inconvenience to 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.599
 what they offer me that there is no need to say 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.779
 sadida it's ugly the bar it's ugly 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.129
 everything is ugly sadida so unless 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.810
 put very very beautiful objects 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.810
 alive and very very beautiful stuff 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.250
 it will remain ugly so the class a little 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.900
 strong month that others it's also 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.900
 for that there is not much of that said in 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.279
 this time apart for the for the pvp 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.349
 with the dolls it can be 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.819
 interesting but he's not very, very 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:29.339
 strong and the dolls slows down it's a 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.870
 little bit the game to sfax he does not play 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.639
 sadida then there are some who 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.409
 will understand it's a subscriber who had me 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.020
 said I was not the real one at sfax because 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.139
 that salida does not play end to this fax does not 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.830
 do not play the sadidas and the character and already 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.270
 already mounted the already level 60 161 so 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.710
 there is a little less challenge not 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.969
 would it be for the videos it's going 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.339
 maybe do a little bit less 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.199
 content so here's what I'm you 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.210
 propose is to vote between these two 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.149
 characters there between 0.5 and my back 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.009
 hamouda so that makes you his ba be on 

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:00.659
 youtube either on the forum or on 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.580
 twitter to the limit if you follow me 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.740
 and then like that I'll take a 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.080
 decision and we show none of these 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.879
 two characters there and we'll see that in 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.139
 video 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:13.430
 Thank you all for following this 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.430
 video and see you soon
