00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.060 
get better and you saw guys was starting
to<00:01:29.790> fly<00:01:29.970> around<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.560> confident<00:01:31.950> in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to fly around and I be more confident in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.440 
to fly around and I be more confident in
this<00:01:32.159> game<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.850> i<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:32.970> i<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this game so i think i think the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.760 
this game so i think i think the
four-man<00:01:33.780> front<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.320> help<00:01:34.439> us<00:01:34.560> on

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
four-man front is going to help us on

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.340 
four-man front is going to help us on
the<00:01:35.100> run<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.810> stop<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.200> right

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the run but just you stop in the right

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
the run but just you stop in the right
with<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.560> what<00:01:38.040> i<00:01:38.070> mean<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:38.460> i<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:39.060> just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
with them what i mean but i think just

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
with them what i mean but i think just
with<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> familiarity<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> defense

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.530 
with the familiarity with the defense
we're<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.060> switching<00:01:42.420> things

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
continue to perfect it and continue to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.240 
continue to perfect it and continue to
get<00:01:48.939> better<00:01:49.119> at<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:49.830> knowing<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.920> Wagner

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
get better at it so knowing a Wagner

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.890 
get better at it so knowing a Wagner
doesn't<00:01:51.520> know<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.880> whole<00:01:52.150> lot<00:01:52.180> about<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.689> guys

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900

doesn't know a whole lot about you guys
does<00:01:53.710> that<00:01:53.799> make<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.009> easier<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.430> just<00:01:54.610> kind<00:01:54.729> of

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
does that make it easier to just kind of

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.100 
does that make it easier to just kind of
go<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:54.970> there<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.150> do<00:01:55.240> what<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.420> do<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.750> yeah

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
go in there and do what you do this yeah

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.389 
go in there and do what you do this yeah
