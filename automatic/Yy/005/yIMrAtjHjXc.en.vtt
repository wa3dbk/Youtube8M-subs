00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.080 
it's it's a standard standard action
Marvel<00:01:45.420> type<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:46.759> footage<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.970> we

Marvel type of you know footage that we
saw<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> biggest<00:01:49.590> hurdle

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
saw there I think the biggest hurdle

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
saw there I think the biggest hurdle
that<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.549> movie<00:01:50.970> needs<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.509> solve<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:52.020> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that this movie needs to solve at this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.910 
that this movie needs to solve at this

cool kind of like how they made Iron Man

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.050 
cool kind of like how they made Iron Man
really<00:02:06.570> cool<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.770> became<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> household

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
really cool and became like a household

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.630 
really cool and became like a household
name<00:02:09.149> after<00:02:09.599> Robert<00:02:10.319> Downey<00:02:10.470> jr.<00:02:10.950> crushed

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
name after Robert Downey jr. crushed

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.230 
name after Robert Downey jr. crushed
that<00:02:11.849> role<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
that role so

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240 
that role so
I<00:02:13.330> thought<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.020> trailer<00:02:14.290> was<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:14.950> I

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
I thought the trailer was all right I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.550 
I thought the trailer was all right I
don't<00:02:16.240> think<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:16.600> going<00:02:16.960> to<00:02:17.020> do<00:02:17.200> enough<00:02:17.410> to

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
don't think it's going to do enough to

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.670 
don't think it's going to do enough to
sell<00:02:17.860> people<00:02:18.100> on<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.690> know<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.170> movie<00:02:20.500> yet

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
sell people on you know on the movie yet

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.840 
sell people on you know on the movie yet
but<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.010> don't<00:02:21.190> think<00:02:21.400> that's<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:21.700> they're

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
but I don't think that's what they're

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.980 
but I don't think that's what they're
trying<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.270> do<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.480> think<00:02:22.630> they<00:02:22.870> were<00:02:22.930> just

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
trying to do I think they were just

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.640 
trying to do I think they were just
trying<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:24.580> people<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.320> guardians

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
trying to get people get the guardians

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.840 
trying to get people get the guardians
of<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.770> galaxy<00:02:26.890> in<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.280> back<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.610> people's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
of the galaxy in the back of people's

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.700 
of the galaxy in the back of people's
mind<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.270> I'm<00:02:28.360> sure<00:02:28.570> they're<00:02:28.720> going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> push

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
mind and I'm sure they're going to push

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.740 
mind and I'm sure they're going to push
heavy<00:02:29.980> with<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.280> promotions<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.480> know<00:02:31.540> as

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
heavy with the promotions you know as

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.480 
heavy with the promotions you know as
the<00:02:32.140> release<00:02:32.500> date<00:02:32.740> come<00:02:32.950> sooner<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.430> sooner

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
the release date come sooner and sooner

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.190 
the release date come sooner and sooner
so<00:02:34.120> decent<00:02:35.050> trailer<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:37.000> know<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.200> I'm

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
so decent trailer you know I I'm

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.480 
so decent trailer you know I I'm
definitely<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.220> no<00:02:39.340> matter

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
definitely going to see it no matter

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.920 
definitely going to see it no matter
what<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:39.970> didn't<00:02:40.210> really<00:02:40.240> matter<00:02:40.540> for<00:02:40.720> me

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
what so it didn't really matter for me

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.020 
what so it didn't really matter for me
but<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.830> most<00:02:42.010> people<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.580> think<00:02:42.610> they'll<00:02:43.000> be

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
but for most people I think they'll be

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.620 
but for most people I think they'll be
like<00:02:43.330> I'm<00:02:44.140> not<00:02:44.680> really<00:02:44.920> sold<00:02:45.220> on<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.430> but<00:02:45.880> maybe

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
like I'm not really sold on it but maybe

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.910 
like I'm not really sold on it but maybe
show<00:02:46.900> me<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.080> little<00:02:47.230> bit<00:02:47.410> more<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:47.830> we'll

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
show me a little bit more and then we'll

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.520 
show me a little bit more and then we'll
go<00:02:48.100> from<00:02:48.130> there<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.630> we'll<00:02:49.630> see<00:02:49.780> what<00:02:49.900> comes<00:02:50.200> in

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
go from there so we'll see what comes in

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.790 
go from there so we'll see what comes in
the<00:02:50.560> next<00:02:50.890> next<00:02:51.700> few<00:02:52.030> months<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.540> then<00:02:53.080> yeah
