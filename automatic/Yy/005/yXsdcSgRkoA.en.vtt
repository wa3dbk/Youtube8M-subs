00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
inflation that is inflating the glider

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.220 
inflation that is inflating the glider
and<00:00:13.980> bringing<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.549> overhead<00:00:15.080> we've<00:00:16.080> already

and bringing it overhead we've already

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.570 
and bringing it overhead we've already
done<00:00:16.470> our<00:00:16.500> pre-flight<00:00:17.100> we've<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.460> our

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
seatbelt on got the motor running I'm

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.620 
seatbelt on got the motor running I'm
gonna<00:00:20.279> talk<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.880> through<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> without<00:00:21.330> the

like this okay when you take and you've
got<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.629> brake<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.920> throttle<00:00:41.370> there's

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
got your brake and your throttle there's

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.369 
got your brake and your throttle there's
a<00:00:41.579> lot<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.000> hands<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> make

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and doesn't go over the kill switch or

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.150 
and doesn't go over the kill switch or
as<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.899> pull<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.140> you're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.770> kill<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
as you pull up you're going to kill the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
as you pull up you're going to kill the
motor<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.579> sure<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> tuck<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.329> down

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
motor make sure you tuck the a down

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.069 
motor make sure you tuck the a down
behind<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:53.789> kill<00:00:54.059> switch<00:00:54.390> right<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.930> between

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
behind the kill switch right in between

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.619 
behind the kill switch right in between
there<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.620> when<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> push<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:57.270> comes<00:00:57.480> up

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
there so when you push up this comes up

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.880 
there so when you push up this comes up
like<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.199> known<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.440> there's<00:00:58.590> tension

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
like that it's known as there's tension

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
like that it's known as there's tension
on<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.370> you'll<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.090> able<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> slide<00:01:00.600> right

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
on that you'll be able to slide right

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.530 
on that you'll be able to slide right
out<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:04.129> let<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> go

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
out of there and get that a let it go

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.300 
out of there and get that a let it go
and<00:01:06.540> initially<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> hit<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and initially we have to hit the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
and initially we have to hit the
throttle<00:01:08.700> full<00:01:09.060> throttle<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.780> push<00:01:10.409> straight

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
throttle full throttle and push straight

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
throttle full throttle and push straight
up<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.240> last<00:01:12.510> thing<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.810> want<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> pull

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
up the last thing we want to do is pull

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
up the last thing we want to do is pull
down<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.430> we're<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> tuck<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
down like this we're going to tuck the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.700 
down like this we're going to tuck the
front<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> glider<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.049> do<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.560> all

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
front of the glider if we do that so all

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.620 
front of the glider if we do that so all
we<00:01:16.860> want<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
we want to do is it's like we're a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.120 
we want to do is it's like we're a
couple<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.200> posts<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> push

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
couple of posts we're going to push

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
couple of posts we're going to push
straight<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.180> full<00:01:21.960> throttle

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
straight up like this full throttle

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
straight up like this full throttle
until<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> glider<00:01:24.210> overhead

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
until we can see the glider overhead

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.380 
until we can see the glider overhead
we're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> look<00:01:26.159> either<00:01:26.580> up<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
we're going to look either up at the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
we're going to look either up at the
glider<00:01:27.659> which<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.110> find<00:01:28.350> rather<00:01:28.470> difficult<00:01:28.890> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
glider which I find rather difficult to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.100 
glider which I find rather difficult to
do<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:29.909> why<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> use<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> mirror<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.869> look

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
do so that's why I use a mirror I look

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
do so that's why I use a mirror I look
down<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.350> there<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.909> front<00:01:33.090> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
down right there and right in front of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
down right there and right in front of
me<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.689> soon<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.470> glider<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
me as soon as I see that glider in the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.120 
me as soon as I see that glider in the
mirror<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:36.420> down<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.710> mid-range

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
mirror I back down to a mid-range

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
mirror I back down to a mid-range
throttle<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.090> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> allow<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
throttle that's going to allow me to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.350 
throttle that's going to allow me to
taxi<00:01:40.380> along<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.430> glider<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> whole

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
taxi along with this glider so the whole

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840 
taxi along with this glider so the whole
idea<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> inflation<00:01:43.649> make<00:01:44.549> sure<00:01:44.700> it's

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
idea of the inflation make sure it's

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.480 
idea of the inflation make sure it's
perfectly<00:01:45.240> set<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.799> we<00:01:46.799> hit<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> throttle

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
perfectly set up we hit the throttle

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910 
perfectly set up we hit the throttle
full<00:01:47.729> throttle<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.329> push<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.290> assist<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
full throttle and push up to assist the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
full throttle and push up to assist the
A's<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:51.060> accelerate<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> glider<00:01:52.020> until<00:01:52.350> its

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
A's to accelerate the glider until its

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.770 
A's to accelerate the glider until its
overhead<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.130> soon<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.579> overhead<00:01:54.090> we're

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
overhead as soon as it's overhead we're

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
overhead as soon as it's overhead we're
going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.990> slide<00:01:55.259> our<00:01:55.470> thumbs<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:56.040> from

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
going to slide our thumbs out from

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.789 
going to slide our thumbs out from
underneath<00:01:57.030> these<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.990> catch<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.560> glider

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
underneath these and catch the glider

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.100 
underneath these and catch the glider
with<00:01:59.040> some<00:01:59.219> brake<00:01:59.460> pressure<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.899> look

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
with some brake pressure and then look

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
with some brake pressure and then look
at<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.350> mirror<00:02:01.680> once<00:02:02.100> we<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.700> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
at our mirror once we see it there and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.480 
at our mirror once we see it there and
balance<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> glider<00:02:03.750> overhead<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:05.219> want<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
balance the glider overhead you want to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.880 
balance the glider overhead you want to
position<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.060> mirror<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.680> head

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
position this mirror so that your head

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
position this mirror so that your head
is<00:02:07.920> visible<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> bottom<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.660> the
