00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
where it's like the the itunes agreement

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.260 
where it's like the the itunes agreement
that<00:03:14.590> no<00:03:14.739> one<00:03:14.860> reads<00:03:15.070> we<00:03:15.370> all<00:03:15.489> click<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.910> agree

on but it's in your pocket so I don't I
would<00:03:51.940> imagine<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.420> some<00:03:52.810> pretty<00:03:53.350> fancy

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
would imagine that some pretty fancy

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.470 
would imagine that some pretty fancy
hackers<00:03:54.190> somewhere<00:03:54.579> could<00:03:54.970> figure<00:03:55.180> out<00:03:55.269> a<00:03:55.420> way

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
hackers somewhere could figure out a way

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.090 
hackers somewhere could figure out a way
for<00:03:55.600> your<00:03:55.900> phone<00:03:56.079> not<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.500> light<00:03:56.680> up<00:03:56.860> and

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100

somehow them be getting the audio or
whatever<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.290> so<00:04:00.010> this<00:04:00.130> just<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.430> sell<00:04:00.760> you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
 that's the thing it's not even half

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.080 
 that's the thing it's not even half
the<00:04:02.890> time<00:04:03.160> it's<00:04:03.280> not<00:04:03.340> even<00:04:03.430> for<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.670> NSA<00:04:04.060> or

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that's interesting point so it's not

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.860 
that's interesting point so it's not
necessarily<00:04:07.810> for<00:04:08.670> purposes<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.730> spying<00:04:10.150> or

more<00:04:54.670> complicated<00:04:54.880> than<00:04:55.420> what<00:04:55.540> I<00:04:55.600> was<00:04:55.870> doing

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
with yes we're so confused but it

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.730 
with yes we're so confused but it
actually<00:04:58.870> gets<00:04:59.020> harder<00:04:59.290> if<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.500> know<00:04:59.620> what

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
actually gets harder if you know what

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.900 
actually gets harder if you know what
you<00:04:59.860> taking<00:05:00.160> everything<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.670> you're<00:05:00.880> a

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910

hundred percent my parents have this TV
the<00:05:03.130> Samsung<00:05:03.550> TV<00:05:04.510> they<00:05:04.690> cannot<00:05:04.990> use<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.380> voice

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
the Samsung TV they cannot use the voice

the Samsung TV they cannot use the voice
recognition<00:05:05.890> thing<00:05:06.370> there's<00:05:06.520> no<00:05:06.640> way<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:06.790> don't

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
recognition thing there's no way I don't

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.830 
recognition thing there's no way I don't
even<00:05:07.030> think<00:05:07.120> they<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.390> use<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.540> remote

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
even think they can use a remote

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.660 
even think they can use a remote
properly<00:05:08.320> and<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.800> every<00:05:09.070> time<00:05:09.100> I<00:05:09.280> go<00:05:09.400> home<00:05:09.520> I

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
properly and I every time I go home I

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.630 
properly and I every time I go home I
end<00:05:09.820> up<00:05:09.910> spending<00:05:10.030> three<00:05:10.210> hours<00:05:11.370> I<00:05:12.370> don't

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
end up spending three hours I don't

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.530 
end up spending three hours I don't
charge<00:05:12.880> them<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.210> hourly<00:05:13.690> rate<00:05:14.640> pro<00:05:15.640> bono<00:05:15.850> but

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
charge them the hourly rate pro bono but

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.640 
charge them the hourly rate pro bono but
I<00:05:16.570> think<00:05:16.780> you're<00:05:16.870> making<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.140> good<00:05:17.290> point<00:05:17.530> that

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
I think you're making a good point that

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.410 
I think you're making a good point that
so<00:05:17.890> they<00:05:18.040> so<00:05:18.220> samsung<00:05:18.640> says<00:05:18.820> okay<00:05:19.120> you<00:05:19.180> can

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
so they so samsung says okay you can

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.860 
so they so samsung says okay you can
shut<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:19.840> thing<00:05:19.900> off<00:05:20.290> but<00:05:21.190> I<00:05:21.370> think<00:05:21.810> 99%<00:05:22.810> of

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
shut this thing off but I think 99% of

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.900 
shut this thing off but I think 99% of
people<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.380> most<00:05:23.950> people<00:05:24.280> unfortunately<00:05:24.790> just

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
people a most people unfortunately just

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.340 
people a most people unfortunately just
give<00:05:25.090> away<00:05:25.120> their<00:05:25.390> privacy<00:05:25.750> regardless<00:05:26.320> so

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
give away their privacy regardless so

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.300 
give away their privacy regardless so
they<00:05:26.500> don't<00:05:26.650> think<00:05:26.800> about<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:26.980> but<00:05:27.130> then<00:05:27.220> the

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
they don't think about it but then the

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.250 
they don't think about it but then the
rest<00:05:27.460> of<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.610> people<00:05:27.850> they<00:05:28.270> don't<00:05:28.390> even<00:05:28.660> they

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
rest of the people they don't even they

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.650 
rest of the people they don't even they
wouldn't<00:05:29.560> take<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:29.890> time<00:05:30.130> to<00:05:31.000> really<00:05:31.330> figure

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
wouldn't take the time to really figure

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.450 
wouldn't take the time to really figure
out<00:05:31.810> how<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.110> do<00:05:32.320> it<00:05:32.470> I<00:05:32.530> always<00:05:33.040> bring<00:05:33.250> up<00:05:33.430> the

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
out how to do it I always bring up the

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.960 
out how to do it I always bring up the

the whole big villain plot of that movie

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.670
