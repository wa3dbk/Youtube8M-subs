00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
mask are covered by this black tinted

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.910 
mask are covered by this black tinted
plastic<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:34.290> eyes<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.500> pretty<00:00:34.710> much

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
plastic so your eyes are pretty much

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440 
plastic so your eyes are pretty much
covered<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:35.610> now<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.850> cannot<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.940 
covered right now you cannot see the
black<00:00:36.630> tinted<00:00:36.899> plastic<00:00:37.260> that's<00:00:37.440> only<00:00:37.620> because

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
black tinted plastic that's only because

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.560 
black tinted plastic that's only because
the<00:00:38.070> light<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.399> shining<00:00:38.430> through<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.969> mask<00:00:39.180> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the light is shining through the mask so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.240 
the light is shining through the mask so
the<00:00:39.870> worry<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.129> not

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the worry about that now if you have not

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.160 
the worry about that now if you have not
noticed<00:00:41.309> yet<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> gloss<00:00:42.629> touch<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
noticed yet there is a gloss touch to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.479 
noticed yet there is a gloss touch to
the<00:00:43.260> mask<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.800> give<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> shine<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the mask to give that shine and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.790 
the mask to give that shine and
reflection<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.390> at<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> same<00:00:45.989> time<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.530> give

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
reflection and at the same time not give

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.290 
reflection and at the same time not give
fingerprints<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.149> really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
fingerprints so that's that's really

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
fingerprints so that's that's really
good<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.140> black<00:00:49.379> lines<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> mask<00:00:50.070> are

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
good the black lines on the mask are

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
good the black lines on the mask are
really<00:00:50.460> carved<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.539> like

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
really carved in well it's not like

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
really carved in well it's not like
those<00:00:51.780> cheap<00:00:51.989> ones<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.350> I've<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.620> drawn<00:00:52.980> on

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
those cheap ones that I've just drawn on

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.939 
those cheap ones that I've just drawn on
it's<00:00:53.399> actually<00:00:53.699> well<00:00:54.480> accurately<00:00:55.140> carved<00:00:55.770> in

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it's actually well accurately carved in

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.490 
it's actually well accurately carved in
and<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.430> gives<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.910> mask<00:00:57.390> much<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.199> depth

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and it gives the mask much more depth

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.099 
and it gives the mask much more depth
now<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> comfort<00:01:00.390> since<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.780> had<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
mention that because it has that weight

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.319 
mention that because it has that weight
on<00:01:28.979> top<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.340> head<00:01:29.460> there's<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.150> no

on top of your head there's really no

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850 
on top of your head there's really no
need<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.570> straps<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.320> around<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.680> head

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
need for straps to go around your head

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
need for straps to go around your head
to<00:01:32.040> keep<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> helmet<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:32.909> falling<00:01:33.210> off<00:01:33.329> now

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
to keep the helmet from falling off now

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.749 
to keep the helmet from falling off now
for<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> mask<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.799> much<00:01:35.040> detail<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
for a mask with this much detail you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.060 
for a mask with this much detail you
would<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.509> there's<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.990> catch<00:01:37.259> well<00:01:37.890> there

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
would think there's a catch well there

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.039 
would think there's a catch well there
is<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.759> cost<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> helmet<00:01:39.540> mask<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
is the cost of this helmet mask is

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.350 
is the cost of this helmet mask is
pretty<00:01:40.290> high<00:01:40.470> well<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.310> masks<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.729> least<00:01:41.939> but

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
pretty high well for masks at least but

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
pretty high well for masks at least but
