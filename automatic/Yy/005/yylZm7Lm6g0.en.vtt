as<00:01:03.500> possible<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:06.800> new<00:01:06.950> work<00:01:08.350> by<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.410> tableau

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
as possible the new work by the tableau

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.250 
as possible the new work by the tableau
was<00:01:10.010> filmed<00:01:10.430> in<00:01:10.520> Liverpool<00:01:11.090> where<00:01:11.540> was<00:01:11.810> taking

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
sound from the ventilation towers that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.070 
sound from the ventilation towers that
are<00:01:17.410> pumping<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.590> air<00:01:18.620> under<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.870> tunnels<00:01:20.870> of

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
are pumping the air under the tunnels of

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.810 
are pumping the air under the tunnels of
the<00:01:21.110> Mercy<00:01:21.590> River<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:23.800> as<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:25.280> found<00:01:25.490> there

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
the Mercy River and as I found there

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.500 
the Mercy River and as I found there
this<00:01:26.320> kind<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.500> cave<00:01:27.770> drawings<00:01:28.400> reminded<00:01:29.360> me

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
this kind of cave drawings reminded me

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.290 
this kind of cave drawings reminded me
like<00:01:30.410> they<00:01:30.920> look<00:01:31.160> like<00:01:31.190> eight<00:01:31.610> drawings<00:01:32.090> but

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
like they look like eight drawings but

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.080 
like they look like eight drawings but
actually<00:01:33.290> it's<00:01:33.530> like<00:01:33.920> engineer<00:01:34.640> drawings

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
actually it's like engineer drawings

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.010 
actually it's like engineer drawings
made<00:01:35.390> since<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.080> last<00:01:36.110> hundred<00:01:36.920> years

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
made since the last hundred years

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.500 
made since the last hundred years
checking<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.170> stability<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.520> ceiling<00:01:41.210> of

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
checking the stability of the ceiling of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.480 
checking the stability of the ceiling of
that<00:01:41.780> tunnel<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.550> in<00:01:43.550> this<00:01:43.850> huge<00:01:45.490> collective

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
that tunnel and in this huge collective

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.139 
that tunnel and in this huge collective
drawing<00:01:47.229> appeared<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:51.070> my<00:01:52.070> film<00:01:52.399> is<00:01:52.610> kind<00:01:52.970> of

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
drawing appeared so my film is kind of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.749 
drawing appeared so my film is kind of
analyzing<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.200> drawings<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:54.979> following<00:01:55.580> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
analyzing the drawings and following the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.060 
analyzing the drawings and following the
law

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
law

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:04.710 
law
I<00:01:57.100> did<00:01:58.030> with<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.990> long<00:01:59.140> road

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.380 

that<00:02:05.050> was<00:02:05.230> researching<00:02:06.130> for<00:02:06.400> some<00:02:06.880> time<00:02:07.120> in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
that was researching for some time in

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.770 
that was researching for some time in
the<00:02:07.740> California<00:02:08.740> desert<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.580> was<00:02:10.060> interested

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
the California desert I was interested

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.080 
the California desert I was interested
in<00:02:11.280> how<00:02:12.280> documents<00:02:13.000> are<00:02:13.780> left<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:15.090> landscapes

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
in how documents are left in landscapes

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.809 
in how documents are left in landscapes
and<00:02:17.910> within<00:02:18.910> different<00:02:19.750> works<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.740> made

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
and within different works that I made

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.420 
and within different works that I made
found<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.799> abandoned<00:02:23.799> racetrack<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:26.109> it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
found this abandoned racetrack and it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.610 
found this abandoned racetrack and it
was<00:02:27.430> for<00:02:27.760> me<00:02:27.879> a<00:02:27.909> life<00:02:28.120> finding<00:02:28.749> some<00:02:29.200> sort<00:02:29.469> of

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
was for me a life finding some sort of

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.239 
was for me a life finding some sort of
language<00:02:30.459> in<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.530> landscape<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.799> wanted

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:33.249 
language in the landscape that I wanted

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.379 
language in the landscape that I wanted
to<00:02:33.310> analyze<00:02:33.909> and<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.870> tried<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.620> see<00:02:36.129> this

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
to analyze and I tried to see this

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.099 
to analyze and I tried to see this
racetrack<00:02:37.389> like<00:02:37.859> drawing<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.219> I<00:02:39.549> was<00:02:39.579> drawing

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
racetrack like drawing and I was drawing

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.319 
racetrack like drawing and I was drawing
making<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.349> same<00:02:41.590> movement<00:02:42.579> with<00:02:42.639> my<00:02:42.909> camera

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
making the same movement with my camera

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.199 
making the same movement with my camera
trying<00:02:44.109> to<00:02:44.409> make<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:45.010> drawing<00:02:45.549> from<00:02:45.939> the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
trying to make a drawing from the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.059 
trying to make a drawing from the
drawing

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.119 

yes<00:02:51.069> maybe<00:02:51.579> modern<00:02:52.209> approach<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:53.049> starts<00:02:53.709> like

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
yes maybe modern approach it starts like

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.390 
yes maybe modern approach it starts like
a<00:02:54.430> documentary<00:02:55.180> approach<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.590> analyze<00:02:57.129> a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
a documentary approach to analyze a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.479 
a documentary approach to analyze a
document<00:02:57.969> that<00:02:58.329> I<00:02:58.629> was<00:02:58.959> interested<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.650> and

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
document that I was interested in and

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.080 
document that I was interested in and
then<00:03:01.469> yeah<00:03:02.469> it<00:03:02.650> ends<00:03:02.949> up<00:03:03.069> in<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.430> sculpture<00:03:03.909> as

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
then yeah it ends up in a sculpture as

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.770 
then yeah it ends up in a sculpture as
well<00:03:04.329> in<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.629> way<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:07.209> much<00:03:07.510> more

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
well in a way but it's much more

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
well in a way but it's much more
cinematic

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.110 

I<00:03:13.830> see<00:03:14.580> all<00:03:14.880> my<00:03:14.910> pieces<00:03:15.360> more<00:03:16.050> as<00:03:16.940> pieces<00:03:17.940> that

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
I see all my pieces more as pieces that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.210 
I see all my pieces more as pieces that
are<00:03:18.240> still<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.660> process<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.470> never<00:03:19.860> really

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
are still in process so I never really

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.250 
are still in process so I never really
see<00:03:20.430> them<00:03:20.640> as<00:03:20.870> finished<00:03:22.190> works<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:24.020> so<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.140> of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
see them as finished works and so it of

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.050 
see them as finished works and so it of
course<00:03:25.470> they<00:03:25.680> have<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.190> has<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.550> stop<00:03:26.820> at<00:03:27.030> a

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
course they have it has to stop at a

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.470 
course they have it has to stop at a
certain<00:03:27.300> point<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:29.760> could<00:03:30.180> go<00:03:30.450> on

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
certain point but it could go on

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.290 
certain point but it could go on
afterward<00:03:31.170> again<00:03:33.800> in<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.820> sculptural

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
afterward again in the in the sculptural

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.530 
afterward again in the in the sculptural
pieces<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:38.430> projector<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.360> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
pieces the the projector and the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.660 
pieces the the projector and the
projected<00:03:40.110> image<00:03:41.120> have<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.630> same<00:03:42.900> weight<00:03:43.770> and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
projected image have the same weight and

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.810 
projected image have the same weight and
