speed<00:01:01.199> i<00:01:01.410> speeds<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:02.040> i<00:01:02.280> should<00:01:02.789> be<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.059> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
speed i speeds there i should be up you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.240 
speed i speeds there i should be up you
know<00:01:03.809> i<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:04.080> good<00:01:04.290> hands<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> backfield

I'm<00:01:05.880> versatile<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.720> think<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.259> speed<00:01:07.680> should<00:01:08.100> be

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
I'm versatile I think my speed should be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.139 
I'm versatile I think my speed should be
like<00:01:09.950> low<00:01:10.950> 90s

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
like low 90s

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.219 
like low 90s
maybe<00:01:13.110> 89<00:01:14.330> when<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> comes<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> arm<00:01:15.960> strength

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
maybe 89 when it comes to arm strength

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.780 
maybe 89 when it comes to arm strength
and<00:01:16.409> accuracy<00:01:16.619> hopefully<00:01:17.310> somewhere<00:01:17.640> between

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and accuracy hopefully somewhere between

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
and accuracy hopefully somewhere between
90<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> 95<00:01:18.869> jumping<00:01:19.590> ability<00:01:20.040> 90<00:01:21.030> I'll<00:01:21.509> jump

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
90 to 95 jumping ability 90 I'll jump

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
90 to 95 jumping ability 90 I'll jump
out<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> building<00:01:22.440> that's<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> 99

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
out the building that's got to be a 99

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.650 
out the building that's got to be a 99
my<00:01:24.210> strength<00:01:24.600> should<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> 99<00:01:26.149> 100<00:01:27.149> you'll

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
my strength should be is 99 100 you'll

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.389 
my strength should be is 99 100 you'll
just<00:01:27.840> hook<00:01:28.020> me<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.289> that's<00:01:28.560> all<00:01:28.770> I'm<00:01:28.950> saying

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
just hook me up that's all I'm saying

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.830 
just hook me up that's all I'm saying
I<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.759> my<00:01:29.850> power<00:01:30.060> should<00:01:30.300> be<00:01:30.360> pretty<00:01:30.660> high

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
I think my power should be pretty high

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.889 
I think my power should be pretty high
around<00:01:31.320> 90<00:01:32.160> I<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.060> arm<00:01:33.450> Street<00:01:33.630> rating

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
around 90 I think my arm Street rating

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.020 
around 90 I think my arm Street rating
should<00:01:34.080> be<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.580> my<00:01:35.640> stronger

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
should be you know one of my stronger

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.340 
should be you know one of my stronger
ratings<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.660> have<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> honor<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.259> make

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
ratings I think I have the honor to make

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.999 
ratings I think I have the honor to make
all<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> throws<00:01:37.800> my<00:01:38.490> catch<00:01:39.289> catching<00:01:40.289> has<00:01:40.679> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
all the throws my catch catching has to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.690 
all the throws my catch catching has to
be<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.429> 78<00:01:42.119> 80<00:01:42.390> speed<00:01:43.399> talking<00:01:44.399> deaf<00:01:44.550> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
be about 78 80 speed talking deaf and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.419 
be about 78 80 speed talking deaf and
say<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.030> should<00:01:45.179> be<00:01:45.330> at<00:01:45.450> 98<00:01:45.929> 99<00:01:46.319> I<00:01:46.860> don't<00:01:47.280> feel

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
say that should be at 98 99 I don't feel

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.609 
say that should be at 98 99 I don't feel
like<00:01:47.610> nobody<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.179> catch<00:01:48.360> me<00:01:48.630> my<00:01:49.170> arm<00:01:49.380> strength

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
like nobody can catch me my arm strength

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.080 
like nobody can catch me my arm strength
I<00:01:49.890> think<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.310> definitely<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> top

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
I think it's definitely on the top

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.109 
I think it's definitely on the top
echelon<00:01:51.569> and<00:01:52.080> 90<00:01:52.380> still<00:01:52.590> hundreds<00:01:53.090> accuracy<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
echelon and 90 still hundreds accuracy I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.180 
echelon and 90 still hundreds accuracy I
believe<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.600> same<00:01:54.810> thing<00:01:55.110> speed<00:01:55.590> wise<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
believe the same thing speed wise the

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.010 
believe the same thing speed wise the
defin<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.670> run<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.509> well

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
defin can run very very well

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.219 
defin can run very very well
watch<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.729> even<00:01:59.849> a<00:02:00.000> rating<00:02:00.300> just

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
watch this is that even a rating just

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.740 
watch this is that even a rating just
everything<00:02:01.619> should<00:02:01.800> be<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.580> least<00:02:02.789> in<00:02:03.000> 90s<00:02:03.509> all

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
everything should be at least in 90s all

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.400 
everything should be at least in 90s all
right<00:02:04.610> you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.789> maybe<00:02:06.360> my<00:02:06.630> kid<00:02:06.899> okay<00:02:07.229> my
