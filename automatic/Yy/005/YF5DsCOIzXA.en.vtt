 the slab after was for the first time delivery 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:30.800
 likewise lacquers ankah cling to 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.020
 loops together where you met 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:43.150

 I still do not cling to the cape 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.710
 we wind the thread when you master this 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.020
 turn you will not be a thread 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.070
 winding up your running gear you will lay it down 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.450

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:16.940
 center point and already cling to it 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.770
 nets as when lagging straight as 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.000

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:47.180
