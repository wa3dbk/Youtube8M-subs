just bring it on to the lid and kind of

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.030 

and<00:03:48.270> then<00:03:49.270> I<00:03:49.600> believe<00:03:50.050> that<00:03:50.080> she<00:03:50.440> uses<00:03:50.710> like<00:03:51.010> a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
and then I believe that she uses like a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.300 
and then I believe that she uses like a
pencil<00:03:51.640> to<00:03:51.670> line<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.450> top<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:53.020> her<00:03:53.410> lash<00:03:54.070> line

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
pencil to line the top of her lash line

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.610 
pencil to line the top of her lash line

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
but I'm going to just use my L'Oreal

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.140 
but I'm going to just use my L'Oreal
infallible<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:59.580> angled<00:04:00.580> brush<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.030> just

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
infallible and a angled brush and just

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.550 
infallible and a angled brush and just
do<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.600> way<00:04:01.720> just<00:04:01.870> because<00:04:02.050> I'm<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.530> used

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.440 
do it that way just because I'm so used
to<00:04:02.920> doing<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.670> looks<00:04:03.880> more<00:04:04.090> like<00:04:04.240> she

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
to doing that but it looks more like she

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.240 
to doing that but it looks more like she
might<00:04:04.630> smudge<00:04:05.050> hers<00:04:05.290> out<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> little<00:04:05.830> bit<00:04:06.010> more

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
might smudge hers out a little bit more

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.910 
might smudge hers out a little bit more
