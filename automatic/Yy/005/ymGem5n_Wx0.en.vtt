00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.760 

let's<00:00:00.359> start<00:00:00.570> up<00:00:00.659> us<00:00:00.810> I'm<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.410> start<00:00:01.620> off

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
let's start up us I'm going to start off

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.550 
let's start up us I'm going to start off
here<00:00:01.800> by<00:00:02.659> we<00:00:03.659> want<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.899> find<00:00:04.110> out<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.410> high

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
here by we want to find out how high

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.780 
here by we want to find out how high
this<00:00:04.770> plane<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.160> between<00:00:05.490> these<00:00:05.640> two

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
this plane is between these two

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.290 
this plane is between these two
observers<00:00:06.150> so<00:00:06.660> what<00:00:06.779> we<00:00:06.899> can<00:00:07.049> do<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:08.130> can<00:00:08.370> go

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
observers so what we can do is we can go

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.780 
observers so what we can do is we can go
ahead<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.290> calculate<00:00:10.550> what<00:00:11.550> this

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
ahead and we can calculate what this

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.520 
ahead and we can calculate what this
angle<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.450> here<00:00:12.630> first<00:00:12.929> because<00:00:13.230> we<00:00:13.349> need

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
angle is in here first because we need

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.350 
angle is in here first because we need
this<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:14.040> order<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.400> determine<00:00:14.790> which<00:00:15.120> each

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
this in order to determine which each

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.200 
this in order to determine which each
each<00:00:15.780> side<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.350> then<00:00:17.340> once<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:18.060> can

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
each side is then once we do that we can

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.640 
each side is then once we do that we can
go<00:00:18.750> from<00:00:18.869> there<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.140> I'll<00:00:19.230> show<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.560> to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
go from there and I'll show you what to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.620 
go from there and I'll show you what to
do<00:00:19.800> first<00:00:20.609> off<00:00:20.869> every<00:00:21.869> triangles<00:00:22.320> 180<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.859> that

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
do first off every triangles 180 so that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.820 
do first off every triangles 180 so that
other<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.080> upper<00:00:25.320> angle<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> be

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
other that upper angle is going to be

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.519 
other that upper angle is going to be
180<00:00:26.250> minus<00:00:26.640> 40<00:00:28.490> minus<00:00:29.490> 35<00:00:30.029> degrees<00:00:30.480> which<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
180 minus 40 minus 35 degrees which is

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.930 
180 minus 40 minus 35 degrees which is
going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:32.809> 180<00:00:33.809> minus<00:00:35.930> sorry<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.200> this

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
going to be 180 minus sorry about this

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:49.250 
going to be 180 minus sorry about this
105<00:00:38.940> degrees<00:00:44.420> all<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.110> this

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
105 degrees all right so so we have this

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.600 
105 degrees all right so so we have this
angle<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.550> can

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
angle and then what we can do is we can

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.319 
angle and then what we can do is we can
find<00:00:50.850> each<00:00:50.969> other<00:00:51.390> side<00:00:52.820> we<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.180> need

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
find each other side we know if we need

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.819 
find each other side we know if we need
okay<00:00:54.570> well<00:00:55.050> I'll<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.170> go<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.500> find<00:00:55.649> each

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
okay well I'll just go and find each

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
okay well I'll just go and find each
side<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.610> sine<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> 105<00:00:57.530> over<00:00:58.530> 1,000<00:00:59.489> feet<00:00:59.820> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
side so sine of 105 over 1,000 feet is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.549 
side so sine of 105 over 1,000 feet is
equal<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.440> I'll<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.660> side<00:01:03.930> here<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.229> do

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
equal to I'll do the side here so do

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.260 
equal to I'll do the side here so do
sign<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> 35<00:01:07.159> over<00:01:09.320> which<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> called<00:01:10.619> X<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> X

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
sign a 35 over which is called X so X

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
sign a 35 over which is called X so X
sine<00:01:12.990> 105<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:14.490> equal<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.140> 1,000<00:01:16.140> sine<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> 35

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
sine 105 is equal to 1,000 sine of 35

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:27.630 
sine 105 is equal to 1,000 sine of 35
degrees<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.680> when<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.920> solve<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:21.360> X

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.230 

you

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.340 

this<00:01:35.780> gives<00:01:36.020> us<00:01:37.509> five<00:01:38.509> hundred<00:01:38.840> ninety<00:01:38.930> three

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
this gives us five hundred ninety three

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.510 
this gives us five hundred ninety three
point<00:01:39.920> eight<00:01:40.100> one<00:01:40.579> feet<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.920> for<00:01:43.189> our

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
point eight one feet and then for our

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.760 
point eight one feet and then for our
side<00:01:44.149> over<00:01:44.479> here<00:01:44.509> I'll<00:01:45.259> go<00:01:45.380> ahead<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:45.590> solve

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
side over here I'll go ahead and solve

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.620 
side over here I'll go ahead and solve
this<00:01:46.009> we<00:01:47.000> get<00:01:49.630> I'll<00:01:50.630> call<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.810> X<00:01:51.170> 2<00:01:52.570> all<00:01:53.570> right

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
this we get I'll call that X 2 all right

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.690 
this we get I'll call that X 2 all right
so<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:53.930> get<00:01:54.020> sine<00:01:54.320> of<00:01:54.350> 40<00:01:55.869> over<00:01:56.869> X<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:58.159> equal<00:01:58.460> to

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
so we get sine of 40 over X is equal to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:09.160 
so we get sine of 40 over X is equal to
one<00:01:59.179> called<00:01:59.390> X<00:01:59.570> two

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:20.610 

I<00:02:09.229> can't

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:31.309 

so<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.099> threw<00:02:21.459> x2<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.150> equal<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.630> this

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.860 

okay

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.369 

and<00:02:36.870> this<00:02:37.590> gives<00:02:37.950> us<00:02:39.830> 665<00:02:40.830> point<00:02:42.050> roughly<00:02:43.050> five

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
and this gives us 665 point roughly five

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.910 
and this gives us 665 point roughly five
feet<00:02:44.090> all<00:02:45.090> right<00:02:45.239> now<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:46.440> think<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.650> needed

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
feet all right now we think we needed

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.220 
feet all right now we think we needed
that<00:02:47.040> but<00:02:47.370> anyway<00:02:47.790> what<00:02:48.420> we<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:48.810> now<00:02:49.019> is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
that but anyway what we can do now is

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.380 
that but anyway what we can do now is
since<00:02:50.160> we<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.580> can<00:02:50.730> choose<00:02:50.910> either<00:02:51.000> side

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
since we have we can choose either side

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.720 
since we have we can choose either side
I'll<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.560> go<00:02:52.709> ahead<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.010> use<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.459> side

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
I'll just go ahead and use this side

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.580 
I'll just go ahead and use this side
this<00:02:53.940> right<00:02:54.209> portion<00:02:54.599> triangle<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> know

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
this right portion triangle so I know

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.820 
this right portion triangle so I know
this<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.799> 35<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.879> this<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.150> 90<00:02:57.599> which<00:02:58.560> means

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
this is 35 and this is 90 which means

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.479 
this is 35 and this is 90 which means
this<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.190> 180<00:02:59.610> minus<00:02:59.879> 35<00:03:00.629> minus<00:03:01.019> 90<00:03:02.330> which<00:03:03.330> is

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
this is 180 minus 35 minus 90 which is

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:15.220 
this is 180 minus 35 minus 90 which is
the<00:03:05.489> one<00:03:05.610> 25<00:03:06.000> 65<00:03:06.750> degrees<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:10.220> was<00:03:11.220> wrong

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:27.050 

should<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.319> 55<00:03:18.230> sorry<00:03:19.230> about<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:25.220> okay<00:03:26.220> so

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
should be 55 sorry about that okay so

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.089 
should be 55 sorry about that okay so
now<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.959> can<00:03:28.049> go<00:03:28.799> ahead<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:32.599> do

about that all right so what happens
here<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.109> I<00:03:55.620> get<00:03:55.829> X<00:03:56.489> because<00:03:56.880> sine<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.239> just

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
here is I get X because sine and I just

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.920 
here is I get X because sine and I just
won't<00:03:57.660> signed<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.260> nine<00:03:58.380> use<00:03:58.530> one<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:59.010> get<00:03:59.970> 665

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
won't signed a nine use one I get 665

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:11.360 
won't signed a nine use one I get 665
times<00:04:01.880> sine<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.060> 35<00:04:07.790> I'll<00:04:08.790> do<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:10.190> point<00:04:11.190> five

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
times sine of 35 I'll do this point five

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.420 
times sine of 35 I'll do this point five
feet<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.079> ultimately<00:04:13.079> X<00:04:13.319> my<00:04:13.910> height<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:16.650> the
