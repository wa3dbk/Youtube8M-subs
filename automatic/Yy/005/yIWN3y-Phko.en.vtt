00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.009
 after the official revelation of windows 8 fell on the net plus a version in 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.079
 development of this operating system 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.079
 abdi of the facade of the time is the 7 9 8 9 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.149
 the version that circulates through the Internet does not have great visual changes in 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.149
 relation to its predecessor 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.539
 who accompanied the previous analysis of windows 8 plus the fuse e-3 made 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:33.469
 by the technician 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.170
 is to know a little about reformulations in the interface of the platform 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.040
 however 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.320
 the microsoft developer team has reserved some news for 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.160
 enthusiasts 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.839
 As far as appearance is concerned, little has changed from 27 9 and 5 5 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.040
 to 79 and 89 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.400
 the ct interface was maintained as the basis for the development of the new 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.780
 platform 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.989
 as in the previous version 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.280
 icon in the notification area that provides easy access to 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.479
 User account settings continue with the same functions 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.030
 in addition the advanced task manager the inbrasil browser and the panel 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 of the metro interface also did not present novelties 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.210
 The first change that can be viewed is the presence of icons in the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090
 interface or ibama 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.280
 the windows will gain more square cantones and different tones in your 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.240
 transparency 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.750
 which gives a system with more elegant appearance 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.120
 is sophisticated 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.840
 edu sachs corrÃªa gets a look very similar to that of the present applications 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 in the craft package 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.729
 as announced by microsoft and windows 8 is being developed for 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.399
 devices with touch screen 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.980
 like starbucks 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.430
 one of the tools exhibited by the press in the revelation of the new version 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.719
 from your platform 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.240
 emerged for the first time in past crises 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.000
 it's the virtual keyboard 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.660
 the active lauper icon on the taskbar can be perceived 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.100
 how it was actually designed 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.700
 for portable devices 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.539
 the keys are marks and have a good space increase feature that 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.539
 allows for more convenient typing 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.969
 however what is most striking is the separate display mode of the keyboard 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.540
 in which the keys are distributed in the corners of the area limited to the keyboard. 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:26.920
 that makes its handling more enclosed in the meco when we use both hands 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.679
 to insure credit 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.679
 we could only type with the thumbs 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.930
 another revelation presented by abert 7 99 is the perfect support for staying 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:39.999
 three points 0 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.159
 technology that enables radio and operating system virtualization 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.179
 with the implementation of this new technology windows 8 will count with a 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:52.399
 new format for creating virtual disks the ph of the stylist 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.689
 this format will draw back current with up to 16 will have country 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.099
 eight times more 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.890
 that the current extension the truth beyond these apparent novelties the version 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.079
 windows 8 offers some evidence of 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.549
 which will still be implemented 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.799
 using many reverse engineering and uses discovered snippets of code 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.639
 programming of the request 7 99 and confirmed the presence of the store form 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.179
 applications on windows 8 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.189
 also through investigations in the source code 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.680
 evidence has emerged of the existence of support for Israel 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.879
 receiving sms messages and for geolocation tools 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.299
 these features reinforce adaptation of windows to devices 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.349
 portable 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.649
 with the innovations evidenced the expectation is that the new platform of the 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:47.620
 microsoft and can even realized in connections by means of 'tablets' 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.569
 in notebooks 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.169
 and has a support for 3d technology 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.190
 even though the interfax process is not significant 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.570
 the bio of 799 demonstrates a little more than windows 8 teresina to users 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.049
 follow the news 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.510
 and the technical assets 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.059
 and keep you informed about the new version 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.059
 of the most used operating system in the world 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.780
