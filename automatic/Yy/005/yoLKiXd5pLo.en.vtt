00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
transparency a pre-printed transparency

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.519 
transparency a pre-printed transparency
I<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> piece<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.480> aluminum<00:00:19.050> foil<00:00:19.289> it's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.779 
been die-cut and I have a piece of
chipboard<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.650> let's<00:00:23.010> start<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.369> stamping

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
chipboard so let's start with stamping

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.420 
chipboard so let's start with stamping
on<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.029> transparency<00:00:25.279> because<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
on the transparency because the

to<00:00:49.289> black<00:00:49.559> ink<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.969> gonna<00:00:51.120> take<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
to black ink so I'm gonna take this

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.850 
to black ink so I'm gonna take this
beautiful<00:00:51.840> butterfly<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> thought<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
beautiful butterfly and I thought it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
beautiful butterfly and I thought it
would<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.039> great<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.760> stamp<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.329> butterflies

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
would be great to stamp the butterflies

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020 
would be great to stamp the butterflies
into<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.890> flourish<00:00:56.430> pattern<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
into this flourish pattern on the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.779 
into this flourish pattern on the
transparency<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> ink<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.579> my

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
transparency so I'm going to ink up my

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.430 
transparency so I'm going to ink up my
butterfly<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.289> going

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
butterfly and you can see that I'm going

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.810 
butterfly and you can see that I'm going
to<00:01:01.469> turn<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.859> way<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> make<00:01:02.520> sure<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to turn it this way and make sure that I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
to turn it this way and make sure that I
put<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.239> ink<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> way<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> nice

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
put the ink on this way so I get a nice

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.340 
put the ink on this way so I get a nice
even<00:01:04.979> surface<00:01:05.330> nice<00:01:06.330> even<00:01:06.689> coverage<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.200> my

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
even surface nice even coverage of my

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.370 
even surface nice even coverage of my
ink<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.860> flipped<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.760> transparency<00:01:09.630> over<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
ink I flipped my transparency over so I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.039 
ink I flipped my transparency over so I
can<00:01:10.560> stamp<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.610> part<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.750> slippery

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
can stamp on this part this is slippery

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
can stamp on this part this is slippery
so<00:01:13.500> when<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.950> down<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> stamp<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.700> careful

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so when you go down to stamp be careful

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
so when you go down to stamp be careful
that<00:01:15.240> you're<00:01:15.420> holding<00:01:15.630> your<00:01:16.259> black<00:01:16.560> steady

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that you're holding your black steady

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.920 
that you're holding your black steady
with<00:01:17.220> both<00:01:17.490> hands<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> doesn't<00:01:18.570> slide

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
with both hands so that it doesn't slide

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.719 
with both hands so that it doesn't slide
when<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> set<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> go

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
when you set it down so I'm going to go

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.859 
when you set it down so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> stamp<00:01:21.659> down

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
ahead I'm going to put the stamp down

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.590 
ahead I'm going to put the stamp down
I'm<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> use<00:01:22.409> two<00:01:22.770> hands<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:24.119> real

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
I'm going to use two hands and a real

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
I'm going to use two hands and a real
gentle<00:01:25.170> amount<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.530> pressure<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> can

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gentle amount of pressure and you can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.910 
gentle amount of pressure and you can
see<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.640> keeping<00:01:27.060> both<00:01:27.450> hands<00:01:28.020> while

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
see that I'm keeping both hands while

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
see that I'm keeping both hands while
I'm<00:01:29.189> pushing<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> doesn't<00:01:30.509> slide

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I'm pushing so that it doesn't slide

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.230 
I'm pushing so that it doesn't slide
because<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.470> easy<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.790> need<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
because very easy to do and you need to
