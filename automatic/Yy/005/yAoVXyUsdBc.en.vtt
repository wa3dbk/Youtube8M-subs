00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
consideration is if this applies even

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
able to get the most out of the edge of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.450 
able to get the most out of the edge of
your<00:00:43.309> weapon<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:44.660> when<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:44.930> throw<00:00:45.170> something

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
your weapon so when you throw something

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.149 
your weapon so when you throw something
you<00:00:46.460> want<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.730> first<00:00:47.510> guess<00:00:47.899> guess<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:49.010> going

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
you want to first guess guess it's going

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.960 
you want to first guess guess it's going
to<00:00:49.220> over<00:00:50.120> rotate<00:00:50.750> or<00:00:51.170> under<00:00:51.530> rotate<00:00:51.860> all<00:00:52.790> right

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
to over rotate or under rotate all right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.880 
to over rotate or under rotate all right
if<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:53.659> believe<00:00:53.930> it's<00:00:54.140> going<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.379> under

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
if you believe it's going to under

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.829 
if you believe it's going to under
rotate<00:00:55.280> then<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.089> want<00:00:56.300> to<00:00:56.390> throw<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.690> with<00:00:56.809> a

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
rotate then you want to throw it with a

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.290 
rotate then you want to throw it with a
blade<00:00:57.110> facing<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.559> ground<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:58.100> way<00:00:58.309> if<00:00:59.059> the

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
blade facing the ground that way if the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.420 
blade facing the ground that way if the
knife<00:00:59.480> for<00:00:59.960> some<00:01:00.110> reason<00:01:00.440> doesn't<00:01:01.129> it<00:01:01.280> with<00:01:01.399> a

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
knife for some reason doesn't it with a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.639 
knife for some reason doesn't it with a
point<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.420> doesn't<00:01:02.629> rotate<00:01:02.750> enough<00:01:03.140> it

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
point and it doesn't rotate enough it

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.359 
point and it doesn't rotate enough it
still<00:01:03.979> can<00:01:04.100> have<00:01:04.250> edge<00:01:04.399> contact<00:01:04.960> now<00:01:06.369> opposite

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
still can have edge contact now opposite

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.920 
still can have edge contact now opposite
for<00:01:07.520> these<00:01:07.640> if<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:08.149> throw<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.479> blade<00:01:08.660> up<00:01:08.780> if

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
for these if you throw the blade up if

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.850 
for these if you throw the blade up if
you<00:01:09.020> think<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.229> knife<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.470> canceled<00:01:09.740> do<00:01:09.800> you

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
you think the knife is canceled do you

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.820 
you think the knife is canceled do you
think<00:01:10.070> did<00:01:10.910> not<00:01:11.030> scan<00:01:11.179> over<00:01:11.360> rotate<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.619> that

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
think did not scan over rotate so that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.320 
think did not scan over rotate so that
doesn't<00:01:13.009> take<00:01:13.220> complete<00:01:13.460> with<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> point<00:01:13.970> and

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
doesn't take complete with a point and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.669 
doesn't take complete with a point and
you<00:01:14.780> won't<00:01:14.990> be<00:01:15.050> able<00:01:15.110> get<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.350> most<00:01:15.500> out<00:01:15.649> of

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
you won't be able get the most out of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.210 
you won't be able get the most out of
your<00:01:15.770> edge<00:01:16.210> there<00:01:17.210> you<00:01:17.300> go<00:01:17.770> all<00:01:18.770> right<00:01:18.830> so
