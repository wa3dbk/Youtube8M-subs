helicopter is 1 130 and I'll without
this<00:00:43.020> without<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> battery<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:46.340> 102<00:00:47.390> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this without the battery it's 102 so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
this without the battery it's 102 so
that's<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> weight<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> everything<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.950> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that's the weight and everything for so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
that's the weight and everything for so
