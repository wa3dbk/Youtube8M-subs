00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.580
 of the launch that is December 19 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.310
 On Wednesday I will bring you a review ingame 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.079
 of all the skins that have been say 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.300
 included in this skin so that special 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.670
 Christmas so you can see a little bit 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.350
 all and if it's worth it 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.630
 and all that kind of stuff I always land 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.920
 bring those reviews of all the skins 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.840
 so good is simply the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.700
 Wednesday if you have any questions 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.770
 for the channel that I will do that review in case 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.540
 perhaps it is worth in addition to this information 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.220
 guys that I comment now at the beginning 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.830
 of the video we also have two images 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.750
 new ones that I wanted to analyze a little bit 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.090
 above so I'm going to make way for the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.890
 first good guys we can see in 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.409
 this first image that we are going to analyze 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.509
 Well, Santa Claus, you see him there 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.640
 left of this whole skin already what 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.380
 we had seen in one of the images 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.149
 that we already analyzed the other day also 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.909
 we can observe a steve with a 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.100
 sort of polar coat something else like that 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.110
 prepared for winter and also 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.119
 we see two incredible skins that to me 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.670
 have really liked one is that great 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.000
 snowman with amazing hat 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.990
 it looks like it's wearing a blue scarf 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.549
 incredible I imagined something of this 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.009
 that's why I told you that this skin 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.619
 fact to me personally it seemed 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.380
 pretty good and as a fourth skin that 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.670
 can appreciate in this image we have what 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.590
 that seems to be kind of like 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.709
 gingerbread man or something like that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.850
 It seems like me that I know I do not know 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.210
 a pretty weird look 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.190
 and if it is looking towards us it seems 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.770
 that has no face is a skin that can 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.070
 be quite weird in addition to this first 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.630
 image that I tell you is not the only one 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.330
 that we have two images so I'm going to 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.680
 get to give way to this second 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.650
 image that we are going to analyze in this 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.980
 video and it's what you're going to see right now 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.660
 there we have it this image has also made me 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.940
 liked very much 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.410
 we can see guys a lot of skins 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.990
 in this image the first of the 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.700
 left we have good in addition to a 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.620
 cow looking through the amazing window 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.000
 this picture 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.180
 we have a zombie as a kind of 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.090
 turkey in the head very very very rare it 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.890
 can see how I already imagined and I 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.080
 I said I was expecting a skeleton with 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.790
 Christmas hat very good too 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.670
 we have a steve with a kind of 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.130
 jersey so very winter style and 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.350
 of this kind of little things we also have 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.900
 a kind of zombie with something for 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.580
 above is not seen very well what 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.580
 it can be maybe it's like a cake or 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.620
 something like that we also have 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.430
 a skin that is as red as if it were 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.950

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.189
