 Laptop screen and how to clean it 

00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:09.252
 In this video you will learn how to clean your screen properly, 

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:13.316
 with inexpensive materials you can have at home, 

00:00:14.728 --> 00:00:17.400
 without damaging your laptop or screen. 

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:22.506
 The same instructions you can follow for any other screen 

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:30.216
 eg on smart devices like mobile phones, monitors for your PCs or your TVs (LCD, CCFL, LED &amp; Plasma). 

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:36.716
 For laptop screen cleaning (and for the next videos you will see) you will need: 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:56.409
 Deionized Water, Pneumatic Spray, A Clean Brush, Few Cotton Cottons, One Piece of Cloth (Cotton) or Better a Cloth with Microfibre, A Blank Bottle of an Azax-old Finished Bottle or Another Sprayable Bottle 

00:00:58.304 --> 00:01:02.304
 The ideal cleaning fluid is deionized (distilled) water. 

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:11.211
 If it is also mixed in a 50/50 ratio with white vinegar it may be more effective when more intense cleaning is needed. 

00:01:15.096 --> 00:01:18.096
 If you have a glass cleaning spray in your house that has finished or is almost empty, 

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:27.135
 you can rinse it with lots of deionized water and then fill it with the solution recommended above. 

00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:31.611
 But do not use it to spray directly onto the screen. 

00:01:33.488 --> 00:01:44.488
 By spraying directly onto the screen the liquid will flow from the surface of the screen to its base where sensitive circuits are located. This will cause irreparable damage to your screen. 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.030
 Turn off your computer or monitor. Remove it from the socket and remove the battery if it is a laptop. 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:01.100
 on a cloth preferably cotton or microfibres which must be clean. 

00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:07.780
 a cloth that is not clean can cause slight scratches on the screen surface. 

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:14.520
 Make sure that the amount to be sprayed is such that the cloth is wet but not too much. 

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:21.510
 With circular light but constant movements, clean your screen by rubbing it lightly. 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.570
 Do not forcefully force the screen because you will cause a problem with the display matrix. 

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:38.880
 Be sure to hold the screen from the back with your other hand so that you do not break your monitor or mounts. 

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:44.400
 If you do not have a spray tank then you can use a small bowl or a deep dish. 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.690
 Just wet a small corner of the fabric in the liquid. 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.910
 Do not use paper to clean the screen because it leaves paper fibers on the surface of the screen. 

00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:08.880
 Do not use kitchen or dish cloths or synthetic fabrics as scratches will occur on the surface of the screen. 

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:19.900
 Also do not use tap water as it will leave salt spots on your screen or AZAX cleaners because they contain ammonia. 

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:30.890
 If you have glass cleaning fluid you can use it instead of distilled water as long as you make sure it does not contain the material: "isopropanol". 

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:37.390
 Repeat cleaning as often as necessary until your screen cleans well. 

00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:55.190
