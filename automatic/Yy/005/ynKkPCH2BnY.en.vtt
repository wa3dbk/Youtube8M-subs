is the third time I'll slaughter this

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.420 
is the third time I'll slaughter this
video<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:41.910> confusing<00:00:42.200> anyway

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430

xbox<00:00:44.430> 360<00:00:44.910> we're<00:00:45.390> using<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> cable<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.170> has

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
xbox 360 we're using the cable that has

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.090 
xbox 360 we're using the cable that has
RGB<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.090> components<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.800> basically<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
RGB and components in it basically the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670 
RGB and components in it basically the
RGB<00:00:50.670> goes<00:00:50.850> into<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> whole<00:00:51.329> pitch<00:00:51.480> device<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
RGB goes into a whole pitch device the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.389 
RGB goes into a whole pitch device the
component<00:00:53.160> goes<00:00:53.280> into<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.390> amplifier<00:00:55.399> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
component goes into the amplifier the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.709 
component goes into the amplifier the
audio<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:57.030> goes<00:00:57.180> into<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.480> amplifier

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
audio actually goes into the amplifier

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.069 
audio actually goes into the amplifier
as<00:00:58.140> well<00:00:58.320> not<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> help<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:59.100> pitch<00:00:59.250> device<00:01:00.079> so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
as well not to help or pitch device so

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
as well not to help or pitch device so
the<00:01:01.350> out<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.520> whole<00:01:02.670> pitch<00:01:02.789> device<00:01:03.090> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the out of the whole pitch device is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
the out of the whole pitch device is
going<00:01:03.539> straight<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> TV<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.379> video<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
going straight to the TV for video the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.770 
going straight to the TV for video the
audio<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:06.060> coming<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.130> amplifier<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
audio is coming from the amplifier and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
audio is coming from the amplifier and
the<00:01:09.780> audio<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.080> also<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> mixer

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the audio is also going into the mixer

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.240 
the audio is also going into the mixer
so<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.570> add<00:01:12.689> commentary<00:01:13.110> once<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.070> going

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so we can add commentary once it's going

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
so we can add commentary once it's going
through<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> mix<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.540> master<00:01:15.930> outs

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
through the mix are the master outs

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.219 
through the mix are the master outs
audio<00:01:17.009> goes<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> whole<00:01:18.360> page<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
audio goes into the whole page so the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.350 
audio goes into the whole page so the
whole<00:01:19.350> page<00:01:19.530> records<00:01:19.979> two<00:01:20.159> fights<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:21.240> our

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
whole page records two fights with our

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.800 
whole page records two fights with our
commentary<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.930> door<00:01:22.680> d<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:24.210> only<00:01:24.420> has<00:01:24.570> one

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
commentary on door d this only has one

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.399 
commentary on door d this only has one
master<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.409> fo<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.610> which<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:27.810> two

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
master out fo know which is the two two

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
master out fo know which is the two two
two<00:01:28.560> cables<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> red<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.280> white<00:01:29.430> cables<00:01:29.790> also

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
two cables to red and white cables also

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.390 
two cables to red and white cables also
known<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.420> component<00:01:30.840> cables<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.799> i'm<00:01:32.070> using

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
known as component cables so i'm using

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.719 
known as component cables so i'm using
the<00:01:32.549> headphone<00:01:33.180> socket<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:34.320> add<00:01:34.619> audio<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the headphone socket to add audio to the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.080 
the headphone socket to add audio to the
stream<00:01:36.799> basically<00:01:37.799> I've<00:01:37.860> got<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> 3.5<00:01:38.640> ml<00:01:38.850> jack

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
stream basically I've got a 3.5 ml jack

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
stream basically I've got a 3.5 ml jack
going<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.950> comes<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> two

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
going in there and it comes out to two

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.219 
going in there and it comes out to two
photo<00:01:42.000> cables<00:01:42.450> what<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> correct

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
photo cables what could not the correct

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.410 
photo cables what could not the correct
colors<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.740> doesn't<00:01:43.979> actually<00:01:44.009> matter

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
colors but it doesn't actually matter

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.240
