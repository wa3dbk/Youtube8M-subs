00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 teach how to pass your android phone 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.490
 with if it is operating android kit 4.4 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.980
 that is of a Chinese with Japanese or in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 Mandarin with any foreign language 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.670
 Spanish the procedure is very easy and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.369
 very simple for example here I have that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.630
 phone which is in a language that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:28.259
 the truth I have no idea what is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789
 if suddenly someone knows they could 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.579
 comment 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.670
 and tell me what signature is then for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.989
 pass it to Spanish simply first 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.190
 I entered through these options 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.300
 configuration that is by 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.190
 notifications we go to the fourth in this 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 nut that is here to the right above 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
 we enter it 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 remember that's something that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.700
 we know then we move towards 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.800
 down looking for a 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:00.010
 one that has three points below 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.550
 let's find it 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.130
 we're going to give you a little bit of 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.260
 zoom so you see normal if the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.050
 camera reaches focus 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.770
 she usually has three points 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.830
 below and I put them in three dots 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.500
 below and we simply enter this 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.909
 option and the first option is the one 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.189
 is up is the one that will allow me 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.759
 and change the language then we enter 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.759
 to her 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.640
 and here we can see all the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.700
 languages ​​languages ​​that we want 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.979
