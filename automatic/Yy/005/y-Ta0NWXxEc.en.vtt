00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:13.300
 it happened Saturday, March 17, 2012 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.150
 so after half an hour of two coaches 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.130
 so so the game the driver left 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.640
 the express way so he rolled very 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.330
 quickly there is someone who shouted in the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.359
 because suddenly I went back and 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.730
 I was on the window and I saw 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.699
 road signs that indicated 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.690
 that a dangerous bend happen good I 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.019
 understood right away what was going to happen 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.000
 pass 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.340
 given the speed at which have 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.649
 sunk so I protected myself protected 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.420
 my face and so after there are a lot 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.210
 from there was a lot of noise from 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.160
 screaming so that's already the noises 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.700
 that I still hear today 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.390
 is two and a half years after my head has 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.280
 hit the ground have for me it lasted a 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.199
 eternity 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.830
 I throw a real puppet I mastered 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.810
 nothing and I thought of my two 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.680
 little girls and I knew he 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:16.420
 I had to take my time after the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.010
 because it's up to this finally stop there 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.689
 it seems to me that there is 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.759
 everything stopped at that moment it's 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.950
 I heard nothing else I named where 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.920
 I had arrived there was debris 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.360
 under me I covered you with debris 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.420
 there were pieces of glass all over 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:40.030
 the earth so I heard it more my 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.380
 husband I feel quickly realized that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.490
 I had my broken arm there I feel 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.490
 realized that I had no longer my hand 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.890
 so this is a moment that has always been 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.180
 atrocious so I started screaming and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.770
 months researching my hand that 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.850
 I had very good that we had to 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.540
 found quickly so they 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.330
 can laugh is very implanted in the day 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.649
 the day the days and I told myself 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.390
 when I'm going to push the bricks 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.170
 it would be a real miracle of 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.170
 return 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.819
 so my daughters I saw them a few 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.959
 days later because I'm pretty 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.319
 a few days in which I find more 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.879
 my words serve so I saw you 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.430
 three days I believe three four days 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.590
 after so at first and my 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.420
 husband decided not to talk about the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.519
 afraid of my hand because I was very 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.579
 marked at the level of the face are suddenly 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:44.219
 there I see them again in the 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.959
 hospital room his entrance everything 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:49.980

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:54.449 --> 00:03:00.840
 which is very hard because it's scary 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.810
 from me so to the man they are 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.849

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.310

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.969

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.250
 begins to arrive 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.530
 my youngest was only three years old and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.470

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.829

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.349

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.449
 first time we said to hoot gay like 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.040
 it will be necessary to measure 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:38.549
 approached and that's another day that that 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.189
 I explained to them that I see there I 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.430
 started by saying that I had my arm 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:50.220
 that had been broken and that I had 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.229
 lost my ma it's a moment that me 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.659
 will remain for life besides all these 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:04:01.229
 moments there but my last asked me 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.549

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:05.519

 I'm too cute that there is both 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.180
 very hard because it's only 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.310
 to say that could be true it would be 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.879
 magnificent 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.879
 there are still good times 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.860
 I wanted to participate in this shoot 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.300
 to educate people for so 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.970
 that they realize that with this 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.250
 speed not driven big 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.210
 sequels for themselves and also for 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.610
 the people who are facing these 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.340
 people who do for example an excess 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.640
 speed and who did not ask for anything 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.090
 it was my body so I have not 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.760
 mama in a traffic accident 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.100
 which is due to a soul with this speed 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.680
 he does not control the vehicle 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.230
 this is my life to shake this day 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.530
 there really should be that people 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.490
 become aware as 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.490
 consequences that may have
