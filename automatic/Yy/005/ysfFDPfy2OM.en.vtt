be<00:01:36.090> grabbing<00:01:36.390> dunks<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:37.020> want<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
be grabbing dunks I don't want to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.630 
be grabbing dunks I don't want to
actually<00:01:37.680> want<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.159> something<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.549> my

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
actually want to see something on my

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.620 
actually want to see something on my
screen<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> seems<00:01:39.270> weird<00:01:39.509> without

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
screen because it seems weird without

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
screen because it seems weird without
fumbling<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:41.070> we're<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:41.430> over

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
fumbling so now we're going to go over

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
fumbling so now we're going to go over
to<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.630> spot<00:01:42.900> where<00:01:42.930> renae's<00:01:43.140> yet<00:01:43.500> sighs<00:01:43.680> map

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
to a spot where renae's yet sighs map

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.960 
to a spot where renae's yet sighs map
it's<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> frustrating<00:01:44.520> how<00:01:44.880> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's kind of frustrating how you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's kind of frustrating how you
actually<00:01:45.119> do<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> glitch<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.290> outside

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
actually do a glitch just to get outside

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.359 
actually do a glitch just to get outside
the<00:01:46.770> map<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.100> general<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.270> um<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> yeah<00:01:49.920> come

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the map in general but um so yeah come

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.219 
the map in general but um so yeah come
on<00:01:50.400> over<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:50.790> go<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> staircase<00:01:51.750> around

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
on over here go up the staircase around

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
on over here go up the staircase around
the<00:01:52.439> back<00:01:52.590> side<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> building<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the back side of the building here and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
the back side of the building here and
you're<00:01:54.780> gonna<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> pull<00:01:55.259> off<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> small

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you're gonna have to pull off a small

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
you're gonna have to pull off a small
little<00:01:56.070> hook<00:01:56.250> jump<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.270> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
little hook jump what we like to do is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.640 
little hook jump what we like to do is
we<00:01:57.509> kind<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.840> go<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> very<00:01:58.409> back

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
we kind of like go to the very back

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.469 
we kind of like go to the very back
cutout<00:01:59.130> stay<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.880> much<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.150> can<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
cutout stay out as much we can do a

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.060 
cutout stay out as much we can do a
small<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:00.930> jump<00:02:01.229> load<00:02:01.409> sprinting<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
small little jump load sprinting and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.740 
small little jump load sprinting and
there<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.880> go<00:02:02.909> take<00:02:03.180> some<00:02:03.329> time<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> get<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
there you go take some time to get the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.999 
there you go take some time to get the
hang<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.259> once<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.770> it's

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
hang of it but once you get it it's

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.190 
hang of it but once you get it it's
pretty<00:02:05.520> easy<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.909> replicate<00:02:06.060> over<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.110> over

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
pretty easy to replicate over and over

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.719 
pretty easy to replicate over and over
and<00:02:07.320> over<00:02:07.380> afterwards<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.100> then<00:02:08.190> jump<00:02:08.549> over

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and over afterwards and then jump over

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.150 
and over afterwards and then jump over
to<00:02:08.790> this<00:02:08.880> color<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.560> try<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> stick<00:02:11.009> out

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
to this color and try to stick out

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.009 
to this color and try to stick out
enough<00:02:11.579> to<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.850> side<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.450> hit<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> barrier

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
enough to the side to go hit the barrier

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.960 
enough to the side to go hit the barrier
and<00:02:13.350> don't<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> pipes<00:02:14.340> that's<00:02:14.610> fake<00:02:14.850> I

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and don't go to the pipes that's fake I

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.170 
and don't go to the pipes that's fake I
found<00:02:15.180> out<00:02:15.329> um<00:02:15.600> go<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.799> instead<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.609> then

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
found out um go to this instead and then

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.870 
found out um go to this instead and then
simply<00:02:18.720> jump<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.470> over<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.100> and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
simply jump on over to this and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.430 
simply jump on over to this and
just<00:02:21.240> kind<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.480> follow<00:02:21.720> me<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.020> video<00:02:22.260> from

you count out of kowloon on an air

on this object i'm about to jump on

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.620 
on this object i'm about to jump on
right<00:03:17.130> now<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.580> wouldn't<00:03:17.850> consider<00:03:18.000> sit<00:03:18.390> out<00:03:18.510> of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
right now I wouldn't consider sit out of

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.240 
right now I wouldn't consider sit out of
map<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.020> your<00:03:19.200> stolen<00:03:19.410> object<00:03:19.920> attached

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
map because your stolen object attached

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.370 
map because your stolen object attached
the<00:03:20.490> building<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.570> only<00:03:21.750> difference<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.200> why

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
the building the only difference of why

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.750 
the building the only difference of why
people<00:03:22.410> probably<00:03:22.860> think<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.280> map<00:03:23.580> is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
people probably think it's a map is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.580 
people probably think it's a map is
because<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.420> actually<00:03:24.540> took<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.840> cross<00:03:25.230> us<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
because it actually took a cross us to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.200 
because it actually took a cross us to
get<00:03:25.770> there<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.070> just<00:03:26.280> because<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.550> took<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.940> lot

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
get there but just because it took a lot

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.180 
get there but just because it took a lot
to<00:03:27.270> get<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.750> point<00:03:27.930> doesn't<00:03:28.170> mean<00:03:28.470> it's

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
to get to that point doesn't mean it's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.240 
to get to that point doesn't mean it's
not<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.430> map<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:29.820> anything<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.710> did<00:03:32.010> do

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
not a map or anything so if you did do

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.530 
not a map or anything so if you did do
ask<00:03:32.490> which<00:03:32.640> without<00:03:32.880> ganma<00:03:33.360> glitch<00:03:33.510> you

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
ask which without ganma glitch you

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.030 
ask which without ganma glitch you
probably<00:03:33.960> divert<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.350> bike<00:03:34.560> here<00:03:34.710> trying<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:34.980> go

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
probably divert a bike here trying to go

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.160 
probably divert a bike here trying to go
down<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.250> stairs<00:03:35.490> but<00:03:35.880> since<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.810> have<00:03:36.840> god

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
down the stairs but since we have god

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.510 
down the stairs but since we have god
mode<00:03:37.410> we<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.650> go<00:03:37.830> right<00:03:38.130> on<00:03:38.250> through<00:03:38.280> this

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
mode we can go right on through this

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.280 
mode we can go right on through this
death<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.210> we<00:03:39.270> got<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.480> huge<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:40.050> of<00:03:40.170> map

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
death there and we got a huge out of map

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.500 
death there and we got a huge out of map
to<00:03:40.470> explore<00:03:40.860> turn<00:03:41.730> amazing<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.240> there's<00:03:42.390> going

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
to explore turn amazing so there's going

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.310 
to explore turn amazing so there's going
to<00:03:42.570> be<00:03:42.600> a<00:03:42.660> few<00:03:42.810> other<00:03:42.930> thing<00:03:43.080> we're<00:03:43.170> going<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
to be a few other thing we're going to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.040 
to be a few other thing we're going to
talk<00:03:43.380> about<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.830> rest<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.160> video<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:44.730> for

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
talk about the rest this video but for

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.450 
talk about the rest this video but for
you<00:03:46.050> guys<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.350> want<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.620> explore<00:03:46.920> just<00:03:47.220> kind<00:03:47.400> of

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
you guys I want to explore just kind of

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.160 
you guys I want to explore just kind of
go<00:03:47.610> near<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> areas<00:03:48.330> i<00:03:48.420> will<00:03:48.600> i'll<00:03:48.750> mention<00:03:49.020> a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
go near the areas i will i'll mention a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.480 
go near the areas i will i'll mention a
few<00:03:49.200> things<00:03:49.380> like<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.830> can<00:03:49.980> vary<00:03:50.220> about<00:03:50.400> you

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
few things like that can vary about you

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.010 
few things like that can vary about you
can<00:03:50.700> go<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.000> by<00:03:51.209> pretty<00:03:51.450> sure<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.840> only<00:03:51.930> go

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
can go on by pretty sure you can only go

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.960 
can go on by pretty sure you can only go
on<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.200> first<00:03:52.410> one<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.770> second<00:03:53.430> or<00:03:53.520> third<00:03:53.550> one

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
on the first one the second or third one

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.110 
on the first one the second or third one
I<00:03:54.209> believe<00:03:54.810> turns<00:03:55.170> fake<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.550> ground<00:03:56.850> down

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
I believe turns fake but the ground down

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.030 
I believe turns fake but the ground down
here<00:03:57.420> isn't<00:03:57.720> necessarily<00:03:58.200> real<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.830> mainly

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
here isn't necessarily real it's mainly

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.010 
here isn't necessarily real it's mainly
a<00:03:59.160> barrier<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.760> underlies<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.570> whole<00:04:00.750> map

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
a barrier that underlies the whole map

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.750 
a barrier that underlies the whole map
there's<00:04:01.680> different<00:04:02.100> layers<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.640> you're

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
there's different layers that you're

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.490 
there's different layers that you're
going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:02.970> drop<00:04:03.270> on<00:04:03.510> also<00:04:03.930> but<00:04:04.230> we'll<00:04:04.380> go

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
going to drop on also but we'll go

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.650 
going to drop on also but we'll go
through<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.830> don't<00:04:05.490> go<00:04:05.640> down<00:04:05.850> too<00:04:06.180> far<00:04:06.420> this

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
through that don't go down too far this

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.390 
through that don't go down too far this
way<00:04:06.720> cuz<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.170> will<00:04:07.440> end<00:04:07.650> up<00:04:07.709> falling<00:04:07.920> off<00:04:08.160> once

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
way cuz you will end up falling off once

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.010 
way cuz you will end up falling off once
you<00:04:08.490> get<00:04:08.580> past<00:04:08.610> this<00:04:08.940> one<00:04:09.150> conveyor<00:04:09.450> belts<00:04:09.870> my

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
you get past this one conveyor belts my

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.050 
you get past this one conveyor belts my
right<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.800> long<00:04:11.010> conveyor<00:04:11.400> belt<00:04:11.610> there<00:04:11.790> you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
right the long conveyor belt there you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.760 
right the long conveyor belt there you
won't<00:04:12.209> ever<00:04:12.480> reach<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.990> to<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.500> right

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
won't ever reach that to that so right

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.080 
won't ever reach that to that so right
here<00:04:13.800> is<00:04:14.010> pretty<00:04:14.250> much<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.370> limit<00:04:14.790> of<00:04:14.850> going

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
here is pretty much the limit of going

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.030 
here is pretty much the limit of going
in<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.240> direction<00:04:15.410> well<00:04:16.410> there's<00:04:16.590> plenty<00:04:16.980> of

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
in this direction well there's plenty of

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.530 
in this direction well there's plenty of
other<00:04:17.130> areas<00:04:17.520> explore<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.910> hear<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.239> clutch

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
other areas explore I hear this clutch

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.870 
other areas explore I hear this clutch
cool<00:04:18.780> truck<00:04:19.470> scene<00:04:19.650> kind<00:04:19.980> of<00:04:20.040> mess<00:04:20.700> around

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
cool truck scene kind of mess around

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.570 
cool truck scene kind of mess around
