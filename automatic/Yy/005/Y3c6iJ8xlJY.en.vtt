00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.880 
pretty rare so my question to you guys
is<00:00:47.000> have<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:47.570> played<00:00:48.079> tested<00:00:48.590> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
is have you played tested the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.100 
is have you played tested the
landspeeders<00:00:49.550> have<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:50.239> seen<00:00:50.539> someone<00:00:50.899> play

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
landspeeders have you seen someone play

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.440 
landspeeders have you seen someone play
them<00:00:51.289> against<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:51.800> were<00:00:52.070> they<00:00:52.190> effective<00:00:52.820> you

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
them against you were they effective you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.750 
them against you were they effective you
know<00:00:53.570> how<00:00:53.750> well<00:00:53.960> did<00:00:54.110> they<00:00:54.260> work<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.770> would<00:00:55.460> I

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
know how well did they work I would I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.209 
know how well did they work I would I
haven't<00:00:56.270> played<00:00:56.450> tested<00:00:56.840> them<00:00:56.960> yet<00:00:56.989> so<00:00:57.440> I

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
haven't played tested them yet so I

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.200 
haven't played tested them yet so I
would<00:00:58.850> assume<00:00:58.969> that<00:01:00.460> they're<00:01:01.460> pretty<00:01:01.940> much

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
would assume that they're pretty much

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.350 
would assume that they're pretty much
the<00:01:03.020> same<00:01:03.379> they<00:01:03.770> go<00:01:04.009> down<00:01:04.220> pretty<00:01:04.820> easily<00:01:05.059> now

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
the same they go down pretty easily now

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.910 
the same they go down pretty easily now
I<00:01:05.390> mean<00:01:05.660> they<00:01:05.750> only<00:01:05.869> have<00:01:06.050> two<00:01:06.259> whole<00:01:06.500> points

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
I mean they only have two whole points

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.980 
I mean they only have two whole points
which<00:01:07.130> I<00:01:07.460> mean<00:01:08.330> they're<00:01:08.450> not<00:01:08.570> going<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.840> take

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
which I mean they're not going to take

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.990 
which I mean they're not going to take
too<00:01:09.170> many<00:01:09.259> cleansing<00:01:09.770> hits<00:01:10.009> this<00:01:10.399> would<00:01:10.580> too

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
too many cleansing hits this would too

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.230 
too many cleansing hits this would too
and<00:01:11.180> they're<00:01:11.300> done<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:13.759> only<00:01:13.910> thing<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.180> can

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and they're done the only thing I can

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.910 
and they're done the only thing I can
look<00:01:14.509> at<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.660> though<00:01:14.810> is<00:01:15.020> it's<00:01:15.259> pretty<00:01:15.590> much

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
look at it though is it's pretty much

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.249 
look at it though is it's pretty much
the<00:01:15.979> exact<00:01:16.580> same<00:01:16.849> concept<00:01:17.479> give<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:17.929> these

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
the exact same concept give you these

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.279 
the exact same concept give you these
vehicles<00:01:18.770> can't<00:01:19.340> take<00:01:19.550> damage<00:01:19.819> too<00:01:20.240> well<00:01:20.479> so

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
vehicles can't take damage too well so

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.290 
vehicles can't take damage too well so
you<00:01:21.349> present<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.039> bigger<00:01:22.369> threat<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:23.000> can

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
you present a bigger threat that can

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.510 
you present a bigger threat that can
take<00:01:23.569> that<00:01:23.750> damage<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:25.099> these<00:01:25.280> guys

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
take that damage and you have these guys

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.160 
take that damage and you have these guys
basically<00:01:25.819> flying<00:01:26.240> around<00:01:26.539> doing<00:01:26.929> what<00:01:27.050> you

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
basically flying around doing what you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.370 
basically flying around doing what you
what<00:01:27.649> you<00:01:27.679> need<00:01:28.009> them<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.399> be<00:01:28.520> doing<00:01:28.819> for<00:01:29.149> you

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
what you need them to be doing for you

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.999 
what you need them to be doing for you
so<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:32.509> know<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:32.780> kind<00:01:32.899> of<00:01:32.990> like<00:01:33.080> saying<00:01:33.349> for

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
so you know it's kind of like saying for

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.440 
so you know it's kind of like saying for
the<00:01:34.069> tougher<00:01:34.399> jobs<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.880> kind<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.149> have<00:01:35.270> your

sledgehammer and for the more fine-tuned
jobs<00:01:38.360> which<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.020> would<00:01:39.229> be<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.560> got<00:01:39.740> you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
jobs which this would be you got you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.440 
jobs which this would be you got you
know<00:01:40.039> say<00:01:40.250> your<00:01:40.399> your<00:01:40.670> pocket<00:01:41.030> knife<00:01:41.179> or<00:01:41.330> your

know say your your pocket knife or your
surgical<00:01:41.780> knife<00:01:42.050> however<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.530> want<00:01:42.679> to<00:01:43.009> look

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
surgical knife however you want to look

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.889 
surgical knife however you want to look
at<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.270> only<00:01:44.450> thing<00:01:44.630> though<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.869> that

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
at it the only thing though is that

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.800 
at it the only thing though is that
these<00:01:45.170> from<00:01:45.979> my<00:01:46.099> understanding<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:47.000> lot<00:01:47.690> of

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
these from my understanding a lot of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.059 
these from my understanding a lot of
times<00:01:48.050> these<00:01:48.229> things<00:01:48.470> were<00:01:48.590> used<00:01:48.890> for

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
times these things were used for

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.279 
times these things were used for
anti-vehicle<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.330> that's<00:01:50.750> basically<00:01:50.989> what<00:01:51.259> i

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
anti-vehicle and that's basically what i

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.020 
anti-vehicle and that's basically what i
use<00:01:51.530> them<00:01:51.739> before<00:01:51.830> back<00:01:52.160> in<00:01:52.190> 5th<00:01:52.520> edition<00:01:52.670> and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
use them before back in 5th edition and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.120 
use them before back in 5th edition and
it<00:01:53.090> worked<00:01:53.330> pretty<00:01:53.539> effectively<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.860> only

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
it worked pretty effectively the only

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.160 
it worked pretty effectively the only
thing<00:01:55.399> though<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.789> not<00:01:56.750> too<00:01:57.140> many

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
thing though is that not too many

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.770 
thing though is that not too many
vehicles<00:01:57.649> are<00:01:57.920> being<00:01:58.069> played<00:01:58.369> nowadays<00:01:58.789> so<00:01:59.090> do

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
vehicles are being played nowadays so do

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.660 
vehicles are being played nowadays so do
you<00:01:59.869> think<00:01:59.929> it's<00:02:00.259> worth<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.709> pay<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
you think it's worth it to pay the

you think it's worth it to pay the
points<00:02:02.209> to<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:02.479> these<00:02:02.660> things<00:02:02.929> flying

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
points to have these things flying

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.839 
points to have these things flying
across<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.649> table<00:02:03.950> what<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.459> arm<00:02:04.670> them<00:02:04.819> with

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
across a table what do you arm them with

I mean I know you can go anti-infantry

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.010 
I mean I know you can go anti-infantry

but how effective is it to be spending
you<00:02:09.110> know<00:02:09.140> 50<00:02:09.619> plus<00:02:09.860> points<00:02:10.369> on<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:11.810> model

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
you know 50 plus points on a model

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.720 
you know 50 plus points on a model
that's<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.560> going<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.739> fly<00:02:12.980> around<00:02:13.129> it<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.520> I

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
I'm questioning is that have you guys

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.910 
I'm questioning is that have you guys
seen<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.780> or<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.140> guys<00:02:35.290> think<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.860> it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
seen it or do you guys think that it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.350 
seen it or do you guys think that it
still<00:02:36.130> worth<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.489> pay<00:02:36.640> these<00:02:36.760> points<00:02:37.180> for

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
still worth it to pay these points for

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.000 
still worth it to pay these points for
it<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.630> what<00:02:38.260> are<00:02:38.290> your<00:02:38.380> thoughts<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:38.800> I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
it and what are your thoughts on that I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.589 
it and what are your thoughts on that I
feel<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.760> still<00:02:40.000> has<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> pretty<00:02:40.510> good

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
feel that it still has a pretty good

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.960 
feel that it still has a pretty good
place<00:02:40.900> on<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> battlefield<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.920> would<00:02:42.760> still

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
place on the battlefield I would still

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.490 
place on the battlefield I would still
like<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.090> test<00:02:43.420> these<00:02:43.569> things<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:44.050> at<00:02:44.260> some

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
like to test these things out at some

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.410 
like to test these things out at some
point<00:02:44.739> in<00:02:44.830> time<00:02:44.860> it's<00:02:45.850> just<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.180> matter<00:02:46.330> of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
point in time it's just a matter of

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.180 
point in time it's just a matter of
constructing<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.140> list<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.560> will<00:02:47.680> complement

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
constructing a list it will complement

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.320 
constructing a list it will complement
them<00:02:48.430> because<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.790> feel<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.030> everything

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
them because I feel that everything

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.080 
them because I feel that everything
should<00:02:49.480> have<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.680> degree<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:51.340> compliment<00:02:52.030> to

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
should have to a degree a compliment to

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.300 
should have to a degree a compliment to
its<00:02:52.300> next<00:02:52.569> unit<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.290> know<00:02:53.410> beside<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.010> doesn't

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
its next unit you know beside it doesn't

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
its next unit you know beside it doesn't
mean<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.700> has<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.850> play<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:56.019> know<00:02:56.050> very

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
mean that it has to play you know very

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.250 
mean that it has to play you know very
specific<00:02:57.220> very<00:02:58.060> hard<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.569> roll<00:02:58.780> where<00:02:59.050> you

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
specific very hard and roll where you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
immediately becoming useless you know it

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.670 
immediately becoming useless you know it
doesn't<00:03:07.600> necessarily<00:03:07.780> work<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.410> way<00:03:08.500> as

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
doesn't necessarily work that way as

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.170 
doesn't necessarily work that way as
long<00:03:08.739> as<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.250> complements<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> degree

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180

we're saying race you know the design

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.800 
we're saying race you know the design
that<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.459> absorb<00:03:12.880> fire<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.450> they<00:03:13.569> do<00:03:13.660> that

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
that to absorb fire so they do that

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.449 
that to absorb fire so they do that
pretty<00:03:14.440> good<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.799> can<00:03:14.920> have<00:03:15.069> these<00:03:15.220> guys
