00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.370 

got<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> digital<00:00:16.500> command<00:00:17.070> control<00:00:18.380> computer

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
got a digital command control computer

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
got a digital command control computer
in<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> head<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.890> train<00:00:22.609> coming<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
in the head of the train coming in the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.970 
in the head of the train coming in the
mountain<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:25.460> flex<00:00:26.460> track<00:00:27.980> nickel

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

mountain this is a flex track nickel
flex<00:00:29.250> track

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.200 

running<00:00:41.180> at<00:00:41.300> Mach<00:00:41.540> speed<00:00:41.570> here<00:00:42.760> this<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:43.970> kind

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
running at Mach speed here this is kind

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.040 
running at Mach speed here this is kind
of<00:00:44.270> running<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:46.030> real<00:00:47.030> heavy<00:00:47.270> speed<00:00:47.720> we

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
of running in a real heavy speed we

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.810 
of running in a real heavy speed we
usually<00:00:48.290> would<00:00:48.380> slow<00:00:48.650> it<00:00:48.680> down<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.250> this<00:00:49.610> is<00:00:49.790> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
usually would slow it down but this is a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.030 
usually would slow it down but this is a
good<00:00:50.750> way<00:00:50.900> to<00:00:50.960> test<00:00:52.990> those<00:00:53.990> uphill<00:00:56.860> we're<00:00:57.860> just

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
good way to test those uphill we're just

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.830 
good way to test those uphill we're just
going<00:00:58.310> to<00:00:58.340> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:16.880 

scenery<00:01:04.620> stage

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.750 

we<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.610> reverse<00:01:18.030> loops<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:20.250> computer

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
we have reverse loops with the computer

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.700 
we have reverse loops with the computer
heads<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> bring<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.290> down<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.620> side

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
heads and bring it down the other side

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.880 
heads and bring it down the other side
of<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.040> track<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> basically<00:01:28.620> when<00:01:28.860> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of the track here so basically when it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
of the track here so basically when it
goes<00:01:29.130> into<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.460> reverse<00:01:29.670> loop<00:01:30.120> it<00:01:30.330> switches<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
goes into a reverse loop it switches the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
goes into a reverse loop it switches the
polarity<00:01:31.470> automatically<00:01:32.160> a<00:01:32.190> little<00:01:32.550> computer

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
polarity automatically a little computer

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.690 
polarity automatically a little computer
chip<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> really<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.330> operates<00:01:37.520> really<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
chip so really it operates really like a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.650 
chip so really it operates really like a
real<00:01:38.970> train

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
real train

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.660 
real train
you<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.680> worry<00:01:40.860> about<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.190> polarity

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you don't worry about the polarity

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.960 
you don't worry about the polarity
problems<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.420> reverse<00:01:42.780> loop<00:01:43.550> as<00:01:44.550> you<00:01:44.760> see

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
problems of the reverse loop as you see

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
problems of the reverse loop as you see
here<00:01:45.150> we're<00:01:45.270> coming<00:01:45.510> back<00:01:45.630> into<00:01:45.900> itself<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
here we're coming back into itself and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.480 
here we're coming back into itself and
it<00:01:47.780> did<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.930> short<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:49.890> means<00:01:50.220> it's

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it did not short out which means it's

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.749 
it did not short out which means it's
easy<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.910> operate<00:01:55.250> we're<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
easy to operate we're going to go up the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.490 
easy to operate we're going to go up the
outside<00:01:56.910> line<00:01:57.570> here

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.699 

we<00:02:03.500> cross<00:02:03.770> back<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.020> see<00:02:09.259> here<00:02:09.500> we'll

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
we cross back in and you see here we'll

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.040 
we cross back in and you see here we'll
throw<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:11.150> switch<00:02:13.599> instead<00:02:14.599> it'll<00:02:14.750> go<00:02:14.900> down

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
throw the switch instead it'll go down

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.220 
throw the switch instead it'll go down
on<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.290> outside<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:17.300> same<00:02:17.540> way<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.840> came<00:02:17.870> up

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
on the outside the same way it came up

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.930 
on the outside the same way it came up
we'll<00:02:18.560> take<00:02:18.739> it<00:02:18.860> down<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.160> inside<00:02:19.489> line<00:02:19.700> here

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
we'll take it down the inside line here

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.570 
we'll take it down the inside line here
in<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.060> second

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.040 

and<00:02:23.580> again<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.180> running<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.600> Mach<00:02:24.810> speed

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and again this is running in Mach speed

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.330 
and again this is running in Mach speed
you<00:02:25.350> would<00:02:25.470> never<00:02:25.620> run<00:02:25.830> up<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.100> fast

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you would never run up this fast

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.960 
you would never run up this fast
typically<00:02:28.040> but<00:02:29.040> good<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> test<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.270> track<00:02:31.970> it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
typically but good to test the track it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.310 
typically but good to test the track it
goes<00:02:33.120> into<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.420> tunnel<00:02:33.690> we'll<00:02:33.960> come<00:02:34.140> back

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
goes into that tunnel we'll come back

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.820 
goes into that tunnel we'll come back
down<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.980> flip<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> switch<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.260> that

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
down here and flip the switch and that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.270 
down here and flip the switch and that
will<00:02:40.280> switch<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.520> track<00:02:41.880> back<00:02:42.270> on<00:02:43.280> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
will switch that track back on the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.530 
will switch that track back on the
computers<00:02:44.760> are<00:02:44.940> switching<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.390> polarity

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
computers are switching the polarity

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.430 
computers are switching the polarity
automatically<00:02:46.440> inside<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.750> Train<00:02:49.050> Eady

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.390 

and<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.560> time<00:02:55.800> we'll<00:02:55.890> go<00:02:56.040> ahead<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.190> we'll

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
and this time we'll go ahead and we'll

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.300 
and this time we'll go ahead and we'll
bring<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.810> down<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.110> around<00:02:58.379> on<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.890> inside

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
bring it down and around on the inside
