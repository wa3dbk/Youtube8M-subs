00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.310
 cuomo 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.410
 still today in the third average of hunting continues to count millions of fans 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.109
 all over the world according to you why 

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:16.199
 gras lime answers questions of how many that profound of man than that of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.699
 moving around the environment 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.529
 trying to open this also reminds us of its evolutionary history 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.849
 it reminds us of its cultural path from the most remote times 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.029
 of the Neolithic 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.119
 to get to the classical medieval era until modern times 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.020
 and therefore this tells us why hunting men often seek ritual 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.800
 of initiation that rite of passage to adulthood because in other times 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 it was also sadly the war 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.530
 and that in any case is part of that 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.230
 you want them to want you like them 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.710
 sky an ancient cultural genome from our species 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.450
 I give every passion great emotions 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.100
 - usually, however, also great gratifications according to her 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.810
 in hunting activity 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.000
 which mechanisms go high 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.480
 to this ancient component of 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.060
 control possession of the territory but also of its living there by visiting 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.220
 know 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.890
 a relationship with the animal world that should be shamanic 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.480
 of the American Indians 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.830
 who prayed to the hunter's animals as a god 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.020
 new relationship by their very nature 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.570
 eco-sustainable with the threat 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.960
 gmail of course there is in our time maybe you can even a taste of fashion if one 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 chest space doing something very playful 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.210
 today, hunting in Italy is very ill-treated itaca prÃ©-saint-didier 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.979
 several things eg Costanzo recently wrote or shoots that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.000
 they have to cure their impotence 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 well there is something true this is the rifle is a phallic symbol for 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.670
 excellence 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.280
 and I believe there is often in many hunters both young and old one 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.250
 unconscious 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.390
 identification between the sea 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.720
 good writing beyond these I believe that 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.460
 we always need the ability to understand to tolerate I am not a 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.869
 hunter and I don't particularly love hunters 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.789
 I understand what the deep needs behind the tale of hunting are 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.079
 I understand that like many hunger for massafra 1 hunting can be ambivalent 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.950
 poor positive aspects there is a player who becomes a social agent 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.549
 of protection of the territory 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.569
 and therefore for its own functions the project process is interested in one 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.659
 strong environmental conservation 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.789
 maybe in this most expressive form eyes of federico ltura 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.199
 but at the same time how to say must be formed and cultured 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:42.349
 to the defense issues the prophecy of the species with which it enters into a relationship 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.769
 and you could hunt in what it was in me exactly 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.769
 they would do it voicing with binoculars with the camera 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.629
 turns that even relationship with the mother mitigated me 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.120
 curatolo imitated by a very mild relationship with the territory 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:03.149
 in times past it was the face was considered prestigious nativity 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.499
 practiced by knight princes 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:06.959
 Nobles 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.249
 oh yes because to wield a weapon it was necessary to belong 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:14.889
 to the warrior class and so it was not for everyone it was not a thing for i 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.149
 peasants and therefore it is a sign of status but unfortunately many were 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:20.669
 moments of war 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.289
 and therefore I would not like this equation hunting war nobility 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.279
 where you become the opportunity for a relationship 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.619
 toscom territory 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:33.059
 so to say that today footballer to be accepted tolerated a bit of 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.429
 more 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.759
 must move with tiptoe 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.409
 therefore it must do as it is to say of education and respect that 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.629
 necessary in all human things 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.969
 an absolute horizon more than in any other activity 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.479
 then because what it does is culturally supportive 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.199
 drunk for this it is necessary that and his discreet attitude 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:57.629
 that is expressed as saying in a tura di sono in integral humanism 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.379
 much more than if I went to play tennis at lol 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.889
 in this society I think some compositions remain 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.829
 an elitist body if we want to inherit this culture 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.859
 Summer knights is connected to cock 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.939
 see books on chivalry selling many copies berchet phenomena that are 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:24.259
 litari states when they become manasse phenomena I become the hunger for consumption 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.819
 I don't know if there is the great Atlantic cavalry alliance hunting 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.400
 also because the ancient hunting by the black knights has done with 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.080
 fowl with falcons with bow and arrows 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.770
 Carlo wanted the sky that the activity of hunting so text 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.219
 unfortunately our hunt leads the idustrial revolution instead 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.479
 made of iron rods it becomes gunpowder guns 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.710
 and therefore it becomes something different nevertheless it should have spread it 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.539
 delicacy the cavalry itself 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.990
 the falcon hunting with the bow the arrows apr
