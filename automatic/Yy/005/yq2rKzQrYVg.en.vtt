00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
brands on bare minerals and elf

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.630 
brands on bare minerals and elf
as<00:00:16.349> you<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.529> tell<00:00:16.590> ones<00:00:16.919> drugstore<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.490> one

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
as you can tell ones drugstore and one

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.950 
as you can tell ones drugstore and one
time<00:00:17.849> to<00:00:18.060> them<00:00:18.180> I'd<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.360> comparing<00:00:18.750> them<00:00:18.840> for

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
time to them I'd be comparing them for

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.139 
time to them I'd be comparing them for
you<00:00:19.020> guys<00:00:19.169> to<00:00:19.680> guys<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:20.009> kind<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.220> see<00:00:20.399> how

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:21.149 
you guys to guys can kind of see how

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.749 
you guys to guys can kind of see how
they<00:00:21.390> compare<00:00:21.919> whether<00:00:22.919> once<00:00:23.250> were<00:00:23.430> spot

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
they compare whether once were spot

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.200 
they compare whether once were spot
worth<00:00:24.119> buying<00:00:24.390> over<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.989> other<00:00:25.200> and<00:00:26.210> whatnot

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
worth buying over the other and whatnot

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.190 
worth buying over the other and whatnot
so<00:00:27.450> these<00:00:28.410> are<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> two<00:00:28.950> bronzers<00:00:30.200> probably

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
so these are the two bronzers probably

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.389 
so these are the two bronzers probably
right<00:00:31.320> away<00:00:31.469> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.739> notice<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> big

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
right away you can notice the big

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.250 
right away you can notice the big
packaging<00:00:33.059> difference<00:00:33.450> now<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
packaging difference now this is a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.529 
packaging difference now this is a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
isn't like a sampler like that and this

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.220 
isn't like a sampler like that and this
is<00:00:40.679> course<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> full-size<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.839> mineral

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is course of a full-size the mineral

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860
