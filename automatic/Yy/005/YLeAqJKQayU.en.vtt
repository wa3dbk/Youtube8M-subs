 happening legal beast insurance on the license

 She gave you the option. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.150
 We recommend that you replace your 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.549
 antivirus solution by another you trust 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.479
 for you to have fun in the grand 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.650

 rainbow karama sides

 so here's a bunch of viruses if 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.170
 fuck then you come here the first 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.729
 closed everything good 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 if your antivirus obviously was the adg 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.640
 some report that avast among others 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.020
 are also using this error you see 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.320
 that would open the bg our settings 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.320
 advanced 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.050
 Son of a bitch passes a motorcycle at the time 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.470
 I'm recording dow jones my bike 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.500
 and additional sessions and are 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.060
 file selections of the old assignment 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:22.440
 Find file goes in gcc folder and 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.410
 do what the mother thinks hexi point but 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.220
 because man point is that he is not here 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.860
 because it was removed by avg then 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.440
 you temporarily disabled avg 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.760
 for 10 minutes just so he can be 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.690
 lowering the man point hexi or the mother 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.360
 point is that if or the mother point ash and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.390
 So you 're a little Pokémon. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.850
 so ready here and now you're coming 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.280
 here at its apogee open bg was everything 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.350
 again 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.790
 advanced settings and sessions 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:03.540
 additional session file look neither 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.010
 point is that if you put marks three boxes 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.280
 check to identify protection and 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:16.110
 resident protection then what places 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:20.900
 apply here apply yes apply and what 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:25.140
 now you can activate your video and 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.840
 avg that activates avg protection even 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.290
 son you are not fully protected 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.090
 I think that's it then there you are 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.400
 is now protected. 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.810
 protect I am not protected and already have 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.820
 a section will now open a large 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.100
 risk covers 100 and we'll see let's see 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.709
 Old man, he's been flushed already. 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.510
 did not make any mistake because 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.459
 so much that it elevates the little itajaí the morning 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.370
 It's good that you can play 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.700
 your game fortunately and you will not have 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.430
 that you replace your part with some 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.700
 another antivirus you will just put 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.870
 in the list of exceptions since you rent 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.170
 says there is no biro then 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
 it will be late zen 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.430
 however that does not have or will have 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.709
 and answer why it's giving 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.260
 detect a Trojan horse Trojan 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.040
 Do you want to make a troy exchange? 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.200
 with us then goes to the pointless goes that they 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.470
 want to steal bank accounts and 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.139
 put finite daycare nalu games 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.970
 So there's the tip for you that 's 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.250
 with error and do not want to switch antivirus 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.020
 So I said too much so this is it. 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.229

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.820
