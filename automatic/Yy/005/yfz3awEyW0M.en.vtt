to the CDJ 2000 and it really is just a

to the CDJ 2000 and it really is just a
slight<00:02:16.700> feature<00:02:17.000> reduction<00:02:17.599> for<00:02:17.780> DJ's<00:02:18.140> who

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
slight feature reduction for DJ's who

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.350 
slight feature reduction for DJ's who

the<00:02:20.629> features<00:02:21.049> they<00:02:21.200> are<00:02:21.260> unlikely<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.769> use<00:02:23.080> so

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
the features they are unlikely to use so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.289 
the features they are unlikely to use so
in<00:02:24.200> our<00:02:24.319> opinion<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.730> probably<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.180> one

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
in our opinion this is probably the one

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.020 
in our opinion this is probably the one
to<00:02:26.450> go<00:02:26.569> for<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.930> save<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.440> few<00:02:28.220> hundred<00:02:28.280> pounds

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
to go for you save a few hundred pounds

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.390 
to go for you save a few hundred pounds
or<00:02:29.120> few<00:02:29.269> hundred<00:02:29.510> dollars<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.470> you'll<00:02:31.220> still

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
or few hundred dollars and you'll still

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.320 
or few hundred dollars and you'll still
get<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.700> top-quality

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
get a top-quality

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.900 
get a top-quality
deck<00:02:32.840> out<00:02:33.049> there<00:02:33.319> if<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:33.920> really<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.430> find<00:02:34.700> you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
deck out there if you really do find you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.039 
deck out there if you really do find you
are<00:02:35.030> missing<00:02:35.330> them<00:02:35.450> features

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
are missing them features

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.930 
are missing them features
it<00:02:36.110> might<00:02:36.379> be<00:02:36.500> worth<00:02:36.650> saving<00:02:37.040> up<00:02:37.160> but<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:37.730> our

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
it might be worth saving up but in our

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.240 
it might be worth saving up but in our
opinion<00:02:38.049> most<00:02:39.049> DJ's<00:02:39.470> will<00:02:39.650> never<00:02:39.829> use<00:02:40.040> them

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
opinion most DJ's will never use them

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.830 
opinion most DJ's will never use them
features<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:40.909> it's<00:02:41.000> only<00:02:41.239> for<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.599> top<00:02:41.750> of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
features and it's only for the top of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.050 
features and it's only for the top of
the<00:02:41.900> range<00:02:42.079> DJ's<00:02:42.590> out<00:02:42.739> there<00:02:43.010> who<00:02:43.250> feel<00:02:43.910> they

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
the range DJ's out there who feel they

00:02:44.060 --> 00:03:00.010 
the range DJ's out there who feel they
could<00:02:44.269> use<00:02:44.480> them<00:02:44.660> in<00:02:44.690> their<00:02:44.989> mixes

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.240 

so<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.110> we<00:03:01.170> take<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> look<00:03:01.770> at<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.920> back<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
so if we take a look at the back of the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.550 
so if we take a look at the back of the
unit<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:03.270> have<00:03:03.450> our<00:03:03.600> USB<00:03:03.840> input<00:03:04.410> for

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
