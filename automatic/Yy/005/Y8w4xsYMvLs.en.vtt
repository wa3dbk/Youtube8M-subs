00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:10.949
 Hello 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.949
 Firefox would like to introduce this idea to you 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.480
 can photograph entire website 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.710
 then edit 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.930
 can send by e-mail 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.420
 to export to the clipboard copying to the program and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.800
 so on 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.449
 and they can only be visible Tel 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.090
 Clearly this also works with the toccata from the on her 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.320
 keyboard 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 just stupid Fire looks something like the add-on 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.170
 maybe one or the other canceling 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.070
 the better the whole thing you can with the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.370
 Hints followed and rasped and hinted provided and so on 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.960
 and the so-called extras add-ons 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.260
 thanks to the whole download and enter here 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.830
 Fire bulkhead 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.770
 to the whole 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.660
 first hit was allowed 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.820
 to say that Firefox 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.230
 Wait for the countdown 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.660
 and now he is clicking here 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 then seen Firefox restart 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.510
 after Firefox restarts, Künast l and close window 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.010
 and now we are photographing from a web site about the eradication 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 Now have the top right and the celebration Schott icon 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.160
 and we have in the context menu groaning on one side make the thick 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.620
 Entry celebration looks 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.090
 the function fulfills the same purpose, in principle, it does not matter if they are graceful 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 Contexts the wrong track method above 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.990
 wait now 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.240
 "We now want to be part of a website so we do not contract that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.299
 All the while, many were only a part of the website 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.150
 the case against above 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.290
 Pourie right-click celebration looks 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.450
 record visible area and now we go 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.540
 to work when we have them 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.650
 Image so the website to hardware in the image format a few more clues 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.040
 want to give such as Filat the show on something 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.030
 or the life so wanting something lean 9 then take the work if it is part 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.849
 want to upload and is 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.939
 want to publish or want to send others next to the 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.259
 Homeric Sion 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.989
 save there you can 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.579
 the picture continues softening the solar what they put on a false one without the whole 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.459
 highly charged 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.359
 as Karen Woo 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.939
 Places by itself but now copying 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.739
 In the show Inpex lets an Edita meet 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.209
 that would be then 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.649
 for example in Windows Paint 

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:36.239
 as the sewer network figured 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.739
 well we want this area here 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.319
 that's why we go 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.289
 visible right record 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.659
 with the visible range is just the current 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.319
 Visible area meant 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.649
 and also edit 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.439
 Barbie on our site a video on the city night Narnia Flash 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.199
 Graphics detected 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.999
 if the animated four penalty corners 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.449
 who race the case is nine video 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.449
 the whole thing would have to be re-rendered and because it is with us 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.979
 it's a youtube video 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.869
 he does not recognize that and shows off anyway 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.629
 but no matter that we did not have Minor and 20 bar is enough so what now 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.589
 make Jan the wave function as before APplus sets compliment export and 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.099
 Plants 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.989
 then we have selleck test because we can, for example, one 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:29.309
 a work invited rectangle or an ellipse off little, they have one awakens 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.669
 grandson 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.889
 I like it here, for example, but our track makes it so white 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.619
 deposited BZ what occupied 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.879
 and now I have the right a few 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.309
 Functions like that could look like 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.309
 i like her the movie mode as we are the whole 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.579
 I have a driveway here 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.629
 the hexagon 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.890
 and the whole thing now wants to color blue has learned in the chat and 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.039
 then that's her blue 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.489
 considered 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.809
 tied the table with explained back 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.509
 Simply select the ellipse then you can do it again 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.369
 Nelly's room of a whole again knows Phil or its equivalent 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.729
 investment 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.159
 option 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.719
 and then they have their sweetheart 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.849
 Shepherd is the one with these damages we can 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.410
 Marc to paint ad 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.019
 for example, ours 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.419
 Huber Panholzer 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:18.379
 slogan 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.419
 he is deposited in a particular color that can be like here 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.469
 establish 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.469
 and the ones above are now available 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.969
 a meal too much satisfied for example 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.689
 slogan 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.019
 countless of this text is also reformatted that you can change now 

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:38.980
 by here 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.980

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:47.180
 good and that to the shepherd to the toilet Renk here you can as the name implies 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:50.519
 Plauen in which their home on the drivers can give them the color 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.059
 that binds Sander with classroom yellow 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.039
 and here i can 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.409
 on the website or practice picture why paint 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.300
 Breun makes sure it's man at the end when the picture is ready 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.400
 have now painted on derive here 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.439
 and so not the whole and in the end to the last meter 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.030
 the next point higher 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.139
 Polzer 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.220
 These are such cuts to the rest of the example 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.710
 Guest book 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.260
 you can then also provide them with a text is see Jürgens 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:22.889
 can 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.319
 for example 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.170
 our 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.170
 Guest book 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:30.819
 OTR 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.330
 and with these 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.020
 In this case you could mark this if you can go here 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.960
 this 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.249
 are the smallest goes simple seniors there is a small point 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:41.699
 They can do it all year 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.069
 then enlarge 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.839
 push in the length 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.900
 and so on 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.500
 the abyss text came as name says individual 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.120
 Add text 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.589
 although St

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.780
 and of course there is also a picture Twitter to push 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.139
 or you can be in the option of a crook then just here 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.029

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.710
 Option is displayed incorrectly 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.570
 Here we can now offer those who are bidding Folder specify so the whole 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.569
 Land to be stored should be operated 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.530
 ProSieben pulls himself as a beautiful gentleman him nothing big 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.099
 can prescribe 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.099
 and that the whole thing is safe 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.550
 Dominic for Two want it all

 can go left and so on 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.979
 everything works wonderfully 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.550
 and Pastor Schott is then again available here right above 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.449
