water is an incredible tool to increase
your<00:00:21.669> energy<00:00:21.970> your<00:00:22.900> vibration<00:00:23.769> and<00:00:24.359> when<00:00:25.359> we

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
your energy your vibration and when we

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.290 
your energy your vibration and when we
increase<00:00:25.989> our<00:00:26.140> vibration<00:00:26.859> we're<00:00:27.669> making<00:00:28.150> it

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
increase our vibration we're making it

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300 
increase our vibration we're making it
easier<00:00:28.779> for<00:00:29.109> us<00:00:29.349> to<00:00:29.529> have<00:00:29.890> that<00:00:29.919> connection

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
easier for us to have that connection

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.510 
easier for us to have that connection

people with a lot of heavy negative

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.060 
people with a lot of heavy negative
energy<00:00:41.010> vibrate<00:00:42.010> at<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.309> very<00:00:42.820> low<00:00:43.239> level<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
energy vibrate at a very low level the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.580 
energy vibrate at a very low level the
happier<00:00:45.489> we<00:00:45.699> get<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.570> more<00:00:46.809> filled<00:00:47.079> with<00:00:47.289> love

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
we get we vibrate at a higher level

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.139 
we get we vibrate at a higher level
angels<00:00:52.170> vibrate<00:00:53.170> so<00:00:53.589> high<00:00:53.829> we<00:00:54.339> can't<00:00:54.609> see<00:00:54.940> them

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149

are<00:00:57.999> having<00:00:58.300> difficulty<00:00:59.019> tapping<00:00:59.440> into<00:00:59.589> that

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
are having difficulty tapping into that

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.189 
are having difficulty tapping into that
energy<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.429> so<00:01:01.149> I<00:01:01.179> really<00:01:01.570> want<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:01.899> encourage
