00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.809
 I believe that the group and the team 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.160
 needed the players needed 

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:08.890
 a triumph in this way so 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.200
 we are all very happy I think the 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.780
 people are fine so a nice 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.400
 satisfaction I think there are things for 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.599
 keep improving but it seems to me that 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.189
 will play a great game 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.599
 he is by far at the level of 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.339
 mouth team in the first half that is 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.019
 the medium that you saw it like that I think that 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.659
 they were pretty good very 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.970
 disciplined I think that what we had 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:32.480
 spoken also the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.370
 that ponzio is more vertical and that 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.379
 He saw the poncio a long time ago 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.399
 time so it makes us happy there 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.010
 players who have had a performance 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.710
 very high so I think we're all 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.320
 very happy 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.600
 this triumph of the players because the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.680
 attitude we had talked about playing a 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.829
 certain way to show that everything as it goes 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.420
 growing as the team of 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.070
 the way we want to play is that 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.089
 convince him nothing more and convince him 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.089
 of quart in this way nothing more 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.180
 I think we were preparing it 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.710
 We talk a lot with him that late or 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.900
 early he was going to present the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.300
 opportunity I thought fair for its 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.970
 experience for its category for its 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.490
 level and the kind of players want me 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.770
 I think the whole team provided a great 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.810
 rendering and I think he made a great 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.150
 goal to follow his record when he finished the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.340
 match that now you're going to have to choose 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.219
 and that put you in trouble 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.990
 to the whole group we need to know that 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.509
 today we had a significant absence of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.759
 chain and one of the team leaders 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.250
 but I see that the team is also very 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.110
 plugged in too much is very 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 concentrated they knew the importance of 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.679
 party and we wanted to show people 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.240
 I think the players gave a great 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.740
 show that you can good let's 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.840
 try to know how many ways does 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.039
 a lot on the side of martinez and pomegranate 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.579
 I knew that out there I could take him out 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.759
 difference of hand is at a great level 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.759
 we knew that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.710
 it seems to me that he is going through a great 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.000
 level we knew it was very sharp 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.220
 during the week we had prepared 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.349
 this match because I think the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.349
 people upstairs needed a satisfaction 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.750
 in the area and I also liked it because 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.640
 shows that it has category has 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.110
 level it seems to me that the whole group did 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.630
 a great benefit to play this 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.920
 way and I think the most important thing that 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.900
 we give a nice satisfaction to the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:40.849
 people who have players hierarchy of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.060
 great level per moment did not complicate in 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.310
 the handling of the ball 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.800
 gago give you more youth well there are 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.599
 high level players this usually happens 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.910
 in the preparation stage but 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.319
 calm we want to continue preparing 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.250
 that we know that important things 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.250
 they will come later 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.290
 good are preparation matches but 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.069
 we believe that the most important thing 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.159
 who made a group and us too 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.200
 have an idea to be convinced of what 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:14.760
 what we do and well I hope we continue 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.799
 improving better also going to session 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.799
 the improvements that must be analyzed 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.769
 well how are they recovered but 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.379
 if the intention I think beyond the 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.939
 players we want fourth 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.319
 practically in this way they were very 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.599
 disciplined 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.980
 and I think that gives pride to a 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.879
 coach but calm the rest 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.650
 just start 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.760
 in the first time it was 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.290
 quiet because we know that mouth is a 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.630
 great team is a great institution 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.510
 has hierarchy players today we 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.000
 it was won but we know that this is just 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.220
 starts with the points is completely 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.950
 different but we believe that the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.240
 our objective on our part and 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.740
 the players wanted to give it a 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.740
 show people how we want 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.040
 ok it was tough hard match I think 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.380
 that in a moment of the game we started 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.000
 very well pressing it and creating 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.220
 situations or what we want and that what 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.110
 that we are going to continue trying in the 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.340
 first time is the summary of the river 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.239
 that you want to see for the rest of the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.560
 championship and aggressive do not wait what 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.030
 is what we really ask the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.460
 players did it I think that 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.380
 tactically they were perfect to try 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.120
 play as we want is the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.700
 mentality that we want to have press 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.870
 not wait so I think we're in 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.380
 a good way but we have to be 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.380
 very calm 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.960
 and we had several chances 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.550
 but we know that the team that is in 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.229
 disadvantage wants to go out and look for 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.270
 propose that they also proposed us 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.129
 they had a couple of occasions also like this 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.810
 that but I think we hit in the 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:48.860
 just right but with a lot 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.219
 quiet because it 's just in 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.219
 prison
