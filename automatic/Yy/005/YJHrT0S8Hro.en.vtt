 we are here today with an unboxing indeed 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.290
 I would say the first unboxing of this channel 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.660
 it's an unboxing 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 really special being that it's mine 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.850
 This is my first gaming mouse 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.210
 opinion a really nice way like 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.130
 you'll see in some of the images is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.930
 really cool anyway let's focus on a 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.210
 moment on both xing in ser 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.650
 as you see at this moment I'm mons mi 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.210
 I'm showing the specifications a 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.280
 little mouse general mouse 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.410
 really nice that comes up to a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.950
 maximum of 4000 dpi which can be 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.450
 divide into various profiles 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.940
 I have to tell you that I tried it a little 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.270
 this mouse and a really comfortable mouse 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.259
 also a good grip with the hand 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.820
 obviously for me I am immediately a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.280
 little bit special to have this no 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.860
 because as you have seen of the inter 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.660
 in fact I had a really bad way before 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.700
 from two and fifty euros we talk and 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.400
 switch between a mouse and time 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.290
 answer to kick the bonus from whom 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.070
 tivo had 50,000 seconds of time 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.630
 answer 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.910
 this one at a millisecond time of 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.140
 answer is really a big deal 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.900
 in fact I found myself immediately 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.870
 well to play besides then foot me 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:22.410
 I immediately got on well with the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.440
 in short, a 3400 3200 dpi profile is good 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.340
 I must say that it was a little bit 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.560
 impossible to open this box 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.090
 guys in fact as you see in this 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.530
 moment in a while I will destroy by paula 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.530
 look kind of destroyed now the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.209
 box but 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.950
 because I didn't understand that we should 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.130
 take off pranks at the top so I have 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.660
 made the casino a little bit the first 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.160
 time I saw this monster boys 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.450
 look at the outcome a little bit 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:52.569
 because i was really hot show type 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.569
 gaming show I was not amazed 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.629
 however as usual I showed 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.640
 just to show that they also send 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:05.030
 instructions etc. thing that everyone 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.310
 you read the boys you are true 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.050
 practically write in the comments if 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.510
 read what instructions why 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.670
 I'm curious, he's not there and I never read them 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.400
 you don't know about you but they are useless then not 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.709
 I know how you see a way anyway 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.959
 really nice because of different 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.239
 illuminations as I will show you shortly 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.860
 illuminations are related to 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.310
 different mouse profiles 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.430
 these profiles are practically 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.260
 precisely the gers dpa and therefore if any 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.500
 let's put the color for example 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.480
 blue goes on 4000 dpi and so they say 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.510
 set all these more these things 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.610
 here comes to our aid to have therefore 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.599
 because point is a way really 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.489
 one hundred percent customizable 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.650
 and is in fact one of the things of mieri 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.090
 the more we are helped by software that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.730
 we can find on the site of the cooler 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.610
 master that allows us to set a 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.430
 lot of things dpa etc. even i 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.410
 colors we want to decide to put 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.120
 example on the wheel then we can 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.850
 put the logo we can change the 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.630
 color of the logo so a lot of things 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.850
 then also the section for macros and then 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.569
 that lite different profiles well guys 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.280
 I say that the video can end anyway 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.660
 here I hope you enjoyed it if it is so silent 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.519
 I don't like it and we're at the next one 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.519
 video hi to all guys
