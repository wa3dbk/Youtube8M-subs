00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.160
 for episode 4 of my series I hope 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.259
 that you're fine 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.790
 so in the previous episode we had 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.320
 sold all the players and so I was 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.870
 go up to division 4 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.139
 as you can see on the screen all 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.270
 so the players are gone we're going 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.660
 so be able to do a little bit of buying 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.939
 resale 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.279
 as I told you so in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.619
 the previous episode 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.539
 so for my sale purchase I took 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.510
 a very simple method actually it's the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.890
 technical money players to 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 auctions ie in fact the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.230
 Money players exceed 250 300 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 credit and you often bet 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.930
 three hundred 300 350 credit on and the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.870
 players are not leaving so that's really 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.250
 it's really profitable and like you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.120
 go see it I'm really going to make a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 good profit look at the screen i have 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.300
 makes 7000 profits on players 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 bought mainly 300-400 credit and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.629
 so as you can see I have 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.910
 resold a few for a city 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 credit is a technique that I you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.850
 advise that not take a lot of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.979
 time in an hour you can you 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 easily make wine 25000 credit 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.189
 in these waters 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 then with the credits recover Belgian 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.790
 and without further ado I started with 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.320
 not rebuild a team 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.720
 so I put really not moaned 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.070
 long to have ideas actually I 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.380
 had to be a quarter of an hour I'm 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.439
 party on a mix actually two Moroccans 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.549
 two a little bit of first league and 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.240
 some mexican players 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.290
 there the team has 99 of collective and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.520
 I still could with tim hill 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.900
 creatively make a team 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 interesting with players from 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.759
 players really not bad I could buy 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.979
 still at the henrique cros like you 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.450
 can see on the screen 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.920
 there I was able to tap into the unknown in 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.170
 did I take players a little bit at 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.189
 pif in fact 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.710
 in fact I really really wanted 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.140
 have a team at 99.2 collective for 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.759
 really start playing proposed 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.899
 really interesting gameplay this 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.459
 as you know a collective 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.679
 really low and that's really 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.789
 difficult to play so here is the team 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.439
 so it's really a team not bad 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.659
 of which 92.2 collective still had 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.819
 Eto'o point is not nothing I 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.349
 was paying 2400 it's really for a 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.230
 player that 85 of general I find that 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.660
 it really is really cheap 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.980
 So tarab of the boussoufa a team 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.810
 really not bad on the paper 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.069
 frankly I advise you even 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.390
 meaning attested because it brings together 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.730
 really all the elements of a good 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.360
 team actually there is speed there is 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.209
 of the five stars there is a good defense 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.590
 only the right side actually lets me 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.760
 questions made because I 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.790
 really do not know his players but 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.680
 already with 99 collective that's okay 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.370
 to really provide you with 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.200
 best gameplay 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.930
 especially for me it's really going to be 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.160
 simpler to play so without more 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.290
 wait I launched a cup game 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.370
 to change a little bit see what that 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.319
 was giving cup match so I'm not going 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.019
 you hide it frankly who told me 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.370
 really not too much of a problem 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.799
 so is it having a team 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.780
 at 99.2 collective or is this the fact 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.639
 to have an opponent who did not ask me 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.269
 problem but I do not know too much 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.980
 25 minutes of play 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.160
 I will open the score pretty quickly 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.440
 so a hit on the pole and 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.290
 so el ahmadi who is who at the 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.570
 reception second half I'm going 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.700
 we really do not continue to ask 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.240
 problem I repeat so here I did a 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.790
 small festival with Moroccan expressed 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.310
 then there on this corner I will I go 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.950
 put a third goal 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.550
 fig and will have the head and my opponent 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.930
 will finally decided to leave 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.370
 so it's a shame for me frankly 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.770
 I would have preferred to finish the match and 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.530
 offer you more gameplay 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.760
 so that shortened a little bit 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.470
 the episode and then the whole match 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.420
 simply 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.860
 so without further ado I decided to 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.140
 start a second match so second match 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.330
 cutting with an opponent who owns 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.000
 a team a little bit actually it's the 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.120
 brothel I have not seen too much at exactly this 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.260
 that they proposed us so from the 8th 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.940
 minute i'm going to open the score 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.860
 so I was a little sick and 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.180
 again with boussoufa so that's 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.930
 really nice to have a team 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.430
 finally 90 collectives we can really 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.290
 there are more opportunities for more 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.090
 spaces more animals more collective 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.250
 so simply the second goal of 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.380
 samuel eto'o so the little flat foot 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.760
 in the end to really ensured the goal 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.130
 then the 36th minute I'm going a little 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.700
 put the same purpose the second one actually 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.910
 with a heeled finish that I 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.560
 have you even well 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.490
 a slow motion still in first 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.600
 half-time we were nearing the end 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:50.000
 in short his goal it goes ahead and bin what that 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.400
 made goal 4-0 then at 4 0 going for me 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.110
 it was folded in more ways like 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.720
 many know it at 4 0 the match 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.940
 he is bent and the opponent him too the 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.550
 surely know and so decided to 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.630
 leave her going not bothered because I 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.880
 wanted to offer you a little more 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.840
 gameplay and suddenly the opponents in 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.240
 have decided otherwise 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.530
 so it's on this contract purchase that 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.780
 will end this episode 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.280
 I hope you liked it and I tell you 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.280
 to the next hello everyone
