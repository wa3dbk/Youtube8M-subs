00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
stylization much more screen accurate

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.130 
stylization much more screen accurate
very<00:00:31.859> very<00:00:32.250> nice<00:00:32.460> looking<00:00:32.790> figure<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.719> appears

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
very very nice looking figure it appears

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.330 
very very nice looking figure it appears
that<00:00:34.200> these<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> same

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
that these are going to be on the same

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
that these are going to be on the same
scale<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> halo<00:00:36.120> 2<00:00:36.180> anniversary<00:00:36.530> figures

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
scale as the halo 2 anniversary figures

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
scale as the halo 2 anniversary figures
so<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.190> also<00:00:38.399> very<00:00:38.579> nice<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> little

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
so that's also very nice it's a little

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.299 
so that's also very nice it's a little
bit<00:00:39.540> larger<00:00:39.930> than<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> halo<00:00:40.350> 4<00:00:40.710> he's<00:00:41.219> gonna

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
bit larger than the halo 4 he's gonna

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.250 
bit larger than the halo 4 he's gonna
come<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.879> least<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.450> pistol<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.200> an

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
come with at least a pistol and an

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.709 
come with at least a pistol and an
alternate<00:00:43.680> head<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:44.370> assault<00:00:44.700> rifle<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
alternate head and an assault rifle you

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.660 
alternate head and an assault rifle you
can<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.289> close<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.800> alternate<00:00:47.219> head<00:00:47.399> has

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
can see up close the alternate head has

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.299 
can see up close the alternate head has
the<00:00:47.969> correct<00:00:48.239> advisor<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.950> will<00:00:50.190> be

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the correct advisor so that will be

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.040 
the correct advisor so that will be
interesting<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.840> plays

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
interesting to see how much that plays

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
interesting to see how much that plays
into<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> game<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.890> why<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.430> got<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
into the game and why we got it on the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.520 
into the game and why we got it on the
figure<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.840> kind<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.140> thing<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.410> then

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
figure and that kind of thing and then

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
figure and that kind of thing and then
the<00:00:55.649> AR<00:00:56.039> has<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> load<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> detail<00:00:57.809> and

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the AR has just a load of detail and

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.630 
the AR has just a load of detail and
we'll<00:00:58.079> be<00:00:58.140> able<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.980> next

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
we'll be able to see that in this next

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.270 
we'll be able to see that in this next
photo<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.270> tons<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.289> detail<00:01:01.649> everything

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
photo here tons of detail everything

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.590 
photo here tons of detail everything
looks<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> came<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.000> out<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> game

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
looks like it came right out of the game

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.750 
looks like it came right out of the game
so<00:01:03.809> I'm<00:01:03.930> super<00:01:04.320> psyched<00:01:04.559> for<00:01:04.739> these<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.489> lack

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
so I'm super psyched for these the lack

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.730 
so I'm super psyched for these the lack
of<00:01:05.790> stylization<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> larger<00:01:07.470> scale

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of stylization and then the larger scale

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.310 
of stylization and then the larger scale
sounds<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> great<00:01:08.850> combo<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:10.229> we

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
sounds like a great combo to me then we

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
sounds like a great combo to me then we
also<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.100> Spartan<00:01:11.580> Locke<00:01:11.850> which<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
also get to see Spartan Locke which you

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.850 
also get to see Spartan Locke which you
know<00:01:13.140> say<00:01:13.380> what<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.680> about<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
know say what you want about the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.170 
know say what you want about the
character<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.520> looks<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> pretty

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
character but this looks like a pretty

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.550 
character but this looks like a pretty
awesome<00:01:15.270> figure<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.259> comes

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
awesome figure and you can see comes

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080 
awesome figure and you can see comes
with<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> BR<00:01:17.189> we'll<00:01:17.340> talk<00:01:17.520> about<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
with the BR we'll talk about that in a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.620 
with the BR we'll talk about that in a
minute<00:01:18.240> his<00:01:18.900> armor<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.409> much<00:01:19.830> more<00:01:20.630> organic

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
minute his armor is much more organic

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960 
minute his armor is much more organic
looking<00:01:21.869> much<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.229> curvy<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.799> swoopy<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
looking much more curvy and swoopy so I

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
looking much more curvy and swoopy so I
think<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:24.450> static<00:01:24.900> pose<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.320> doesn't

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
think these static pose here doesn't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
think these static pose here doesn't
quite<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.009> figure<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.060> people

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
quite do the figure just as some people

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.700 
quite do the figure just as some people
are<00:01:27.330> saying<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.630> proportions<00:01:28.229> look<00:01:28.380> weird

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
are saying that proportions look weird

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
are saying that proportions look weird
but<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:29.700> pretty<00:01:30.000> sure<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.570> be

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
but I'm pretty sure it's just gonna be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.420 
but I'm pretty sure it's just gonna be
that<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> pose<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.920> once<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.310> him

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that it's the pose and once you get him

I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.030> pose<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
I think that's just the pose with the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.940 
I think that's just the pose with the
lighting<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.259> don't<00:01:55.500> think<00:01:55.680> it'll<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
lighting I don't think it'll be a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.520 
lighting I don't think it'll be a
problem<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.520> all<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:57.689> then<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> said<00:01:58.140> he
