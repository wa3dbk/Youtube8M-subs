and<00:00:35.519> we're<00:00:35.789> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:35.969> kick<00:00:36.210> off<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.769> the

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
and we're going to kick off with the

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.470 
and we're going to kick off with the
anatomy<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.609> physiology<00:00:38.789> of<00:00:39.269> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
anatomy and physiology of the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.279 
anatomy and physiology of the
musculoskeletal<00:00:40.350> system<00:00:41.839> now<00:00:42.839> we<00:00:42.899> talk<00:00:43.199> about

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
musculoskeletal system now we talk about

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.310 
musculoskeletal system now we talk about
the<00:00:43.469> musculoskeletal<00:00:43.890> system<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.909> whole

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
the musculoskeletal system as a whole

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
the musculoskeletal system as a whole
but<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.530> ease<00:00:46.679> of<00:00:46.710> teaching<00:00:47.370> are<00:00:47.460> actually

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
but for ease of teaching are actually

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.579 
but for ease of teaching are actually
going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> divide<00:00:48.269> it<00:00:48.449> into<00:00:48.479> two<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.379> we'll

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
going to divide it into two so we'll

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.009 
going to divide it into two so we'll
we'll<00:00:49.890> deal<00:00:49.949> with<00:00:50.159> the<00:00:50.449> skeletal<00:00:51.449> system<00:00:51.659> and

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
we'll deal with the skeletal system and

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.229 
we'll deal with the skeletal system and
joints<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.619> what-have-you<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.729> then

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
joints and what-have-you first and then

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
joints and what-have-you first and then
go<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.629> muscles<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.469> see<00:00:55.739> how<00:00:55.920> skeletal

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
go into muscles and see how skeletal

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.799 
go into muscles and see how skeletal
muscles<00:00:56.789> work<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.329> we'll<00:00:57.420> look<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.659> their

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
muscles work and we'll look at their

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.500 
muscles work and we'll look at their
structure<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.879> next

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
structure and so on and then next

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.469 
structure and so on and then next
Tuesday<00:01:00.960> we'll<00:01:01.229> look<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.530> some<00:01:01.739> pathologies

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
Tuesday we'll look at some pathologies

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.189 
Tuesday we'll look at some pathologies
associated<00:01:03.479> with<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.750> musculoskeletal

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
associated with the musculoskeletal

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.309 
associated with the musculoskeletal
system<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> we'll<00:01:12.270> deal<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.720> skeletal

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
system so we'll deal with the skeletal

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:17.930 
system so we'll deal with the skeletal
system<00:01:13.470> first<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:16.460> we'll<00:01:17.460> look<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.819> the

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
system first and we'll look at the

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.830 
system first and we'll look at the
functions<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.179> many<00:01:21.450> functions

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
functions and there are many functions

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.840 
functions and there are many functions
of<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.380> skeleton<00:01:22.920> some<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.429> which<00:01:23.580> are

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
of the skeleton some of which are

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.169 
of the skeleton some of which are
blatantly<00:01:24.420> obvious<00:01:24.899> others<00:01:25.789> may<00:01:26.789> take<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.149> a

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
blatantly obvious others may take you a

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.050 
blatantly obvious others may take you a
little<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.450> by<00:01:27.720> surprise<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.729> first<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.940> all

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
little bit by surprise so first of all

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.039 
little bit by surprise so first of all
we<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.270> consider<00:01:33.690> its<00:01:33.899> function<00:01:34.319> of<00:01:34.500> support

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
we can consider its function of support

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.139 
we can consider its function of support
and<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.319> particular<00:01:37.469> its<00:01:38.130> supports<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.899> soft

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
and in particular its supports the soft

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.609 
and in particular its supports the soft
tissues<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.219> I<00:01:44.369> could<00:01:44.640> brick<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:46.170> lady's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
tissues so if I could brick this lady's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.789 
tissues so if I could brick this lady's
skull<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> cranium<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:47.969> just<00:01:48.570> suddenly<00:01:48.799> whip

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
skull the cranium and just suddenly whip

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.319 
skull the cranium and just suddenly whip
it<00:01:50.039> out<00:01:50.159> along<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.969> rest<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it out along with the rest of the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.149 
it out along with the rest of the
skeleton<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.679> trick<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
skeleton a bit like the trick with the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.499 
skeleton a bit like the trick with the
tablecloth<00:01:53.729> where<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.090> snatched<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
tablecloth where they snatched the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.330 
tablecloth where they snatched the
tablecloth<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.229> leave<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.100> plates

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
tablecloth and leave there the plates

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.370 
tablecloth and leave there the plates
and<00:01:56.549> things<00:01:56.729> she<00:01:57.450> will<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.840> become<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and things she will just become a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.099 
and things she will just become a
massive<00:01:58.710> soft<00:01:59.579> tissue<00:01:59.909> she'll<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:00.780> become<00:02:01.079> a

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
massive soft tissue she'll just become a

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.639 
massive soft tissue she'll just become a
bit<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> blob<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.039> jelly<00:02:02.990> okay<00:02:03.990> because<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
bit of a blob of jelly okay because the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.130 
bit of a blob of jelly okay because the
skeleton<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.249> inside<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.479> supporting

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
skeleton is inside and it's supporting

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.440 
skeleton is inside and it's supporting
everything<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:07.890> giving<00:02:08.340> structure<00:02:09.060> it's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
everything it's giving structure it's

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.810 
everything it's giving structure it's
giving<00:02:09.780> framework<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:13.140> refer<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:14.070> skeleton

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
giving framework we refer to a skeleton

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.449 
giving framework we refer to a skeleton
that's<00:02:15.000> inside<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.989> body<00:02:16.370> supporting<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
that's inside the body supporting the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.509 
that's inside the body supporting the
soft<00:02:17.730> tissues<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.390> an<00:02:19.400> endoskeleton<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
soft tissues as an endoskeleton so the

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.199 
soft tissues as an endoskeleton so the
human<00:02:23.819> skeleton<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.420> an<00:02:24.569> endoskeleton<00:02:25.230> endo

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
human skeleton is an endoskeleton endo

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.729 
human skeleton is an endoskeleton endo
meaning<00:02:27.209> within

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.070 

secondly<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:34.250> skeleton<00:02:34.760> provides<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.480> system

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
secondly the skeleton provides a system

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.009 
secondly the skeleton provides a system
of<00:02:36.700> levers<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.790> this<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.090> course<00:02:41.120> facilitates

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
of levers and this of course facilitates

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.960 
of levers and this of course facilitates
movement<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.010> locomotion<00:02:46.569> and<00:02:48.849> related<00:02:49.849> to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
movement and locomotion and related to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.300 
movement and locomotion and related to
point<00:02:50.209> number<00:02:50.450> two<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.980> skeleton<00:02:51.980> forms

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
point number two the skeleton forms

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.559 
point number two the skeleton forms
joints<00:02:52.910> at<00:02:53.120> various<00:02:53.599> places<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.819> joints<00:02:56.390> of

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
joints at various places and joints of

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:05.830 
joints at various places and joints of
course<00:02:56.840> are<00:02:57.080> for<00:03:01.569> articulation<00:03:02.569> mostly<00:03:04.840> there

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
course are for articulation mostly there

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.479 
course are for articulation mostly there
are<00:03:05.959> some<00:03:06.200> types<00:03:06.470> of<00:03:06.650> joints<00:03:07.010> which<00:03:07.190> are<00:03:07.310> for

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
are some types of joints which are for

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.059 
are some types of joints which are for
joining<00:03:07.970> bones<00:03:08.810> together<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.739> form<00:03:09.980> a

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
joining bones together to form a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.380 
joining bones together to form a
different<00:03:10.160> structure<00:03:10.640> we'll<00:03:10.940> look<00:03:11.090> at<00:03:11.269> that

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
different structure we'll look at that

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.910 
different structure we'll look at that
later<00:03:11.450> when<00:03:11.959> we<00:03:12.049> look<00:03:12.200> at<00:03:12.290> joints<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.739> more

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
later when we look at joints in more

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.890 
later when we look at joints in more
detail<00:03:13.280> but<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.060> whole<00:03:14.209> most<00:03:14.390> joints<00:03:14.780> are

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
detail but on the whole most joints are

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.069 
detail but on the whole most joints are
for<00:03:15.110> articulation<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:20.209> skeleton<00:03:20.660> is<00:03:20.780> also

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
for articulation the skeleton is also

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.559 
for articulation the skeleton is also
for<00:03:21.380> blood<00:03:21.739> cell<00:03:22.040> production<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.299> comes

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
for blood cell production and this comes

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.720 
for blood cell production and this comes
from<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.870> bone<00:03:27.079> marrow<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:31.010> all<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.430> our<00:03:31.549> blood

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
from the bone marrow so all of our blood

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.479 
from the bone marrow so all of our blood
cells<00:03:32.060> originate<00:03:32.750> from<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.709> bone<00:03:33.890> marrow<00:03:33.920> and

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
cells originate from the bone marrow and

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.340 
cells originate from the bone marrow and
the<00:03:34.549> bone<00:03:35.269> marrow<00:03:35.299> is<00:03:35.660> found<00:03:35.930> within<00:03:36.200> the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
the bone marrow is found within the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.979 
the bone marrow is found within the
Centers<00:03:36.889> of<00:03:37.100> most<00:03:37.670> bones<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:41.420> skeleton<00:03:41.870> is

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
Centers of most bones the skeleton is

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.400 
Centers of most bones the skeleton is
also<00:03:42.380> for<00:03:42.829> protection<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.930> gameís<00:03:45.260> is

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
also for protection and the gameís is
