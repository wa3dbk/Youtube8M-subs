00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
one location you just kind of pull it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.000 
one location you just kind of pull it

you

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.699 

load<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.340> up<00:02:49.430> with<00:02:49.459> our<00:02:49.700> flat<00:02:49.940> peg<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:51.500> time

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
load it up with our flat peg this time

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.920 
load it up with our flat peg this time
we<00:02:51.830> get

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
we get

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.790 
we get
more<00:02:54.680> than<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.069> did<00:02:55.220> with<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> black

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.830 

we<00:02:58.430> don't<00:02:58.610> line<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:58.970> up<00:02:59.060> exactly<00:02:59.570> where<00:02:59.720> the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
we don't line it up exactly where the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:14.170 
we don't line it up exactly where the
black<00:03:00.050> was<00:03:10.150> okay<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.880> would<00:03:14.030> go<00:03:14.150> a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
black was okay now this would go a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.250 
black was okay now this would go a
little<00:03:14.360> bit<00:03:14.510> quicker<00:03:14.660> if<00:03:14.960> I<00:03:15.050> wasn't

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
little bit quicker if I wasn't

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.140 
little bit quicker if I wasn't
demonstrating<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:17.890> now<00:03:18.890> we<00:03:18.950> load<00:03:19.340> up<00:03:19.370> our<00:03:19.760> red

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
demonstrating so now we load up our red

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.330 
demonstrating so now we load up our red
paint<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.720> we<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.290> want<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.590> lot<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.190> on

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
paint and we really want a lot of it on

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.809 
paint and we really want a lot of it on
there

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
there

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.149 
there
about<00:03:24.510> three<00:03:24.810> times<00:03:24.840> as<00:03:25.290> much<00:03:25.470> black<00:03:25.799> as<00:03:26.040> we

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
about three times as much black as we

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:30.949 
about three times as much black as we
they<00:03:27.470> all<00:03:28.470> right<00:03:29.090> see<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.599> see<00:03:30.780> that's

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
they all right see as you can see that's

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.160 
they all right see as you can see that's
that's<00:03:31.290> quite<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.650> bit<00:03:31.829> of<00:03:31.890> paint<00:03:32.099> on<00:03:32.250> there

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
that's quite a bit of paint on there

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.619 
that's quite a bit of paint on there
come<00:03:34.170> back<00:03:34.200> over<00:03:34.530> here<00:03:34.650> for<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.980> third<00:03:35.159> time

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
come back over here for the third time

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.990 
come back over here for the third time
you<00:03:36.629> start<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.049> right<00:03:37.230> below<00:03:37.439> there

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
you start it right below there

00:03:39.000 --> 00:04:18.740 
you start it right below there
maybe<00:03:39.690> off

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:30.000 

you<00:04:19.750> can<00:04:19.930> manipulate<00:04:20.139> do<00:04:23.340> those<00:04:24.340> lines

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.620 

what<00:04:31.010> when<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.090> want<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.300> make<00:04:32.420> sure<00:04:32.450> you

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
what when you you want to make sure you

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.140 
what when you you want to make sure you
have<00:04:32.750> this<00:04:32.900> adjusted<00:04:33.470> for<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.770> mist<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.520> not<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
have this adjusted for a mist and not a

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.570 
have this adjusted for a mist and not a
spray

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.480 

spray<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:39.879> spray<00:04:40.150> above<00:04:40.539> it

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.130 

so<00:04:44.000> you'll<00:04:44.240> run<00:04:44.420> down<00:04:44.660> through<00:04:44.930> there<00:04:45.110> like

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
so you'll run down through there like

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:55.950 
so you'll run down through there like
that<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:47.540> pull<00:04:47.810> more<00:04:48.020> color<00:04:48.320> with

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.179 

you

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:02.189 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.369 

now<00:05:02.759> it's<00:05:02.969> still<00:05:03.179> the<00:05:03.389> gravity<00:05:04.110> is<00:05:04.169> still

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
now it's still the gravity is still

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.299 
now it's still the gravity is still
doing<00:05:04.679> its<00:05:04.830> work

00:05:05.299 --> 00:05:05.309 
doing its work

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.570 
doing its work
so<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:06.330> painting<00:05:06.809> is<00:05:06.989> still<00:05:07.319> painting<00:05:08.249> if<00:05:08.520> you

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
so the painting is still painting if you

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.759 
so the painting is still painting if you
built<00:05:09.119> it's<00:05:09.659> not<00:05:09.899> through<00:05:10.229> doing<00:05:10.499> what<00:05:10.649> it's

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:10.769 
built it's not through doing what it's

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.879 
built it's not through doing what it's
going<00:05:10.889> to<00:05:10.979> do<00:05:11.419> but<00:05:12.419> we're<00:05:12.869> done<00:05:13.139> touching<00:05:13.739> it

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
going to do but we're done touching it

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.879 
going to do but we're done touching it
