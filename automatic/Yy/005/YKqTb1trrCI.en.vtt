the more I use this phone the more I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
the more I use this phone the more I
appreciate<00:01:05.129> how<00:01:05.280> comfortable<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.240> hold

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
appreciate how comfortable it is to hold

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570 
appreciate how comfortable it is to hold
and<00:01:06.630> use<00:01:06.780> I've<00:01:07.439> seen<00:01:07.650> plenty<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.070> other<00:01:08.250> phones

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and use I've seen plenty of other phones

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
and use I've seen plenty of other phones
this<00:01:08.850> size<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.299> course<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.140> usually

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this size of course but that usually

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.440 
this size of course but that usually
comes<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> cost<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.909> much<00:01:12.150> smaller

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
comes at the cost of a much smaller

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.810 
comes at the cost of a much smaller
screen<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:14.010> obviously<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
screen here that's obviously not the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.539 
screen here that's obviously not the
case<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:16.110> me<00:01:16.290> around<00:01:17.040> four<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> half

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
case now for me around four and a half

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
case now for me around four and a half
inches<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.360> where<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> screen<00:01:18.990> jumps<00:01:19.380> from

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
inches is where the screen jumps from

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
inches is where the screen jumps from
okay<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.640> big<00:01:21.150> enough<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.600> me<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> use

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
okay to big enough for me to use

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260 
okay to big enough for me to use
comfortably<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> Moto<00:01:23.460> X<00:01:23.729> definitely

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
comfortably so the Moto X definitely

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.390 
comfortably so the Moto X definitely
works<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> case<00:01:25.200> I've<00:01:25.439> played<00:01:26.130> around

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
works in that case I've played around

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
works in that case I've played around
with<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> clear<00:01:26.970> pixel<00:01:27.360> camera<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.750> little<00:01:27.840> bit

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
with the clear pixel camera a little bit

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
with the clear pixel camera a little bit
the<00:01:28.770> gesture<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> launch<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.939> pretty<00:01:30.210> cool<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the gesture to launch is pretty cool and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.170 
the gesture to launch is pretty cool and
it<00:01:30.869> definitely<00:01:31.049> takes<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.680> decent<00:01:32.130> photo<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.150> I

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it definitely takes a decent photo but I

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
it definitely takes a decent photo but I
haven't<00:01:33.630> done<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> in-depth<00:01:34.439> testing

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
haven't done the in-depth testing

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.030 
haven't done the in-depth testing
required<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.329> RGB<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.470> sensor

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
required to see if the RGB see sensor

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.660 
required to see if the RGB see sensor
here<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:39.030> makes<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.390> difference

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 

if<00:01:42.479> there's<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.900> thing<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.200> find<00:01:43.350> really

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
if there's one thing I find really

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
if there's one thing I find really
surprising<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.640> Moto<00:01:44.820> X<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.330> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
surprising about the Moto X it's the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
surprising about the Moto X it's the
price<00:01:45.750> everybody<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.890> expecting<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.580> be

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
price everybody was expecting it to be

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.060 
price everybody was expecting it to be
much<00:01:48.060> cheaper<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> case<00:01:49.680> if

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
much cheaper and that is in the case if

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.670 
much cheaper and that is in the case if
it<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.670> priced<00:01:50.970> similarly<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> nexus<00:01:52.439> 4

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it was priced similarly to the nexus 4

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.920 
it was priced similarly to the nexus 4
for<00:01:52.920> example<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.520> think<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.180> would<00:01:54.270> fly<00:01:54.540> off<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
for example I think it would fly off the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.230 
for example I think it would fly off the
shelves<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.439> launch<00:01:55.710> day<00:01:55.860> we<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> current

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
shelves on launch day we at the current

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.170 
shelves on launch day we at the current
price<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.509> 1<00:01:57.960> 99<00:01:58.320> on<00:01:58.680> contract<00:01:59.399> I'm<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.909> so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
price of 1 99 on contract I'm not so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.050 
price of 1 99 on contract I'm not so
sure<00:02:00.210> we'll<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.590> happens<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.670> my<00:02:02.820> time

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
sure we'll see what happens and my time

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.880 
sure we'll see what happens and my time
playing<00:02:03.240> around<00:02:03.630> with<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> moto<00:02:04.110> x<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.590> actually

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
playing around with a moto x I actually

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
playing around with a moto x I actually
like<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.369> quite<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> bit<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.630> that's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
like it quite a bit but that's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.710 
like it quite a bit but that's
subjective<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:08.250> an<00:02:08.369> objective<00:02:09.119> look<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.569> it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
subjective for an objective look at it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.910 
subjective for an objective look at it
