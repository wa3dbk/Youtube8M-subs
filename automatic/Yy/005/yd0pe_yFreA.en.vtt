tutorials the user noticed I had a bunch
of<00:00:28.460> different<00:00:28.820> sequences<00:00:29.150> open<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.680> I<00:00:30.769> have<00:00:30.920> a

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
of different sequences open and I have a

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.499 
of different sequences open and I have a
project<00:00:31.189> file<00:00:31.460> open<00:00:31.760> right<00:00:31.880> now<00:00:31.910> of<00:00:32.239> my<00:00:32.359> new

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
project file open right now of my new

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.750 
project file open right now of my new
cartoon<00:00:32.960> a<00:00:33.200> hajur<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:33.920> segi<00:00:34.130> truth<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:34.700> if

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
cartoon a hajur the segi truth and if

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.190 
cartoon a hajur the segi truth and if
you<00:00:34.850> want<00:00:35.030> to<00:00:35.120> check<00:00:35.270> that<00:00:35.420> out<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:35.899> can<00:00:35.930> go<00:00:36.140> to

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
you want to check that out you can go to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.780 
you want to check that out you can go to
the<00:00:36.440> trough<00:00:36.649> group<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:36.950> films<00:00:37.220> channel<00:00:37.579> and

could<00:00:42.050> do<00:00:42.140> with<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:43.160> anyway<00:00:43.489> what<00:00:44.180> I

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
could do with that but anyway what I

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.959 
could do with that but anyway what I
have<00:00:44.390> done<00:00:44.600> here<00:00:44.930> is<00:00:45.050> created<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.190> project<00:00:46.520> that

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
have done here is created a project that

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.319 
have done here is created a project that
has<00:00:47.120> multiple<00:00:47.629> sequences<00:00:48.140> now<00:00:49.300> what<00:00:50.300> a

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
has multiple sequences now what a

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.470 
has multiple sequences now what a
sequence<00:00:50.809> is<00:00:50.989> in<00:00:51.320> Premiere<00:00:52.010> is<00:00:52.160> simply<00:00:52.789> just<00:00:52.820> a

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
sequence is in Premiere is simply just a

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.130 
sequence is in Premiere is simply just a
I<00:00:54.110> would<00:00:54.469> say<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.710> blank<00:00:55.190> timeline<00:00:55.850> um<00:00:56.140> it's

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
I would say a blank timeline um it's

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.119 
I would say a blank timeline um it's
almost<00:00:57.289> as<00:00:57.500> if<00:00:57.530> you're<00:00:57.739> working<00:00:58.010> with

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
almost as if you're working with

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.490 
almost as if you're working with
multiple<00:00:58.399> project<00:00:58.969> files<00:00:59.149> if<00:00:59.539> you<00:01:00.110> were<00:01:00.260> for

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
multiple project files if you were for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.900 
multiple project files if you were for
instance<00:01:00.590> working<00:01:01.039> with<00:01:01.129> anime<00:01:01.430> studio<00:01:01.579> or

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
instance working with anime studio or

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.899 
instance working with anime studio or
flash<00:01:02.180> since<00:01:02.629> a<00:01:02.899> lot<00:01:03.110> of<00:01:03.199> my<00:01:03.320> subscribers<00:01:03.980> work

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
flash since a lot of my subscribers work

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.190 
flash since a lot of my subscribers work
with<00:01:05.029> those<00:01:05.149> software<00:01:05.600> they<00:01:05.719> probably<00:01:05.929> know

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
with those software they probably know

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.699 
with those software they probably know
what<00:01:06.319> that<00:01:06.469> is<00:01:06.649> but<00:01:07.549> with<00:01:08.119> my<00:01:08.600> editing<00:01:09.079> what<00:01:09.679> I

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:09.709 
what that is but with my editing what I

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.580 
what that is but with my editing what I
usually<00:01:10.130> do<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.549> I<00:01:10.729> go<00:01:10.969> through<00:01:10.999> and<00:01:11.630> every

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
usually do is I go through and every

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.459 
usually do is I go through and every
scene<00:01:12.950> I<00:01:13.189> put<00:01:13.670> into<00:01:13.909> a<00:01:14.090> sequence<00:01:14.719> so<00:01:15.170> for<00:01:15.380> my

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
scene I put into a sequence so for my

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.730 
scene I put into a sequence so for my
first<00:01:15.649> scene<00:01:16.039> here<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:17.060> have<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:18.079> captain<00:01:18.560> and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
first scene here we have the captain and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.039 
first scene here we have the captain and
she's<00:01:18.950> walking<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.520> she<00:01:19.609> sees<00:01:19.849> the<00:01:20.630> commotion

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
she's walking and she sees the commotion

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.510 
she's walking and she sees the commotion
going<00:01:21.079> on<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.649> she<00:01:21.799> gets<00:01:21.950> mad<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.399> then

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
going on and she gets mad and then

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.309 
going on and she gets mad and then
that's<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.270> end<00:01:23.359> of<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.569> sequence<00:01:23.749> and<00:01:24.229> then

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
that's the end of the sequence and then

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.440 
that's the end of the sequence and then
the<00:01:24.409> next<00:01:24.649> sequence<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.219> on<00:01:25.459> the<00:01:25.609> bridge<00:01:25.849> where

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
the next sequence is on the bridge where

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.239 
the next sequence is on the bridge where
I<00:01:26.479> have<00:01:26.719> all<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:26.990> going<00:01:27.319> on<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:27.499> then<00:01:27.920> when

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
I have all this going on and then when

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.760 
I have all this going on and then when
it<00:01:28.340> ends<00:01:28.789> you<00:01:29.029> know<00:01:29.539> with<00:01:30.109> the<00:01:30.229> bridge<00:01:30.409> then<00:01:30.679> we

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
it ends you know with the bridge then we

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.219 
it ends you know with the bridge then we
go<00:01:30.889> to<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.159> next<00:01:31.340> sequence<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:32.899> the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
go to the next sequence and so on so the

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.469 
go to the next sequence and so on so the
question<00:01:33.619> then<00:01:33.799> becomes<00:01:34.159> how<00:01:34.490> do<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.240> get<00:01:35.359> all

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
question then becomes how do you get all

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.730 
question then becomes how do you get all
this<00:01:35.630> together<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.109> you<00:01:36.409> have<00:01:36.529> all<00:01:36.649> these

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
this together so you have all these

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.739 
this together so you have all these
sequences<00:01:37.039> they're<00:01:37.459> all<00:01:37.579> split<00:01:37.880> up<00:01:37.999> how<00:01:38.689> to

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
sequences they're all split up how to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:39.429 
sequences they're all split up how to
get<00:01:38.959> them<00:01:39.049> together

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
get them together

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.789 
get them together
well<00:01:40.130> once<00:01:40.849> I<00:01:41.029> have<00:01:41.270> edited<00:01:41.779> all<00:01:41.959> my<00:01:42.259> sequences

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
well once I have edited all my sequences

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.159 
well once I have edited all my sequences
what<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.039> do<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.459> I<00:01:43.489> make<00:01:43.819> another<00:01:44.329> sequence

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:45.169 
what I do is I make another sequence

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:46.629 
what I do is I make another sequence
surprise<00:01:46.159> huh

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
surprise huh

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.440 
surprise huh
called<00:01:47.209> the<00:01:47.959> main<00:01:48.169> sequence<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.270> see

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
called the main sequence and you can see

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.719 
called the main sequence and you can see
it's<00:01:50.599> right<00:01:50.779> here<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.380> what<00:01:52.279> I<00:01:52.310> have<00:01:52.549> done

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
it's right here and what I have done

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.219 
it's right here and what I have done
here<00:01:52.789> then<00:01:53.359> is<00:01:53.599> simply<00:01:54.289> put<00:01:54.919> my<00:01:55.459> sequences

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
here then is simply put my sequences

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.440 
here then is simply put my sequences
into<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.349> sequence<00:01:57.770> so<00:01:58.549> for<00:01:58.759> instance<00:01:59.119> let's

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
into the sequence so for instance let's

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.629 
into the sequence so for instance let's
say<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.840> course<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.319> hallway<00:02:00.739> sequence<00:02:01.369> comes

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
say of course the hallway sequence comes

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:07.359 
say of course the hallway sequence comes
first<00:02:02.109> well<00:02:03.109> I<00:02:03.380> can<00:02:03.979> go<00:02:04.130> into<00:02:04.279> my<00:02:05.079> messy<00:02:06.369> file

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
first well I can go into my messy file

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.929 
first well I can go into my messy file
browser<00:02:07.700> here<00:02:08.090> because<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.590> obviously<00:02:09.939> haven't

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
browser here because I obviously haven't

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.870 
browser here because I obviously haven't
really<00:02:11.209> been<00:02:11.329> keeping<00:02:11.659> up<00:02:11.900> with<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:13.310> can

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
really been keeping up with it and I can

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.880 
really been keeping up with it and I can
Kait<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.270> sequence<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.930> then<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.770> just

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
Kait that sequence and then I can just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.110 
Kait that sequence and then I can just
bring<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.460> like<00:02:16.640> that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
bring it in like that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.990 
bring it in like that
and<00:02:17.290> now<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:19.040> can<00:02:19.190> watch<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.460> sequence<00:02:19.790> play

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and now we can watch the sequence play

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.060 
and now we can watch the sequence play
out<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.540> go<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.990> next<00:02:21.290> scene

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
out and then we can go to the next scene

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.210 
out and then we can go to the next scene
and<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.290> good<00:02:24.650> thing<00:02:24.710> about<00:02:24.950> this

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
and so on now the good thing about this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.120 
and so on now the good thing about this
method<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.850> yes<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.690> could<00:02:26.990> go<00:02:27.410> into<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
method is yes you could go into the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.550 
method is yes you could go into the
hallway<00:02:28.490> sequence<00:02:29.030> make<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> video<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.110> then

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
hallway sequence make a video and then

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.590 
hallway sequence make a video and then
import<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.220> video<00:02:31.490> into<00:02:31.820> your<00:02:31.940> bin<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.390> then

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
import that video into your bin and then

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.260 
import that video into your bin and then
import<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.080> video<00:02:33.170> onto<00:02:33.500> your<00:02:33.740> scene<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
import the video onto your scene but the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.940 
import the video onto your scene but the
good<00:02:35.420> thing<00:02:35.450> about<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.170> if<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.620> make<00:02:36.800> any

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
good thing about this is if I make any

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.950 
good thing about this is if I make any
changes<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> sequence<00:02:38.240> let's<00:02:38.600> say<00:02:38.750> for

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
changes on the sequence let's say for

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.420 
changes on the sequence let's say for
instance<00:02:38.990> I<00:02:39.320> don't<00:02:39.380> want<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.830> sound<00:02:40.100> effect

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
instance I don't want the sound effect

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.700 
instance I don't want the sound effect
in<00:02:40.550> there<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.880> remove<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.480> where<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.930> trim<00:02:42.620> up

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
in there I remove that where I trim up

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.860 
in there I remove that where I trim up
the<00:02:42.830> sequence<00:02:43.190> or<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.520> change<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.240> filter<00:02:44.630> or

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the sequence or I change the filter or

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.950 
the sequence or I change the filter or
whatever<00:02:45.320> it<00:02:45.680> will<00:02:46.390> automatically<00:02:47.390> reflect

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
whatever it will automatically reflect

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.230 
whatever it will automatically reflect
that<00:02:48.140> on<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:49.100> sequence<00:02:49.490> that<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.730> put<00:02:49.970> into

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
that on the sequence that you put into

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.350 
that on the sequence that you put into
your<00:02:50.480> main<00:02:51.170> sequence<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.940> really<00:02:53.240> nice

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
your main sequence so it's a really nice

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.810 
your main sequence so it's a really nice
way<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.690> be<00:02:53.870> able<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.230> control<00:02:54.620> things<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.310> to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
way to be able to control things and to

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.470 
way to be able to control things and to
be<00:02:55.940> able<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.830> work<00:02:57.830> on<00:02:57.980> multiple<00:02:58.280> clips<00:02:59.180> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
be able to work on multiple clips and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.150 
be able to work on multiple clips and
then<00:02:59.810> just<00:03:00.020> combine<00:03:00.380> them<00:03:00.530> all<00:03:00.680> at<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:00.980> end

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
then just combine them all at the end

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.950 
then just combine them all at the end
now<00:03:01.940> there's<00:03:02.120> some<00:03:02.270> people<00:03:02.390> out<00:03:02.600> there<00:03:02.810> who

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
now there's some people out there who

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.840 
now there's some people out there who
like<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.260> work<00:03:03.590> with<00:03:03.830> just<00:03:03.950> one<00:03:04.160> sequence<00:03:04.520> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
like to work with just one sequence and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.070 
like to work with just one sequence and
they<00:03:04.940> put<00:03:05.150> all<00:03:05.300> their<00:03:05.480> stuff<00:03:05.510> on<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.960> that

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
they put all their stuff on to that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.620 
they put all their stuff on to that
sequence<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:06.650> they<00:03:06.730> drop<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:07.970> they<00:03:08.060> trim<00:03:08.390> and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
sequence and they drop and they trim and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.660 
sequence and they drop and they trim and
they<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:09.650> know<00:03:09.740> do<00:03:09.920> everything<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.400> there

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
they you know do everything on there

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.240 
they you know do everything on there
just<00:03:11.420> one<00:03:11.630> sequence<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.830> completely

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
just one sequence and that is completely

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.270 
just one sequence and that is completely
fine<00:03:13.490> this<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.240> just<00:03:14.480> my<00:03:14.840> method<00:03:15.200> or<00:03:15.380> one<00:03:16.100> of<00:03:16.190> my

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
fine this is just my method or one of my

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.490 
fine this is just my method or one of my
methods<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.270> thought<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:17.660> would<00:03:17.990> share<00:03:18.230> and

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
methods and I thought I would share and

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.560 
methods and I thought I would share and
the<00:03:19.010> other<00:03:19.190> good<00:03:19.730> thing<00:03:19.910> about<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.510> method

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
the other good thing about this method

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.750 
the other good thing about this method
is<00:03:21.110> in<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:22.070> case<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.490> this<00:03:22.730> series<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.690> have<00:03:24.760> the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
is in the case of this series I have the

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.420 
is in the case of this series I have the
series<00:03:26.630> taking<00:03:26.930> place<00:03:27.110> on<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> ship<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.400> I

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
series taking place on a ship and so I

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.520 
series taking place on a ship and so I
have<00:03:28.730> some<00:03:29.030> like<00:03:29.210> space<00:03:29.540> noises<00:03:29.780> going<00:03:30.110> on<00:03:30.320> you

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
have some like space noises going on you

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.040 
have some like space noises going on you
hear<00:03:30.710> like<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.580> like<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.820> low<00:03:32.270> roaring<00:03:32.660> going

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
hear like just like a low roaring going

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.510 
hear like just like a low roaring going
on<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.350> background<00:03:33.800> with<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:33.920> spaceship

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
on in the background with the spaceship

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.460 
on in the background with the spaceship
well<00:03:35.180> once<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.510> have<00:03:35.660> all<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.840> sequences<00:03:36.260> put

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
well once I have all the sequences put

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.890 
well once I have all the sequences put
together<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.920> can<00:03:37.160> then<00:03:37.370> put<00:03:37.610> those<00:03:38.210> sound

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
together I can then put those sound

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.380 
together I can then put those sound
effects<00:03:39.200> like<00:03:39.890> for<00:03:40.070> instance<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.610> spaceship

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
effects like for instance the spaceship

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.660 
effects like for instance the spaceship
engine<00:03:41.720> room<00:03:41.900> sound<00:03:42.140> effect<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:43.430> keep

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
engine room sound effect and just keep

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.610 
engine room sound effect and just keep
repeating<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.330> then<00:03:44.540> throughout<00:03:45.050> all<00:03:45.440> my

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
repeating it then throughout all my

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.030 
repeating it then throughout all my
clips<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.600> that<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.810> doesn't<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.920> know

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
clips to so that it doesn't you know

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.010 
clips to so that it doesn't you know
sound<00:03:49.400> like<00:03:49.520> it<00:03:49.580> get<00:03:49.700> cut<00:03:50.090> or<00:03:50.330> anything<00:03:50.780> like

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
sound like it get cut or anything like

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.360 
sound like it get cut or anything like
that<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.530> course<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:51.920> could<00:03:52.040> do<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.250> if

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
that of course you could do that if
