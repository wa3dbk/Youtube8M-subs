into<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.780> game<00:00:33.929> against<00:00:34.260> aventis<00:00:34.679> they<00:00:34.800> are

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
into the game against aventis they are

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.139 
into the game against aventis they are
currently<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> table<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
currently first in the table as you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.849 
currently first in the table as you
might<00:00:36.300> seen<00:00:36.539> from<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> league<00:00:37.079> table<00:00:37.260> so

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
might seen from the league table so

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.110 
might seen from the league table so
they're<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.249> of<00:00:38.309> running<00:00:38.519> away<00:00:38.609> with<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.999> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
they're kind of running away with it so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.520 
they're kind of running away with it so
it's<00:00:39.179> important<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> get<00:00:39.839> a<00:00:39.899> couple<00:00:40.109> of<00:00:40.260> points

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it's important to get a couple of points

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.349 
it's important to get a couple of points
from<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.519> you<00:00:41.579> Ventus<00:00:41.940> took<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> lead

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
from this so you Ventus took the lead

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.880 
from this so you Ventus took the lead
early<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> game<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.769> really

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
early on in the game and it's really

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.919 
early on in the game and it's really
important<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.429> not<00:00:44.670> let<00:00:44.730> an<00:00:45.089> early<00:00:45.510> goal<00:00:45.659> go

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
important to not let an early goal go

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:48.470 
important to not let an early goal go

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
p.m. so we start the second now for

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.710 
p.m. so we start the second now for
needing<00:01:29.430> two<00:01:29.640> goals<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.030> least<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.330> get<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.480> draw

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
needing two goals at least to get a draw

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.930 
needing two goals at least to get a draw
and<00:01:30.990> Balotelli<00:01:31.380> once<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.250> wants<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> win<00:01:32.910> the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
and Balotelli once that wants to win the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.030 
and Balotelli once that wants to win the
game<00:01:33.060> any<00:01:33.390> chops<00:01:33.810> past<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.140> defender<00:01:34.260> I<00:01:34.710> think

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
game any chops past the defender I think

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.380 
game any chops past the defender I think
that's<00:01:35.160> been<00:01:35.340> each<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.790> then<00:01:35.880> finishes<00:01:36.300> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that's been each it and then finishes it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.570 
that's been each it and then finishes it
in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> 54th<00:01:37.170> minute<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.620> finishes<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> off

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
in the 54th minute and finishes it off

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.120 
in the 54th minute and finishes it off
with<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> muscle<00:01:39.390> flex<00:01:39.600> celebration<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.770> we

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
with the muscle flex celebration so we

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
with the muscle flex celebration so we
needed<00:01:41.490> another<00:01:41.580> goal<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.210> next<00:01:42.450> goal<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
needed another goal the next goal was a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.540 
needed another goal the next goal was a
crucial<00:01:43.050> goal<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.860> you've<00:01:43.980> enter<00:01:44.250> scored

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
crucial goal and if you've enter scored

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.190 
crucial goal and if you've enter scored
it<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.790> would<00:01:44.940> win<00:01:45.120> it<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> look<00:01:46.020> what's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it they would win it and look what's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.750 
it they would win it and look what's
going<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.500> happen<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.010> they<00:01:47.160> score<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.640> to

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
going to happen and they score there to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.430 
going to happen and they score there to
stay<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.150> could<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.390> done<00:01:48.510> better<00:01:48.660> didn't

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
stay and could have done better didn't

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.440 
stay and could have done better didn't

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
season and we haven't actually drawn

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310 
season and we haven't actually drawn
many<00:02:05.940> games<00:02:06.270> we've<00:02:06.540> lost<00:02:06.720> about<00:02:06.870> four<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.200> five

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
many games we've lost about four or five

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.499 
many games we've lost about four or five
already<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.369> good<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.909> have<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.420> of

already so it's good we have to kind of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.330 
already so it's good we have to kind of
work<00:02:09.899> something<00:02:10.319> out<00:02:10.409> to<00:02:10.649> stop<00:02:10.920> losing<00:02:11.069> all

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
work something out to stop losing all

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.570 
work something out to stop losing all
these<00:02:11.489> games

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
these games

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.460 
these games
where<00:02:12.820> she<00:02:12.970> approached<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.750> transfer

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
where she approached in the transfer

where she approached in the transfer
window<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.950> I've<00:02:15.040> actually<00:02:15.190> already<00:02:15.580> played

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
comfortable with but by the way war girl

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.570 
comfortable with but by the way war girl
that<00:02:29.410> was<00:02:29.530> from<00:02:29.680> shackling<00:02:30.040> with<00:02:30.160> his<00:02:30.280> weaker

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
that was from shackling with his weaker

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.790 
that was from shackling with his weaker
foot<00:02:30.730> into<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.420> back<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.750> net<00:02:31.960> so<00:02:32.560> yeah<00:02:32.770> I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
foot into the back of the net so yeah I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.310 
foot into the back of the net so yeah I
want<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.070> swap<00:02:33.250> 235<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.970> have<00:02:34.270> maybe<00:02:34.660> three

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
want to swap 235 to have maybe three

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.900 
want to swap 235 to have maybe three
defenders<00:02:35.740> so<00:02:35.950> it's<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.220> patter<00:02:36.430> we'll<00:02:36.670> go<00:02:36.820> at

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
defenders so it's a patter we'll go at

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.070 
defenders so it's a patter we'll go at
the<00:02:36.970> end<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.210> season<00:02:37.330> but<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.660> think<00:02:37.930> at

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the end of the season but I think at

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.920 
the end of the season but I think at
FIFA<00:02:38.440> glitch<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.790> plays<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.660> fifa

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
FIFA glitch that you have plays on fifa

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.200 
FIFA glitch that you have plays on fifa
13<00:02:40.960> for<00:02:41.860> two<00:02:42.070> seasons<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.730> that's<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.970> bit<00:02:43.090> of

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
13 for two seasons so that's a bit of

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.850 
13 for two seasons so that's a bit of
glitch<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.930> I'll<00:02:44.080> probably<00:02:44.230> hang<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.710> to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
glitch so I'll probably hang on to

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.190 
glitch so I'll probably hang on to
Zapata<00:02:45.190> ver<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.030> they<00:02:46.180> will<00:02:46.360> go<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.630> back<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
Zapata ver and they will go to back to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.650 
Zapata ver and they will go to back to
real<00:02:47.470> madrid<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:47.980> I'll<00:02:48.580> be<00:02:48.700> left<00:02:48.850> with<00:02:49.000> mex's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
real madrid and I'll be left with mex's

here<00:04:29.199> Zapata<00:04:29.530> should<00:04:29.800> done<00:04:29.979> better<00:04:30.130> in<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
here Zapata should done better in the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.420 
here Zapata should done better in the
box<00:04:30.639> and<00:04:30.850> I'm<00:04:31.240> finding<00:04:31.600> ver<00:04:32.139> la<00:04:32.530> Meck<00:04:32.919> says<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
box and I'm finding ver la Meck says and

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.159 
box and I'm finding ver la Meck says and
Zapata<00:04:33.610> aren't<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.150> best<00:04:34.240> for<00:04:34.449> heading<00:04:34.690> they

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
Zapata aren't the best for heading they

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.170 
Zapata aren't the best for heading they
are<00:04:35.320> quite<00:04:35.560> Pacey<00:04:35.860> but<00:04:36.250> they're<00:04:36.699> not<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.060> best

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
are quite Pacey but they're not the best

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.850 
are quite Pacey but they're not the best
of<00:04:37.360> heading<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:37.870> most<00:04:38.169> strikers<00:04:38.530> are<00:04:38.650> out

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
of heading and most strikers are out

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.110 
of heading and most strikers are out
jumping<00:04:39.220> them<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.520> scoring<00:04:39.789> so<00:04:39.970> you'll

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
jumping them and scoring so you'll

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.120 
jumping them and scoring so you'll
probably<00:04:40.240> notice<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:41.350> most<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.710> girls<00:04:41.919> at

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.350 
certainly there's two in this episode
there<00:04:53.680> was<00:04:53.800> one<00:04:54.160> before<00:04:54.490> when<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:55.030> was<00:04:55.150> talking

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
there was one before when I was talking

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.629 
there was one before when I was talking

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
about something else so Balotelli

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.550

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
schooled in the 57th minute and he

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.900 
schooled in the 57th minute and he
wasn't<00:04:59.740> got<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.160> wasn't<00:05:00.490> going<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.669> miss<00:05:00.789> him

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
wasn't got it wasn't going to miss him

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.420 
wasn't got it wasn't going to miss him
there<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.300> apparently<00:05:01.750> his<00:05:02.199> penalty<00:05:02.979> stuck<00:05:03.340> I

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
there and apparently his penalty stuck I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.529 
there and apparently his penalty stuck I
talked<00:05:03.639> about<00:05:03.820> that<00:05:03.970> he's<00:05:04.060> never<00:05:04.240> missed<00:05:04.419> a

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
talked about that he's never missed a

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.659 
talked about that he's never missed a
penalty<00:05:04.660> is<00:05:04.990> true<00:05:05.260> so<00:05:05.830> he<00:05:05.919> scores<00:05:06.160> again<00:05:06.400> here

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
penalty is true so he scores again here

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.100 
penalty is true so he scores again here
and<00:05:06.850> there's<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.300> fantastical<00:05:07.900> with<00:05:08.020> his

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
stopping them and it comes a bit it

stopping them and it comes a bit it
becomes<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.180> bit<00:05:22.300> panicky<00:05:22.750> so<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.280> make<00:05:24.280> these

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
becomes a bit panicky so I make these

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.900 
becomes a bit panicky so I make these
stupid<00:05:24.789> error<00:05:24.940> here<00:05:25.210> Verona<00:05:25.630> just<00:05:26.050> being
