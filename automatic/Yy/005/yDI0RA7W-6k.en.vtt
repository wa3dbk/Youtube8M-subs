 often young people who spend their 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.640
 days behind a screen to goinfrer 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.529
 jobs street people who so 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.179
 watch other people finally play 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.179
 really nothing to do with his life what

 ico partners is a company 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 specialized in market analysis

 European online video games thanks

 to their methods of monitoring 6000 sites

 internet all over europe 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.900
 they were able to unveil the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 most mentioned video games by 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 sites in 2014 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 among the ten most cited games on

 found in 1st place crazy fit

 warfare watchdog battlefield 4 is a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.540
 remake of a game released in 2002 a 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.280
 rich result of lessons that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.619
 proves that the web media is not 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.420
 different from the TV in this sense 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:56.850
 where we do not speak entirely of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 best games we talk about games 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.080
 more goods and so the more 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.729
 expected little vicious circle that makes 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.530
 that the most anticipated games are 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.030
 blow the most anticipated games because everything 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 the world is talking about it is like the effect 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.549
 snowball but without the poetry of the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.770
 Snowflake 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.110
 what to remember that on this sweet 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.729
 earth what we talk about less are 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.729
 often those who make it the most 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.690
 microsoft announces that it will hold its 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.820
 promise 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.070
 you had pretended to forget by 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.430
 politeness but the announcement of the xbox 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.080
 one 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.240
 he had been promised to do 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.870
 any xbox on a kit of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 development 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.430
 the promise is so everyone with his xbox 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.720
 one bought in store and the right to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.670
 develop small games or 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.050
 apps on for most 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.850
 players that does not mean that they are going 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.479
 to get to live something at the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.070
 programming 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.409
 but it's mostly the promise to see 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 appear on the xbox full market 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.610
 applications like on smartphone and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 I hardly dare to think about it maybe 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.310
 probably potentially in 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.470
 expectantly 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
 a nice little game for kinect 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.430
 an opening scheduled for this summer that 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.950
 predicts a wave of applications 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.440
 for November either as if by chance at 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.420
 moment when windows 10 will come out and where it 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.340
 will try to prove tooth and nail that he 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.690
 is compatible with xbox one 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.430
 qed I would agree with 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.440
 you and I say yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.120
 you're right it's fucked it's shit 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.360
 fucking everything is rotten andres case it's 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:29.280
 less of here went to live in the woods 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.230
 but no I will not say that I'm not 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.550
 Okay 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.250
 first big triple out of 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.140
 the year and already the first controversy 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.970
 revealed for the first time at e3 2013 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.140
 zii order 1886 finally arrives on ps4 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.150
 presented at the time as the iron of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.890
 launches the new sony console the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.570
 game crystallized all expectations 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.670
 around this new generation of 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.160
 generation consoles still at the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.200
 looking for a real nexgen posture this 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.450
 game that had participated in the excitement 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.640
 that sparked the announcement of the ps4 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.340
 finally turns out to be a classic 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.470
 tps with enemies can motivate to 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.540
 get out of their waypoints and with 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.220
 many phases of ass you are nothing e 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.930
 innovative so if not a rendered a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.310
 hair more beautiful than the games of the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.290
 previous generation 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.940
 if it becomes every month more difficult 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.769
 to wait for big publishers 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.630
 taking risks in gameplay 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.269
 innovating some resentment 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.160
 emerging in players resentment 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.959
 which is never fully verbalized and 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.150
 which is anchored on themes in 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.100
 particular here the controversy is 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.200
 focuses on the fact that six order is 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.510
 would finish in five six hours of which almost 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.400
 two hours in phase not played duration 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.019
 of life is not necessarily a criterion for 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.570
 quality of a game and you have to understand 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.280
 that behind this polemic targeted 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.110
 hides something other than the announce of a 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.209
 expensive game very short whose levels in 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.160
 corridor the frozen scenario and the lack of 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.989
 multiplayer prevents to extend 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.310
 the work a long time not that after 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.290
 everything is banal 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.970
 in reality this controversy over time 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.709
 of life is only the icon on which 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.750
 grafted a discontent more 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.940
 globalized linked to a generation that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.390
 is not up to nothing that does not deliver 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.280
 nothing more zii order 1886 was to be 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.410
 for many the actual beginning of this 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.300
 new generation of video games on the 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.099
 public place this week we have nothing 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.830
 could do other than observe that six 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:17.370
 order 1886 showed up at the crowd 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.260
 as the end of the 2015 next-gen illusion 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.970
 nevertheless offers several appointments 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.460
 that help to keep hope 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.290
 final fantasy quinced for example it's 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.290
 maybe here the next-gen starts
