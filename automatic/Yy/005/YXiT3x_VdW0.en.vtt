00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
clear is something we call negation

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.940 
clear is something we call negation
which<00:02:32.380> simply<00:02:32.800> means<00:02:33.750> showing<00:02:34.750> what<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.500> word

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
which simply means showing what a word

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.710 
which simply means showing what a word
is<00:02:36.160> not<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:37.630> order<00:02:37.960> to<00:02:38.080> explain<00:02:38.530> what<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.370> is

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
is not in order to explain what it is

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.200 
is not in order to explain what it is
for<00:02:40.720> example<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.230> whale<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.830> not<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.640> fish<00:02:42.940> a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
for example a whale is not a fish a

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.750 
for example a whale is not a fish a
whale<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.350> large<00:02:44.650> mammal<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.130> lives<00:02:45.490> in

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
whale is a large mammal that lives in

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.920 
whale is a large mammal that lives in
the<00:02:45.910> sea<00:02:46.150> or<00:02:47.490> success<00:02:48.490> is<00:02:48.730> not<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.270> large<00:02:49.600> bank

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the sea or success is not a large bank

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.040 
the sea or success is not a large bank
account<00:02:50.700> instead<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> feeling<00:02:52.870> of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
account instead it is a feeling of

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.170 
account instead it is a feeling of
achievement<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.000> satisfaction<00:02:55.000> with

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
achievement and satisfaction with

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.560 
achievement and satisfaction with
yourself<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:57.100> following<00:02:57.670> these<00:02:57.850> four<00:02:58.300> steps

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
yourself so following these four steps

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.080 
yourself so following these four steps
is<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:59.350> useful<00:02:59.830> way<00:03:00.010> of<00:03:00.040> making<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.820> clear
