later on the season every team has got

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.520 
later on the season every team has got
to<00:05:45.550> find<00:05:45.730> its<00:05:45.880> own<00:05:46.000> path<00:05:46.510> you<00:05:47.140> know<00:05:47.260> and<00:05:47.470> this

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
to find its own path you know and this

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.580 
to find its own path you know and this
team<00:05:47.800> is<00:05:48.640> slowly<00:05:49.420> you<00:05:49.870> know<00:05:49.960> starting<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.470> do

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
team is slowly you know starting to do

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.830 
team is slowly you know starting to do
that<00:05:50.740> now<00:05:50.970> listen<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.060> hope<00:05:52.210> is<00:05:52.390> that<00:05:52.420> this<00:05:52.690> is

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
that now listen the hope is that this is

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.600 
that now listen the hope is that this is
not<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.530> benchmark<00:05:53.950> you<00:05:54.130> know<00:05:54.220> the<00:05:54.340> hope<00:05:54.460> is

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
not the benchmark you know the hope is

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.640 
not the benchmark you know the hope is
that<00:05:54.700> we<00:05:54.880> get<00:05:54.970> better<00:05:55.150> from<00:05:55.330> here

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
that we get better from here

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.320 
that we get better from here
because<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.310> teams<00:05:57.550> either<00:05:57.730> get<00:05:58.060> better<00:05:58.180> or

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
because the teams either get better or

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.120 
because the teams either get better or
worse<00:05:58.630> but<00:05:59.050> they<00:05:59.200> don't<00:05:59.380> stay<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.680> same<00:05:59.710> and

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
worse but they don't stay the same and

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.400 
worse but they don't stay the same and
and<00:06:00.820> so<00:06:01.000> that<00:06:01.360> will<00:06:01.690> be<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.900> challenge<00:06:01.930> now

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
and so that will be the challenge now

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.200 
and so that will be the challenge now
for<00:06:02.440> this<00:06:02.680> group<00:06:02.890> is<00:06:03.100> now<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.730> you<00:06:03.790> play<00:06:03.970> like
