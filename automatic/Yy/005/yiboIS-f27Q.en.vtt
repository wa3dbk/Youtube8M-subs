00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
it so I think that the best thing about

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.940 
it so I think that the best thing about
that<00:06:46.240> first<00:06:47.080> the<00:06:47.260> teaching<00:06:47.710> is<00:06:47.920> very

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
that first the teaching is very

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.580 
that first the teaching is very
differently<00:06:48.610> I<00:06:49.060> think<00:06:49.900> the<00:06:50.020> teachers<00:06:50.410> are<00:06:50.560> a

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
differently I think the teachers are a

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.430 
differently I think the teachers are a
lot<00:06:50.740> more<00:06:50.950> open<00:06:51.340> and<00:06:51.790> close<00:06:52.480> to<00:06:52.690> see<00:06:52.930> students

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
lot more open and close to see students

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.860 
lot more open and close to see students

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150 
practitioners as well as educators there

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.580

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
and drop-in sessions like for my course

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.120 
and drop-in sessions like for my course
I'm<00:07:16.930> not<00:07:17.050> sure<00:07:17.200> about<00:07:17.260> other<00:07:17.440> courses<00:07:17.800> but<00:07:17.860> for

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
I'm not sure about other courses but for

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.190 
I'm not sure about other courses but for
my<00:07:18.220> course<00:07:18.520> so<00:07:18.790> learning<00:07:19.510> is<00:07:19.660> really<00:07:19.960> easy

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.200 
my course so learning is really easy

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.100 
my course so learning is really easy
because<00:07:20.500> there's<00:07:21.310> plenty<00:07:21.550> of<00:07:21.760> support<00:07:22.080> here<00:07:23.080> I

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
because there's plenty of support here I

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.440 
because there's plenty of support here I
think<00:07:23.560> it<00:07:23.800> is<00:07:23.830> more<00:07:24.220> self-directed<00:07:24.910> and

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
think it is more self-directed and

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.230 
think it is more self-directed and
learning<00:07:25.930> as<00:07:26.140> to<00:07:26.770> find<00:07:27.040> out<00:07:27.310> what<00:07:27.790> I<00:07:28.060> am
