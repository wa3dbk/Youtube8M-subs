00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
described it yes now when we have
coconut<00:01:54.060> palm<00:01:54.299> sugar<00:01:54.329> look<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> Green

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
coconut palm sugar look at the Green

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.139 
coconut palm sugar look at the Green
Line<00:01:55.560> instead<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.340> getting<00:01:56.520> those<00:01:56.579> big<00:01:56.820> peaks

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
Line instead of getting those big peaks

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.120 
Line instead of getting those big peaks
and<00:01:57.360> valleys<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> much<00:01:58.530> slower

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and valleys you get a much slower

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.490 
and valleys you get a much slower
undulating<00:01:59.850> curve<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.350> don't

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
undulating curve there and so you don't

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
undulating curve there and so you don't
have<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.040> highs<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.610> lows<00:02:02.820> which<00:02:03.090> means

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
have the highs and the lows which means

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.270 
have the highs and the lows which means
which<00:02:03.899> means<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> ton<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
which means you don't get the ton of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
which means you don't get the ton of
sugar<00:02:05.490> dumped<00:02:05.820> into<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.090> blood<00:02:06.270> followed<00:02:06.930> by

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
sugar dumped into your blood followed by

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.330 
sugar dumped into your blood followed by
the<00:02:07.079> big<00:02:07.290> trader<00:02:07.649> afterwards<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.280> feel

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the big trader afterwards you feel

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
the big trader afterwards you feel
famished<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.479> reason<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.200> low

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
famished the reason for that is this low

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.530 
famished the reason for that is this low
of<00:02:10.590> my<00:02:10.709> glycemic<00:02:11.280> index<00:02:11.610> scale<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.330> know<00:02:12.420> what

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
of my glycemic index scale you know what

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.580 
of my glycemic index scale you know what
have<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.720> ever<00:02:12.810> heard<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
have you ever heard of that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190 
have you ever heard of that
glycemic<00:02:14.250> index<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:15.030> oh<00:02:15.360> yeah<00:02:15.630> good<00:02:15.840> well

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
glycemic index I have oh yeah good well

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.300 
glycemic index I have oh yeah good well
I<00:02:16.230> mean<00:02:16.410> explain<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:16.890> everybody<00:02:17.069> because

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I mean explain it for everybody because

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.710 
I mean explain it for everybody because
it's<00:02:17.459> not<00:02:17.550> always<00:02:17.700> clear<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.390> it

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
it's not always clear what it is it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.750 
it's not always clear what it is it
basically<00:02:19.500> means<00:02:19.740> how<00:02:19.980> quickly<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.459> absorb

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
basically means how quickly you absorb

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.949 
basically means how quickly you absorb
sugar<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> foods<00:02:21.630> into<00:02:21.840> your

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
sugar out of the foods into your

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.930 
sugar out of the foods into your
bloodstream<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.980> lower<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.340> glycemic<00:02:23.490> index

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
bloodstream the lower the glycemic index

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.610 
bloodstream the lower the glycemic index
the<00:02:24.540> more<00:02:24.720> you'll<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.380> little

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the more you'll have that so little

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.199 
the more you'll have that so little
curve<00:02:25.830> like<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.940> has<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.180> same

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
curve like that so it has the same

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.240 
curve like that so it has the same
amount<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.630> calories<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.170> sugar<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.980> provides

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
amount of calories of sugar and provides

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.370 
amount of calories of sugar and provides
a<00:02:29.400> slower<00:02:29.730> release<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.330> energy<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:31.020> curbs

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
a slower release of energy that curbs

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.140 
a slower release of energy that curbs
your<00:02:31.470> appetite<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.459> won't<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> crave

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
your appetite so you won't have to crave

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.880 
your appetite so you won't have to crave
food<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.540> much<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.050> won't<00:02:34.260> put<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
food so much so you won't put on the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.449 
food so much so you won't put on the
weight<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.130> quickly

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
weight so quickly

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.070 
weight so quickly
okay<00:02:35.880> that's<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.330> I<00:02:36.360> love<00:02:36.510> about<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.870> now

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
different forms of issues one of the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.250 
different forms of issues one of the
biggest<00:02:44.580> advantages<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.420> use<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.959> just

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
biggest advantages is you use it just

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.199 
biggest advantages is you use it just
like<00:02:46.500> sugar<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:47.130> measure<00:02:47.400> out<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.670> same<00:02:48.000> way

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
like sugar you measure out the same way

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.150 
like sugar you measure out the same way
so<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.810> swap<00:02:49.410> out<00:02:49.530> recipes<00:02:50.040> without

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
I was expecting something that's tested

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.949 
I was expecting something that's tested
more<00:02:58.800> chemically<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.850> at<00:03:00.000> all<00:03:00.120> no<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.630> doesn't

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
more chemically not at all no it doesn't

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.470 
more chemically not at all no it doesn't
taste<00:03:01.080> chemically<00:03:01.709> okay<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.150> proof<00:03:03.330> is

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
taste chemically okay now the proof is

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.729 
taste chemically okay now the proof is
always<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.900> pudding<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.200> I've<00:03:04.319> challenged
