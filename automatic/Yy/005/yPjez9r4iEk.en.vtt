can see how small it is then you can
just<00:02:36.140> fold<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.560> up<00:02:38.830> sit<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:39.950> right<00:02:39.980> there<00:02:40.370> and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
just fold it up sit it right there and

there you go you have a stand it has

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.310 
there you go you have a stand it has
kind<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.240> rubbery<00:02:44.690> feel<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.230> the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
kind of like a rubbery feel on the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.170 
kind of like a rubbery feel on the
bottom<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.130> not<00:02:46.310> gonna<00:02:46.550> slide<00:02:46.790> across

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
bottom so it's not gonna slide across

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.300 
bottom so it's not gonna slide across
the<00:02:47.480> table<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:48.020> also<00:02:48.140> has<00:02:48.410> rubber<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.920> these

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
super light as well as extremely thin I

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.420 
super light as well as extremely thin I
know<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.360> Apple<00:04:11.570> has<00:04:12.020> one<00:04:12.650> where<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.220> has<00:04:13.400> a

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
know that Apple has one where it has a

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.090 
know that Apple has one where it has a
dock<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:14.210> you<00:04:14.360> can<00:04:14.540> also<00:04:14.720> set<00:04:15.200> up<00:04:15.350> your<00:04:15.890> iPad

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
dock that you can also set up your iPad

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.580 
dock that you can also set up your iPad
to<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:16.700> dock<00:04:16.880> however<00:04:17.450> that<00:04:18.020> one<00:04:18.170> was<00:04:18.350> more

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
to the dock however that one was more

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.979 
to the dock however that one was more
heavy<00:04:18.890> it's<00:04:19.580> harder<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.330> carry<00:04:20.480> that<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.840> went

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
heavy it's harder to carry that and went

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.780 
heavy it's harder to carry that and went
around<00:04:21.080> because<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:22.010> little<00:04:22.160> dock<00:04:22.400> doesn't

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
around because the little dock doesn't

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.450 
around because the little dock doesn't
come<00:04:22.940> off<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.930> I<00:04:23.990> like<00:04:24.170> this<00:04:24.320> one<00:04:24.470> better<00:04:24.680> well

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
come off so I like this one better well

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.160 
come off so I like this one better well
it<00:04:25.550> doesn't<00:04:25.820> have<00:04:25.970> all<00:04:26.270> of<00:04:26.360> these<00:04:26.750> keys

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
it doesn't have all of these keys

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.500 
it doesn't have all of these keys
functioning<00:04:27.920> especially<00:04:28.490> for<00:04:28.730> the<00:04:28.850> iPad<00:04:29.270> I

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
functioning especially for the iPad I

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.380 
functioning especially for the iPad I
find<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:31.130> not<00:04:31.280> really<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.670> problem

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
find that it's not really a problem

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.600 
find that it's not really a problem
and<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.840> can<00:04:32.990> work<00:04:33.140> with<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.530> just<00:04:33.980> fine<00:04:34.310> without

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
and I can work with it just fine without

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.080 
and I can work with it just fine without
those<00:04:35.000> keys<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:39.680> with<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:39.980> arcon<00:04:40.430> portable

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
those keys so with the arcon portable

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.350 
those keys so with the arcon portable

well as the regular keyboard I can

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.159 
well as the regular keyboard I can
actually<00:05:22.340> type<00:05:22.699> pretty<00:05:23.330> fast<00:05:23.660> and<00:05:23.960> I'll<00:05:24.050> try

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
actually type pretty fast and I'll try

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.390 
actually type pretty fast and I'll try
to<00:05:24.199> demonstrate<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.979> might<00:05:25.099> be<00:05:25.190> kind<00:05:25.370> of

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
to demonstrate it might be kind of

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.689 
to demonstrate it might be kind of
awkward<00:05:25.580> with<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.060> way<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.240> camera<00:05:26.539> is<00:05:27.669> hello

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
awkward with the way the camera is hello

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
I can type fairly quickly the actual

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.939 
I can type fairly quickly the actual
screen<00:05:38.530> okay<00:05:39.530> right<00:05:39.830> so<00:05:40.190> there<00:05:40.370> you<00:05:40.430> go<00:05:40.580> so

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
screen okay right so there you go so

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.469 
screen okay right so there you go so
sometimes<00:05:42.949> I<00:05:43.190> just<00:05:43.250> take<00:05:43.550> it<00:05:43.580> out<00:05:43.789> working<00:05:44.360> out

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
sometimes I just take it out working out

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.390 
sometimes I just take it out working out
like<00:05:44.630> that<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:45.080> can<00:05:45.320> write<00:05:45.500> maybe<00:05:45.710> a<00:05:46.039> few

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
like that I can write maybe a few

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.830 
like that I can write maybe a few
paragraphs<00:05:46.729> like<00:05:47.120> that<00:05:47.330> but<00:05:47.509> if<00:05:47.599> I'm<00:05:47.690> gonna

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
paragraphs like that but if I'm gonna

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.740 
paragraphs like that but if I'm gonna
you<00:05:48.590> know<00:05:48.710> write<00:05:49.340> out<00:05:49.460> an<00:05:49.580> entire<00:05:49.940> paper<00:05:50.300> I
