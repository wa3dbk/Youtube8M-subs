today<00:00:33.900> we're<00:00:34.260> back<00:00:34.470> on<00:00:34.739> bad<00:00:35.100> company<00:00:35.640> -<00:00:35.880> I

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
today we're back on bad company - I

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.940 
today we're back on bad company - I
thought<00:00:36.270> we'd<00:00:36.480> start<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.320> company<00:00:37.620> -

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
thought we'd start with that company -

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.080 
thought we'd start with that company -
today<00:00:38.220> because<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.880> looking

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
today because we're going to be looking

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.960 
today because we're going to be looking
at<00:00:39.239> three<00:00:39.600> battlefield<00:00:40.080> games<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.530> particular

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
at three battlefield games in particular

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.310 
at three battlefield games in particular
because<00:00:41.970> they<00:00:42.090> all<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.570> relevance<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
because they all have relevance to the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.140 
because they all have relevance to the
title<00:00:43.650> of<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.860> video<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
title of this video and that's the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.790 
title of this video and that's the
veteran<00:00:45.629> weapons<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.440> been<00:00:46.559> included

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
veteran weapons that have been included

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.270 
veteran weapons that have been included
in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.699> last<00:00:47.940> three<00:00:48.270> battlefield<00:00:48.840> games<00:00:49.280> so

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
in the last three battlefield games so

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.030 
in the last three battlefield games so
as<00:00:50.580> I<00:00:50.640> said<00:00:50.940> let's<00:00:51.360> start<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:52.020> bad<00:00:52.260> company<00:00:52.530> 2

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
as I said let's start with bad company 2

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.390 
as I said let's start with bad company 2
now<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.900> game<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.830> access<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
now with this game you get access to

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.090 
now with this game you get access to
essentially<00:00:57.239> three<00:00:57.900> different<00:00:58.140> veteran

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
essentially three different veteran

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.060 
essentially three different veteran
weapons<00:00:59.580> to<00:01:00.510> start<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.019> if<00:01:01.260> you're<00:01:01.559> actually

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
weapons to start with if you're actually

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.829 
weapons to start with if you're actually
a<00:01:02.220> battlefield<00:01:02.610> veteran<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.360> that<00:01:03.449> requires

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
a battlefield veteran and that requires

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.750 
a battlefield veteran and that requires
you<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.290> played<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.620> least<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.890> previous

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
you to have played at least one previous

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240 
you to have played at least one previous
battlefield<00:01:06.360> title<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.650> got<00:01:07.799> access<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
battlefield title then you got access to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.190 
battlefield title then you got access to
the<00:01:08.549> m1<00:01:08.729> garand<00:01:09.120> and<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.870> could<00:01:10.049> download

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the m1 garand and you could download

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.110 
the m1 garand and you could download
that<00:01:10.620> and<00:01:10.860> essentially<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.610> semi-auto

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
that and essentially it's a semi-auto

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.480 
that and essentially it's a semi-auto
rifle<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.350> could<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.830> any<00:01:14.100> class

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
rifle that you could use with any class

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.610 
rifle that you could use with any class
that<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.790> wanted<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> couldn't<00:01:16.380> have

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
that you wanted to but you couldn't have

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.930 
that you wanted to but you couldn't have
any<00:01:16.920> attachments<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.760> so<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> just

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
any attachments on it so you just

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.149 
any attachments on it so you just
basically<00:01:18.180> had<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.750> use<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> thing<00:01:19.200> naked<00:01:19.619> now

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
basically had to use the thing naked now

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
basically had to use the thing naked now
I'm<00:01:20.220> using<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> gameplay<00:01:21.210> behind<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
I'm using it in the gameplay behind and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530 
I'm using it in the gameplay behind and
it<00:01:22.260> absolutely<00:01:22.440> rocks<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.940> get<00:01:24.090> two<00:01:24.270> shots

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it absolutely rocks if you get two shots

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
it absolutely rocks if you get two shots
to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.780> chest<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.409> sort<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> medium<00:01:26.100> range

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to the chest at sort of medium range

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.830 
to the chest at sort of medium range
you're<00:01:26.549> looking<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:26.909> probably<00:01:27.420> killing<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you're looking at probably killing the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.750 
you're looking at probably killing the
player<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:28.860> long<00:01:29.040> ranges<00:01:29.460> starting

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
player and then at long ranges starting

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.100 
player and then at long ranges starting
to<00:01:29.820> look<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.030> three<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.390> four<00:01:30.570> shots<00:01:30.810> but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
to look at three and four shots but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
to look at three and four shots but
ultimately<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.700> cool<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> play

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
ultimately it was really cool to play

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
ultimately it was really cool to play
with<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.450> weapon<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.469> felt

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
with this weapon and you actually felt

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
with this weapon and you actually felt
like<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> veteran<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.700> something<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.180> other

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
like a veteran it's something that other

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.440 
like a veteran it's something that other
people<00:01:36.750> didn't<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.850> also<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.030> Bad<00:01:39.210> Company

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
people didn't have also with Bad Company

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020 
people didn't have also with Bad Company
2<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.140> had<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> option<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.070> gain<00:01:41.460> access<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
2 you had the option to gain access to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.830 
2 you had the option to gain access to
the<00:01:42.329> m1a1<00:01:42.899> Thompson<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.429> 1911<00:01:44.969> pistol

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the m1a1 Thompson and the 1911 pistol

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
the m1a1 Thompson and the 1911 pistol
which<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.229> sort<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.469> commonplace<00:01:46.799> within<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
which is sort of commonplace within the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
which is sort of commonplace within the
Battlefield<00:01:47.969> series<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.590> liked

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
Battlefield series now I really liked

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.349 
Battlefield series now I really liked
the<00:01:50.039> Thompson<00:01:50.460> machine<00:01:50.549> gun<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.179> was

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
the Thompson machine gun when I was

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.870 
the Thompson machine gun when I was
playing<00:01:51.539> this<00:01:51.750> game<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.380> ps3<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.759> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
playing this game on my ps3 I think I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
playing this game on my ps3 I think I
spent<00:01:54.149> roughly<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.570> hundred<00:01:54.869> hours<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.679> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
spent roughly a hundred hours with this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
spent roughly a hundred hours with this
weapon<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.340> considering<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.789> played<00:01:57.030> 1200

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
weapon and considering I played 1200

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.719 
weapon and considering I played 1200
hours<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.079> total<00:01:58.259> that's<00:01:59.070> an<00:01:59.219> extreme<00:01:59.579> amount

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
hours in total that's an extreme amount

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.310 
hours in total that's an extreme amount
of<00:01:59.880> time<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> dedicate<00:02:00.570> yourself<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.170> one

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of time to dedicate yourself to just one

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.919 
of time to dedicate yourself to just one
weapon<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.249> really<00:02:02.969> enjoyed<00:02:03.299> using<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.869> was

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
weapon I really enjoyed using it it was

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.419 
weapon I really enjoyed using it it was
really<00:02:04.170> good<00:02:04.259> at<00:02:04.350> close<00:02:04.530> range<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> had<00:02:05.039> really

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
really good at close range it had really

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.330 
really good at close range it had really
good<00:02:05.549> hipfire<00:02:06.030> accuracy<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.469> 1911<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
good hipfire accuracy and the 1911 you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.370 
good hipfire accuracy and the 1911 you
can<00:02:08.460> actually<00:02:08.610> acquire<00:02:08.940> in-game<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
can actually acquire in-game if you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.809 
can actually acquire in-game if you

three<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:50.450> didn't<00:02:50.720> get<00:02:50.900> quite<00:02:51.200> such<00:02:51.710> good

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
three we didn't get quite such good

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.830 
three we didn't get quite such good
treatment<00:02:52.550> we<00:02:52.850> did<00:02:53.060> still<00:02:53.330> get<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.540> weapon

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
treatment we did still get a weapon

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.230 
treatment we did still get a weapon
which<00:02:54.410> was<00:02:54.620> really<00:02:54.830> good<00:02:55.160> we<00:02:55.640> got<00:02:55.790> access<00:02:56.000> to

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
which was really good we got access to

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.770 
which was really good we got access to
the<00:02:56.540> 1911<00:02:56.990> pistol<00:02:57.820> although<00:02:58.820> in<00:02:59.120> battlefield

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
the 1911 pistol although in battlefield

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.380 
the 1911 pistol although in battlefield
3<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.320> feel<00:03:00.800> at<00:03:00.980> least<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.670> thing<00:03:01.910> took<00:03:02.180> a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
3 I feel at least the thing took a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.750 
3 I feel at least the thing took a
massive<00:03:02.810> downgrade<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.710> terms<00:03:03.920> of<00:03:04.130> status<00:03:04.550> in

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
massive downgrade in terms of status in

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.060 
massive downgrade in terms of status in
bad<00:03:05.300> company<00:03:05.510> -<00:03:05.900> I'll<00:03:06.140> flash<00:03:06.410> up<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.650> shot<00:03:06.860> right

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
bad company - I'll flash up a shot right

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.140 
bad company - I'll flash up a shot right
now<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.970> 1911<00:03:08.480> looks<00:03:09.440> absolutely<00:03:09.920> badass<00:03:10.850> and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
now the 1911 looks absolutely badass and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.449 
now the 1911 looks absolutely badass and
that's<00:03:11.480> because<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.050> literally<00:03:12.350> is<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.890> replica

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
that's because it literally is a replica

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.270 
that's because it literally is a replica
of<00:03:13.490> the<00:03:13.900> 1911<00:03:14.900> when<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.530> first<00:03:15.770> went<00:03:15.980> into

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
of the 1911 when it first went into

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.880 
of the 1911 when it first went into
production<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:17.420> 1911<00:03:17.959> that's<00:03:18.350> included<00:03:18.800> in

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
production the 1911 that's included in

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.979 
production the 1911 that's included in
battlefield<00:03:19.400> 3<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.970> modernized<00:03:20.840> version

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
battlefield 3 is a modernized version

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.890 
battlefield 3 is a modernized version
and<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.739> doesn't<00:03:22.070> have<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.610> wooden<00:03:22.940> handle<00:03:23.810> on

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
and it doesn't have the wooden handle on

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.000 
and it doesn't have the wooden handle on
the<00:03:23.989> side<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.500> forgive<00:03:24.709> me<00:03:24.770> I'm

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
the side you have to forgive me I'm

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.740 
the side you have to forgive me I'm
really<00:03:25.489> not<00:03:25.610> good<00:03:25.850> with<00:03:25.880> what<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.330> names<00:03:26.570> of

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
really not good with what the names of

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.470 
really not good with what the names of
things<00:03:26.989> on<00:03:27.200> weapons<00:03:27.590> are<00:03:27.770> but<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.580> 1911<00:03:29.360> in

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
things on weapons are but the 1911 in

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.660 
things on weapons are but the 1911 in
Bad<00:03:29.630> Company<00:03:29.900> 2<00:03:30.080> was<00:03:30.440> far<00:03:30.739> better<00:03:30.980> than<00:03:31.190> the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
Bad Company 2 was far better than the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.020 
Bad Company 2 was far better than the
1911<00:03:32.150> in<00:03:32.480> battlefield<00:03:32.870> 3<00:03:32.900> in<00:03:33.170> terms<00:03:33.380> of<00:03:33.530> status

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
1911 in battlefield 3 in terms of status

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.430 
1911 in battlefield 3 in terms of status
essentially<00:03:35.030> they<00:03:35.390> were<00:03:35.420> exactly<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.140> same

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
essentially they were exactly the same

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.020 
essentially they were exactly the same
weapon<00:03:36.800> because<00:03:37.070> they<00:03:37.160> did<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.400> same<00:03:37.610> damage

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
weapon because they did the same damage

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.760 
weapon because they did the same damage
and<00:03:38.239> ultimately<00:03:38.780> performed<00:03:39.200> exactly<00:03:39.350> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
and ultimately performed exactly the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.550 
and ultimately performed exactly the
same<00:03:40.040> but<00:03:40.700> for<00:03:40.910> me<00:03:41.030> in<00:03:41.270> Bad<00:03:41.840> Company<00:03:42.080> 2<00:03:42.230> that

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
same but for me in Bad Company 2 that

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.320 
same but for me in Bad Company 2 that
weapon<00:03:42.890> was<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.310> much<00:03:43.520> better<00:03:43.700> than<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:44.000> was<00:03:44.180> in

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
weapon was so much better than it was in

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.690 
weapon was so much better than it was in
battlefield<00:03:44.750> 3<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.739> as<00:03:45.860> I<00:03:46.010> said<00:03:46.070> in<00:03:46.340> terms<00:03:46.519> of

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
battlefield 3 and as I said in terms of

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.699 
battlefield 3 and as I said in terms of
status<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.330> didn't<00:03:47.780> really<00:03:48.110> feel<00:03:48.350> all<00:03:48.650> that

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
status I didn't really feel all that

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.830 
status I didn't really feel all that
proud<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.580> be<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.760> veteran<00:03:50.000> player<00:03:50.360> when<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
weapon could have just been any other

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.449 
weapon could have just been any other
handgun<00:03:53.510> in<00:03:53.720> battlefield<00:03:54.320> 3<00:03:54.380> I<00:03:54.739> mean<00:03:54.799> really

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
handgun in battlefield 3 I mean really

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.430 
handgun in battlefield 3 I mean really
it<00:03:55.760> doesn't<00:03:56.120> look<00:03:56.299> all<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.720> different<00:03:56.780> -<00:03:57.290> in

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
it doesn't look all that different - in

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.060 
it doesn't look all that different - in
-<00:03:57.980> an<00:03:58.070> m9<00:03:58.430> pistol<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.030> mp443<00:03:59.690> and<00:04:00.230> ultimately

I<00:04:01.160> didn't<00:04:01.580> think<00:04:01.850> that<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.510> really<00:04:03.140> stood<00:04:03.380> out

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
I didn't think that I really stood out

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.930 
I didn't think that I really stood out
from<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.769> crowd<00:04:04.010> with<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.400> weapon<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.850> was

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
from the crowd with this weapon it was

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.460 
from the crowd with this weapon it was
just<00:04:05.120> like<00:04:05.269> any<00:04:05.480> other<00:04:05.660> weapon<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.200> had<00:04:06.350> the

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
just like any other weapon and I had the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.110 
just like any other weapon and I had the
option<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.860> choose<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:07.519> I<00:04:07.670> wanted<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.940> play

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
option to choose it if I wanted to play

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.020 
option to choose it if I wanted to play
with<00:04:08.299> it<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:08.799> if<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:09.950> thought<00:04:10.190> battlefield<00:04:10.760> 3

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
with it and if you thought battlefield 3

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.880 
with it and if you thought battlefield 3
was<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.239> letdown<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:12.170> did<00:04:12.410> then

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
was a letdown like I did then

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.490 
was a letdown like I did then
battlefield<00:04:13.459> 4<00:04:13.700> is<00:04:13.910> pretty<00:04:14.299> much<00:04:14.510> rock<00:04:14.930> bottom

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500

the battlefield 4 veteran system is a

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.740 
the battlefield 4 veteran system is a
battle<00:04:19.040> pack<00:04:19.250> which<00:04:19.580> is<00:04:19.790> sort<00:04:20.209> of<00:04:20.239> like<00:04:20.479> the

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
battle pack which is sort of like the

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.080 
battle pack which is sort of like the
appreciation<00:04:21.620> system<00:04:22.280> that<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.520> developers

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
appreciation system that the developers

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.390 
appreciation system that the developers
thought<00:04:23.330> was<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.540> good<00:04:23.720> idea<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:24.110> battle<00:04:24.620> 4<00:04:24.860> in

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
thought was a good idea for battle 4 in

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.490 
thought was a good idea for battle 4 in
all<00:04:25.880> lessons<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.360> wasn't<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:26.780> amazing<00:04:27.350> but

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
all lessons it wasn't that amazing but

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.020 
all lessons it wasn't that amazing but
it<00:04:27.590> was<00:04:27.710> still<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.220> was<00:04:28.340> still<00:04:28.490> quite<00:04:28.640> good<00:04:28.760> it

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
it was still it was still quite good it

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.130 
it was still it was still quite good it
was<00:04:29.150> something<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.419> little<00:04:29.660> bit<00:04:29.780> different

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
was something a little bit different

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.110 
was something a little bit different
than<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.320> previous<00:04:30.500> two<00:04:30.919> games<00:04:30.950> but<00:04:31.490> but<00:04:32.000> in

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
than the previous two games but but in

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.360 
than the previous two games but but in
this<00:04:32.270> veteran<00:04:32.870> battle<00:04:33.320> pack<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.860> got<00:04:34.130> a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
this veteran battle pack you got a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.300 
this veteran battle pack you got a
splinter<00:04:35.120> soldier<00:04:35.840> camouflage<00:04:36.380> now<00:04:37.100> if

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
splinter soldier camouflage now if

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.130 
splinter soldier camouflage now if
you've<00:04:37.460> had<00:04:37.760> many<00:04:38.090> of<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.390> camouflages<00:04:39.020> in

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
you've had many of the camouflages in

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.600 
you've had many of the camouflages in
battlefield<00:04:39.560> 4<00:04:39.590> you'll<00:04:39.890> know<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.220> most<00:04:40.490> of

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
battlefield 4 you'll know that most of

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.460 
battlefield 4 you'll know that most of
them<00:04:40.760> don't<00:04:40.940> actually<00:04:41.450> look<00:04:41.660> that<00:04:41.930> different

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
them don't actually look that different

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.320 
them don't actually look that different
from<00:04:42.560> each<00:04:42.740> other<00:04:42.979> so<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.550> was<00:04:43.669> very<00:04:43.820> difficult

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
from each other so it was very difficult

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.150 
from each other so it was very difficult
to<00:04:44.419> tell<00:04:44.630> who<00:04:45.200> would<00:04:45.440> be<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.620> veteran<00:04:46.010> or<00:04:46.130> not

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
to tell who would be a veteran or not

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.010 
to tell who would be a veteran or not
because<00:04:46.729> all<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.240> camos<00:04:47.540> sort<00:04:47.780> of<00:04:47.870> look

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
because all of the camos sort of look

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.650 
because all of the camos sort of look
the<00:04:48.110> same<00:04:48.190> you've<00:04:49.190> got<00:04:49.370> access<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:49.970> veteran

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
the same you've got access to a veteran

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.399

franchise dog tag the a cb90 knife which

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:56.259 
franchise dog tag the a cb90 knife which
I<00:04:54.499> guess<00:04:54.889> it's<00:04:55.069> quite<00:04:55.279> cool<00:04:55.550> but<00:04:55.819> at<00:04:55.969> the<00:04:56.089> same

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:56.269 
I guess it's quite cool but at the same

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:57.969 
I guess it's quite cool but at the same
time<00:04:56.509> you<00:04:56.719> can<00:04:56.899> actually<00:04:57.199> unlock<00:04:57.349> it<00:04:57.649> in<00:04:57.769> game

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
time you can actually unlock it in game

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:08.179 
a little bit more for being a veteran

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:10.659 
a little bit more for being a veteran
but<00:05:08.569> that's<00:05:09.349> a<00:05:09.589> three<00:05:09.860> time<00:05:10.069> scope<00:05:10.429> for<00:05:10.610> the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
and that was given to us because the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.059 
and that was given to us because the
game<00:05:14.509> wasn't<00:05:14.899> in<00:05:15.019> a<00:05:15.080> very<00:05:15.110> good<00:05:15.529> State<00:05:15.830> and

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
in order to make us a little bit more

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.149 
in order to make us a little bit more

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:26.179 
disappointed in the veteran system for

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:28.600 
disappointed in the veteran system for
Battlefield<00:05:26.599> 4<00:05:26.809> I<00:05:27.019> mean<00:05:27.589> how<00:05:28.129> can<00:05:28.189> it<00:05:28.489> have

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
Battlefield 4 I mean how can it have

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.999 
Battlefield 4 I mean how can it have
been<00:05:28.789> only<00:05:28.969> four<00:05:29.119> years<00:05:29.689> and<00:05:30.319> we<00:05:30.559> have<00:05:30.709> three

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009

in<00:05:33.800> battlefield<00:05:34.069> 3<00:05:34.249> and<00:05:34.610> then<00:05:35.059> pretty<00:05:35.479> much<00:05:35.569> an

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:35.929 
in battlefield 3 and then pretty much an

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:38.469 
in battlefield 3 and then pretty much an
afterthought<00:05:36.649> in<00:05:36.860> battlefield<00:05:37.639> 4<00:05:37.699> I<00:05:38.179> don't

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
afterthought in battlefield 4 I don't

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.029 
afterthought in battlefield 4 I don't
really<00:05:38.809> quite<00:05:39.110> get<00:05:39.409> what<00:05:39.589> was<00:05:39.769> going<00:05:39.979> through

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
really quite get what was going through

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.469 
really quite get what was going through
the<00:05:40.249> developers<00:05:40.729> Minds<00:05:40.939> when<00:05:41.179> they<00:05:41.269> thought

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
the developers Minds when they thought

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.359 
the developers Minds when they thought
oh<00:05:41.719> we<00:05:42.499> need<00:05:42.649> to<00:05:42.769> give<00:05:42.889> something<00:05:43.099> to<00:05:43.219> the

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:43.369 
oh we need to give something to the

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:44.559 
oh we need to give something to the
veterans<00:05:43.759> I<00:05:43.969> know

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
veterans I know

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.239 
veterans I know
we'll<00:05:44.809> give<00:05:44.959> them<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.199> scope<00:05:45.529> for<00:05:45.829> a<00:05:45.860> pistol

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:46.249 
we'll give them a scope for a pistol

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.499 
we'll give them a scope for a pistol
that<00:05:46.339> anyone<00:05:46.759> else<00:05:46.939> can<00:05:47.179> use<00:05:47.360> in<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.929> game<00:05:48.249> hmm

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
that anyone else can use in the game hmm

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.239 
that anyone else can use in the game hmm
so<00:05:50.509> it's<00:05:50.659> safe<00:05:50.869> to<00:05:50.899> say<00:05:51.079> that<00:05:51.259> being<00:05:51.709> a<00:05:51.860> veteran

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:52.249 
so it's safe to say that being a veteran

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:53.469 
so it's safe to say that being a veteran
in<00:05:52.339> the<00:05:52.429> battlefield<00:05:52.849> series<00:05:53.209> right<00:05:53.449> now

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
in the battlefield series right now

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.979 
in the battlefield series right now
isn't<00:05:54.169> really<00:05:54.529> worth<00:05:54.739> being<00:05:55.539> you<00:05:56.539> basically

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:56.989 
isn't really worth being you basically

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.959 
isn't really worth being you basically
get<00:05:57.259> nothing<00:05:57.709> in<00:05:57.889> battlefield<00:05:58.369> 4<00:05:58.429> for<00:05:58.699> being<00:05:58.879> a

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
get nothing in battlefield 4 for being a

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:00.429 
get nothing in battlefield 4 for being a
veteran<00:05:59.300> as<00:05:59.389> far<00:05:59.539> as<00:05:59.659> I'm<00:05:59.809> concerned<00:06:00.229> you

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:00.439 
veteran as far as I'm concerned you

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:01.839 
veteran as far as I'm concerned you
don't<00:06:00.559> get<00:06:00.740> anything<00:06:01.039> that's<00:06:01.309> really<00:06:01.579> worth

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
don't get anything that's really worth

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:02.799 
don't get anything that's really worth
writing<00:06:02.179> home<00:06:02.300> about

00:06:02.799 --> 00:06:02.809 
writing home about

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:05.709 
writing home about
so<00:06:03.529> my<00:06:03.649> point<00:06:03.889> of<00:06:04.009> this<00:06:04.189> video<00:06:04.490> is<00:06:04.729> what<00:06:04.939> would

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
so my point of this video is what would

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:08.079 
so my point of this video is what would
you<00:06:05.869> like<00:06:06.139> to<00:06:06.349> see<00:06:06.589> as<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.860> veteran<00:06:07.550> weapon<00:06:07.909> in

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:08.089 
you like to see as the veteran weapon in

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:09.959 
you like to see as the veteran weapon in
the<00:06:08.209> upcoming<00:06:08.749> game<00:06:09.169> battlefield<00:06:09.889> hardline

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:09.969 
the upcoming game battlefield hardline

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.519 
the upcoming game battlefield hardline
now<00:06:10.969> obviously<00:06:11.449> it's<00:06:11.809> a<00:06:12.019> completely

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
now obviously it's a completely

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.230 
now obviously it's a completely
different<00:06:12.800> setting<00:06:13.429> so<00:06:13.729> it<00:06:13.879> probably

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
different setting so it probably

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.759 
different setting so it probably
wouldn't<00:06:14.539> be<00:06:14.659> very<00:06:14.839> relevant<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.499> give<00:06:15.649> us

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:15.769 
wouldn't be very relevant to give us

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:18.100 
wouldn't be very relevant to give us
some<00:06:15.949> World<00:06:16.189> War<00:06:16.279> styled<00:06:16.849> weapons<00:06:17.209> but<00:06:17.869> do<00:06:17.990> you

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
some World War styled weapons but do you

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.569 
some World War styled weapons but do you
think<00:06:18.139> that<00:06:18.529> being<00:06:18.709> a<00:06:18.860> veteran<00:06:19.249> should<00:06:19.429> give

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:19.579 
think that being a veteran should give

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.819 
think that being a veteran should give
us<00:06:19.699> access<00:06:19.909> to<00:06:20.119> I<00:06:20.509> don't<00:06:20.779> know<00:06:20.839> maybe<00:06:21.469> an

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:21.829 
us access to I don't know maybe an

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:24.069 
us access to I don't know maybe an
exclusive<00:06:22.579> weapon<00:06:23.029> for<00:06:23.269> each<00:06:23.419> faction<00:06:23.809> of<00:06:24.019> the

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:24.079 
exclusive weapon for each faction of the

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:26.109 
exclusive weapon for each faction of the
game<00:06:24.349> so<00:06:24.949> maybe<00:06:25.159> we<00:06:25.339> could<00:06:25.489> see<00:06:25.639> it<00:06:25.819> like<00:06:25.969> an

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:26.119 
game so maybe we could see it like an

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.939 
game so maybe we could see it like an
exclusive<00:06:26.629> police<00:06:26.929> weapon<00:06:27.379> and<00:06:27.589> then<00:06:27.800> an

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
exclusive police weapon and then an

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.949 
exclusive police weapon and then an
exclusive<00:06:28.519> robbers<00:06:29.029> weapon<00:06:29.389> would<00:06:29.599> that<00:06:29.779> work

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:29.959 
exclusive robbers weapon would that work

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:32.319 
exclusive robbers weapon would that work
quite<00:06:30.169> well<00:06:30.289> I<00:06:30.679> think<00:06:31.309> that<00:06:31.579> would<00:06:31.729> be<00:06:31.759> quite

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:32.329 
quite well I think that would be quite

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:34.059 
quite well I think that would be quite
cool<00:06:32.509> or<00:06:32.809> if<00:06:33.110> we<00:06:33.229> were<00:06:33.349> actually<00:06:33.499> given<00:06:33.919> a

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
cool or if we were actually given a

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.939 
cool or if we were actually given a
really<00:06:34.249> cool<00:06:34.550> camo<00:06:34.879> to<00:06:35.149> use<00:06:35.419> a<00:06:35.749> weapon<00:06:36.469> skin

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:36.949 
really cool camo to use a weapon skin

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.769 
really cool camo to use a weapon skin
that<00:06:37.129> was<00:06:37.249> ultimately<00:06:37.639> completely<00:06:38.209> different

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:38.779 
that was ultimately completely different

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:39.999 
that was ultimately completely different
to<00:06:38.869> anyone<00:06:39.229> else<00:06:39.409> and<00:06:39.529> that<00:06:39.649> would<00:06:39.800> actually

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
to anyone else and that would actually

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.999 
to anyone else and that would actually
stand<00:06:40.639> out<00:06:40.969> in<00:06:41.239> game<00:06:41.539> maybe<00:06:42.349> access<00:06:42.829> to<00:06:42.979> I

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
stand out in game maybe access to I

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:44.679 
stand out in game maybe access to I
don't<00:06:43.159> know<00:06:43.309> paint<00:06:43.789> for<00:06:44.059> your<00:06:44.149> grenades<00:06:44.539> you

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 
don't know paint for your grenades you

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:45.879 
don't know paint for your grenades you
make<00:06:44.869> it<00:06:44.959> look<00:06:45.050> like<00:06:45.139> a<00:06:45.199> poker<00:06:45.469> ball<00:06:45.739> or

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:45.889 
make it look like a poker ball or

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:47.290 
make it look like a poker ball or
something<00:06:46.009> when<00:06:46.189> you<00:06:46.309> throw<00:06:46.550> it<00:06:46.729> I<00:06:46.849> don't<00:06:47.209> know

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
something when you throw it I don't know

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.719 
something when you throw it I don't know
I<00:06:47.329> mean<00:06:47.719> what<00:06:48.139> do<00:06:48.289> you<00:06:48.319> guys<00:06:48.649> think<00:06:48.709> I<00:06:49.249> just

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:49.729 
I mean what do you guys think I just

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:51.339 
I mean what do you guys think I just
think<00:06:49.909> they<00:06:49.999> really<00:06:50.419> need<00:06:50.599> to<00:06:50.659> focus<00:06:51.199> on

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
think they really need to focus on

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:52.659 
think they really need to focus on
something<00:06:51.589> that<00:06:51.919> will<00:06:52.039> make<00:06:52.069> sure<00:06:52.489> that

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
something that will make sure that

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.359 
something that will make sure that
veterans<00:06:52.819> are<00:06:53.360> at<00:06:53.539> least<00:06:53.689> satisfied<00:06:54.439> having

veterans are at least satisfied having

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:56.769 
veterans are at least satisfied having
