on my lights really quickly or just a

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.040 
on my lights really quickly or just a
little<00:01:49.970> bit<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.210> can<00:01:50.330> see<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.660> red

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
little bit you can see the red

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.660 
little bit you can see the red
illumination<00:01:51.619> they're<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.860> little<00:01:52.070> bit<00:01:52.220> less

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
illumination they're a little bit less

through some of the features so like I

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.060 
through some of the features so like I
said<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.960> totally<00:02:03.530> blanked<00:02:03.770> out<00:02:03.800> last<00:02:03.979> night

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
said I totally blanked out last night

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.740 
said I totally blanked out last night
this<00:02:04.340> button<00:02:04.610> on<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.820> very<00:02:05.119> right<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
this button on the very right is the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.990 
this button on the very right is the
brightness<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.619> have<00:02:07.250> my<00:02:07.399> brightness<00:02:07.640> on

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
brightness I have my brightness on

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.270 
brightness I have my brightness on
automatic<00:02:08.750> which<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.110> recommend<00:02:09.380> your<00:02:10.130> so

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
automatic which I recommend your so

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.509 
automatic which I recommend your so
adjust<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.970> day<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.360> everything<00:02:11.660> but<00:02:12.440> um<00:02:12.709> you

guys can have it however you want so um
like<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.330> said<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> mode<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.200> toggle

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
like I said this is the mode to toggle

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.900 
like I said this is the mode to toggle
through<00:02:18.769> your<00:02:19.070> settings<00:02:19.430> oh<00:02:20.320> no<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:22.010> wish<00:02:22.730> only

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
through your settings oh no I wish only

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.940 
through your settings oh no I wish only
use<00:02:23.150> highway<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.870> auto<00:02:24.049> highway<00:02:24.890> is

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
use highway and auto highway is

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.150 
use highway and auto highway is
obviously<00:02:25.519> for<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.760> freeway<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:27.040> from<00:02:28.040> my

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
obviously for the freeway and from my

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.190 
obviously for the freeway and from my
understanding<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.970> opens<00:02:29.480> up<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.959> range

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
understanding it it opens up the range

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.860 
understanding it it opens up the range
of<00:02:30.440> frequencies<00:02:31.100> like<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.090> distance<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.690> it

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
of frequencies like the distance that it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.060 
of frequencies like the distance that it
will<00:02:33.459> detect<00:02:34.459> radar<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.290> that's<00:02:36.709> why<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.890> want

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
will detect radar so that's why you want

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.319 
will detect radar so that's why you want
to<00:02:37.130> use<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.370> one<00:02:37.519> for<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.760> freeway<00:02:38.090> because

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
to use that one for the freeway because

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.190 
to use that one for the freeway because
it<00:02:38.450> opens<00:02:38.750> up<00:02:38.959> how<00:02:39.380> far<00:02:39.860> waking<00:02:40.220> detect<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
it opens up how far waking detect and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.539 
it opens up how far waking detect and
mare's<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.410> down<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.739> police<00:02:42.920> frequencies

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
mare's it down to police frequencies

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.670 
mare's it down to police frequencies
it's<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.269> collectively<00:02:44.870> ride<00:02:45.110> bike<00:02:45.290> cameras

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
it's not collectively ride bike cameras

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.390 
it's not collectively ride bike cameras
and<00:02:45.829> stuff<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.160> freeway<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:47.450> Auto<00:02:48.019> uh<00:02:48.709> hell

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
and stuff on the freeway so Auto uh hell

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.300 
and stuff on the freeway so Auto uh hell
is<00:02:49.730> when<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:50.600> use<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.350> city<00:02:51.590> because<00:02:52.040> auto

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
is when I use in the city because auto

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.860 
is when I use in the city because auto
does<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:52.880> red-light<00:02:53.180> cameras<00:02:53.660> and

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
does like red-light cameras and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.890 
does like red-light cameras and
everything<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:55.090> that's<00:02:56.090> what<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.600> manual

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
everything and that's what the manual

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.229 
everything and that's what the manual
had<00:02:57.230> recommended<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.829> use<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.070> auto<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.060> just

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
had recommended to use is auto so I just

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.000 
had recommended to use is auto so I just
go<00:02:59.390> ahead<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.720> use<00:02:59.810> auto<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.650> you'll<00:03:00.829> leave

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
go ahead and use auto so you'll leave

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.620 
go ahead and use auto so you'll leave
those<00:03:01.250> on<00:03:01.430> highway<00:03:01.820> all<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.030> time<00:03:02.329> that's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
those on highway all the time that's

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.990 
those on highway all the time that's
their<00:03:02.930> choice<00:03:02.959> as<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.470> said<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.190> little<00:03:04.519> part

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
their choice as I said this little part

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.949 
their choice as I said this little part
right<00:03:05.060> here<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:07.250> scans<00:03:08.030> behind<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.720> and

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
right here it it scans behind you and

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.819 
right here it it scans behind you and
looks<00:03:09.709> for<00:03:10.010> police<00:03:10.760> back<00:03:11.000> there<00:03:11.500> but<00:03:12.500> yeah<00:03:12.680> the

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
looks for police back there but yeah the

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.759 
looks for police back there but yeah the
installation<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.519> easy<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.810> just<00:03:15.590> have

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
installation is easy so you just have

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:16.750 
installation is easy so you just have
the<00:03:15.860> su<00:03:16.010> section<00:03:16.370> cops<00:03:16.549> right<00:03:16.700> there

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
the su section cops right there

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.920 
the su section cops right there
sometimes<00:03:17.390> they<00:03:17.540> fall<00:03:17.750> off<00:03:18.019> so

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
sometimes they fall off so

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.449 
sometimes they fall off so
and<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.200> kind<00:03:21.379> of<00:03:21.409> have<00:03:21.590> become<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:22.010> drawback

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
and it's kind of have become a drawback

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.300 
and it's kind of have become a drawback
but<00:03:23.299> for<00:03:23.599> mounting<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.349> I<00:03:24.499> recommend<00:03:25.159> having

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
but for mounting it I recommend having

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.860 
but for mounting it I recommend having
in<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.760> middle<00:03:25.969> of<00:03:26.030> your<00:03:26.120> windshield<00:03:26.420> some

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
in the middle of your windshield some

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.539 
in the middle of your windshield some
people<00:03:27.170> have<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.950> mount<00:03:28.189> right<00:03:28.489> here

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
people have a mount right here

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.550 
people have a mount right here
underneath<00:03:28.969> their<00:03:29.180> mirror<00:03:29.629> that<00:03:30.139> they<00:03:30.290> use

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
underneath their mirror that they use

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.190 
underneath their mirror that they use
but<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.099> recommend<00:03:31.519> just<00:03:31.760> having<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.359> right<00:03:33.079> in

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
but I recommend just having it right in

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.300 
but I recommend just having it right in
the<00:03:33.260> middle<00:03:33.409> of<00:03:33.499> your<00:03:33.590> windshield<00:03:33.829> just<00:03:34.189> like

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
the middle of your windshield just like

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.479 
the middle of your windshield just like
that<00:03:34.489> because<00:03:34.909> um<00:03:35.590> I'm<00:03:36.590> gonna<00:03:36.799> have<00:03:36.980> his<00:03:37.129> flat

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
that because um I'm gonna have his flat

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.069 
that because um I'm gonna have his flat
as<00:03:37.670> I<00:03:37.790> can<00:03:38.060> this<00:03:38.329> one's<00:03:38.510> actually<00:03:38.689> a<00:03:38.870> little

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
as I can this one's actually a little

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.379 
as I can this one's actually a little
bit<00:03:39.200> angled<00:03:39.500> down<00:03:39.829> but<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:40.849> like<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.209> have<00:03:41.299> it

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
bit angled down but I like to have it

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.360 
bit angled down but I like to have it
angled<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.750> little<00:03:41.989> bit<00:03:42.079> out<00:03:42.200> so<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.709> can<00:03:42.889> like<00:03:43.099> I

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
angled a little bit out so it can like I

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.699 
angled a little bit out so it can like I
don't<00:03:44.120> know<00:03:44.269> detect<00:03:44.719> but<00:03:45.319> I<00:03:45.349> guess<00:03:45.560> that's

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
don't know detect but I guess that's

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.679 
don't know detect but I guess that's
just<00:03:45.769> my<00:03:45.980> philosophy<00:03:46.549> behind<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:47.180> I'll<00:03:47.359> show

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
just my philosophy behind it I'll show

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:55.379 
just my philosophy behind it I'll show
around<00:03:48.879> just<00:03:49.879> like<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.739> just<00:03:54.769> like<00:03:55.040> that

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
around just like this so just like that

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:01.149 
around just like this so just like that
and<00:03:56.389> then<00:03:56.480> from<00:03:56.599> a<00:03:56.750> distance<00:03:59.799> that's<00:04:00.799> just<00:04:01.040> how

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
and then from a distance that's just how

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.339 
and then from a distance that's just how
it<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.340> we<00:04:02.150> have<00:04:02.299> this<00:04:02.449> I<00:04:02.719> would<00:04:03.019> like<00:04:03.169> this

scanner

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
scanner

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.439 
scanner
it's<00:04:04.040> easy<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.909> go<00:04:05.120> down<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:07.449> input

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
it's easy if I go down to the input

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.449 
it's easy if I go down to the input
right<00:04:08.629> here<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.199> have<00:04:09.439> a<00:04:09.469> mute<00:04:09.829> button<00:04:09.859> right

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
right here I have a mute button right

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.149 
right here I have a mute button right
here<00:04:10.489> which<00:04:10.939> is<00:04:11.060> convenient<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.829> I<00:04:12.829> believe

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
here which is convenient and I believe

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.890 
here which is convenient and I believe
this<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:13.549> alert<00:04:13.879> lights<00:04:14.120> up<00:04:14.329> red<00:04:14.359> which<00:04:14.870> is

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
this this alert lights up red which is

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.379 
this this alert lights up red which is
cool<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.409> it's<00:04:15.530> going<00:04:15.799> off<00:04:16.009> but<00:04:16.549> I'd<00:04:17.150> prefer

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
cool and it's going off but I'd prefer

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.089 
cool and it's going off but I'd prefer
the<00:04:18.019> green<00:04:18.229> light<00:04:18.380> zero<00:04:18.709> that's<00:04:18.859> my<00:04:18.949> only

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
the green light zero that's my only

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.370 
the green light zero that's my only
complaint<00:04:19.459> with<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.180> red<00:04:20.449> one<00:04:20.660> but<00:04:21.139> yeah<00:04:21.229> it's

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
complaint with a red one but yeah it's

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.350 
complaint with a red one but yeah it's
really<00:04:21.440> easy<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.919> use<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.789> recommend

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
really easy to use so I recommend

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.499 
really easy to use so I recommend
installing<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:24.710> into<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> output<00:04:26.240> that's

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
installing this into a output that's

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.149 
installing this into a output that's
close<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.169> so<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.440> can<00:04:27.560> just<00:04:27.590> mute<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:28.009> if

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:28.159 
close to you so you can just mute it if

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:29.680 
close to you so you can just mute it if
