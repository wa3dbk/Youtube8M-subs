 and in this class I will be denouncing a 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.450
 the basic basic module because it is 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.000
 a life that does not have much of a secret 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.040
 execution which as can be seen by 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 teams and the video from beginning a turn 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.300
 very simple but she only very well what 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.090
 it is more important is if it is the execution 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.870
 It's difficult, the important is this. 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.820
 well ok I had this video and more 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.440
 still be able to help disseminate the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.720
 channel that gives this strength is and access 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.640
 my page on facebook dot com bar 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.130

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:26.020
 thigh are four notes within a time 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:28.299
 Okay, so we have two more axes. 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.310
 important is what will always roll in the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.909
 last ever koch that would be with the hand 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.560
 left we 'll put the globe in the face 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.210
 the four times are like this 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:46.389
 so the basic idea you master 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:53.460
 first movement 14 to hit the 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:56.740
 left you replace by buba whom 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.969
 you will have the blessing here in several 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:07.329
 speeds is ok beauty let's go then 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.450
 first time we will have left right 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:16.890
 and bulb distributed in the following 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.890
 way tone box charge ok 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.980
 second time 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:28.960
 the box box with two silly waiting 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:34.980
 good right to be the right time and 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:37.330
 extreme-right silly box deaf go rate 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.220
 and to finish 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.620
 if you have to ride your what for two 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.640
 dishes is the way I do not know at the beginning 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.940
 you will be able to do left right 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.090
 right and left at the head of time 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.620
 you give another plate of attack as 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:01.990
 with the vat in the group then how much 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:05.100
 time is waiting right sneijder can 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:11.100
 have only this of them lost since 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.100
 back to the rhythm that I am 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:22.560
 I do not have the attack plan has 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.530
 problem only does the butt of the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:35.010
 getting that way it was right 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:37.320
 Bass drum and good rate you will not you not 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.930
 put your left hand 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:04:02.040
 the other was, so I'm going to do it 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:04:04.050
 complete counting or 234 has the attack 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:18.900
 now because you do not have another attack 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:23.520
 on the right side is the fast 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:29.760
 the two attacks later on ether 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:35.190
 putting only the attack does not stand 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:37.710
 right in the group 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.820
 an example is the first with the two 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:44.270
 attacks 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.270
 then without the good attack 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:08.139
 Ok, that 's it, you know, you liked it. 

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:12.009
 very simple if you record this 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.139
