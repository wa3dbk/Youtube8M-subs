41 megapixels I can't stop
megapixels<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.730> I'm<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:14.910> say<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.239> more

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
megapixels so I'm gonna say it one more

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.390 
megapixels so I'm gonna say it one more
time<00:02:15.420> or<00:02:15.870> maybe<00:02:15.989> two<00:02:16.230> more<00:02:16.440> times<00:02:16.650> megapixels

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
time or maybe two more times megapixels

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.670 
time or maybe two more times megapixels
and<00:02:17.430> megapixels<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.629> third<00:02:18.959> on<00:02:19.140> my<00:02:19.290> list<00:02:19.560> is

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
and megapixels so third on my list is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.820 
and megapixels so third on my list is
the<00:02:19.890> iphone<00:02:20.090> 5s<00:02:21.090> why<00:02:21.900> did<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.170> pick<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.440> iphone

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the iphone 5s why did I pick the iphone

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.410 
the iphone 5s why did I pick the iphone
well<00:02:23.160> because<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.760> does<00:02:23.910> actually<00:02:24.120> have<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
well because it does actually have a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.750 
well because it does actually have a
place<00:02:24.750> on<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.140> list<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:26.129> wasn't<00:02:26.640> a

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
place on this list it wasn't a

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.040 
place on this list it wasn't a
revolutionary<00:02:27.450> change<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.989> think

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
revolutionary change I think

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.110 
revolutionary change I think
revolutionary<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> very<00:02:29.190> strong<00:02:29.580> word<00:02:29.879> now

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
revolutionary is a very strong word now

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.479 
revolutionary is a very strong word now
to<00:02:30.930> use<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.380> about<00:02:31.530> anybody<00:02:32.069> but<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
to use it just about anybody but the

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.240 
to use it just about anybody but the
iphone<00:02:32.790> 5s<00:02:33.209> gave<00:02:33.450> us<00:02:33.630> touch<00:02:33.900> ID<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.860> gave<00:02:35.040> us<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
iphone 5s gave us touch ID it gave us a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.559 
iphone 5s gave us touch ID it gave us a
better<00:02:35.459> camera<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:36.150> new<00:02:36.690> color<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:38.360> that's<00:02:39.360> it

Apple now the iphone 5c was massively

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.699 
Apple now the iphone 5c was massively
disappointing<00:03:51.690> for<00:03:51.840> just<00:03:51.989> about<00:03:52.109> anyone<00:03:52.410> for

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
reviewers because basically the iphone

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.729 
reviewers because basically the iphone
5c<00:03:56.730> was<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.910> retail<00:03:57.450> die<00:03:57.599> phone<00:03:57.900> in<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.530> plastic

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
5c was a retail die phone in a plastic

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.500 
5c was a retail die phone in a plastic
shell<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.489> basically<00:03:59.910> a<00:04:00.030> better<00:04:00.209> camera

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
shell and basically a better camera

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.180 
shell and basically a better camera
that's<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.079> there<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.650> nothing<00:04:01.829> really

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
that's it there is nothing really

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.949 
that's it there is nothing really
different<00:04:02.340> other<00:04:02.700> than<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.150> thickness<00:04:03.329> the

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
different other than the thickness the

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.220 
different other than the thickness the
material<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:05.130> camera<00:04:05.459> that's<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:07.109> the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
material and the camera that's it so the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.470 
material and the camera that's it so the
iphone<00:04:07.530> 5c<00:04:08.040> basically<00:04:08.609> gives<00:04:08.819> us<00:04:08.970> proof<00:04:09.299> but

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
iphone 5c basically gives us proof but

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.780 
iphone 5c basically gives us proof but
Apple<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.079> working<00:04:10.650> on<00:04:10.859> different<00:04:11.190> models

Apple is working on different models
does<00:04:12.389> that<00:04:12.569> mean<00:04:12.780> we'll<00:04:12.930> have<00:04:12.989> bigger<00:04:13.380> iPhones

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
does that mean we'll have bigger iPhones

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.500 
does that mean we'll have bigger iPhones
who<00:04:14.069> knows<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.700> does<00:04:14.910> mean<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.180> Apple

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
who knows but that does mean that Apple

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.599 
who knows but that does mean that Apple
is<00:04:15.840> actually<00:04:16.289> thinking<00:04:16.650> outside<00:04:17.039> of<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.220> only
