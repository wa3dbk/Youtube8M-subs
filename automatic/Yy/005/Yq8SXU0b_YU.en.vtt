air raids so you guys can kind of see

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.400 
air raids so you guys can kind of see
the<00:02:20.820> similarities<00:02:21.450> obviously<00:02:22.080> there's<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
the similarities obviously there's that

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.320 
the similarities obviously there's that
cross<00:02:22.650> strap<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.460> these<00:02:24.030> ones<00:02:24.180> are

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
cross strap right there these ones are

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.060 
cross strap right there these ones are
made<00:02:24.540> for<00:02:24.840> probably<00:02:25.110> more<00:02:25.290> rugged<00:02:25.530> material

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
made for probably more rugged material

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.380 
made for probably more rugged material
considering<00:02:26.550> it's<00:02:26.670> supposed<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:26.970> be<00:02:27.090> made<00:02:27.240> for

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
considering it's supposed to be made for

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.890 
considering it's supposed to be made for
outdoor<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:29.570> materials<00:02:30.570> are<00:02:30.630> obviously

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
outdoor and materials are obviously

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.540 
outdoor and materials are obviously
totally<00:02:31.110> different<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:31.920> have<00:02:32.070> some

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
totally different they have some

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.600 
totally different they have some
commonalities<00:02:33.210> though<00:02:33.740> obviously<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:35.370> cross

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
commonalities though obviously the cross

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.060 
commonalities though obviously the cross
strap<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.120> biggest<00:02:36.390> one<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:37.530> souls<00:02:37.800> are

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
strap is the biggest one the souls are

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.700 
strap is the biggest one the souls are
totally<00:02:38.340> different<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:39.930> good<00:02:40.080> reason<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
totally different for good reason the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.080 
totally different for good reason the
Jordan<00:02:41.010> eights<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.370> then<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.700> see<00:02:41.880> that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
Jordan eights and then you can see that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.050 
Jordan eights and then you can see that
this<00:02:42.210> one<00:02:42.390> says<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.930> outdoor<00:02:43.230> use<00:02:43.260> only

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
this one says for outdoor use only

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.430 
this one says for outdoor use only
because<00:02:45.060> that's<00:02:45.270> what<00:02:45.450> these<00:02:45.750> air<00:02:46.020> raids<00:02:46.260> were

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
because that's what these air raids were

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.710 
because that's what these air raids were
for<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.220> other<00:02:47.340> huge<00:02:47.610> similarity<00:02:48.210> that<00:02:48.240> I

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
for but the other huge similarity that I

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.510 
for but the other huge similarity that I
wanted<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.410> show<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.560> guys<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.100> back<00:02:50.280> of

aquas have nothing obviously but it has
the<00:03:03.990> same<00:03:04.170> kind<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.620> bumps<00:03:05.040> on<00:03:05.330> both<00:03:06.330> of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the same kind of little bumps on both of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.030 
the same kind of little bumps on both of
them<00:03:06.690> or<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.170> back<00:03:07.350> it's<00:03:07.620> kind<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.830> like

ribbed or whatever you want to call it
so<00:03:11.460> I<00:03:11.490> thought<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.030> kind<00:03:12.240> of<00:03:12.300> cool<00:03:12.360> also

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
so I thought that was kind of cool also

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.830 
so I thought that was kind of cool also
that<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.470> could<00:03:13.620> see<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:15.030> says<00:03:15.210> air<00:03:15.450> raid<00:03:15.630> on

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
that you could see it says air raid on

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.090 
that you could see it says air raid on
the<00:03:15.900> end<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> strap<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.740> and<00:03:16.920> then<00:03:17.010> it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
the end of the strap there and then it

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.220 
the end of the strap there and then it
has<00:03:17.220> air<00:03:17.940> jordan<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.630> strap<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.110> air

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
has air jordan on this strap but the air

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.750
