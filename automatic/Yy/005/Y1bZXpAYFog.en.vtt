00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 hi guys today let's prepare together a 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.929
 roll with whipped cream and strawberries 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:20.650
 to prepare it we need 6 eggs 150 g 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:23.140
 of sugar 50 g of flour 50 g of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:28.119
 potato starch that rome is vanilla 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.860
 or of the vanillin 250 g of strawberry and 200 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.820
 ml of fresh cream 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:40.270
 let's start by preparing the divide base 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:46.660
 the egg yolks from the egg whites we put half 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:50.640
 of the sugar together with the egg whites and with 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.640
 we assemble our food processor 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.660
 now that our egg whites are mounted 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.870
 we can whip the egg yolks with the rest 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.870
 sugar 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.400
 let's proceed by sifting the two flours e 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.400
 the vanillin 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.170
 we take a whisk by hand and begin 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.560
 to add a little at a time alternating 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.659
 egg whites whipped with flour 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.450
 the movement must always be delicate 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.470
 from the bottom upwards so that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.470
 egg whites do not dismantle 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.860
 our dough is ready now not there 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.780
 it remains to pour it on a baking sheet from 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.780
 oven covered with parchment paper 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.959
 we can bake in a hot oven at 180 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.090
 degrees for about 12 minutes while the base 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.810
 it cooks we can proceed to cut the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.670
 strawberries we take the cold cream of 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 refrigerator otherwise does not mount well 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.610
 so let's start mounting it 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.850
 the ball is now well assembled and we can 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.310
 add the strawberries into small pieces e 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.450
 with the help of a marisa we mix for 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.450
 mix the cream 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.880
 we put our face in 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.130
 refrigerator until ready to fill 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.920
 our roll our biscuit e 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.840
 cooked now leased we turn on a 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.010
 sheet of parchment paper and we massage it 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.010
 that of sugar 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.020
 we dust it with sugar 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.020
 caster and we massage it 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.590
 did this 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.660
 we still put it down again 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.959
 we turn it with its sheet of parchment paper 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.180
 and let it cool our base 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.180
 and cold so we can proceed with 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:47.580
 the filling we turn again e 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.580
 fill with cream and strawberries 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.770
 let's take one side 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.920
 and tightening on himself we start a 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.920
 turn 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.160
 we place our roll on a plate 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.870
 and we transfer it to the refrigerator for 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.150
 at least a couple of hours so that you 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.160
 coagulate well I have decided to decorate 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.280
 this roll with icing sugar 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.900
 whipped cream and strawberries then we cut 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.520
 the two ends to make it more 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.130
 adjust if we make some sugar a 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.610
 veil over roll is simply 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.060
 let's make some tufts of cream and 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.060
 strawberries 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.569
