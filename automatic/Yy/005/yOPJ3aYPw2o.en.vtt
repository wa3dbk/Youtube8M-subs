00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
called mortises and started in 1972 and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.790 
called mortises and started in 1972 and
there<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> very<00:00:15.630> 60s<00:00:15.929> idea<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.350> guess<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:16.710> it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
there was a very 60s idea I guess but it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
there was a very 60s idea I guess but it
was<00:00:16.890> an<00:00:17.010> idea<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.520> collect<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> practice

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
was an idea about I collect the practice

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.800 
was an idea about I collect the practice
i<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:20.010> looking<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.400> film<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.880> lot<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.600> saw

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
i was looking at film a lot and I saw

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.840 
i was looking at film a lot and I saw
architecture<00:00:22.500> very<00:00:22.740> parallel<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.340> film<00:00:23.609> in

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
its collaborative nature and it was very

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.890 
its collaborative nature and it was very
conscious<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.170> removing<00:00:28.830> authorship<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.750> a

industrial design etc and I we very much

industrial design etc and I we very much
work<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.850> guess<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.870> position<00:00:49.289> very

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
work like that I guess my position very

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
work like that I guess my position very
simply<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.059> auteur<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.570> the

simply with that of the auteur of the
director<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.010> definitely<00:00:54.110> guiding

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
director and then I'm definitely guiding

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.910 
director and then I'm definitely guiding
conceptually<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:57.510> interests<00:00:58.050> etc<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
conceptually the interests etc of the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.779 
conceptually the interests etc of the
group<00:00:59.160> but<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:01.190> just<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.430> way<00:01:02.579> you're

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
group but it's a just the way you're

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.620 
group but it's a just the way you're
asking<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.300> preconceived<00:01:04.049> ideas<00:01:05.630> there's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
asking about preconceived ideas there's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.760 
asking about preconceived ideas there's
discussions<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.060> sometimes<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.770> putting

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
discussions and sometimes I'm putting

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.500 
discussions and sometimes I'm putting
down<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.100> first<00:01:11.310> kind<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> hunch<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.180> it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
down the first kind of hunch and it's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410 
down the first kind of hunch and it's
it's<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.229> somewhat<00:01:14.159> form<00:01:14.880> already<00:01:15.060> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
it's it's in somewhat form already it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's it's in somewhat form already it's
formed<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.900> somebody's<00:01:16.710> closer<00:01:17.130> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
formed as somebody's closer to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.649 
formed as somebody's closer to
Architecture<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.880> under<00:01:18.060> other<00:01:18.240> time<00:01:18.420> it's

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
Architecture and under other time it's

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
Architecture and under other time it's
just<00:01:18.689> ideas<00:01:19.200> it'll<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.189> about<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.580> land<00:01:20.850> or

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
just ideas it'll be about the land or

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
just ideas it'll be about the land or
it's<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> slope<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.080> about<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> force

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it's about a slope or it's about a force

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.899 
it's about a slope or it's about a force
of<00:01:22.920> movement<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:23.729> something

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of movement it's about something

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.170 
of movement it's about something
there'll<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.750> words<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.729> start

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
there'll be just words and then we start

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
there'll be just words and then we start
working<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.049> forth<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:31.280> it's<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
working back and forth and it's a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.819 
working back and forth and it's a
collective<00:01:33.240> practice<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.049> think<00:01:34.290> most<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
collective practice I think most if you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.770 
collective practice I think most if you
asked<00:01:35.100> other<00:01:35.220> people<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.759> my<00:01:35.970> profession<00:01:36.240> they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
asked other people in my profession they

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.140 
asked other people in my profession they
would<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.259> our<00:01:37.799> practice<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.729> being<00:01:38.970> very

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
would see our practice as being very

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
would see our practice as being very
clearly<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.930> very<00:01:40.409> particular<00:01:40.890> type<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
clearly a very particular type of

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.649 
clearly a very particular type of
practice<00:01:42.090> which<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:43.070> represent<00:01:44.070> some<00:01:44.659> where

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
practice which is represent some where

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.800 
practice which is represent some where
I'm<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:47.220> leadership<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.030> I'm<00:01:48.119> part<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
I'm the leadership and I'm part of the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.850 
I'm the leadership and I'm part of the
directorship<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.649> absolutely

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
directorship but it's absolutely

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
directorship but it's absolutely
collaborative<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.390> course<00:01:51.420> with

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
collaborative and then of course with

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.889 
collaborative and then of course with
that<00:01:52.189> comes<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.520> huge<00:01:54.210> numbers<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> people
