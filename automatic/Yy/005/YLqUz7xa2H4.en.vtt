said<00:06:32.390> it<00:06:32.510> before<00:06:32.630> Apple<00:06:33.260> has<00:06:33.770> given<00:06:34.190> us<00:06:34.310> five

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
said it before Apple has given us five

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.310

gigabytes<00:06:35.090> of<00:06:35.330> iCloud<00:06:35.540> storage<00:06:35.930> which<00:06:36.290> is

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
gigabytes of iCloud storage which is

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.710 
gigabytes of iCloud storage which is
great<00:06:36.770> but<00:06:37.430> when<00:06:37.790> you<00:06:37.910> have<00:06:38.090> multiple<00:06:38.570> devices

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
great but when you have multiple devices

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.340 
great but when you have multiple devices
like<00:06:39.350> an<00:06:39.500> iPad<00:06:39.890> and<00:06:40.070> iPhone<00:06:40.430> and<00:06:40.730> a<00:06:40.820> Mac<00:06:41.350> five

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.900 
gigabytes pretty much gets eaten up
really<00:06:45.110> quick<00:06:45.350> I'm<00:06:45.830> hoping<00:06:46.220> that<00:06:46.370> Apple<00:06:46.669> will

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
really quick I'm hoping that Apple will

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.760 
really quick I'm hoping that Apple will
look<00:06:47.180> at<00:06:47.330> that<00:06:47.540> and<00:06:47.750> say<00:06:47.960> hey<00:06:48.169> you<00:06:48.230> know<00:06:48.530> you

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
paid for an iPad you paid for a Mac you

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.930 
paid for an iPad you paid for a Mac you
paid<00:06:51.620> for<00:06:51.860> a<00:06:51.890> device<00:06:52.190> let's<00:06:52.490> get<00:06:52.640> in<00:06:52.729> five

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
paid for a device let's get in five

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.000 
paid for a device let's get in five
gigabytes<00:06:53.390> per<00:06:53.540> device<00:06:53.870> or<00:06:54.140> maybe<00:06:54.320> just<00:06:54.710> 20

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.010 
gigabytes per device or maybe just 20

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.610 
gigabytes per device or maybe just 20
gigabytes<00:06:55.370> so<00:06:56.000> you<00:06:56.060> have<00:06:56.360> space<00:06:56.720> to<00:06:56.960> go<00:06:57.320> from

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
gigabytes so you have space to go from
