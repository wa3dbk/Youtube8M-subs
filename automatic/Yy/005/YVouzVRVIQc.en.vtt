there are lots of things in formalin
that<00:00:13.629> are<00:00:13.719> very<00:00:13.870> important<00:00:14.289> if<00:00:14.379> you<00:00:14.410> want<00:00:14.469> to

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:14.589 
that are very important if you want to

challenge for a world championship and

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.029 
challenge for a world championship and
one<00:00:17.140> of<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.289> most<00:00:17.410> important<00:00:17.949> is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
one of the most important is

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.490 
one of the most important is
aerodynamics<00:00:18.670> so<00:00:19.060> what's<00:00:19.240> this<00:00:19.359> car<00:00:19.630> I<00:00:19.869> dunno

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
aerodynamics so what's this car I dunno

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.509 
aerodynamics so what's this car I dunno
but<00:00:20.529> I'd<00:00:20.740> let<00:00:20.859> us<00:00:20.949> thought<00:00:21.039> and<00:00:21.160> let<00:00:21.220> you<00:00:21.340> tell

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
but I'd let us thought and let you tell

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.249 
but I'd let us thought and let you tell
me<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:25.060> Stirling<00:00:25.420> Moss<00:00:25.449> edition<00:00:26.170> of

the SLR and last SLR we produced target
of<00:00:29.170> this<00:00:29.349> car<00:00:29.589> was<00:00:29.830> all<00:00:30.099> about<00:00:30.369> slow<00:00:30.669> man<00:00:30.910> speed

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
how far do you actually do that in

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
how far do you actually do that in
Formula<00:00:37.000> 1<00:00:37.120> anymore

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
Formula 1 anymore

that's<00:00:38.170> probably<00:00:38.560> what<00:00:38.950> we<00:00:39.100> do<00:00:39.250> do<00:00:39.430> in<00:00:39.700> the
