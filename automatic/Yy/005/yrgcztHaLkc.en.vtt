00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.750 
Pie's maybe five six inches tall most so
something<00:02:18.620> that's<00:02:18.650> really<00:02:19.160> huge<00:02:19.459> so

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
something that's really huge so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.699 
something that's really huge so
something<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.090> take<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.270> lot<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.569> space<00:02:20.690> do<00:02:21.530> like

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
something I take a lot of space do like

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.960 
something I take a lot of space do like
the<00:02:21.800> fact<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.129> there's<00:02:22.400> not<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.550> whole<00:02:22.700> lot<00:02:22.730> of

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the fact that there's not a whole lot of

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.220 
the fact that there's not a whole lot of
things<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.330> lose<00:02:23.480> with<00:02:23.780> it<00:02:23.959> just<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.040> headband

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
things to lose with it just a headband

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.490 
things to lose with it just a headband
up<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.440> tap<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:29.150> other<00:02:29.629> than<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:29.930> everything

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
up on tap and other than that everything

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
up on tap and other than that everything
is<00:02:30.680> pretty<00:02:30.950> well<00:02:31.129> contained<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:31.849> from<00:02:32.420> my

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
is pretty well contained so from my

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.300 
is pretty well contained so from my
perspective<00:02:32.780> three<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.560> half<00:02:33.680> stars<00:02:33.800> might

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
perspective three and a half stars might

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.369 
perspective three and a half stars might
be<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> little<00:02:34.640> generous<00:02:35.090> with<00:02:35.269> it<00:02:35.450> just

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
be a little generous with it just

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.430 
be a little generous with it just
because<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:37.430> has<00:02:38.209> limited<00:02:38.540> playability<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
because it has limited playability and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.110 
because it has limited playability and
again<00:02:39.800> it's<00:02:40.069> tough<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.640> don't<00:02:40.819> have<00:02:41.090> a

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
again it's tough if you don't have a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.400 
again it's tough if you don't have a
little<00:02:41.569> girl<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.900> likes<00:02:42.110> like<00:02:42.260> My<00:02:42.379> Little

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.770 
little girl that likes like My Little
Pony<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:43.550> might<00:02:43.910> not<00:02:44.120> make<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.360> whole<00:02:44.569> lot<00:02:44.750> of

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
Pony it might not make a whole lot of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.839 
Pony it might not make a whole lot of
sense<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.260> get<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.920> walk<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.250> talking

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
sense to get the walk and talking

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.470 
sense to get the walk and talking
