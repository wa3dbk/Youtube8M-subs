swamps haven't been updated for a good
bit<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.430> time<00:01:08.520> anyway<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.110> that<00:01:10.110> was<00:01:10.530> probably

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
bit of time anyway so that was probably

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
bit of time anyway so that was probably
a<00:01:11.010> game<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> while<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.080> hadn't

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
a game for a while and I just hadn't

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
a game for a while and I just hadn't
heard<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.530> also<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> same<00:01:15.000> person

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
heard about it also from the same person

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
heard about it also from the same person
not<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> bug<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.619> something<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.400> take<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
not a bug but just something to take a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
not a bug but just something to take a
look<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.049> search<00:01:19.439> someone's<00:01:19.830> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
look at now when you search someone's a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
look at now when you search someone's a
log<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.430> shows<00:01:20.640> what<00:01:20.850> clan<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.299> in

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
log it shows what clan there in

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
log it shows what clan there in
previously<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.680> show<00:01:22.830> their<00:01:23.009> clan

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
previously would just show their clan

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.539 
previously would just show their clan
colors<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.090> herald<00:01:24.720> around<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
colors the herald around what is it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.850 
colors the herald around what is it
called<00:01:26.759> yeah<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.810> clan<00:01:28.110> colors<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
called yeah the clan colors and the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.950 
called yeah the clan colors and the
little<00:01:28.979> icons<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.270> wasn't<00:01:30.479> helpful<00:01:30.780> at

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
little icons and that wasn't helpful at

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
little icons and that wasn't helpful at
all<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.590> says<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> clan

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
all but now it actually says the clan

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.249 
all but now it actually says the clan
name<00:01:32.610> which<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.570> great<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.140> an

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
name which is really great so that's an

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.490 
name which is really great so that's an
update<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> bug<00:01:34.950> though<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:36.229> okay<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
