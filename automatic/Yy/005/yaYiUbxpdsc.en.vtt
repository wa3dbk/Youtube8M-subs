something that all the smartphones I've
had<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.170> far<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.890> done<00:01:35.100> very<00:01:35.549> well<00:01:36.380> the

sliced bread of course also have some
gaming<00:01:39.570> capability<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.159> feels<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.520> they

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
gaming capability but it feels like they

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
gaming capability but it feels like they
are<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.909> bit<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> conservative<00:01:42.869> side<00:01:43.259> and
