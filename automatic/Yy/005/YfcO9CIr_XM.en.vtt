00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.970
 this is not soda advertisement 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.880
 it is not that inside this bottle has a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.370
 object is the detail that a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 The merchant bought not only this 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.080
 bottle but many others are also 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.690
 exact the fire 1.16 packaging was on 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.660
 inside the fargo I was putting the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 drinks to chill and I just realized how 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 You're noticing she's missing. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.050
 due to a small hole that has 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.359
 in the bottle and put it a kind of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.160
 an aquino adhesive exactly placing 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.350
 range to avoid getting leaking but only 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 if it is him and only this funnel that neither 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.059
 Little one does not fit through that hole. 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.370
 there is no change in it 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.090
 have at most two at most 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.960
 three millimeters it size of the hole 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.550
 in the bottle 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.920
 I there and saw it had a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.140
 thing exactly I just realized by the fact 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 of it the fact is missing liquid 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 so I separated for the future 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 exchange the packaging on the market there 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.149
 fatah serving dish sealed in the faith 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.770
 it's just bored it had nothing it would be in the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.879
 market that bought exchange 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.040
 usually not 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.080
 but how you are missing separated for 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.760
 then making the switch was that I saw that 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.820
 something stirred inside the bottle 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.409
 so that was why there was in total 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 this dirt and into that thing 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.570
 disgusting that it is there that they 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 they found the stateroom, which indicates everything 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
 one belongs to the composition of the liquid 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.040
 It's the liquid the bottle ended up being 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.659
 open a small hole in the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.479
 bottle where it was even blue 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.150
 a good part of the liquid has now entered 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.400
 finished the session inside the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.670
 pet bottle and begins the process of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.259
 composition of the material then very 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.939
 this is possibly as residue 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.530
 process of composition we send to 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.880
 laboratory to accurately identify 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.579
 What I wanted right? 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.920
 but the almost absolute certainty that 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.890
 treatment of waste and the decomposition of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.430
 material that you conclude here looks is a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.549
 unusual fact right 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.409
 aaaah if this object is apparently 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.189
 an object inside a bottle of 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.380
 refrigerant and it may be that the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.710
 expert made an analysis there with the naked eye 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.170
 Aissami grandson 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.090
 now it may be that he is correct 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.860
 is a problem of decomposition of the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.290
 material here has caused the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.040
 object inside the bottle as can be 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.890
 there is no way to discard 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.710
 packaging problem then the most 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.250
 correct would be to wait for the result 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.400
 of the technical examination of the laboratory examination 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.160
 this examination finds that there has been 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.170
 one bottling problem around the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.470
 person is the owner of this bottle 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.830
 make the complaint the complaint is better 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.440
 saying in procon procon to take the 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.350
 against the manufacturer and may 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.720
 there is a penalty fine and 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.510
 future until such 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.190
 establishments to verify the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.090
 that these 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.430
 products 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.750
 I received from spaipa sa official note that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.150
 spaipa to me please 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.770
 this note here is the note that the company 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.050
 of soft drinks sent us to spaipa s / a 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.660
 informs that she was not contacted by the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.640
 establishment by the citizen 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.460
 Come and bring us the bottle of coca. 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.210
 and had no access to packaging for 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.070
 analyze 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.950
 this can not manifest itself 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.050
 about the specific case the company 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.870
 reiterates that it follows the strictest 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.760

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.660
 integrity in the fabrication of their 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.400
 products 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.040
 the factory production lines 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 have a series of 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.130
 inspection with electronic equipment 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.650
 which ensure the quality of products 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.080
 and reaffirms its commitment to

 by ISO standard 22000 and places 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.600
 provision for service by 0800 21 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.600
