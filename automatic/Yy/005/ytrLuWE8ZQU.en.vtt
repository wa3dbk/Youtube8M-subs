00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.280
 father explain to me about god how he is 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.280
 and how he created things 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.680
 The Bible tells us that in the beginning God 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 created the heavens and the earth 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.430
 we do not know when it was can have 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.760
 been millions billion or trillion 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.760
 year 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.020
 the first thing he had to do 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.020
 was to create a way up 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.040
 in a spiritual body called the locus of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:04.070
 God 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:04.070
 the verb of god the fires god that is the good 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.130
 - says in Saint John chapter 11 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.860
 in the verse that in the beginning was 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.640
 verb and the verb was with god and the verb 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.190
 was god 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:31.680
 in verse 14 of that and the verb became flesh 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:35.530
 and dwelt among us I understand 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.280
 then Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.280
 of the New Testament 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.939
 see there in Hebrew chapter 11 of the cycle 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.869
 the Bible telling us it manifested itself 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.270
 often and in varying ways but 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.710
 now he has manifested himself 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.569
 permanent in your movie as well 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.989
 The theme reminds you that God appeared to 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.989
 and said that if Maria 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.640
 wife because what was generated in her 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.580
 was of the holy spirit 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.640
 yes I remember then it means that the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.430
 holy spirit is the father of jesus himself 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.750
 and is not the third person in the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.950
 holy Trinity and how much Mary gave to the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.530
 light those little logos that the very 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.670
 God incarnated to be clean 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.670
 That's why Jesus Christ is 100% yours.
