00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.539 
forward with too much mental energy
without<00:02:24.799> balancing<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> little

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
without balancing it out with a little

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.600 
without balancing it out with a little
bit<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.730> emotional<00:02:27.599> more<00:02:27.930> heart<00:02:28.799> focused<00:02:29.280> or

heart-centered<00:02:30.120> energy<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.860> makes

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
heart-centered energy if that makes

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.640 
heart-centered energy if that makes

powerful reading and the death card in a

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.470 
powerful reading and the death card in a
lot<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.500> ways<00:02:52.799> it's<00:02:53.430> kind<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.970> similar<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
lot of ways it's kind of similar to the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.119 
lot of ways it's kind of similar to the
ace<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:54.810> swords<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.379> that<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.920> new

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
ace of swords in that it is a new

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.000 
ace of swords in that it is a new
beginning<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:57.989> definitely<00:02:58.260> an<00:02:58.590> ending

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
beginning but it's definitely an ending

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.160 
beginning but it's definitely an ending
so<00:02:59.640> something<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.090> coming<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.629> an<00:03:00.750> end<00:03:00.870> we're

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
so something is coming to an end we're

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.520 
so something is coming to an end we're
putting<00:03:01.440> something<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:02.159> rest<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:03.079> I<00:03:04.079> get<00:03:04.379> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
putting something to rest and I get the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.220 
putting something to rest and I get the
sense<00:03:04.829> just<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.819> ace<00:03:06.299> of<00:03:06.540> swords<00:03:06.780> card

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
powerful effect on you as you move

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.449 
powerful effect on you as you move
forward<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:48.829> I'm<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:49.980> going<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.160> look<00:03:50.310> at

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
forward and I'm just going to look at

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.430 
forward and I'm just going to look at
these<00:03:50.549> three<00:03:50.970> cards<00:03:51.239> together<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:52.079> see<00:03:52.260> if<00:03:52.349> I

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
these three cards together and see if I

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.670 
these three cards together and see if I
can<00:03:52.650> can<00:03:53.280> get<00:03:53.459> any<00:03:53.699> more<00:03:54.150> messages<00:03:54.930> or<00:03:55.379> themes

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680

that<00:03:55.919> jump<00:03:56.190> out<00:03:56.340> at<00:03:56.549> me<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:57.480> there's

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
that jump out at me and there's

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.080 
that jump out at me and there's
definitely<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:59.160> sense<00:04:00.829> when<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:01.859> look<00:04:02.160> at<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
definitely a sense when I look at the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.509 
definitely a sense when I look at the
middle<00:04:03.359> car<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.750> page<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.169> swords<00:04:04.250> he<00:04:05.250> seems
