00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
got the hose hooked up this machine I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.850 
got the hose hooked up this machine I
just<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.970> came<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.330> off<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.510> water<00:01:09.860> got

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

just I just came in off the water got
the<00:01:10.979> water<00:01:11.189> turned<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.450> want<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> leave

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the water turned on you want to leave

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
the water turned on you want to leave
this<00:01:13.229> off<00:01:14.090> until<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> engine<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> running

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
this off until the engine is running

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
this off until the engine is running
because<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:17.040> it'll<00:01:17.729> push<00:01:17.970> water

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because if you don't it'll push water

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
because if you don't it'll push water
into<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.630> cylinders<00:01:19.170> okay<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.040> there's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
into your cylinders okay because there's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.429 
into your cylinders okay because there's
an<00:01:20.340> open<00:01:20.640> path<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.659> can't<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
an open path it can't do that when the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.200 
an open path it can't do that when the
engine<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.770> running<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.700> exhaust<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
engine is running because the exhaust is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.950 
engine is running because the exhaust is
coming<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.720> okay<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.740> I'm<00:01:26.400> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.960> I'm

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
coming out okay so I'm going to I'm

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.240 
coming out okay so I'm going to I'm
going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.290> run<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.530> water<00:01:28.710> through<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
going to run some water through the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.170 
going to run some water through the
engine<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.920> let's<00:01:32.850> give<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
engine and my see here let's give it a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.499 
engine and my see here let's give it a
little<00:01:34.250> c4<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> start<00:01:35.670> without<00:01:35.880> me<00:01:36.119> giving<00:01:36.270> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
little c4 to start without me giving in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.630 
little c4 to start without me giving in
any<00:01:36.720> fuel<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> doubt<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.189> let's<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.579> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
any fuel I doubt it will but let's go to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.530 
any fuel I doubt it will but let's go to
try<00:01:39.530> nope<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.360> see<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
try nope I'm going to have to see if I

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.440 
try nope I'm going to have to see if I
can<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.869> some<00:01:43.079> fuel<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.939> with<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.060> elbow

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
can get some fuel with my with my elbow

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:59.029 
can get some fuel with my with my elbow
a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.840> elbow<00:01:45.960> trip<00:01:46.759> nope

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.670 

gave<00:02:00.039> a<00:02:00.070> little<00:02:00.280> too<00:02:00.490> much<00:02:00.909> throttle<00:02:01.240> there

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
gave a little too much throttle there

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:13.280 
gave a little too much throttle there
that's<00:02:02.680> okay

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.390 

when<00:02:14.290> they're<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.560> water<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.980> can't<00:02:15.220> see

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
when they're in the water you can't see

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.760 
when they're in the water you can't see
that<00:02:15.610> but<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.480> look<00:02:16.720> forward

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
that but you look forward
