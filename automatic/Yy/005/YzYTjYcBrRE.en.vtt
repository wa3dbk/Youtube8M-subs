 above I have so many things or even 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.470
 unfortunately had to install the machine 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.910
 virtual here that fuses so much crap and i 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.549

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.930
 on yours it should work for a while 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.110
