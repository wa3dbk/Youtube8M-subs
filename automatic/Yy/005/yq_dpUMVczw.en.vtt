only<00:00:03.929> as<00:00:04.290> far<00:00:04.529> as<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:04.830> concerned<00:00:05.279> anyhow<00:00:05.640> I

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
only as far as I'm concerned anyhow I

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.880 
only as far as I'm concerned anyhow I
haven't<00:00:06.180> tested<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.750> platinum<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.649> I

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
haven't tested this was platinum so I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.560 
haven't tested this was platinum so I
can't<00:00:08.130> give<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.400> confirmation<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.360> yet

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
can't give my confirmation on that yet

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.740 
can't give my confirmation on that yet

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
if I do come across a platinum one that

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.690 
if I do come across a platinum one that
is<00:00:12.929> different<00:00:13.320> from<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.860> will<00:00:14.160> update<00:00:14.400> it

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
is different from this I will update it

show you a live footage but all these

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
show you a live footage but all these
codes<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.610> separate<00:00:39.030> add<00:00:39.270> them<00:00:39.899> separate

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
codes are separate add them separate

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
codes are separate add them separate
they're<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> huge<00:00:41.100> block<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.730> again<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
they're not a huge block and again and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.229 
they're not a huge block and again and
again<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.360> stress<00:00:42.690> only<00:00:42.930> add<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.969> one<00:00:44.969> by<00:00:45.210> one

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
again I stress only add them one by one

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.500 
again I stress only add them one by one
and<00:00:45.750> only<00:00:46.079> activate<00:00:46.620> them<00:00:46.969> one<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> time

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and only activate them one at a time

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
and only activate them one at a time
when<00:00:49.020> using<00:00:49.440> them<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.800> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.430> choose<00:00:50.670> only

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
when using them and if you choose only

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
when using them and if you choose only
one<00:00:51.149> nature<00:00:51.390> when<00:00:51.840> you're<00:00:51.960> catching<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
one nature when you're catching a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.689 
one nature when you're catching a
Pokemon<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.070> should<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> hundred

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
Pokemon you should have a hundred

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.549 
Pokemon you should have a hundred
percent<00:00:53.879> catch<00:00:54.210> rate<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.539> here's<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> codes<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
percent catch rate so here's the codes I

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
percent catch rate so here's the codes I
have<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.520> alphabetical<00:00:57.090> order<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
have them in alphabetical order for you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.229 
have them in alphabetical order for you
you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.079> pause<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.620> any<00:00:58.739> time<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> I'll

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you can pause this at any time and I'll

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.450 
you can pause this at any time and I'll
also<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.780> adding<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.619> near<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> end<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.510 
lets me keep in mind for as far as
battling<00:01:47.610> goes<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
battling goes if you have these for a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.109 
battling goes if you have these for a
positive<00:01:55.100> yeah<00:01:56.100> there's<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> positive<00:01:56.579> next<00:01:57.000> or

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
positive yeah there's a positive next or

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.499 
positive yeah there's a positive next or
that<00:01:57.240> means<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> adds<00:01:57.630> 10%<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:58.950> potential

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
that means it adds 10% to your potential

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
that means it adds 10% to your potential
skill<00:02:00.509> /<00:02:00.869> stat<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> minus<00:02:02.070> next<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
skill / stat if I have a minus next to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.450 
skill / stat if I have a minus next to
these<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.750> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:04.590> against<00:02:05.040> you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
these it is going to go against you

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.809 
these it is going to go against you
by<00:02:06.030> 10%<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.680> neutral<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.700> you

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
by 10% and if it is neutral like you

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850
