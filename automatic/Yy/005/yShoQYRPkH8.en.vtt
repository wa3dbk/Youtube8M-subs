just one zombie I tried it with two it's

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.950 
just one zombie I tried it with two it's
a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.789> more<00:00:50.910> difficult<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.690> case<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
a little more difficult just in case you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
a little more difficult just in case you
do<00:00:52.140> kill<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.210> they're

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
do kill one but it is around one they're

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.670 
do kill one but it is around one they're
gonna<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.600> moving<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:55.050> slow<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
gonna be moving really slow and

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.139 
gonna be moving really slow and
basically<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:56.670> you're<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
basically what you're going to want to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
basically what you're going to want to
do<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.539> rank<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.899> easy<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.039> gonna

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
do to rank up easy it's I'm not gonna

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.560 
do to rank up easy it's I'm not gonna
say<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.489> quick<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.149> haven't<00:01:00.329> really

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
say it's quick because I haven't really

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.729 
say it's quick because I haven't really
tested<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> don't<00:01:01.320> think<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.680> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tested and I don't think it's going to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.009 
tested and I don't think it's going to
be<00:01:01.800> any<00:01:02.010> quicker<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.489> rank<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.820> quick<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
be any quicker than rank up quick but I

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.179 
be any quicker than rank up quick but I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.460 
now i'm going to start the generator up
as<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.060> guys<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> these

count towards kills as you guys going to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
count towards kills as you guys going to
see<00:01:25.530> right<00:01:25.560> there<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.920> five<00:01:26.189> now<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.700> 6<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
see right there at five now I have 6 and

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
see right there at five now I have 6 and
so<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
so on and so on and what you're going to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.770 
so on and so on and what you're going to
want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.640> keep<00:01:29.850> jumping<00:01:30.270> off<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> pad

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
want to do is keep jumping off the pad

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.390 
want to do is keep jumping off the pad
and<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.229> let<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.439> capture<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> generator

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and don't let it capture the generator

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
and don't let it capture the generator
because<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> make<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.810> Templar

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
because that's going to make the Templar

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.899 
because that's going to make the Templar
Knight<00:01:34.350> zombies<00:01:34.740> keep<00:01:34.920> coming<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.430> they're

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
Knight zombies keep coming and they're

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.480 
Knight zombies keep coming and they're
going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.420> knife<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.900> round<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.530> now

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
going to be one knife on round one now

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.859 
going to be one knife on round one now
the<00:01:38.549> Templar<00:01:39.000> Knight<00:01:39.180> zombies<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> little

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the Templar Knight zombies are a little

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.569 
the Templar Knight zombies are a little
more<00:01:40.079> sporadic<00:01:40.380> than<00:01:40.770> your<00:01:40.890> normal<00:01:41.009> zombies

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
more sporadic than your normal zombies

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.010 
more sporadic than your normal zombies
there's<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.270> pattern<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> where

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
there's not really a pattern of where

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.109 
there's not really a pattern of where
they're<00:01:43.170> coming<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> guys<00:01:44.790> could<00:01:44.939> see

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
they're coming to as you guys could see

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
they're coming to as you guys could see
I<00:01:45.149> prefer<00:01:45.630> trying<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> keep<00:01:46.110> my<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I prefer trying to keep my back to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.679 
I prefer trying to keep my back to
somewhere<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> know<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.299> going

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
somewhere that I know they are not going

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.660 
somewhere that I know they are not going
to<00:01:48.899> spawn<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.009> could<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:50.430> eyes<00:01:50.640> on

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to spawn and I could have my eyes on

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.639 
to spawn and I could have my eyes on
them<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.270> time<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:52.049> once<00:01:52.229> again<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.500> have

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
them at all time but once again you have

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.499 
them at all time but once again you have
to<00:01:52.829> keep<00:01:52.950> your<00:01:53.100> eye<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.610> count<00:01:54.119> down<00:01:54.270> and

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to keep your eye on that count down and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.450 
to keep your eye on that count down and
hop<00:01:54.689> back<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:56.040> gonna<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> hop

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
hop back on you're gonna have to hop

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
hop back on you're gonna have to hop
back<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> generator<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.659> sure<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
back on the generator and make sure you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.200 
back on the generator and make sure you
capture<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.350> some<00:01:58.590> more<00:01:58.790> before<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.030> get

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
capture it some more before you do get

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880 
capture it some more before you do get
off<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.689> hop<00:02:00.869> back<00:02:00.899> off<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> keep

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
off and then hop back off and you keep

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.020 
off and then hop back off and you keep
doing<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> could<00:02:02.670> probably<00:02:02.729> do

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
doing this little you could probably do

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.630 
doing this little you could probably do
this<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.420> long<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.750> guys<00:02:03.899> wanted<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
this for as long as you guys wanted to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.249 
this for as long as you guys wanted to
this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.880> an<00:02:06.060> easy<00:02:06.240> way<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.509> rank<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.930> its

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this is just an easy way to rank up its

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.690 
this is just an easy way to rank up its
you<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.009> difficult<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.640> challenging

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you know it is difficult and challenging

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.669 
you know it is difficult and challenging
at<00:02:09.209> times<00:02:09.239> once<00:02:09.810> again<00:02:09.869> I'm<00:02:10.140> not<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.560> say

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
at times once again I'm not going to say

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.110 
at times once again I'm not going to say
that<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.009> quick<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.489> don't<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.030> going

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that it's quick I don't think it's going

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.110 
that it's quick I don't think it's going
to<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.239> any<00:02:12.510> quicker<00:02:12.810> than

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
to be any quicker than

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.360 
to be any quicker than
rank<00:02:13.299> up<00:02:13.420> quick<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:14.560> honestly<00:02:14.739> might<00:02:15.159> take

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
rank up quick it honestly might take

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.830 
rank up quick it honestly might take
more<00:02:15.610> time<00:02:15.819> than<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:16.120> rank<00:02:16.269> up<00:02:16.420> quick<00:02:16.629> but

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
more time than the rank up quick but

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.100 
more time than the rank up quick but
it's<00:02:16.959> easy<00:02:17.909> it's<00:02:18.909> just<00:02:18.940> one<00:02:19.299> knife<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.720> Templar

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110

guys can go to whatever generator that
you<00:02:37.120> prefer<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:38.440> could<00:02:38.590> go<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:39.370> know<00:02:39.459> up

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
you prefer you could go to you know up

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.039 
you prefer you could go to you know up
on<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.879> right<00:02:40.000> side<00:02:40.060> up<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.659> left<00:02:40.870> side

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
on the right side up on the left side

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.710 
on the right side up on the left side
you<00:02:41.579> can<00:02:42.579> literally<00:02:42.909> do<00:02:43.030> whatever<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.510> wanted

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
you can literally do whatever you wanted

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.869 
you can literally do whatever you wanted
to<00:02:43.780> do<00:02:44.019> i<00:02:44.200> would<00:02:45.099> just<00:02:45.220> prove<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.609> know<00:02:45.640> i'll

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
to do i would just prove you know i'll

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.490 
to do i would just prove you know i'll
recommend<00:02:46.090> keeping<00:02:46.480> some<00:02:46.840> points<00:02:47.109> because<00:02:47.379> if

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
recommend keeping some points because if

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.619 
recommend keeping some points because if
you<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:47.739> let<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.040> generator<00:02:48.400> go<00:02:48.579> down<00:02:48.849> you're

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
you do let the generator go down you're

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.000 
you do let the generator go down you're
going<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.840> want<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.019> have<00:02:50.109> points<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.799> to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
going to want to have points on you to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.650 
going to want to have points on you to
be<00:02:51.250> able<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.549> start<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.849> back<00:02:51.970> up<00:02:52.030> again<00:02:52.299> and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
be able to start it back up again and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.240 
be able to start it back up again and
you<00:02:53.170> don't<00:02:53.349> get<00:02:53.470> points<00:02:53.680> for<00:02:53.829> killing<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you don't get points for killing the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.069 
you don't get points for killing the
Templar<00:02:54.609> Knight<00:02:54.790> zombies<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.510> that's

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
Templar Knight zombies so that's

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.110 
Templar Knight zombies so that's
something<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.410> keep<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.769> mind<00:02:56.829> if<00:02:57.609> you<00:02:57.760> do<00:02:57.909> want
