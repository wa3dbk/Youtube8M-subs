00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.610
 of spring obviously entering 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.680
 summer so we have to take 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 inspiration of what we see on air 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.040
 free in terms of colors so 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.710
 very fashionable are the citrus colors 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.140
 like yellow, lemon green and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.820

 Chinese have understood me so 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.809
 perfect so let's incorporate it to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.730
 through the decorative accessories in 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.830
 the home keep the walls according to color 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.870
 a little more neutral like a brownish gray to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.570
 the best a color I remove almond and 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.760
 then add that color pop through 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.650
 decorative pillows accessories 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.630
 on the rugs and so you have the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.760
 current colors of the season in your 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 home so thanks for your question 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.200
 another question from the followers of 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.880
 facebook on the facebook home page 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.610
 she is called ramón a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.280
 and you want to know since you have a sofa in 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.350
 the red color what kind of accessories 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.659
 decorative through the curtains and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 what paint color incorporate in your 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.070
 home so well we already have a color 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 very loud striking on the sofa wants 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.299
 say we have to give it a contrast 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.520
 to the environment with the paint color in 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.399
 the background a little more neutral or more 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.229
 clarito I would say is ramona so I 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.850
 would like to see it as a brown color with 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.280
 milk a little paler a little more 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.079
 clarito a typical color almond or beige 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.869
 as they also say so that from this 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.789
 already the sofa if you have a contrast 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.619
 well nice and look good warm the 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.959
 obviously we have to bring the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.940
 red towards decorative accessories 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.220
 so if you have art for the wall 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.930
 here if we can make a one take towards 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.269
 up we see a nice poster 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.430
 contemporary with the color red and is a 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.250
 way to unify the environment as soon as 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.140
 to the color of the curtains for your home I 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.819
 I would tell you with a color even a 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.150
 chocolate a brown that is well 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.130
 contemporary or maybe a red in 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.230
 combination with brown or if already 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.120
 you have the color red in a solid color 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.750
 or on the sofa you need a little 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.360
 of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.340
 in a pattern or some kind of design 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.200
 so that it does not look so simple 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.910
 decoration in your home so I hope 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.070
 may this serve you and you have to 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.440
 promise to put a photo of the before and 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.870
 then here on the facebook page of 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.280
 casafé use all Maria Mercedes as 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.620
 I love you, your name reminds me 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.780
 a lot of the soap opera is from thalía that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.190
 fascinates me so, look, I know you have 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.530
 a gassed outdoors and that you're 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.660
 some suggestions to decorate what 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.820
 first of all I love that you have 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.860
 a toilet because I think that a structure 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.230
 architectural as it is to age then 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.209
 much much presence to a space at 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.820
 outdoors being a patio a terrace and 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.530
 Now I do not know what kind of furniture you're going to 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.590
 incorporate below you may have 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.170
 a spa 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.930
 to a dining table outside or once a 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.480
 a set to sit in that case I 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.879
 I would love to see curtain panels in the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.800
 cast structure evo to give it a 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.989
 touch more luxurious a touch as well as 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.090
 typical spa as if you were staying 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.790
 in a five star luxury hotel 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.519
 so incorporate fabrics that are 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.290
 fabrics for outdoor use I love 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.870
 some transparent fabrics is a color 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.510
 white that looks good as well cool 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.420
 summery and I think already with the set 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.920
 of furniture or any type of function 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.280
 what are you going to give to the inside 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.709
 you will have as a good focal point 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.019
 dramatic in that case ok I hope that you 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.060
 has helped that answer or that of 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.780
 italy this answer is specifically 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.950
 for you 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.660
 I know you want to give a little more 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.910
 romance and a warmer touch to your 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.230
 Master bedroom is not like that 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.370
 good look in a master bedroom 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.379
 I always tell all my clients 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.849
 as a suggestion that they have to take 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.250
 inspiration of the bed set 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.470
 then the comforter the pillows 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.889
 cushions so first of all you have 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.870
 what to look for that set that you love 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.639
 look exactly what the colors are 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.469
 who have for example in this case 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.960
 I have this decorative cushion we are going to 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:32.539
 imagine this is being and you the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.370
 duvet set for the bed and 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.319
 you have to see the colors that you are 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.999
 using in this case I would love 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.669
 incorporate to possibly this color 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:42.529
 like orange or rust success in the background 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.330
 as the paint color so that 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.759
 highlight nice and everything that a 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.189
 final report but definitely use 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.300
 the bed set as inspiration and 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.669
 I think you also have to have in 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.500
 mind that the tone of the painting is 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.699
 a master bedroom we want it to be 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.800
 a serene atmosphere of general 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.310
 Relaxation we do not want some colors 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.699
 so strong or so dark that they can 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.979
 so give much energy to the space opts 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.659
 by colors a little more clarito if 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.029
 you want a little more pulling the cake 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:13.339
 but following in these tones so that 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:15.500
 in this way already the color of the furniture 

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:18.110
 and the decorative accessories give you then 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.449
 the dramatic point that you want to give 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.939
 well elegant at the same time and romantic to that 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.900
 master bedroom ok so luck and 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.900
 many candles too
