into effect for wildland fire behavior

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.200 
into effect for wildland fire behavior
and<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> three<00:00:27.029> main

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
and as you know that the three main

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.330 
and as you know that the three main
factors<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.750> fire<00:00:28.050> behavior<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:28.830> wildland

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
factors in fire behavior for wildland

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.989 
factors in fire behavior for wildland
fires<00:00:29.609> are<00:00:29.939> fuel<00:00:30.330> weather<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> topography

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
fires are fuel weather and topography

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.860 
fires are fuel weather and topography
the<00:00:32.999> weather<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.389> something<00:00:33.719> that's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the weather is something that's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.270 
the weather is something that's
important<00:00:34.319> to<00:00:34.350> us<00:00:34.409> because<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:35.010> something

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
important to us because that's something

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.219 
important to us because that's something
that<00:00:35.429> changes<00:00:35.909> so<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.749> is<00:00:36.929> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.109> be<00:00:37.199> a

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:37.229 
that changes so this is going to be a

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.200 
that changes so this is going to be a
tool<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.010> although<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> battalion<00:00:38.940> Chiefs

beneficial to us the use of this device

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.459 
beneficial to us the use of this device
as<00:02:21.609> a<00:02:21.640> weather<00:02:22.359> recording<00:02:22.959> instrument<00:02:23.349> it's

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
as a weather recording instrument it's

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.170 
as a weather recording instrument it's
important<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.980> us<00:02:24.069> for<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> couple<00:02:24.609> reasons<00:02:24.640> as

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
important to us for a couple reasons as

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.839 
important to us for a couple reasons as
we<00:02:25.989> talked<00:02:26.200> about<00:02:26.349> we've<00:02:26.980> got<00:02:27.189> fire<00:02:27.579> weather

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
we talked about we've got fire weather

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.940 
we talked about we've got fire weather
behavior<00:02:28.480> which<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.170> one<00:02:29.349> of<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.530> factors

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
behavior which is one of the factors

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.009 
behavior which is one of the factors
that<00:02:29.980> influence<00:02:30.189> while<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.970> events<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
that influence while and events the

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.839 
that influence while and events the
first<00:02:32.049> thing<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.769> wind<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.400> reason<00:02:33.760> that's

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
first thing is wind the reason that's

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.729 
first thing is wind the reason that's
important<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.359> us<00:02:34.510> fires<00:02:35.019> can<00:02:35.140> create<00:02:35.620> their

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
important to us fires can create their

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.679 
important to us fires can create their
own<00:02:35.769> wind<00:02:36.189> but<00:02:36.760> they're<00:02:36.879> also<00:02:37.060> driven<00:02:37.510> by<00:02:37.629> the

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
own wind but they're also driven by the

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.619 
own wind but they're also driven by the
wind<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.409> goes<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.739> within<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.129> weather

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
wind that goes on within the weather

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.940 
wind that goes on within the weather
increased<00:02:40.629> winds<00:02:40.959> will<00:02:41.349> increase<00:02:41.709> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
increased winds will increase the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.429 
increased winds will increase the
veracity<00:02:42.760> of<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.970> fire<00:02:43.180> changes<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.319> wind

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
veracity of the fire changes in wind

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.020 
veracity of the fire changes in wind
direction<00:02:44.620> will<00:02:45.040> change<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.519> direction<00:02:45.670> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
direction will change the direction the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.240 
direction will change the direction the
fires<00:02:46.269> going<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.500> those<00:02:47.650> are<00:02:47.799> things<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.099> are

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
fires going so those are things that are

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.740 
fires going so those are things that are
important<00:02:48.609> to<00:02:48.670> us<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.970> know<00:02:49.150> when<00:02:49.389> we<00:02:49.510> come<00:02:49.689> on

our general temperature of the day we

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.819 
our general temperature of the day we
know<00:03:15.849> that<00:03:16.090> as<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.540> temperature<00:03:17.019> goes<00:03:17.169> up<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
know that as the temperature goes up the

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.800 
know that as the temperature goes up the
fuels<00:03:18.159> become<00:03:18.790> preheated<00:03:19.359> and<00:03:19.540> once

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
fuels become preheated and once

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.599 
fuels become preheated and once
preheated<00:03:20.349> it's<00:03:20.500> easier<00:03:20.889> for<00:03:20.949> the<00:03:21.190> fuels<00:03:21.430> to

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
preheated it's easier for the fuels to

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.789 
preheated it's easier for the fuels to
ignite<00:03:21.879> in<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.150> first<00:03:22.419> place<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:22.840> easier<00:03:23.530> for

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
ignite in the first place and easier for

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.309 
ignite in the first place and easier for
fire<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.220> spread<00:03:24.340> through<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.989> using<00:03:26.260> a

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
fire to spread through that so using a

fire to spread through that so using a
device<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:26.940> even<00:03:27.940> on<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.060> short-term

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
device like this even on a short-term

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.449 
device like this even on a short-term
incident<00:03:28.959> allows<00:03:29.260> us<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.859> a<00:03:29.889> baseline

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
incident allows us to get a baseline

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.129 
incident allows us to get a baseline
reading<00:03:30.669> of<00:03:31.000> where<00:03:31.269> our<00:03:31.299> temperature<00:03:31.870> where

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
reading of where our temperature where

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.589 
reading of where our temperature where
our<00:03:32.620> humidity<00:03:33.190> what<00:03:33.760> our<00:03:33.879> wind<00:03:34.090> speeds<00:03:34.389> are

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
our humidity what our wind speeds are

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.990 
our humidity what our wind speeds are
when<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.959> event<00:03:35.290> begins<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.190> as<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.760> event

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
when the event begins and as the event

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.569 
when the event begins and as the event
progresses<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:38.349> just<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.739> small<00:03:39.040> device<00:03:39.310> like

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
progresses so just a small device like

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.550 
progresses so just a small device like
this<00:03:39.819> we<00:03:40.359> can<00:03:40.540> use<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.199> take<00:03:41.379> our

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
this we can use that to take our

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.439 
this we can use that to take our
readings<00:03:41.949> track<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.579> during<00:03:42.879> event<00:03:43.269> and

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:43.449 
readings track that during event and

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.229 
readings track that during event and
allows<00:03:44.019> us<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.409> plan<00:03:44.829> our<00:03:45.250> strategy<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:46.120> our

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
allows us to plan our strategy and our

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.349 
allows us to plan our strategy and our
tactics<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.500> successful<00:03:47.889> outcome<00:03:48.359> the

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
tactics to have a successful outcome the

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.479 
tactics to have a successful outcome the
