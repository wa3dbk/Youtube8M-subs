00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.420
 where and to everyone is reese 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.280
 today we find ourselves for 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.160
 boils quiniou he about a big 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.470
 game and in fact finally I you 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 opens a new video series 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.289
 I had a little trouble telling you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.210
 but here it is anyway here I am you 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 opens this famous new series of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.570
 videos that it's actually a series of 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.820
 informative videos for now and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
 after gameplay of course the game far 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.939
 cry 4 so today that's fine I'm going 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.219
 no explosion in terms of information 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.270
 already it's going to be difficult because in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.280
 terms of information there is no 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.530
 enormously hugely low of info from 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.730
 news about this game all there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
 know this is for now there has been a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.420
 gameplay that was presented at the 2014 e3 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 for people who do not know yet 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.079
 but I think you probably need 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.610
 know is that it was presented 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.620
 all that I think or 2b probably know 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.300
 my opinion a robot of the date of release 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 of far cry case all that with some 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.789
 little things 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.770
 in any case if you know not I'll 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.149
 read in this video the gameplay I 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.680
 will actually have it displayed on the screen 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.719
 so like that you'll see it all 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.649
 last gameplay well from far cry to 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.180
 which it is true that it can us 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.229
 give a lot of information that's in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.159
 actually do a little analysis 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.780
 stuff like that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.880
 I tried to deepen in this 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 series here soon at the level of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270
 term of a stuff information forum 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.840
 like that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.820
 official it's really the thing 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.290
 main I'm going to look for a game 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.060
 not try to give you 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 speculations but may not have but 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 really my main thing down is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.900
 the most important thing is to say 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.950
 you to give you information 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.110
 correct 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.170
 in any case a new life of a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.119
 new series actually on my channel 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.100
 come on it's air on the game far cry 4 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.689
 who for me the game far cry 3 was 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.220
 really was really good but 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.570
 it's true what to do with 2o if he were 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.259
 really all that and then we can 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.930
 debate 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.119
 I did not test the far cry any more 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.060
 short and then fail two such 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.759
 also I tested there is no in the far 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 cry the one before the far cry 2 is good 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.850
 better so after that remains to be seen at 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.259
 level of people who play but 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.030
 minus the first per kg not too much play 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.680
 at last short today we speak in 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.240
 made pancake 4 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.860
 excuse me so I think you in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.630
 have a little fun finally may not have 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.770
 but most people yeah they 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.550
 have they do not care a bit so I 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.429
 you gave a few features 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.690
 of this game there in fact the then the mode 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.819
 history for now we do not know 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.920
 great thing but here you present a 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.230
 little the game itself is already at the level 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.340
 of the geographical situation it's okay 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.410
 change ie to manceau 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.630
 really were we going to say between two 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.340
 they all at big island 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.450
 and then yes then basta what are we 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.980
 surrounded by water and then it was 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.060
 inaccessible while here we are 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.319
 really in the Himalayas 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.900
 that is to say in the big ones 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.370
 mountains we 'll say it's rather varied 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.440
 we have rather green places 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.549
 and then snowy places a little 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.500
 did not say stupidity 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.239
 so that's a little what will save a 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.950
 little new far cry at the end of the year 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.370
 because it would be that the principle is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.250
 the same 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.510
 the principle is to survive and to 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.430
 develop on your own 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.290
 whether it's killing animals or 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.210
 so by killing enemies by taking 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.740
 their weapons all that 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.630
 you will also be able to release 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.350
 strong places that is to say there will be 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.430
 enemy encampments and then to sail and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.980
 everything was a bit like in far 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.320
 cry 3 it was really implemented 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.240
 and it's true that clearly when I 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.290
 seen the gameplay there is really a slap 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.240
 graphically serves only at the level of the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.120
 picture quality all this is going to be great 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.590
 interesting and maybe there is a 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.330
 kind of exclusivity in the playstation 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.280
 4 because the gameplay actually that I 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.540
 shows you on the screen is recorded 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.970
 since the playstation case so it remains 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.090
 to see after if it's going to be a big 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.660
 partnership they have established between 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.150
 ubisoft is simply actually and 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.250
 toni or while we are going to say a 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.290
 little trick of the style just to make 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.970
 the gameplay ad in very present 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.890
 so that's it remains to be seen 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 so that's all it could 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.640
 level of the release date he will be going out 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.380
 the perfect game 4 on November 20th so 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.240
 we have quite a bit of time at the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.100
 same period that will come out for example 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.700
 the iphone I do not even know why I 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.110
 you say that's just for fun 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.990
 So that's also the same period 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.640
 in my opinion that will come out the new gta 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.990
 5 in quotation marks to actually pass it 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.730
 will come out on the new platform of 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.080
 short video games so here it's pretty much 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.460
 near everything we know you at the wii at 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.870
 bus pass tell you that you are going 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.880
 to actually embody a character 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.530
 so it's going to be a man who goes all 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.790
 simply having to survive all that 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.170
 So there's going to be a man that will 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.660
 to be a woman it's going to be complicated 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.860
 honestly to develop with a woman 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.360
 all this it will have to change all the 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.040
 stuff so maybe it'll be a day 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.049
 in a future far cry but in any case 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.730
 here you have incarnated a man and 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.739
 you have to embody it and that 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.510
 after that we will have to live from his 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.580
 own way so after that remains to be seen 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.700
 it is necessary without actually thinking of this game 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.680
 the as far cry 3 and from old to more 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.990
 also opus apologized to me ie 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.060
 f1 flaw makes a short whole which 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.890
 you have preferred you the most and 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.110
 what do you think about this famous 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.160
 trailer and this famous gameplay actually 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.890
 from far cry 4 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.090
 do you think that eventually 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.040
 is going to be a good game we will always stay 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.510
 a little in the same originality and this 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.249
 which is rich in actually rusty iron a 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.379
 little game 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.399
 my opinion the fact of the influenced here of 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.679
 completely change zone 

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:54.299
 geographic as here the himalaya it's 

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.349
 not such a bad idea because that's it 

00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:55.889
 he can really create things 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.569
 additional 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.829
 there will be animals as they 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.169
 will be added as for example a 

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:02.339
 elephant that made me when I saw that I 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.439
 I 'm voice over and he's really 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:07.129
 well done the elephant the access of the 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:10.619
 texture is very different and improve 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:12.869
 in my opinion the density of animals all that 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:14.189
 will be increased impasse and inevitably 

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:16.499
 it will be more dedicated to news 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.839
 generations of consoles and at the 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.699
 platform pc also so that risk 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.279
 to be really a game that will ask 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.559
 a lot of power and that's it 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.879
 frankly super interesting there we are 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.589
 changing stage we're trying 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.569
 to actually pass them generations 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.999
 of consoles to new generations of 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.860
 video game consoles so we're in 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.689
 to cross a new course that is 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.579
 really a graphic slap and that is 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.869
 also to deepen perhaps the game in 

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:41.849
 himself after the scenario 

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:43.110
 I hope it will be improved because 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.469
 that there are many who speak a little 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.079
 of a rather basic scenario but that that 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.179
 the principle in itself far cry 4 finally 

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:52.439
 far cry rather low it's a bit the same 

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.519
 months the threat first of all people thank you 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:55.199
 put a little I loved the video that 

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.909
 is great fun especially for mission 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.199
 personal page massarotto then I want 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.199
 to say next tchatcho crisis out 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.190
 I
