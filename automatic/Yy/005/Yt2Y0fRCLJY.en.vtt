powdered<00:02:11.740> sugar<00:02:11.770> in<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:13.090> I'm<00:02:13.570> going<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
powdered sugar in there and I'm going to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.240 
powdered sugar in there and I'm going to
beat<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> little<00:02:14.290> bit<00:02:14.470> more<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:15.070> make<00:02:15.220> sure

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
beat it a little bit more to make sure

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.640 
beat it a little bit more to make sure
the<00:02:15.640> icing<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.180> light<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.690> after<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.470> I'm

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
the icing is light and after that I'm

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.810 
the icing is light and after that I'm
going<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.860> stream<00:02:18.130> in<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.310> little<00:02:18.610> bit<00:02:18.730> of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
going to stream in a little bit of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.970 
going to stream in a little bit of
orange<00:02:19.060> juice<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.750> finish<00:02:20.500> off<00:02:20.709> with<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
orange juice and finish off with a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.729 
orange juice and finish off with a
little<00:02:21.340> bit<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.489> scraped<00:02:21.880> vanilla<00:02:22.300> bean

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
little bit of scraped vanilla bean

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.590 
little bit of scraped vanilla bean
before<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.770> add<00:02:24.040> in<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> orange<00:02:24.700> juice<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.300> want

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
before I add in the orange juice I want

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.120 
before I add in the orange juice I want
to<00:02:25.660> make<00:02:25.780> sure<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.320> mixer<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.770> turning

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
to make sure that the mixer is turning

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.680 
to make sure that the mixer is turning
low<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:27.610> again<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.180> orange<00:02:28.420> juice<00:02:28.510> will

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
low because again the orange juice will

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.630 
low because again the orange juice will
splash<00:02:28.959> out<00:02:29.200> everywhere<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.430> want<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
splash out everywhere and I just want to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:41.150 
splash out everywhere and I just want to
stream<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.150> slowly

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.500 

okay<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:42.220> after<00:02:42.520> I've<00:02:42.760> added<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.210> orange

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.360 
okay so after I've added the orange
juice<00:02:43.660> I've<00:02:43.930> let<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.320> beat<00:02:44.500> for<00:02:44.860> about<00:02:45.010> one

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
