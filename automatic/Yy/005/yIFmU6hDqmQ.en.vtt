00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.019
 today I want to show you another 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:17.850
 papa inventions the super rotary cultivator 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:20.840
 born from old ruggerini engine old 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:27.210
 mar of the seventies totally 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:30.779
 restored rectified from here it is 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.910
 born everything you see we have 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.940
 put it in dad's lab that it is 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.700
 constantly messy as you can 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.910
 see here is he succeeds in 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.270
 to find oneself because it is practically 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.620
 adding other other features 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 then he always inventor 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.680
 here is francica first then called a 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.840
 explain the main features of the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 super rotary cultivator then how 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.609
 let's start 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.890
 let 's start the engine line then go 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.810
 let's start from the engine engine was if it is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.330
 normal African trust was an old man 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.460
 engine that you bought at the time no 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.470
 exalts everything was and throws it away 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 option letters then here we have neither 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 profession is the bike because it is needed 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.880
 because it serves just because it serves eder 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 league noiatri he normal walk no ok 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.310
 when I have to attach the bowler hat i 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.729
 dragons 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.360
 and betty grain of chain through a bang 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.390
 in the ok now works when he attacked the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.320
 clutch a chosen clutch this yes 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.170
 attest to bombay 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.869
 ok the hydraulic bowler because it is needed 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.390
 we also have it here at the altar 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.320
 then we have the tilting system 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.090
 because it catches you when Teramo is full 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.689
 there is no need to do so there is the piston 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.350
 plumber 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.970
 here it is that serves to overturn later 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.840
 that we have of life in the Varese area 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.270
 when you are six months old 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.000
 ok let's say the winch when we say 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.619
 in the most uncomfortable points we fail to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.789
 to go up 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 we also applied wounded 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.590
 the plumber and allows us to succeed 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.840
 after we have that we have in the socket of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.170
 strength of the crowd is a company of cox 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.349
 cardan power take-off taken by force 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.150
 always useful maybe it could be 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.660
 useful as well as to imagine something 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.120
 to connect for everyone in short 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.459
 we have a distributor of trevi e 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.950
 other ways 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.079
 then we have another solenoid valve 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.120
 also that automatically serves the 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.350
 remote control and networks but ok because 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 we have another invention there 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.269
 we'll see in another video that 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.569
 it would rewind manin automatically 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.950
 networks 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.510
 the olive harvest there are 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.819
 attacks but there goes where they come 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.439
 with the remote control with the correct force 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.189
 ok it was nothing in a remote way 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.049
 closed but I will have to operate 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.819
 solenoid valve and of which manual 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.250
 no because at a distance when we are 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.409
 picking up more often than not knowing 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.209
 come which to detach attacker ok 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.109
 those that we have then that we have there 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.129
 we have a good hundred other grave net 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.400
 power 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:16.609
 now settle from a mini minor of the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.870
 minor end for favors between 600 then 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.079
 we see 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.269
 then we have a braking system 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.760
 all with disks no 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.099
 Calabria is not really out of two 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.349
 wheels are no longer the brakes how that 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.870
 for the question of safety and 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.120
 better braking right 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.909
 we block directly from who it is 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.409
 Instead pizza at the pizza then here it is 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.409
 we have other sites here again for this 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.439
 always just love rest is this is the 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:49.729
 hand brake of an old scooter 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:51.310
 then to action friends the bowler from 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.770
 vinci 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.420
 until the hand brake caliper then here 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:01.959
 we have two couples with said dott 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:08.910
 casini we open the trains in front but also 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.910
 we will do by force 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.400
 so how we betray launch we have 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:19.609
 put as an excuse to the shared ok 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.480
 you to the right just excuse then 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.830
 this edition was pincio 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.060
 of the alpha romeo 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.240
 ok then to the Serbian joke we said 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.720
 joke here he is often plumber though 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.090
 I serve prank text this yes these these 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.900
 familiar this name 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.300
 ok of the volkswagen golf wall here 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.300
 We can be there always walks the 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.520
 pump obviously not and standing still 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.870
 ok so it's basically not hired 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.220
 by profession but power steering 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.950
 rightly because when I had to walk 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.130
 feels to turn new to is always e 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.760
 seems to be activated the mayor is here and there 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.340
 compensation the lights are not classic but 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:11.470
 they are the ones that are so called anti 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.330
 anti-vibration catalytic muffler 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:18.340
 because we respect the environment I call 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.610
 green then 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.010
 because today the coil from her sabrina 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.100
 he was sick of candles and when needed 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.370
 around that I'm not ok starting already 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.560
 20 the newspaper with 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.900
 with glow plugs because music for sale 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.100
 also the hi fi system 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.790
 you are uncertain about them with the cashier 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.440
 wide and then the brown one after 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:48.020
 titles under a cylinder of the delle 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.080
 old gas stoves because practically 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.630
 in case of puncture or we need it 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.669
 the air we accumulate the air and here 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.840
 we have the attack 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:06:04.729
 here it is in the perfect air and well 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.650
 in short, we are just not right 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.270
 twin wheels for more 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.300
 stability 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.910
 here they are jesi lights where lucia is going 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.699
 arrows of f lapresse proves president 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.490
 gimbal we put this goes 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:23.300
 basically it works like this pulls in 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:27.460
 crazy you practically cancellation yes 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.500
 unroll ok like all real celli 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.550
 so, however, one knows where and after which 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.539
 attacks the fiction then rewinds 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.539
 other features 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.620
 you have to finish it below to finish again 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:51.290
 here the system that controls everything 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:59.960
 here too many senile races like 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:07:03.680
 we must but from anatomic we have said 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.050
 almost everything, however, to make it short it was 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.190
 only the old ruggerini engine of the 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:13.940
 70s and later he created that point 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.980
 what you see is necessity by necessity but 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.320
 how to say is not that he created rajada 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.480
 created years ago just in these 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.350
 days he is reviewing it for a moment 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:27.020
 because it's because we know we used it 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:30.050
 we did it for earthmoving itself 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.550
 broken in two for the pole event 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.010
 is restoring revising and 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:38.180
 reinforcing that this is fine 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:41.510
 we said so we close nothing 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:45.250
 boys leave you to the next 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:47.540
 next mention ok at lent values 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.720
 hello guys to all the friends of 

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.720
 youtube 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.319
 Yup
