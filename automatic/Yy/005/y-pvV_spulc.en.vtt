it all because I believe that apart from
maybe<00:03:58.020> that<00:03:58.440> my<00:03:59.250> batteries<00:03:59.640> double<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.060> triple

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
maybe that my batteries double a triple

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.320 
maybe that my batteries double a triple
A's<00:04:00.540> 9<00:04:00.870> volts<00:04:03.530> something<00:04:04.530> like

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.900 

it<00:04:07.780> should<00:04:08.080> have<00:04:08.260> everything<00:04:08.830> in<00:04:09.280> there<00:04:09.610> ready

to run including the return of the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.260 
to run including the return of the
battery<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.190> should<00:04:12.430> not<00:04:12.580> be<00:04:12.790> sold<00:04:13.000> separately

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
battery it should not be sold separately

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.610 
battery it should not be sold separately
it<00:04:13.990> shouldn't<00:04:14.440> be<00:04:14.530> sold<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:16.390> another<00:04:17.080> package

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
it shouldn't be sold in another package

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.790 
it shouldn't be sold in another package

like<00:04:20.920> that<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.130> think<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.430> should<00:04:21.610> be<00:04:21.670> all<00:04:22.060> sold

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
like that I think it should be all sold

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
like that I think it should be all sold
together<00:04:22.690> one<00:04:22.900> package<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:24.690> do<00:04:25.690> not<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.110> like

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
the taiko was ripping off I think it

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.570
