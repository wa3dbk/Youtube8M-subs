 how cool its content and immediately 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.090
 does the twilight meet us when I saw 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 I wanted to laugh and cry 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 at the same time 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.930
 If you are not in the subject, then I will explain this flash 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.140
 a doll that stupidly deviantart 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 but 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.739

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.250

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.870
 horror precisely these words surfaced in my 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 head when i saw it what it is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.790

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.010
 fall tons of bricks do not know why 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.340
 this mug is associated with one 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.200
 moment of muva 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.479
 I was also embarrassed by the fact that the library 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.210
 still exists and has no twilight 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.070
 wings can you say hey company 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.189

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.400
 a library in chips but applejack 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.380
 regularly throws these purple 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.659
 mushrooms 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.180

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.460
 Forget everything you saw before that and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 look at this illustration 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 what i can't even describe in words 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.170
 however, you yourself see all the editors 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.170
 you assholes grow or what if you 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.360
 consider it the norm so here there is still 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.390
 fun game which of these fragments 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.700
 there is a big picture and you know what 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.160
 it's either i'm a fool or an editor 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.209
 degradanta how much I did not look at these 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.760

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.769
 completed illustrations accent 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.660
 attention to what is written here is not 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.650
 meaning is all the same for preschool kids 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.200
 age 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.450
 I will only say briefly the story of how 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.459
 I wanted to leave the country that she 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.980
 I had a dream because in Ponyville 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.140
 it rains but then it dawned on it 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.769
 her friends live and so this is the best 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.030
 place on earth profit friendship magic 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.519

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.310
 more adequate although translation and printing in 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.450
 Russia produces the same building 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.489
 last thing i wanted to do 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.230

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.230
