strike of his own tell me all that that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.910 
strike of his own tell me all that that
ball<00:02:32.940> by<00:02:33.180> Bobby<00:02:33.390> Holmes<00:02:33.720> was<00:02:34.080> was<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.709> his

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
ball by Bobby Holmes was was that his

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920 
ball by Bobby Holmes was was that his
execution<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.970> some<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.330> reacting

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
execution was that some of that reacting

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410 
execution was that some of that reacting
urethane<00:02:37.830> ball<00:02:38.010> making<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.459> left<00:02:38.730> turn<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:39.209> think

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
urethane ball making a left turn I think

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.760 
urethane ball making a left turn I think
there's<00:02:39.540> no<00:02:39.660> question<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:40.200> was<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.349> lot<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.620> help

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
there's no question it was a lot of help

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.830 
there's no question it was a lot of help
from<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> surface<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.489> ball<00:02:41.640> Mike<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
from the surface of the ball Mike and a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.210 
from the surface of the ball Mike and a
lot<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.019> people<00:02:43.319> might<00:02:43.470> dispute<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.190> I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
lot of people might dispute that but I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.820 
lot of people might dispute that but I
think<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.580> reactive<00:02:44.970> resin<00:02:45.120> balls<00:02:45.830> really

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
think the reactive resin balls really

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.860 
think the reactive resin balls really
are<00:02:47.099> almost<00:02:47.519> an<00:02:47.819> illegal<00:02:48.360> weapon<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.720> might

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
are almost an illegal weapon you might

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.380 
are almost an illegal weapon you might
say<00:02:49.430> kind<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> aluminum<00:02:51.030> bat

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
say kind of like the aluminum bat

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.360 
say kind of like the aluminum bat
baseball<00:02:51.959> there<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.200> go<00:02:52.380> yeah<00:02:52.769> that's<00:02:53.130> that's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
baseball there you go yeah that's that's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.220 
baseball there you go yeah that's that's
not<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> bad<00:02:53.849> analogy<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.510> they<00:02:54.660> do<00:02:54.720> they

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
not a bad analogy because they do they

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.449 
not a bad analogy because they do they
do<00:02:55.290> create<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.620> lot<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.800> area<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.040> line<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
do create a lot of area on line and a

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.130 
do create a lot of area on line and a
lot<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.730> hitting<00:02:56.880> power<00:02:57.120> at<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.420> ball<00:02:57.630> that

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
lot of hitting power at the ball that

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.210 
lot of hitting power at the ball that
the<00:02:58.260> bowler<00:02:58.440> doesn't<00:02:58.860> generate<00:02:59.160> himself<00:03:04.220> Jean

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the bowler doesn't generate himself Jean

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.100 
the bowler doesn't generate himself Jean
stuffs<00:03:05.580> biggest<00:03:05.940> problem<00:03:06.239> for<00:03:06.420> him<00:03:06.569> today<00:03:06.750> is

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
stuffs biggest problem for him today is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.210 
stuffs biggest problem for him today is
going<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.350> be<00:03:07.470> keeping<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.799> ball<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
going to be keeping the ball to the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.370 
going to be keeping the ball to the
right<00:03:08.310> hip<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:08.790> because<00:03:09.180> he<00:03:09.690> doesn't<00:03:09.900> generate

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
right hip in because he doesn't generate

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.570 
right hip in because he doesn't generate
the<00:03:10.530> ball<00:03:10.680> speed<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.160> some<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.459> other

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
the ball speed that some of the other

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.570 
the ball speed that some of the other
players<00:03:11.819> do<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.980> ball<00:03:14.130> wants<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.459> hook

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
players do and so the ball wants to hook

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.979 
players do and so the ball wants to hook
on<00:03:14.760> him<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:14.970> he's<00:03:15.120> gonna<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.540> find<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.870> way

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
on him and he's gonna have to find a way

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.720 
on him and he's gonna have to find a way
to<00:03:16.019> keep<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.349> right<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.920> hit<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.340> that

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
to keep it right in the hit and that

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.580 
to keep it right in the hit and that
could<00:03:17.880> be<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> problem

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.050 

well<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> first<00:03:23.459> pressure<00:03:23.819> that's

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
well this is the first pressure that's

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.190 
well this is the first pressure that's
been<00:03:24.239> put<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.569> Bobby<00:03:24.810> holders<00:03:25.260> at<00:03:25.380> all<00:03:27.200> that's

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
been put on Bobby holders at all that's

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.750 
been put on Bobby holders at all that's
the<00:03:28.319> worst<00:03:28.500> shot<00:03:28.709> he's<00:03:28.860> made<00:03:29.099> Mike<00:03:29.340> since<00:03:29.670> the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
the worst shot he's made Mike since the

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.160 
the worst shot he's made Mike since the
first<00:03:29.970> frame<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.390> first<00:03:30.569> game<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.110> that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
first frame of the first game and that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.510 
first frame of the first game and that
one<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.410> was<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.590> almost<00:03:31.800> directly<00:03:32.220> at<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
one it was to almost directly at the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.370 
one it was to almost directly at the
middle<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.849> dinner<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.900> might<00:03:34.080> have<00:03:34.200> been<00:03:34.290> an

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
middle of dinner it might have been an

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.559 
middle of dinner it might have been an
accumulation<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.190> how<00:03:35.400> long<00:03:35.670> can<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:36.030> go<00:03:36.239> here

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
accumulation of how long can I go here

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.630 
accumulation of how long can I go here
well<00:03:37.080> just<00:03:37.680> prove<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.010> he<00:03:38.099> at<00:03:38.250> least<00:03:38.400> is

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
well just prove that he at least is

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.370 
well just prove that he at least is
humid<00:03:39.060> right<00:03:39.239> that's<00:03:39.690> right<00:03:39.870> well<00:03:40.110> this<00:03:40.319> is

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
humid right that's right well this is

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.199

it<00:07:07.550> gets<00:07:07.669> down<00:07:07.789> at<00:07:07.939> the<00:07:08.029> bottom<00:07:08.180> right<00:07:08.449> there

00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:08.559 
it gets down at the bottom right there

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.379 
it gets down at the bottom right there
let<00:07:09.559> it<00:07:09.589> continue<00:07:09.919> on<00:07:10.159> just<00:07:10.370> a<00:07:10.460> little<00:07:10.759> bit<00:07:10.909> you

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
let it continue on just a little bit you

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:12.820 
let it continue on just a little bit you
see<00:07:11.479> the<00:07:11.719> elbow<00:07:11.839> right<00:07:12.080> there<00:07:12.319> off<00:07:12.589> to<00:07:12.740> the

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
see the elbow right there off to the

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.469 
see the elbow right there off to the
side<00:07:13.039> when<00:07:13.460> this<00:07:13.729> is<00:07:13.849> what<00:07:13.939> Mike's<00:07:14.149> talking

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
side when this is what Mike's talking

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:15.790 
side when this is what Mike's talking
about<00:07:14.659> the<00:07:14.779> elbow<00:07:14.930> came<00:07:15.199> out<00:07:15.319> this<00:07:15.559> way

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
about the elbow came out this way

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.439 
about the elbow came out this way
instead<00:07:16.699> of<00:07:16.759> going<00:07:16.999> straight<00:07:17.059> through<00:07:17.270> the

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:17.449 
instead of going straight through the

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:18.879 
instead of going straight through the
ball<00:07:17.629> and<00:07:17.870> that's<00:07:17.930> when<00:07:18.169> the<00:07:18.259> ball<00:07:18.379> floats<00:07:18.680> on

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
ball and that's when the ball floats on

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:26.710 
ball and that's when the ball floats on
you<00:07:19.039> or<00:07:19.189> you<00:07:19.490> pull<00:07:19.729> it<00:07:19.849> one<00:07:19.999> or<00:07:20.120> the<00:07:20.180> other

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.380 

and<00:07:27.720> another<00:07:28.170> light<00:07:28.410> 7-pin<00:07:29.180> just<00:07:30.180> not

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:30.390 
and another light 7-pin just not

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.850 
and another light 7-pin just not
carrying<00:07:30.810> those<00:07:30.990> hits<00:07:31.260> that<00:07:31.440> he<00:07:31.500> was<00:07:31.620> carrying

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 
carrying those hits that he was carrying

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.410 
carrying those hits that he was carrying
the<00:07:32.010> last<00:07:32.190> game<00:07:32.400> you<00:07:32.520> know<00:07:32.700> we<00:07:32.850> talked<00:07:33.120> during

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420 
the last game you know we talked during

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.510 
the last game you know we talked during
the<00:07:33.510> break<00:07:33.600> to<00:07:34.080> that<00:07:34.380> that<00:07:34.890> sometimes<00:07:35.370> you

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 
the break to that that sometimes you

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.460 
the break to that that sometimes you
shoot<00:07:35.700> those<00:07:35.850> 270<00:07:36.510> games<00:07:36.720> in<00:07:36.960> the<00:07:37.080> next<00:07:37.200> game

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
shoot those 270 games in the next game

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.860 
shoot those 270 games in the next game
they<00:07:37.890> don't<00:07:38.040> fall<00:07:38.670> quite<00:07:38.970> so<00:07:39.180> easily<00:07:39.360> yeah<00:07:39.720> and

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
they don't fall quite so easily yeah and

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.600 
they don't fall quite so easily yeah and
all<00:07:39.960> is<00:07:40.110> really<00:07:40.470> is<00:07:40.650> an<00:07:40.800> entry<00:07:41.070> angle<00:07:41.220> when

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610 
all is really is an entry angle when

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.250 
all is really is an entry angle when
you're<00:07:41.760> striking<00:07:42.030> the<00:07:42.420> ball<00:07:42.570> is<00:07:42.690> entering<00:07:42.930> at

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
you're striking the ball is entering at

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.960 
you're striking the ball is entering at
the<00:07:43.290> right<00:07:43.530> angle<00:07:43.890> when<00:07:44.040> you're<00:07:44.190> not<00:07:44.400> even

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
the right angle when you're not even

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.160 
the right angle when you're not even
though<00:07:45.060> you're<00:07:45.210> getting<00:07:45.420> the<00:07:45.510> same<00:07:45.750> basic

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.170 
though you're getting the same basic

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.420 
though you're getting the same basic
hits<00:07:46.380> and<00:07:46.590> he<00:07:46.650> carried<00:07:46.920> this<00:07:47.010> yet<00:07:47.220> as<00:07:47.310> you

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.430 
hits and he carried this yet as you

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.100 
hits and he carried this yet as you
mentioned<00:07:47.760> Mike<00:07:47.910> three<00:07:48.450> or<00:07:48.540> four<00:07:48.690> times<00:07:48.930> in

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.110 
mentioned Mike three or four times in

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.840 
mentioned Mike three or four times in
that<00:07:49.200> first<00:07:49.470> game<00:07:49.650> he's<00:07:50.040> not<00:07:50.220> carrying<00:07:50.520> it<00:07:50.730> now

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:50.850 
that first game he's not carrying it now

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.250 
that first game he's not carrying it now
because<00:07:51.180> the<00:07:51.210> ball<00:07:51.480> isn't<00:07:51.690> entering<00:07:52.110> at<00:07:52.230> the

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.260 
because the ball isn't entering at the

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.020 
because the ball isn't entering at the
same<00:07:52.500> angle<00:07:52.680> so<00:07:53.130> he's<00:07:53.280> changed<00:07:53.670> either<00:07:53.820> his

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.030 
same angle so he's changed either his

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.940 
same angle so he's changed either his
release<00:07:54.360> or<00:07:54.990> he's<00:07:55.200> changed<00:07:55.560> the<00:07:55.590> entity's

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:55.950 
release or he's changed the entity's

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.840 
release or he's changed the entity's
changed<00:07:56.280> the<00:07:56.340> ball<00:07:56.460> speed

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:56.850 
changed the ball speed

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.020 
changed the ball speed
well<00:07:57.540> Bobby<00:07:57.870> Holmes<00:07:58.140> is<00:07:58.350> trailing<00:07:58.710> by<00:07:59.130> 15<00:07:59.640> pins

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.030 
well Bobby Holmes is trailing by 15 pins
