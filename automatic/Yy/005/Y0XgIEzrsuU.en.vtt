00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 it's very good morning 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.700
 Carla, how are you, good morning? 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.700
 I meet here with the excited ones 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.519
 metallica fans because at nine o'clock 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.340
 the night begins this awaited second 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.340
 concert in our country here is nothing 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 for example 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.270
 good morning metallica and that is that in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.580
 actually I was very excited about what 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.380
 what will be this second concert in 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.940
 our country but we are going to talk 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.000
 with one of them what do you feel about seeing 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
 second time the truth is pitifully 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.020
 the first time but this time 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.430
 them for the first time is going to be a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.220
 unique moment in my life is a moment 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.530
 perfect and glorious and I can say 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.530
 contest that I can die in peace 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.360
 I think you're going to die what's up with 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.360
 they I know 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.090
 we are on the day good Monday while 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.829
 the friend of the first full day I do not 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.829
 I could buy it 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 all right 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.640
 so they do not deserve 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.420
 and we are going to talk here with us about 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.630
 what are you doing the tail I'm 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.630

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.549
 First 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.790
 there are all kinds of fans here 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.290
 there was one that had a tattoo hatch 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.090
 I was lost around here to see this 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.090
 stuck up this face we're going to 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.720
 teach because the false 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:21.209
 so much so that I know that they are tattooed 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:23.370
 arms that means that the brain the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.840
 guitar is inside brain and notes 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.280
 that comes out of the mouth of the learn 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.280

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:45.290

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.390
 so much heat is already starting to 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.070

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.330

 what expectations do you have for tonight 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.370

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.170
 my life to see metallica no no no what 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.310

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.500

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.220
 the apotheosis that was that concert you 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:51.080
 encouraged to tell you how they were all 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.540
 the expectations that here the boys 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.090
 they are not the only ones because they are not so 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.090

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.970
 fans here my cameraman carlos cruz 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.760
 also that he is looking forward to the 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.860

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.440
 we can force because in that field but 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.290
 he is also with his metallica polito 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.160

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.160

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.520
