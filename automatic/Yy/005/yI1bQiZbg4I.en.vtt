 I wanted me to speak with us 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.430
 began what difference this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.520
 aircraft for the current aircraft that the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.580
 much larger plane to 270 seats in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 two classes that how we will operate 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.240
 This is more than double an hour. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.540
 where we have until today that I had 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.230
 long as it is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.970
 operate the airplane in the coming years and is the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.160
 airplane that will take you to Florida 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.360
 for their own destinies, where the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.329
 people have programmed 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.370
 a lot of people want to know about the service 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:10.530
 is a differentiated service 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.900
 Why did you prefer to speak what you can? 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.150
 tell exactly what will get there will 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.550
 be a good standard service 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 international competition on flights 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.690

 hot dish options in class 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.870
 and before arrival to the flora and 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.540
 of the fauna, we're going to serve a coffee 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.950
 the warm morning in the goals pro landu part 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.510
 at another time to have around 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.549
 noon then we will serve 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.159
 first hot lunch same option 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.100
 four hot plates executive 2 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.380
 that before arriving in Orlando 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 we should arrive around 56 6 of the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.930
 Later next, we serve a second 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.760
 meal is a hot meal too 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.440
 during the flight we will have connections 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.170
 open bar in which our customers 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.380
 can serve the urge to drink the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.200
 scotch of hunger and boredom no one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.869
 will die and cries speak a little 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.239
 also what the traveling passenger 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.229
 now to this end and that it finds within 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.569
 of this aircraft 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.349
 it will find the default service of the 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.090
 that is the basket of snacks and that 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.000
 the customer can choose as many as he wants 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.310
 repeat and non-alcoholic beverages that 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.980
 we already serve are four types of 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.950
 soda water and finally it is the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.239
 standard of domestic flights service 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.780
 applied in this jet which is much larger 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.209
 because the blue decided that it is to start 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.459
 train and let's say that airplane 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.560
 within Brazil and not simply 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.170
 debut for an international flight 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.420
 this is a very common procedure before 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.849
 you start an international route 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.250
 The whole company begins by making 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.500
 short domestic newspaper with brazil is 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.450
 a big country is doing domestic 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.049
 but for example companies that have received 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.390
 to 389 a huge began to make flights 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.940
 neighboring countries 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.859
 we do this to enable us to have 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.200
 possibility of training the greater 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.480
 number of crew members who must have a 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.780
 certain minimum hours to be able to 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.890
 is familiarizing those trained in the new 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.989
 type of airplane 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.760
 in our case we opted for reef 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.829
 that the market is in great demand 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.380
 The plane is making a return trip. 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.810
 per day and this should remain so 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.430
 even after we inaugurate the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.180
 international services on 1 st 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.370
 December 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.200
 that is to say even when the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.030
 international flights will keep 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.980
 an aircraft going to reef 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.690
 let's keep a daily flight to reef 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.030
 of the many that we have here 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.250
 starting from campinas and we study 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.510
 also placing this airplane on the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.880
 for manaus 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.099
 it is so in a definitive way because it 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.989
 has an enormous carrying capacity and 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.239
 How do you know the manaus market is a 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.049
 very important market for cargo 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.239
 coral right 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.730
 talking a little, going back a little 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.319
 subject setting next year to 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.989
 blue will be with all your new 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.569
 aircraft reconfigured at last standard 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.000
 company that creates this can expect 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.040
 there when they are is once but 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.959
 reconfigured looks will be a change 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.230
 from water to wine we're going to invest 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.359
 10 million dollars per plane and let's 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.310
 completely change the interior of these 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.859
 we will start the service on 1st 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.600
 with the current setting is 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.300
 only violence 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.700
 used but we will invest 10 million 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.830
 of dollars to put the interior that the 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.290
 state of the art brand new 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.630
 new subsidiaries in all classes. 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.960
 new service of new 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.630
 entertainment with last screens 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.620
 generation in economy class and class 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.750
 businesswoman 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.550
 We're going to be armchairs in the 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.110
 beds that is a new concept in the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.540
 Brazil, the people will charge the equivalent 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.940
 the three passages and sell the space 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.250
 four armchairs is a couple can sleep 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.210
 rest your mind in four others that 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.340
 will come bed 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.300
 these and other news we start 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.500
 to operate on reconfigured aircraft 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.200
 beginning in the month of April and people 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.510
 estimates that between April of next year and 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.610
 July next year we should have the 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.950
 our seven sisters totally 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.170
 reconfigured then there will be a 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.020
 product that is capable of competing with 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.480
 best airlines in the field and the 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.370
 international flight is sure to leave 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.620
 from here the new turnaround terminal 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.540
 we are sure that yes the works 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.760
 here in Campinas they are advanced 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.700
 Actually we've operated some flights 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.120
 here where we are right 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.070
 is the terminal destroyed at the airport and 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.570
 these bugs our brothers and sisters do not 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.000
 take off from here 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.740
 mid-year next to new york 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.410
 God damn if you want from that beautiful 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.690
 Campinas terminal and Brazil is 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.940
 now getting what you speak for 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.190
 last of this transition from the old to the 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.490
 new terminal people already have four flights 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.620
 of blue five that is the common one that arrives ne 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.410
 How is this transition going? 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.360
 when it goes what you expect looks 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.420
 this is also quite common in aviation 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.270
 It's not you, you have to do it when you have it. 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.700
 who experience walking and hitting 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.630
 doing this fine chemistry in the latter 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.420
 settings 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.960
 the system fits the stars of 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.990
 baggage finally yard of bridges bridges 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.280
 nerd boat all this if you can do it 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.870
 gradually 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.090
 usually much better than 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.610
 simply wait for the entire airport 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.409
 is ready and the night could cut 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.330
 Blue is collaborating with 0 with 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.550
 brazil airports is doing the part 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.289
 and we believe that the most 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.210
 important now that we are on the line 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.229
 end is to have a little bit more 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.030
 patience 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.379
 The fact is that when the airport is 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.330
 boyfriend 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.009
 It will be a perfect wedding the best. 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.840
 brazil airport for the best
