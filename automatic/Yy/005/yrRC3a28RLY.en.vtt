us<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:56.000> think<00:00:56.030> it's<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.390> 97<00:00:57.020> STI<00:00:57.770> when<00:00:58.250> the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
us I think it's the 97 STI when the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.440 
us I think it's the 97 STI when the
first<00:00:58.520> st<00:00:58.910> isaac<00:00:59.210> coming<00:00:59.450> to<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.600> country<00:01:00.400> 22b

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
first st isaac coming to the country 22b

first st isaac coming to the country 22b
with<00:01:02.450> one<00:01:02.600> of<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.750> favorite<00:01:03.110> cars<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.560> like

with one of the favorite cars and like

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.560 
with one of the favorite cars and like
subaru<00:01:04.070> people<00:01:04.490> and<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.059> then<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.270> got<00:01:05.420> the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
subaru people and so then we got the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.380 
subaru people and so then we got the
2002<00:01:06.410> st<00:01:07.070> i<00:01:07.100> was<00:01:07.610> actually<00:01:07.759> possible<00:01:08.030> borns

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
2002 st i was actually possible borns

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.359 
2002 st i was actually possible borns
rally<00:01:08.570> car<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:08.930> 0<00:01:08.990> 2<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.259> then<00:01:09.860> dean<00:01:10.100> drove

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
rally car and 0 2 and then dean drove

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.820 
rally car and 0 2 and then dean drove
that<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:10.670> 2003<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.050> after<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.350> we've<00:01:12.560> got<00:01:12.710> the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
that in 2003 so after that we've got the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.940 
that in 2003 so after that we've got the
WIP<00:01:13.369> 10<00:01:13.670> WRX<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.630> 2005<00:01:15.350> model<00:01:15.710> which<00:01:15.830> is

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
WIP 10 WRX to 2005 model which is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.740 
WIP 10 WRX to 2005 model which is
actually<00:01:16.130> number<00:01:16.520> one<00:01:16.670> of<00:01:16.850> four<00:01:17.090> hundred<00:01:17.630> that

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
actually number one of four hundred that

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.840 
actually number one of four hundred that
were<00:01:17.840> produced<00:01:17.990> so<00:01:18.410> this<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.740> 2015<00:01:19.520> model

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
were produced so this is the 2015 model

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.999 
were produced so this is the 2015 model
WRX<00:01:20.330> we've<00:01:20.509> also<00:01:20.660> got<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:20.990> red<00:01:21.140> STI<00:01:21.560> here<00:01:21.830> too

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
WRX we've also got the red STI here too

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.410 
WRX we've also got the red STI here too
and<00:01:22.190> so<00:01:22.369> we've<00:01:22.490> been<00:01:22.580> fortunate<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.119> have<00:01:23.210> days

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
and so we've been fortunate to have days

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.820 
and so we've been fortunate to have days
we've<00:01:23.690> actually<00:01:23.810> been<00:01:23.990> able<00:01:24.110> to<00:01:24.290> drive<00:01:24.470> all<00:01:24.770> of

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
we've actually been able to drive all of

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.920 
we've actually been able to drive all of
the<00:01:25.070> cars<00:01:25.340> consecutively<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.330> you<00:01:26.690> sort<00:01:26.869> of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
the cars consecutively and you sort of

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.150 
the cars consecutively and you sort of

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
all-wheel drive i'll probably didn't

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.710 
all-wheel drive i'll probably didn't
realize<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.250> too<00:01:37.340> much<00:01:37.460> at<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.670> time<00:01:37.819> but<00:01:37.880> to

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
realize it too much at the time but to

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.749 
realize it too much at the time but to
have<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.899> car<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.200> was<00:01:39.500> fundamentally<00:01:40.280> well

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
have a car that was fundamentally well

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.279 
have a car that was fundamentally well
balanced<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.420> start<00:01:41.660> with<00:01:41.810> before<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.110> even

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
balanced to start with before you even

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.169 
balanced to start with before you even
built<00:01:42.590> into<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.860> rally<00:01:43.069> car<00:01:43.160> meant<00:01:43.910> that<00:01:44.060> it's

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
built into a rally car meant that it's

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
going to have performance advantages

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.650 
going to have performance advantages
over<00:01:46.429> other<00:01:46.459> models<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.000> i<00:01:47.060> think<00:01:47.270> that's<00:01:47.420> you

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
over other models and i think that's you

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.029 
over other models and i think that's you

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
shafts and things like that all lives

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.059 
shafts and things like that all lives
today<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.470> brand-new<00:02:04.800> cast

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.380 

the<00:02:09.069> new<00:02:09.220> cars<00:02:09.489> are<00:02:09.610> just<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:09.880> great<00:02:10.149> they<00:02:10.330> do

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
the new cars are just so great they do

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.210 
the new cars are just so great they do
everything<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.110> well<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.650> refinement<00:02:12.160> in

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
everything so well on the refinement in

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.710 
everything so well on the refinement in
those<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.400> mean<00:02:12.640> if<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.819> were<00:02:12.910> trying<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.150> set<00:02:13.690> a

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
those I mean if you were trying to set a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.510 
those I mean if you were trying to set a
pretty<00:02:13.900> good<00:02:14.140> time<00:02:14.410> both<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.370> probably

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
pretty good time both of it we probably

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.070 
pretty good time both of it we probably
jump<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.000> new<00:02:16.120> one<00:02:16.270> because<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:16.810> got<00:02:16.959> all

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
jump in the new one because it's got all

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.660 
jump in the new one because it's got all
the<00:02:17.319> great<00:02:17.650> things<00:02:17.890> are<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> older<00:02:18.280> car<00:02:18.459> just

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the great things are the older car just

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.880 
the great things are the older car just
in<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.880> new<00:02:19.000> package<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.319> my<00:02:20.470> what<00:02:20.830> we

this is the safest Subaru that's ever
been<00:02:44.799> built<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.549> also<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.390> best<00:02:46.720> driving

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
been built it is also the best driving

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.110 
been built it is also the best driving
it's<00:02:47.560> fun<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.069> drive<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.459> puts<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.790> smile<00:02:49.090> on

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
it's fun to drive it puts a smile on

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.259 
it's fun to drive it puts a smile on
your<00:02:50.019> face<00:02:50.310> part<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.400> our<00:02:51.519> role<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.970> actually

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
your face part of our role is actually

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.940 
your face part of our role is actually
do<00:02:52.390> evaluation<00:02:52.989> drive<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.530> spend<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:53.799> bit<00:02:53.920> of

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
do evaluation drive so we spend a bit of

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.039 
do evaluation drive so we spend a bit of
time<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.190> Japanese<00:02:54.790> engineers<00:02:55.299> basically

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
time with Japanese engineers basically

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.509 
time with Japanese engineers basically
we<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.290> then<00:02:56.410> tune<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.799> car<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.160> Australian

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
we can then tune the car for Australian

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.400 
we can then tune the car for Australian
conditions<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.060> in<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.690> past<00:02:58.840> even<00:02:59.140> down<00:02:59.380> to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
conditions so in the past even down to

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.350 
conditions so in the past even down to
the<00:02:59.560> point<00:02:59.739> we've<00:02:59.890> done<00:03:00.040> some<00:03:00.190> ABS<00:03:00.519> tune<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
the point we've done some ABS tune to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.640 
the point we've done some ABS tune to
get<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.569> cattle<00:03:01.750> work<00:03:01.930> properly<00:03:02.200> on<00:03:02.319> gravel

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
get the cattle work properly on gravel

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.039 
get the cattle work properly on gravel
roads<00:03:02.680> in<00:03:03.010> Australia<00:03:03.400> yeah<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.060> VDC<00:03:04.360> systems

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
roads in Australia yeah the VDC systems

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.600 
roads in Australia yeah the VDC systems
are<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.200> vehicle<00:03:05.500> dynamics<00:03:05.860> control<00:03:06.190> systems

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
are the vehicle dynamics control systems

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.440 
are the vehicle dynamics control systems
the<00:03:06.730> suspension<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.420> all<00:03:07.780> refined<00:03:08.140> for<00:03:08.410> arrows

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.729 

few<00:03:15.450> changes<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.020> bonnet<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.500> bonnet

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
few changes to the bonnet so the bonnet

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.229 
few changes to the bonnet so the bonnet
now<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:16.920> bionic<00:03:17.580> scoop<00:03:17.819> has<00:03:17.940> been<00:03:18.090> moved

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
now the bionic scoop has been moved

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.000 
now the bionic scoop has been moved
forward<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.720> fair<00:03:18.900> way<00:03:19.050> now<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:19.739> obviously

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
forward a fair way now but obviously

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.470 
forward a fair way now but obviously
there's<00:03:20.520> really<00:03:20.640> good<00:03:20.730> airflow<00:03:21.000> there<00:03:21.360> which

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
there's really good airflow there which

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.760 
there's really good airflow there which
gets<00:03:21.870> through<00:03:22.080> onto<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.410> top<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
gets through onto the top of the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.470 
gets through onto the top of the
intercooler<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:23.340> obviously<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.209> really

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
intercooler and obviously it's really

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.699 
intercooler and obviously it's really
important<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.810> cool<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.230> down<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.530> much<00:03:25.620> as

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
important to cool that down as much as

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.220 
important to cool that down as much as
you<00:03:25.860> possibly<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> new<00:03:27.989> type<00:03:28.200> of

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
you possibly can this is a new type of

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.900 
you possibly can this is a new type of
engine<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.650> original<00:03:28.980> engine<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> WX<00:03:29.819> is

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
engine the original engine in the WX is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.430 
engine the original engine in the WX is
two<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.239> half<00:03:30.390> litre<00:03:30.599> turbo<00:03:30.959> now<00:03:31.170> it's<00:03:31.380> a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
two and a half litre turbo now it's a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.140 
two and a half litre turbo now it's a
two<00:03:31.620> liter<00:03:31.800> direct<00:03:32.220> injection<00:03:32.489> turbo<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.000> it's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
two liter direct injection turbo so it's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.190 
two liter direct injection turbo so it's
a<00:03:33.180> lot<00:03:33.269> more<00:03:33.330> efficient<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:33.930> actually<00:03:34.140> about

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
a lot more efficient it's actually about

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.170 
a lot more efficient it's actually about
eleven<00:03:34.590> percent<00:03:34.800> more<00:03:35.040> fuel<00:03:35.280> efficient<00:03:35.640> but

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
eleven percent more fuel efficient but

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.580 
eleven percent more fuel efficient but
very<00:03:36.420> similar<00:03:36.690> to<00:03:36.720> power<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.260> previous

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
very similar to power to the previous

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.460 
very similar to power to the previous
model<00:03:37.830> it's<00:03:37.950> 197<00:03:38.910> kilowatts<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.390> 350<00:03:40.260> newton

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
model it's 197 kilowatts and 350 newton

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.920 
model it's 197 kilowatts and 350 newton
meters<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.709> torque<00:03:40.970> nought<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.000> 100<00:03:42.180> times<00:03:42.569> are

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
meters of torque nought to 100 times are

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.479 
meters of torque nought to 100 times are
similar<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.709> previous<00:03:43.860> model<00:03:44.190> around

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
similar to the previous model around

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.970 
similar to the previous model around
five<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.150> half<00:03:45.180> 5.4<00:03:46.019> seconds<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:46.560> but

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
five and a half 5.4 seconds I think but

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.140 
five and a half 5.4 seconds I think but
the<00:03:47.040> thing<00:03:47.069> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.370> that's<00:03:47.580> changed<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:48.030> this

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
the thing I think that's changed in this

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.330 
the thing I think that's changed in this
model<00:03:48.390> now<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.900> chassis<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
model now is this chassis and so the the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.830 
model now is this chassis and so the the
rear<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.700> car<00:03:50.880> has<00:03:51.030> more<00:03:51.060> grip<00:03:51.450> now<00:03:51.600> and

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
rear of the car has more grip now and

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.140 
rear of the car has more grip now and
dynamically<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.799> car<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.220> improved<00:03:54.000> from

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
dynamically this car is improved from

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.699 
dynamically this car is improved from
the<00:03:54.209> previous<00:03:54.269> model<00:03:54.690> sharper<00:03:55.140> responds<00:03:55.500> more

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
the previous model sharper responds more

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.160 
the previous model sharper responds more
grim<00:03:55.980> more<00:03:56.250> lateral<00:03:56.610> G<00:03:56.790> Force<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.019> sort

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
grim more lateral G Force and that sort

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.240 
grim more lateral G Force and that sort
of<00:03:58.200> thing

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.010 

so<00:04:06.250> this<00:04:06.520> model<00:04:06.850> here<00:04:07.000> they've<00:04:07.330> built<00:04:07.600> from

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
so this model here they've built from

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.590 
so this model here they've built from
the<00:04:08.110> ground<00:04:08.200> up<00:04:08.560> for<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.860> track<00:04:09.600> particularly

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
the ground up for the track particularly

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.540 
the ground up for the track particularly
