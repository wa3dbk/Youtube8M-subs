00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello 3d games we continue with the e3 2015 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.250
 We have been in electronic with 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 alexander pascual alex good guardéis 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.439
 speed mother mia new new reset 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.759
 the franchise is that every time 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.099
 dismissal more or less can become 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.050
 until a restart because there are enough 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.489
 differences between some about 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.169
 all for the certain stages that has 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.730
 passed the franchise yes yes yes 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.619
 certainly in the case country that is that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.930
 really liked the last work the cost 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.250
 game rivals came that everyone is 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.720
 of agreement but I will always defend 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.330
 up speed I know it sounds a bit 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:47.310
 strange this is your thing 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:50.540
 I did not think about it but then yes it is 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.510
 true that he has things that the subject of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.280
 the hormones and spend it implying for 8 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.230
 well you are multiplying as you have to 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.149
 save the next ones you lose act goes 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.589
 keeping the quilombo until the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.420
 back because nothing can be compared in 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.330
 something for ramón 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.580
 in a perhaps in the gameplay in the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.560
 aspect of braking and here I have 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.729
 done this is like a and forspeed that has 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.700
 tried to be like a kind of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.119
 tribute to the whole saga because it takes 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.350
 all of everything of all and one of those of the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.960
 points in the adjustment of the car is that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.850
 we can choose a braking system more 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.250
 rival type because he has explained it to us 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.860
 so it would be more like drift or a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.869
 braking drier than would pick up the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.270
 essence of what were the underground or 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.420
 the first most wanted because it's cool 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.679
 peace question I do not know if you saw it in the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.960
 electronic arts conference 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.119
 but when the car braked it was like 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 that the camera went crazy if it went down 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.929
 suddenly a lot was going to one side 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 to make a system as very 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.530
 spectacular but that maybe it was not 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 so it works playable since this is so 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.369
 annoys more 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.080
 It does not bother me because I was not here and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.820
 I was wondering why this type of 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.590
 Cava has said good this kind of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.890
 camera has made it a bit special for 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.240
 this video so when you give the 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.000
 square that would be like the brake grace 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.069
 mandril so the more you leave 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 pushed the button rampant the 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.140
 camera is doing that down every time 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 stronger and that seems for the least 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.560
 playable but if you do a braking 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.250
 normal or just give it a moment 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.840
 there is not that mother of angular of a 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.340
 place accused that is that from the bottom 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.110
 can be a bit against and 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.519
 the fact is that I suppose it will be 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.470
 a big map not where you're doing 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.870
 your missions two races and such in leather 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.250
 hard watch I have not seen a map so 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.580
 big as what for example could 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.500
 it seemed like rail valls but it did have 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.720
 like all those structured missions 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.519
 that you stop at a traffic light or something 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.200
 but what about in certain events in 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.959
 the ones you give to read e 1 and the active 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.120
 however, we have a menu again 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.500
 let's say in conditions and a more menu 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.819
 traditional that I 'm something that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.650
 they love car games and I do not know why 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.730
 what did they have a stage in which all 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.230
 ccoo eyes have to invent 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.730
 foolishness in the menu that we took 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.450
 a lot to start playing what you 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.250
 you wanted 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.010
 a little bit of a stop is at the time 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.849
 for that it's true then this is very 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.099
 good 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.959
 but I did not like all this easy 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.760
 drive that was invented criteria without and 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.260
 now that we talk about person criteria 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.849
 how is this parenthesis but has been the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.300
 great absence good now there will be the great 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.300
 absence of at least the competition if 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.550
 you're aware something on the strings, not what 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.170
 they are very quiet and like this really 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.690
 of the game and it has nothing to do with 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.069
 criteria 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.900
 me for spirit and us with the game 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.400
 this lake but what I call him yes yes 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.750
 yes that's why I put you in parenthesis and I 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.280
 I would like the truth, well let's go back to 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.940
 need for speed 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.610
 city ​​than such a night city what 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.190
 we have seen but it does not mean that it is 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.870
 a all the circuits and all these 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.329
 yes races that are urban us 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.680
 we move away from those more alpine circuits 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.630
 I also like them a lot with these forests 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.519
 he accepted buoys that were in ray walser 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.069
 impressive his assignees here is going to 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.530
 be the most underground city much 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.019
 tuning but although we have seen only 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.850
 night circuits we will have a cycle 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.920
 day and night and the game will have that 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.870
 variety 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.970
 and some detail that you have stayed like this 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.940
 concrete of this title of this new 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.290
 review will focus a lot on the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.680
 narrative also personalization 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.680
 every 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.650
 wonder 

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:39.059
 and now to be or not to be resentful 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.109
 well then if you have seen the video 

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:42.869
 of the electronic conference and 

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:45.569
 you will have seen that there was a video 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:47.339
 engraved with efe mv real image and of 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.199
 there was suddenly a transition like 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.479
 that moment the sounds and you remember in 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.029
 the microsoft conference and camera that 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.669
 changed from cg to water motor then 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:58.019
 time wonder then here yes yes yes 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.599
 here what they do is change their image 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:01.529
 real with the transition that is that is 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:06.059
 perfect 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:11.009
 just one and if they told us that they did not 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:12.119
 I noticed the car and we are inside the 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.699
 game 

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:19.289
 this is great graphically something else 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.939
 important because the teaser I think that 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.219
 Let 's jaw - dropping them 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.229
 presented and the title is still very 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.459
 good looking but what did you think of a 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.689
 Once you've put yourself in the controls and it's 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.819
 that then put at the controls too 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.829
 it's also that in car games 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.419
 you do not have time to appreciate because you're going to 

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:35.009
 those speeds also put a lot 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.129
 blur filter 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:40.529
 and blur and you can not appreciate that much 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.449
 the graphics but I was more surprised at 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.029
 the conference that playing is also 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.849
 true that clear the night scene and 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:50.189
 this kind of thing does not lead to 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.839
 appreciate both the details and when 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:52.710
 there is one more daylighting then 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.809
 we still have to give a couple of 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.569
 returns but at the moment although yes that 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:59.550
 has a realism that as we have said 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.309
 even merges those images 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.289
 real with the game at the moment has not 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.809
 seemed like the game with the best 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.309
 graphics of the fair well then of 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:09.599
 moment we are going to stay here if not 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:11.909
 you have nothing more to add sir 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.559
 now rowan and we will continue to pay attention to 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.930
 everything that happens with need for speed 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:17.490
 and see what awaits us for this title 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.789
 that we're going to play in the end is annie 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.009
 true the former actor good so I'll see you 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.479
 the e3 continues here in 3d games in the 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.129
 youtube channel you already know your 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.039
 always available and see you in 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:32.629
 3dgames paschal friend we are dealing with 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.629
 the people lived until then to jobs ko
