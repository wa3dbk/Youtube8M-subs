okay<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.380> one's<00:00:01.620> where<00:00:01.800> things<00:00:02.040> start

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
okay this one's where things start

okay this one's where things start
getting<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.610> little<00:00:02.700> interesting<00:00:03.410> this<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
getting a little interesting this is a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.860 
getting a little interesting this is a
prime<00:00:05.040> example<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.819> level<00:00:06.150> where<00:00:06.359> speed<00:00:06.660> is

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
prime example of a level where speed is

can<00:00:32.969> probably<00:00:33.180> guess<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:34.380> 90%<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> pain

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
can probably guess but 90% of the pain

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
can probably guess but 90% of the pain
came<00:00:35.760> from<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> very<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.480> section<00:00:37.070> busy

glow<00:00:38.280> stage<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.940> probably<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> best<00:00:39.960> example

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
glow stage is probably the best example

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.950 
glow stage is probably the best example
so<00:00:40.739> far<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.190> detailed<00:00:41.760> path<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.390> spent<00:00:42.780> for

so far of a detailed path a spent for
this<00:00:43.079> challenge<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:44.120> probably<00:00:45.120> don't<00:00:45.270> even

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
this challenge I probably don't even

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
this challenge I probably don't even
need<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> point<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:46.110> which<00:00:46.320> individual<00:00:47.039> jumps

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
need to point out which individual jumps

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.709 
need to point out which individual jumps
and<00:00:47.579> trots<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:48.030> planned<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.570> it's

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and trots are planned because it's

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.299 
and trots are planned because it's
pretty<00:00:48.899> evident<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.469> watching<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.070> that

pretty evident just watching this that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.130 
pretty evident just watching this that
they<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.000> there's<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
they all are and there's not really a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
they all are and there's not really a

enemies<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> biggest<00:00:55.620> offenders<00:00:56.219> here

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
enemies are the biggest offenders here

enemies are the biggest offenders here
because<00:00:57.270> extreme<00:00:57.750> mode<00:00:58.170> places<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:58.890> in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
because extreme mode places them in

because extreme mode places them in
positions<00:00:59.460> where<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.820> either<00:01:00.090> take<00:01:00.390> way<00:01:00.690> too

one<00:02:20.250> thing<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.580> do<00:02:20.640> love<00:02:20.910> about<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.390> stage<00:02:21.630> is

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
one thing I do love about this stage is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.040 
one thing I do love about this stage is
how<00:02:22.020> completely<00:02:22.620> methodical<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.459> thing<00:02:23.640> is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
how completely methodical the thing is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.780 
how completely methodical the thing is
there's<00:02:25.050> basically<00:02:25.770> nothing<00:02:26.070> here<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.610> gave

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
there's basically nothing here that gave

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.730 
there's basically nothing here that gave
me<00:02:26.910> any<00:02:27.030> real<00:02:27.420> trouble<00:02:27.750> during<00:02:28.050> my<00:02:28.320> attempts

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
me any real trouble during my attempts

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.820 
me any real trouble during my attempts
at<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.950> segment<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:31.110> entire<00:02:31.440> process

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
at the segment and the entire process

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.890 
at the segment and the entire process
pretty<00:02:32.430> much<00:02:32.670> boils<00:02:32.880> down<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.300> playing<00:02:33.750> around

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
pretty much boils down to playing around

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.440 
pretty much boils down to playing around
with<00:02:34.260> shortcuts<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.100> trying<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.970> find<00:02:36.209> ways

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
with shortcuts and trying to find ways

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.420 
with shortcuts and trying to find ways
to<00:02:36.720> use<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.110> charge<00:02:37.380> Buster<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> X's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.820 
to use the charge Buster the X's
advantage<00:02:38.940> which<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.600> something<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.770> don't

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
advantage which is something you don't

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.800 
advantage which is something you don't
really<00:02:41.370> associate<00:02:41.820> with<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.390> weapon<00:02:42.660> too

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
first part this isn't something I could

first part this isn't something I could
do<00:03:01.410> much<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.860> actively<00:03:02.310> improve<00:03:02.820> outside<00:03:03.269> of

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
probably also noticed by now that this

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.900 
probably also noticed by now that this
guy's<00:03:59.870> level<00:04:00.319> is<00:04:00.440> completely<00:04:01.069> hopped<00:04:01.430> up<00:04:01.670> from

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
guy's level is completely hopped up from

guy's level is completely hopped up from
the<00:04:02.000> last<00:04:02.180> boss<00:04:02.510> up<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:04.880> way<00:04:05.000> that<00:04:05.209> works

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
the last boss up the way that works

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.330 
the last boss up the way that works
isn't<00:04:05.660> really<00:04:05.930> as<00:04:06.049> complicated<00:04:06.470> as<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:06.950> said<00:04:07.220> it

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
isn't really as complicated as I said it

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.240 
isn't really as complicated as I said it
was<00:04:07.989> every<00:04:08.989> time<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.290> defeat<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> boss<00:04:09.860> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
was every time you defeat a boss the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.400 
was every time you defeat a boss the
level<00:04:10.519> of<00:04:10.640> boost<00:04:10.849> by<00:04:11.090> two<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.930> lose<00:04:12.110> an<00:04:12.260> hour

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
level of boost by two you lose an hour

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.500 
level of boost by two you lose an hour
to<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.769> timer<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.310> boost<00:04:13.580> by<00:04:13.940> two<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.480> you

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
to the timer and boost by two and you

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.440 
to the timer and boost by two and you
gain<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.319> rank<00:04:15.709> and<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.280> loses<00:04:16.459> by<00:04:16.790> two<00:04:16.850> those

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
gain a rank and it loses by two those

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.909 
gain a rank and it loses by two those
are<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.660> only<00:04:17.810> three<00:04:18.079> things<00:04:18.380> that<00:04:18.530> really

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
are the only three things that really

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.180 
are the only three things that really
work<00:04:19.220> into<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.579> um<00:04:20.139> it's<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.260> little<00:04:21.410> finicky

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
work into it um it's a little finicky

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.520 
work into it um it's a little finicky
when<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.210> Sigma<00:04:23.570> stage<00:04:23.750> has<00:04:23.930> come<00:04:24.110> up<00:04:24.260> because

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
when the Sigma stage has come up because

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.260 
when the Sigma stage has come up because
you<00:04:24.620> can<00:04:24.770> obviously<00:04:25.070> have<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.370> variable<00:04:25.880> amount

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
you can obviously have a variable amount

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.390 
you can obviously have a variable amount
of<00:04:26.360> hours<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:27.020> have<00:04:27.500> passed<00:04:27.770> before<00:04:28.039> you

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
of hours that have passed before you

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.000 
of hours that have passed before you
completely<00:04:29.000> stop<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.390> timer<00:04:30.010> that's

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
completely stop the timer that's

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.529 
completely stop the timer that's
something<00:04:31.430> that<00:04:31.550> will<00:04:31.669> drop<00:04:32.000> up<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.300> little

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
something that will drop up a little

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.370 
something that will drop up a little
later<00:04:32.780> though<00:04:33.050> up<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:35.000> wraps<00:04:35.300> up<00:04:35.600> is<00:04:36.020> Glo

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
later though up that wraps up is Glo

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.170 
later though up that wraps up is Glo
stays<00:04:36.710> next<00:04:37.160> up<00:04:37.310> is<00:04:37.460> done<00:04:37.610> stock<00:04:37.820> wheeling

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
stays next up is done stock wheeling

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.570 
stays next up is done stock wheeling
which<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:39.500> can't<00:04:39.770> do<00:04:39.890> a<00:04:39.919> bloody<00:04:40.250> thing

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
which I really can't do a bloody thing

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.180 
which I really can't do a bloody thing
to<00:04:40.880> speed<00:04:41.840> up<00:04:41.990> so<00:04:42.260> that'll<00:04:42.560> be<00:04:42.680> ten<00:04:43.010> minutes

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
to speed up so that'll be ten minutes

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.660 
to speed up so that'll be ten minutes
emptiness<00:04:43.729> hope<00:04:43.940> you<00:04:44.030> look<00:04:44.120> forward<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.510> it
