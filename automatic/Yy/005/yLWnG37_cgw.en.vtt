00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.019
 the chicken lee helen dishes of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.179
 the easiest ceremonies to prepare 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.050
 I must say that we can garnish the chicken 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:27.300
 shield with all kinds of vegetables 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.179
 candied ie sweet or just 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.090
 acidulated we will prepare today the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.100
 candied chicken with pumpkin 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.820
 blacks as it's called then we're going 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 need 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.410
 of course chicken and composition 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 tracks for folded you will see 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.940
 it's very simple it's not complicated there 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.400
 I normally take one can put 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.380
 a whole chicken or a slice cut them 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.210
 in four I like the thighs of 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.670
 chicken take that chicken legs 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.220
 it gives me a gelatin side with sauce 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.250
 is well Saturday a sauce well in 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.660
 dig and then also I prefer them 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.040
 chicken legs because it supports 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.109
 better cooking is not like the 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.689
 white white it is very dry 

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:07.770
 so fast but good as I said I 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.149
 put the chicken legs you can 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.090
 very well put a whole chicken 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:16.020
 so I take the chicken legs I 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.280
 will scent them and spices and with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 firefighters spices 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.200
 and I add a little water 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.600
 I can let them marinate like that 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.490
 in this preparation for half a 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.110
 time but if we do not have the time to 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.760
 to marinate one can very well 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.280
 leathers right after putting them directly 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.840
 in the stewpot and cook them with the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.420
 spices I will first put oil 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.630
 the equivalent of 4 tablespoons 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.630
 of oil 1 minced onion 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.340
 a very small size squeezed foam 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.560
 2 tracks for you still read a small 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.560
 little with onions 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.720
 okay 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.510
 once the marinated chicken legs 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.890
 for about 15 minutes to 30 minutes 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.250
 depending on the time you have is the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:54.150
 recovers with their marinade and we 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.150
 place with onion 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.910
 the marinade I want to add a little 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.980
 bouquet of herbs aulas I put a little bit of 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.810
 coriander 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.400
 I'm going to withdraw just now I'm going 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.800
 put salt like that we go to the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.240
 second step which is the preparation of 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.680
 the pumpkin we are going to go very little 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.810
 because the sauce will be very short and 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.080
 we will go to the second step to 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.480
 prepare the pumpkin we will see well 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.840
 obviously need pumpkin is the 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:45.190
 peel seed and cut into pieces 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:49.180
 we will steam it to help it 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.870
 to disgorge I'm going to sprinkle it with a 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.860
 little bit of salt 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.460
 it's important to rooms and 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.720
 vegetable jams 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.130
 do you know the door anyway 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.130
 a taste balance 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.830
 and I cook about 25 to 30 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.820
 minutes the time that the pumpkin 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:19.220
 are well cooked and well melted 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:25.490
 once cooked I get the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.090
 pumpkin and I pour it into a 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.980
 stove 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.980
 I will add oil 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:44.180
 all this must be crushed or have 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:48.289
 a nice pumpkin jam 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.289
 so for sluc rank 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.140
 I sprinkle with semolina sugar 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.000
 see that she will still bleed 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:09.150
 so the idea is trust on 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.150
 sweet fire cinnamon waffle 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.530
 orange blossom water 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.569
 and mastic 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:38.259
 and we will continue cooking while stirring 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:40.749
 quietly and you will see the 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.659
 texture in a little moment of the 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:46.769
 pumpkin jam that we're going 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:50.169
 see after half an hour of cooking 

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:52.569
 you can look at the texture of the 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.439
 jam it is beautiful and there a 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.959
 straight color 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.789
 we left it confirmed between half 

00:05:55.959 --> 00:06:00.039
 hour at three quarters of an hour on a low heat 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:08.069
 as I explained now for the 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:11.679
 sauce and chicken rice here is the result 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:14.050
 of the problem nor is it a sauce very very 

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:14.679
 reduced really very short and for the 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.619
 decoration 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:20.050
 I'll take I took rather 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:21.429
 nuts that I baked and then I 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.759
 get rid of their little 

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:26.259
 very thin film we will have the 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.999
 chicken legs and then we go them 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.999
 garnish with pumpkin jam 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.580
 I presented you one of the versions 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:54.949
 chicken league harness with a 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.180
 sweet topping that was the 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.580
 candied pumpkin 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.580
 you can see the other version of the pole 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.500
 and acidulated that is to say garnished with 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:07.569
 candied lemon and red olives 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.569
 always on tb choumicha good attitude
