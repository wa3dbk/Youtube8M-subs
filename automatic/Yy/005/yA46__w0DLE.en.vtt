00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
about about the connection and how it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.690 
about about the connection and how it
can<00:01:06.540> cause<00:01:06.810> oral<00:01:07.740> cancer<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> serious

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
can cause oral cancer it's a serious

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
can cause oral cancer it's a serious
thing<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.259> caught<00:01:10.740> early

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
thing and if it is not caught early

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.350 
thing and if it is not caught early
it<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:12.000> kill<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> dentist<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:15.240> an

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it can kill you so the dentist can do an

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.710 
it can kill you so the dentist can do an
oral<00:01:15.600> cancer<00:01:15.960> exam<00:01:16.290> we're<00:01:16.830> trained<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
oral cancer exam we're trained to do it

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.910 
oral cancer exam we're trained to do it
unfortunately<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
unfortunately I don't think it is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
unfortunately I don't think it is
possible<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.730> a<00:01:20.790> complete<00:01:21.150> oral<00:01:21.480> cancer

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
possible to get a complete oral cancer

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.440 
possible to get a complete oral cancer
exam<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> dental<00:01:22.740> office<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
exam at the dental office I think the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.260 
exam at the dental office I think the
better<00:01:24.600> exam<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:26.040> you're<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
better exam if you're if you're a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.700 
better exam if you're if you're a
patient<00:01:27.690> that<00:01:27.840> needs<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.650> done

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
patient that needs to have this done

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.280 
patient that needs to have this done
would<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> ENT<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.690> ear<00:01:30.870> nose<00:01:31.080> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
would be at the ENT the ear nose and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
would be at the ENT the ear nose and
throat<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:32.220> would<00:01:32.400> basically<00:01:32.580> get<00:01:33.060> your

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
throat they would basically get your

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.930 
throat they would basically get your
nose<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:33.960> throat<00:01:34.260> numb<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.890> send<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.580> camera

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
nose or throat numb and send a camera

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.760 
nose or throat numb and send a camera
down<00:01:36.060> there<00:01:36.120> and<00:01:36.570> take<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.200> really<00:01:37.620> good

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
down there and take a really really good

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.930 
down there and take a really really good
look<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.370> where<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.760> this

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
look because that's where a lot of this

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.480 
look because that's where a lot of this
cancer<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.690> found<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> base<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.430> the

that can get cancer and I can't see that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.740 
that can get cancer and I can't see that
as<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> dentist<00:01:50.190> so<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.570> false

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
as a dentist so I think it's a false

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.109 
as a dentist so I think it's a false
sense<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.140> security<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.670> think<00:01:53.970> your

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
sense of security that you think your

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.730 
sense of security that you think your
dentist<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.600> giving<00:01:54.930> an<00:01:54.990> oral<00:01:55.140> cancer<00:01:55.500> exam

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
dentist is giving an oral cancer exam

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
think needs to be routine and that is a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.679 
think needs to be routine and that is a
test<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.399> order<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.119> your<00:02:09.390> dentist

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
into it and spit into a test tube and it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.210 
into it and spit into a test tube and it
gets<00:02:17.310> sent<00:02:17.520> off<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> blood

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
gets sent off and that is a like a blood

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.150 
gets sent off and that is a like a blood
test<00:02:20.430> essentially<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.569> looking

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
test essentially it's a looking

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.070 
test essentially it's a looking
for<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> marker<00:02:22.700> for<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:23.120> cancer<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:24.050> think

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
for a marker for this cancer and I think

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.060 
for a marker for this cancer and I think
that's<00:02:24.380> something<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.890> should

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
that's something that you should

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.580 
that's something that you should
consider<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.970> if<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.660> think<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.170> you've<00:02:27.290> had

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
consider so if you think that you've had

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.230 
consider so if you think that you've had
and<00:02:27.980> again<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.520> line<00:02:28.760> drawn<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.090> the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
and again this is a line drawn on the

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.230 
and again this is a line drawn on the
sand<00:02:29.480> by<00:02:29.660> some<00:02:30.410> Harvard<00:02:30.800> researchers<00:02:31.370> if<00:02:31.880> you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240
