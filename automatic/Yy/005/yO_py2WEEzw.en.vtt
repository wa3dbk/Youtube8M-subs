00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.270 
just figure because the little the hover
over<00:01:50.880> shows<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.750> Windows<00:01:52.229> 10<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:53.100> like

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
immediately back away from their

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.859 
immediately back away from their
computer<00:01:55.439> figuring<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.329> malicious

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
computer figuring that this is malicious
