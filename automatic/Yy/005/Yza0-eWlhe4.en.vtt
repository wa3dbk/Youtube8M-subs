00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
or the bathroom so this is just the one

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.310 
or the bathroom so this is just the one
place<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.970> head<00:00:24.150> where<00:00:24.840> there's<00:00:25.050> almost

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
place in the head where there's almost

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
place in the head where there's almost
enough<00:00:25.650> light<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.689> it's

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
enough light to do this by but it's

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.380 
enough light to do this by but it's
quite<00:00:28.050> difficult<00:00:28.609> see<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> best<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
quite difficult see this is the best I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.420 
quite difficult see this is the best I
can<00:00:30.539> do<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> exposure<00:00:31.470> put<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
can do with the exposure put right the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.330 
can do with the exposure put right the
way<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> light<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.079> my<00:00:34.290> room<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:35.190> not
