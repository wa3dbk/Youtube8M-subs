00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.319 
look at this texture on the skin even
though<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.380> can't<00:01:43.890> zoom<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.610> much<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
though you can't zoom in as much you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.710 
though you can't zoom in as much you
could<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:47.149> know<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.570> all

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
could see it you know you can see all

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.719 
could see it you know you can see all
the<00:01:48.840> detail<00:01:49.259> thing<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.799> usually<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.610> could

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the detail thing is usually you could

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
the detail thing is usually you could
zoom<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.420> right<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
zoom in a lot right for this one you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
zoom in a lot right for this one you
can't<00:01:53.310> zoom<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> much<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.570> is
