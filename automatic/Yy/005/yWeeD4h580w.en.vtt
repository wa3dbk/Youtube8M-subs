fact<00:04:23.830> launch

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
fact launch

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.020

very<00:04:26.340> large<00:04:27.080> missiles<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.320> Elenin<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.880> lot

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
very large missiles and Elenin and a lot

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.720 
very large missiles and Elenin and a lot
of<00:04:30.060> people<00:04:30.360> don't<00:04:30.450> know<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.840> either

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
of people don't know that either

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.120 
of people don't know that either
and<00:04:32.730> then<00:04:32.850> they<00:04:32.970> did<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:33.480> I<00:04:33.780> knew<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.710> broke<00:04:34.920> up

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
and then they did but I knew it broke up

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.530 
and then they did but I knew it broke up
that's<00:04:35.340> all<00:04:35.520> they<00:04:35.700> were<00:04:35.760> saying<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.510> know

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
that's all they were saying you know

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.870 
that's all they were saying you know
that<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.140> had<00:04:37.350> broken<00:04:37.650> apart<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:41.550> it's<00:04:41.700> yeah

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
that it had broken apart but it's yeah

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.390 
that it had broken apart but it's yeah
oh<00:04:41.910> yeah<00:04:42.270> vo<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.720> I<00:04:43.020> guess<00:04:43.830> it's<00:04:44.040> what<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.370> it

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
oh yeah vo it I guess it's what is it

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.920 
oh yeah vo it I guess it's what is it
now<00:04:44.640> just<00:04:44.850> a<00:04:45.000> debris<00:04:45.390> field<00:04:47.270> yes<00:04:48.270> because<00:04:48.540> it's

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
now just a debris field yes because it's

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.920 
now just a debris field yes because it's
and<00:04:49.410> then<00:04:49.620> again<00:04:49.890> you<00:04:50.510> that's<00:04:51.510> right<00:04:51.720> because

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
and then again you that's right because

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.190 
and then again you that's right because
they're<00:04:52.200> still<00:04:52.380> trapped<00:04:52.830> in<00:04:53.220> our<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:54.720> our

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
they're still trapped in our in our

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.350 
they're still trapped in our in our
solar<00:04:55.560> system's<00:04:56.040> pool<00:04:56.550> because<00:04:57.090> when<00:04:57.270> you

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
solar system's pool because when you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.470 
solar system's pool because when you
break<00:04:57.540> an<00:04:57.690> object<00:04:58.110> up<00:04:58.640> although<00:04:59.640> scientists

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
break an object up although scientists

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.420 
break an object up although scientists
will<00:05:00.570> say<00:05:00.720> if<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:00.990> loses<00:05:01.140> mass<00:05:01.650> it<00:05:01.980> also<00:05:02.100> loses

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
will say if it loses mass it also loses

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.810 
will say if it loses mass it also loses
its<00:05:02.730> its<00:05:03.030> pool<00:05:03.470> but<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:05.040> never<00:05:05.340> made<00:05:05.430> it<00:05:05.610> out

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
its its pool but it never made it out

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.080 
its its pool but it never made it out
far<00:05:06.210> enough<00:05:06.360> to<00:05:06.750> escape
