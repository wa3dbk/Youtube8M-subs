I feel feels pretty good so that's a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.750 
I feel feels pretty good so that's a
good<00:03:02.459> piece<00:03:02.670> I'm<00:03:02.910> gonna<00:03:03.090> leave<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.390> out

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
good piece I'm gonna leave it out

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.270 
good piece I'm gonna leave it out
because<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.650> am<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.829> be<00:03:07.890> cleaning<00:03:08.130> this

solvent<00:03:18.600> truly<00:03:18.900> inside<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.320> motor<00:03:20.000> I'm<00:03:21.000> just

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
solvent truly inside the motor I'm just

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.220 
solvent truly inside the motor I'm just
checking<00:03:21.360> all<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> other<00:03:21.780> parents<00:03:22.140> which

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
checking all the other parents which

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.930 
checking all the other parents which
I've<00:03:22.350> already<00:03:22.470> done<00:03:22.590> most<00:03:22.950> of<00:03:23.130> them<00:03:23.250> now<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
I've already done most of them now the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.880 
I've already done most of them now the
other<00:03:24.120> barons<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.510> need<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> replaced<00:03:25.049> and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
other barons that need to replaced and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.600 
other barons that need to replaced and
that<00:03:25.920> one's<00:03:26.190> good<00:03:27.410> my<00:03:28.410> main<00:03:28.739> seals<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.459> one

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
that one's good my main seals this one

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.630 
that one's good my main seals this one
is<00:03:29.730> shot<00:03:30.290> well<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.590> not<00:03:31.709> shot<00:03:32.070> but<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.430> feels

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
is shot well it's not shot but it feels

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.550 
is shot well it's not shot but it feels
a<00:03:32.670> little<00:03:32.760> gritty<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.239> one's<00:03:33.420> good<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.470> I'm

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
a little gritty that one's good and I'm

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.569 
a little gritty that one's good and I'm
obviously<00:03:34.680> gonna<00:03:34.920> replace<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.430> crank

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
obviously gonna replace the crank

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.949 
obviously gonna replace the crank
bearings<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:38.480> I'll<00:03:39.480> show<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.780> how<00:03:39.900> to

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
bearings so I'll show you how to

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.509 
bearings so I'll show you how to
actually<00:03:40.680> will<00:03:41.610> do<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.910> right<00:03:42.060> now<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.430> you

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
actually will do that right now so you

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.509 
actually will do that right now so you
get<00:03:44.700> your<00:03:44.850> crank<00:03:45.690> bearing<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.859> sits<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.310> here

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
get your crank bearing it sits in here

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:56.360 
get your crank bearing it sits in here
it's<00:03:47.940> pretty<00:03:48.930> tightly<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.530> there<00:03:51.799> I<00:03:55.190> do<00:03:56.190> it

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
it's pretty tightly in there I do it

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.070 
it's pretty tightly in there I do it
you'll<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:56.730> two<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:57.030> these

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
you'll have two of these

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.050 
you'll have two of these
you<00:03:58.650> have<00:03:58.770> one<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.040> either<00:03:59.130> side<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.940> unscrew

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
you have one on either side you unscrew

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.670 
you have one on either side you unscrew
those<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.750> will<00:04:00.870> need<00:04:01.050> an<00:04:01.170> impact<00:04:01.500> and

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
those you will need an impact and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.220 
those you will need an impact and
probably<00:04:02.130> they're<00:04:02.250> pretty<00:04:02.430> tight<00:04:02.640> they're

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
probably they're pretty tight they're

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.270 
probably they're pretty tight they're
locked<00:04:04.230> hide<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.590> there<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> bearing

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
locked hide it in there and the bearing

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.700 
locked hide it in there and the bearing
will<00:04:05.370> just<00:04:05.520> be<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.700> there<00:04:05.820> won't<00:04:06.000> fall<00:04:06.210> out

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
will just be in there won't fall out

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
will just be in there won't fall out
heat<00:04:07.710> up<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.920> case<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> little<00:04:08.460> bit<00:04:08.580> if<00:04:08.700> you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
heat up the case a little bit if you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.240 
heat up the case a little bit if you
want<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:10.200> doesn't<00:04:10.500> really<00:04:10.590> help<00:04:10.800> because<00:04:11.010> you

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
want it doesn't really help because you

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.040 
want it doesn't really help because you
really<00:04:11.550> in<00:04:12.000> order<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.360> really<00:04:12.630> get<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.990> effect

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
really in order to really get the effect

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.960 
really in order to really get the effect
this<00:04:13.740> would<00:04:13.950> need<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.100> be<00:04:14.220> cold<00:04:14.490> this<00:04:14.820> would

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
this would need to be cold this would

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.449 
this would need to be cold this would
need<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.120> be<00:04:15.270> hot<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.350> heating<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.160> up<00:04:17.250> doesn't

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
need to be hot so heating it up doesn't

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.400 
need to be hot so heating it up doesn't
do<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.670> whole<00:04:17.760> lot<00:04:17.959> actually<00:04:18.959> these<00:04:19.049> bearings

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
do a whole lot actually these bearings

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.130 
do a whole lot actually these bearings
feel<00:04:19.560> pretty<00:04:19.920> darn<00:04:20.100> good<00:04:20.400> but<00:04:20.790> I'm<00:04:21.780> gonna<00:04:21.989> go

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
feel pretty darn good but I'm gonna go

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.300 
feel pretty darn good but I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:22.170> and<00:04:22.350> replace<00:04:22.590> them<00:04:22.830> since<00:04:23.010> I've<00:04:23.130> got

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
ahead and replace them since I've got

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.350 
ahead and replace them since I've got
the<00:04:23.490> motor<00:04:23.940> part<00:04:24.410> and<00:04:25.410> then<00:04:25.980> you<00:04:26.280> would<00:04:27.210> get<00:04:27.300> a

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
the motor part and then you would get a

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.660 
the motor part and then you would get a
socket<00:04:27.710> on<00:04:28.710> this<00:04:28.890> side<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.430> used<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:31.610> give<00:04:32.610> you

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
socket on this side I used a I give you

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.600 
socket on this side I used a I give you
something<00:04:33.060> like<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:34.560> get<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.830> started

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
something like this to get it started

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.030 
something like this to get it started
fits<00:04:35.910> perfect<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.270> there<00:04:36.420> perfectly<00:04:36.890> pound<00:04:37.890> on

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
fits perfect in there perfectly pound on

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.650 
fits perfect in there perfectly pound on
it<00:04:38.130> with<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.400> rubber<00:04:38.670> mallet<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:42.480> then<00:04:42.600> I

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
it with a rubber mallet and then I

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.510 
it with a rubber mallet and then I
finished<00:04:42.990> it<00:04:43.080> off<00:04:43.230> with<00:04:43.260> this<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.340> pops

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
finished it off with this and it pops

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.290 
finished it off with this and it pops
right<00:04:44.640> out<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:46.340> does<00:04:47.340> take<00:04:47.910> some<00:04:47.940> pretty

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
right out it does take some pretty

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.910 
right out it does take some pretty
pretty<00:04:48.660> forceful<00:04:49.140> hits<00:04:49.350> but<00:04:49.560> nothing<00:04:49.800> that's

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
pretty forceful hits but nothing that's

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.530 
pretty forceful hits but nothing that's
gonna<00:04:49.980> break<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.370> case<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:51.150> not<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.450> know

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
gonna break the case it's not you know

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.060 
gonna break the case it's not you know
all<00:04:51.780> your<00:04:51.960> might<00:04:52.110> or<00:04:52.230> anything<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.650> so
