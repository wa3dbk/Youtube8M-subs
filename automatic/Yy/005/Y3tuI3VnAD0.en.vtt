bowling<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.880> think<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.360> even<00:01:30.570> worse<00:01:30.780> was

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
bowling I think what is even worse was

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
bowling I think what is even worse was
that<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.770> Tony's<00:01:32.130> eyes<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.880> bowlers<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that in Tony's eyes the bowlers on the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.230 
that in Tony's eyes the bowlers on the
bench<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.200> din<00:01:34.439> does<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> challahs<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.579> don't

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
bench the din does the challahs I don't

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
bench the din does the challahs I don't
think<00:01:36.540> he<00:01:36.630> had<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.780> confidence<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.560> play<00:01:37.860> them

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
think he had the confidence to play them

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
think he had the confidence to play them
in<00:01:38.240> instead<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.450> batsman<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.409> India

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
in instead of a batsman and so India

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
in instead of a batsman and so India
going<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.280> seven<00:01:41.700> batsmen<00:01:41.909> plus<00:01:42.450> Ashwin

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
going in at seven batsmen plus Ashwin

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990 
going in at seven batsmen plus Ashwin
plus<00:01:43.229> port<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.649> way<00:01:44.009> too<00:01:44.520> much<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.939> like

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
plus port on way too much it's like

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.179 
plus port on way too much it's like
sending<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.450> tank<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> kill<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> mosquito<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
sending a tank out to kill a mosquito it

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.679 
sending a tank out to kill a mosquito it
was<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:47.549> too<00:01:47.579> much<00:01:47.790> batting<00:01:48.299> but<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> reason

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
was way too much batting but the reason

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.389 
was way too much batting but the reason
there<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.079> way<00:01:49.290> too<00:01:49.320> much<00:01:49.500> batting<00:01:49.979> was

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
there was way too much batting was

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.710 
there was way too much batting was
because<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.759> don't<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> only<00:01:51.329> trusted

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
because I don't think the only trusted

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.630 
because I don't think the only trusted
his<00:01:51.869> bowling<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.500> also<00:01:52.710> he<00:01:52.829> wasn't<00:01:53.250> sure<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
his bowling and also he wasn't sure the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
his bowling and also he wasn't sure the
starts<00:01:54.030> he<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.180> getting<00:01:54.540> that's<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> other

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
starts he was getting that's the other

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.709 
starts he was getting that's the other
big<00:01:55.350> factor<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.340> condense<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.969> game<00:01:57.149> into<00:01:57.390> 20

big factor we condense a game into 20
overs<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.439> still<00:01:58.680> need<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> take<00:01:59.070> wickets

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
overs but you still need to take wickets
you<00:01:59.610> still<00:01:59.880> need<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.210> starts<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.780> that's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you still need to get starts and that's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
you still need to get starts and that's
beautiful<00:02:01.590> thing<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.040> game<00:02:02.219> that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

and I think that is where India were
hurt<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.820> as<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:40.970> result<00:02:42.040> too<00:02:43.040> much<00:02:43.220> dependence

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
slow that that was interesting it one

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.730 
slow that that was interesting it one
photons<00:03:29.240> got<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.420> bit<00:03:29.630> slower<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.380> India's

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
photons got a bit slower so India's

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.710

fielding<00:03:31.130> was<00:03:31.250> always<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.760> little<00:03:31.850> minus<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.540> I

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
fielding was always a little minus so I

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.270 
fielding was always a little minus so I
think<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.050> time<00:03:33.350> has<00:03:33.380> come<00:03:33.740> for<00:03:33.950> India<00:03:34.250> to

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
think that time has come for India to

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.760 
think that time has come for India to
look<00:03:34.520> back<00:03:34.850> at<00:03:35.090> its<00:03:35.270> d20<00:03:35.870> structure<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.500> say

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
look back at its d20 structure and say

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.880 
look back at its d20 structure and say
right<00:03:37.130> who<00:03:37.580> are<00:03:37.700> our<00:03:37.730> best<00:03:38.240> t20<00:03:38.660> players<00:03:39.080> let's

right who are our best t20 players let's

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.830 
right who are our best t20 players let's
look<00:03:40.130> at<00:03:40.310> them<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.880> IPL<00:03:41.270> is<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.420> feeding<00:03:41.810> ground

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
look at them the IPL is a feeding ground

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.900 
look at them the IPL is a feeding ground
but<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.560> standard<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.070> bowling<00:03:43.400> in<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:43.610> IPL

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
but the standard of bowling in the IPL

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.220 
but the standard of bowling in the IPL
is<00:03:44.060> far<00:03:44.270> lower<00:03:44.480> than<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.840> standard<00:03:45.110> of

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
bullying in a world t20 so you need to

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.670 
bullying in a world t20 so you need to
factor<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.360> but<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.840> fact<00:03:48.080> remains<00:03:48.170> that

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
factor that in but the fact remains that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.710
