00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.519
 and it's the people here talking about facts and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.660
 this time I bring you here to me 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.750
 play the national interpol on intel hd 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.550
 3000 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 I did not let go of my mission 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.870
 here you can see how it works 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.720
 good self party 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:32.800
 is one of the options in this game does not have 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.790
 inpc edit transports is is the port in 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.280
 same city as using the fast drink and 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 also have some scrolls that 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 makes travel to intercity 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.260
 teleport when you are playing 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.960
 in facts that voice is this face that the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.720
 animation to leave the wake the sister with 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 Who was I sleeping in now? 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.000
 And then I remembered that I had to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.080
 make a player here that my game does not 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.910
 I was taking a service for you 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.010
 I thought it was going to be that I will not have it. 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:16.850
 another opportunity so it's better to record 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:24.970
 So good recording now I noticed it 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.970
 is ranging from 24 to 30 fps quiet 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.620
 without treatment or 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.620
 there is something that is important 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.270
 involving 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.880
 the treatment 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.039
 have to keep in mind that this game is 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.920
 online then it can be your connection 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.929
 talent and there already causes and if this problem 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.039
 it will look like it's treatment but it's a 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.380
 book reads because of the connection what 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.780
 Happens to me a lot 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.320
 but it 's okay that you can say 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.130
 about the city in the center where 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.000
 lived then is the full name of the game 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.739
 file in 1561 very fun every moment 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.700
 What are you going to be playing? Will you? 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:22.750
 notice similarities no good 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.500
 well visible so gold was the crash 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.550
 net 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.550
 maybe because it is 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.680
 You already like this genre and do not 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.260
 has this game is a very low county 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.800
 because it's free 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.150
 That's right, 2009 for free to you. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.280
 relax when downloaded below in version 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.200
 open beta it had some up to some 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.890
 banks is once not falling into the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.170
 map and had no way out of the soft 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.700
 was that I had a parchment that 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.050
 interest carried capacity 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.240
 main 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.770
 now I'm too scared to fall 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.680
 bang decides new good 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.470
 I am now in a cave and not 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.970
 There's a lot of action no one is stuck there 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.800
 30fps recording right now without recording everything 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.550
 well it'll be better you'll 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:29.260
 achieve 60 fps easy easy going 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.290
 to be evaluated in 35 50 species when 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.090
 You're in town because in the city. 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.690
 how much do you have 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.150
 players have a duel have n 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.370
 I realize that mobility has a bonfire 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.090
 There are a lot of things, right? 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.910
 the movie people fall something normal now in 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.890
 so you will notice if it is not 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.090
 a very busy area you will 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.780
 achieve 60 fps quiet 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.360
 Our almost died there I did not see this 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.420
 my class that is one against the river 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.049
 so I do not have a good physical defense 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.319
 huh 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.790
 I have to stay long and carrying 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.160
 But you say you do not try not to get 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.829
 teleportation justified the missive 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.829
 This skill is good. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.810
 the setting here the game is showing 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.810
 for you 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:30.620
 Video options here have already been deleted because 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:34.009
 I like to play in pmrg has made the 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.729
 increase your field of view of details 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:44.229
 of the twenty-one resolution of the area of 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:44.229
 maximum work than 1366 by 768 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:51.940
 I've already been excluded, the rhythm is reflex 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.820
 right is the upgrade rate 60 networks 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.770
 brightness there you adjust accordingly there not 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.070
 I only wish because I did not play but were 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:06.770
 in a clear I like to leave 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:12.370
 all 130 network aspect in case is atypical 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:18.830
 if there you choose someone to win 4.3 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:21.050
 19.19 16.10 because it differs in not 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.710
 has a monitor in case I and my case 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.450
 how monitor it is 4.3 then i 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.600
 I have to leave it automatic for that 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.440
 adjust the best performance and I 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.220
 I advise you to also synchronize 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.530
 vertical to achieve this performance if 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.449
 55 and faith is important to be with this 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.650
 disabled option 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:50.069
 and here in the textures options ee 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.499
 rendering it already shows the recommended 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:55.129
 to it will analyze your board and will 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:06:00.180
 ordering here stops rendering 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:02.639
 80% who have 17 indicate recommended and 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.669
 quality of textures he already recommends 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.469
 leaves the graphic wrong and you will be able to 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.580
 play games in any treatment 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:12.599
 quiet 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.270
 remembering that this medication lunch 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.879
 put it this way it's made for 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.210
 reaches 60 frames then it is 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:23.550
 indicating the quantity the configuration therein 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.990
 so that you can achieve this 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.860
 amount 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.260
 it is important if you follow it you 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.760
 can play the game without treatment in the river 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.120
 how did you say when you are in a location 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.610
 where there are many people and skill 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:43.390
 is fully indicating the case has now been 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:46.270
 The 21st party is normal but it's back already 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:50.190
 came back to 27 because I left town 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.200
 but you can play well quiet 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.230
 I'm just writing a city 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.800
 I think I'll make you over 30. 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:02.940
 party except the main town 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:07.680
 game is the important influence now 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.630
 five were colored and she unfortunately there 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.090
 you will get a fan if you will notice 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:17.040
 also has been falling there 19 ps wins no 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.770
 will get a little honey and recording 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.350
 I do not even dare take the test there because 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.430
 I know it's going to be dinner is almost 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.860
 impossible 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.630
 Good people, I think that's what I 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.940
 I forgot to say anything like I said the 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.860

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.920
 some caves here in a group and already 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.620
 I can assure you that you will give 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.270
 to play the game without recording well 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.660
 also recording at the time it was a 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.320
 thrombosis such with the guys to give to 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.450
 record without any treatment 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.470
 I hope you like it if you like it. 

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.240
