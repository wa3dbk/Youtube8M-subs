okay<00:03:37.709> so<00:03:38.540> say<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:39.569> example<00:03:39.750> you're<00:03:40.290> at<00:03:40.379> it<00:03:40.650> and

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
okay so say for example you're at it and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.009 
okay so say for example you're at it and
go<00:03:40.829> table<00:03:41.220> with<00:03:41.340> about<00:03:41.549> five<00:03:41.819> people<00:03:42.030> you

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
go table with about five people you

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.629 
go table with about five people you
dealt<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.500> king<00:03:43.949> queen<00:03:44.190> now<00:03:45.739> normally<00:03:46.739> that

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
dealt a king queen now normally that

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.720 
dealt a king queen now normally that
plays<00:03:47.970> as<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.799> priority<00:03:49.799> ranking<00:03:50.160> hand<00:03:50.549> which

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
plays as a priority ranking hand which

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.099 
plays as a priority ranking hand which
doesn't<00:03:51.060> really<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.629> don't<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:52.019> do

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
doesn't really you don't really do

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.809 
doesn't really you don't really do
anything<00:03:52.349> okay<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:52.919> only<00:03:53.160> really<00:03:53.340> probably

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
anything okay you only really probably

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.970 
anything okay you only really probably
might<00:03:54.269> look<00:03:54.419> at<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.690> knee<00:03:54.870> ranked<00:03:55.620> hand<00:03:55.799> if

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
might look at the knee ranked hand if

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.930 
might look at the knee ranked hand if
you're<00:03:56.129> in<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.310> position<00:03:57.620> but<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:59.459> king<00:03:59.699> queen

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
you're in a position but that king queen

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.610 
you're in a position but that king queen
hand<00:04:00.269> will<00:04:00.449> move<00:04:00.569> up<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.840> better<00:04:00.989> see<00:04:01.199> ranking

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
hand will move up to better see ranking

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.740 
hand will move up to better see ranking
so<00:04:01.799> usually<00:04:02.489> at<00:04:02.699> least<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:03.000> minimum<00:04:03.329> hands<00:04:03.659> will

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
so usually at least a minimum hands will

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
so usually at least a minimum hands will
move<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:04.019> at<00:04:04.139> least<00:04:04.290> one<00:04:04.470> when<00:04:04.949> you're<00:04:05.099> getting

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
move up at least one when you're getting

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.589 
move up at least one when you're getting
further<00:04:05.519> down<00:04:05.790> when<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.269> less<00:04:06.419> and<00:04:06.510> less

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
further down when the less and less

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.509 
further down when the less and less
people<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:07.169> sometimes<00:04:07.349> you<00:04:07.709> sometimes<00:04:08.310> even

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
people and sometimes you sometimes even

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.000 
people and sometimes you sometimes even
to<00:04:08.669> priority<00:04:09.510> rankings<00:04:09.870> higher<00:04:10.079> as<00:04:10.319> well<00:04:10.530> okay

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
to priority rankings higher as well okay

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.809 
to priority rankings higher as well okay
so<00:04:12.769> one<00:04:13.769> thing<00:04:13.979> to<00:04:14.069> keep<00:04:14.220> in<00:04:14.340> mind<00:04:14.400> when<00:04:14.790> it

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
so one thing to keep in mind when it

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.930 
so one thing to keep in mind when it
comes<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.269> preflop<00:04:15.690> strategy<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.590> okay<00:04:16.979> where

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
comes to preflop strategy is okay where

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.210 
comes to preflop strategy is okay where
you're<00:04:18.090> sitting<00:04:18.769> you've<00:04:19.769> got<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.979> get<00:04:20.099> you

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
you're sitting you've got to get you

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.379 
you're sitting you've got to get you
going<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.489> very<00:04:20.669> very<00:04:20.729> cautious<00:04:21.000> when

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
going to be very very cautious when

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.760 
going to be very very cautious when
seeing<00:04:21.659> now<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.930> further<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.380> get<00:04:22.590> around

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
seeing now the further you get around

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.529 
seeing now the further you get around
the<00:04:22.889> table<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.639> labor<00:04:23.820> position<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.360> sit

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
the table and the labor position you sit

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.209 
the table and the labor position you sit
in<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.780> can<00:04:24.930> become<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.260> bit<00:04:25.440> more<00:04:25.590> open<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:26.099> can

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
in you can become a bit more open it can

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.740 
in you can become a bit more open it can
be<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.340> bit<00:04:26.460> more<00:04:26.550> aggressive

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
be a bit more aggressive

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.420 
be a bit more aggressive
you<00:04:27.840> can<00:04:27.990> try<00:04:28.140> things<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:28.560> because<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:29.280> can

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
you can try things out because you can

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.330 
you can try things out because you can
see<00:04:29.580> what<00:04:29.700> other<00:04:29.880> people<00:04:30.150> are<00:04:30.180> doing<00:04:30.270> okay<00:04:31.340> but

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
see what other people are doing okay but
