00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'll show you what I bought from cosmetics two 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.190
 times i was in shiseido to myself bought 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 serum looks like it is like this in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.230
 different formats 30 and 50 milliliters i 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.830
 I bought 50 because to whom in her 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.470
 churches 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 she didn't like it so much 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.880
 serum as stated what she 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.779
 suitable for any skin at any age 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.849
 and the older you are the better she acts 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.690
 the better it affects your skin 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.870
 the result is comfort literally the first days 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.290
 because it became noticeable that the skin 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.989
 more uniform color is she some 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.520
 velvety pleasant to the touch and forever 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.660
 moist I bought a high start 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.730
 notice that pores are less noticeable they 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 a bit narrowed but it is very noticeable 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.289
 was because they have a lot on 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.620
 cheek about serum says that she 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.640
 asset for so the skin's immune system 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.949
 serum stimulates production 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 collagen significantly increases levels 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.240
 skin moisture that I noticed 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.610
 literally the first day protects against 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.950
 pollution and sebum oxidation further 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.250
 bought this concealer in the very 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.250
 light shade like this it looks like and 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.189
 such is him 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.710
 wide brush and very convenient to apply 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.610
 not for concealer his average 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.320
 coating density but due to the fact that 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.430
 it highlights the skin 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.950
 this is the area around the eyes it is more 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.780
 highlighted does not emphasize mimic 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.520
 some wrinkles look beautiful 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.680
 it feels like you didn't put 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.470
 concealer 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.690
 less skin around your eyes and skin 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.520
 looks due to the fact that the brush 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.650
 slightly wide and convenient to apply 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.050
 tool and as highlighter 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.140
 on the cheekbones on the area above the upper lip and 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.540
 especially on the back of the nose did not give them in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.020
