00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.469
 Hi guys, I'm still here today. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.550
 recording the first video of the program 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.550
 telling my science 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.199
 in fact I should start this 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.210
 talk about chem more solved 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.600
 start telling you how I came in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.250
 I'm the only girl in the class of the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.330
 second year of a technical course in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 electromechanical the reality there was a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.940
 picture but I 'm the only one who survived 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 the first year 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 unfortunately there was a small sequel 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 a pending where I study 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 later I started attending classes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.890
 chemistry in the morning which did not 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.200
 That's right, because I do not sleep early and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.670
 I ended up sleeping in the room a few times. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.230
 That's when my teacher had the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.149
 bright idea to invite me to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.309
 participate in a construction project 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.930
 videos about science as an option for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.460
 kill this pendency in fact he 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.120
 liked a picture that became fashionable in the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 youtube 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.840
 the drama my life and decided to invent 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 something to do content about 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.470
 science 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.020
 hence our ideal was born but science or 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 drawing my science fruit of my 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.710
 drowsiness of my teacher's 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.360
 to know this, not even a little piece of the planet. 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.180
 Now, let's talk a little about the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.170
 chemistry the best of my chemistry because 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.689
 so I understand it is a chemical 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.670
 science or a way of producing 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.049
 knowledge about things 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.979
 there are various forms of knowledge 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.460
 about the world eg mythological 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.110
 Philosophical Common Sense and Science 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.640
 one of the differences between these 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.210
 knowledge is a method as it is 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 construct mythological knowledge through 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.560
 example is obtained by lighting and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.299
 disseminated by religions 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 already common sense is basically 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.880
 built by our experiences of the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.200
 and is perpetuating itself for generations. 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.420
 scientific knowledge is constructed by 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.329
 particular methods which includes 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.340
 hypotheses theories models experiments 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.660
 this knowledge seems to work well 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.280
 in many contexts 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.110
 hence the fact that people think 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.110
 important that it be is 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.630
 in schools good here me that science 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.520
 of materials of substances 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.710
 she is mainly concerned with 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.140
 the properties of matter or with 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.720
 their characteristics and their 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.560
 constitution of how things are 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 made 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.340
 In addition chemistry seeks to understand 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 transformations of matter 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.490
 let's take an example a steel nail has 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.790
 some very interesting properties 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.950
 as hardness to malleability color all 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.459
 their properties are related to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.110
 your constitution 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.480
 according to chemistry it is made of 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.970
 at least two different substances 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.190
 iron and carbon and depending on 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.140
 Steel may have 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.930
 very different properties 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.540
 one of the properties of steel this 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.640
 of iron in its constitution is the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.390
 which will easily be it 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.310
 rust here we complete the triangle 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.610
 concerns in the chemical 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.070
 transformations here the subject stopped 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.620
 being thus gave origin to the base mount 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.150
 of iron oxides having another 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.920
 constitution in properties as 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.090
 different people who no longer know the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.070
 mothers things 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.810
 Good people for today is this but soon 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.370
 we come back with more lay people 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.110
