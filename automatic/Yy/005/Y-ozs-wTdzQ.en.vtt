improved and definitive version this is
how<00:00:30.510> we<00:00:31.050> do<00:00:32.390> super<00:00:33.390> pro<00:00:33.630> version<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.380> no

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
how we do super pro version with no

how we do super pro version with no
stress<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.460> any<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> parts

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
stress on any of the parts

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.810 
stress on any of the parts
but<00:00:39.420> together<00:00:39.690> cool<00:00:40.170> tricks<00:00:40.559> first<00:00:41.520> thing<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
but together cool tricks first thing to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.770 
but together cool tricks first thing to
do<00:00:42.649> is<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.890> take<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.399> cord<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.070> up

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
do is to take your cord and to go up

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.290 
do is to take your cord and to go up
there<00:00:48.780> sort<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> generous<00:00:49.590> loop<00:00:50.149> down<00:00:51.149> here

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
there sort of generous loop down here

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.970 
there sort of generous loop down here
here<00:00:54.410> which<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:56.070> handle<00:00:56.640> nice<00:00:57.570> hook

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
here which will be your handle nice hook

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:06.910 
here which will be your handle nice hook
go<00:00:58.980> once<00:00:59.699> around<00:01:00.710> top<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:05.240> transformer

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
go once around top of the transformer

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.280 
go once around top of the transformer
holding<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.430> hand<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:09.930> just

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
holding it with this hand and then just

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.850 
holding it with this hand and then just
wrap<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:13.140> tension<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.650> it

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
wrap it this way and put tension on it

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.210 
wrap it this way and put tension on it
and<00:01:16.860> wrap<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> nicely<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.939> tension<00:01:19.100> we<00:01:20.100> were

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and wrap it nicely with tension we were

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.039 
and wrap it nicely with tension we were
sandwiching<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.420> sandwich<00:01:21.869> Inge<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:24.049> power

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
sandwiching your sandwich Inge the power

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.800 
sandwiching your sandwich Inge the power
cord<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.710> notice<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.610> there<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.880> no<00:01:27.180> there's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
cord and notice that there is no there's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.370 
cord and notice that there is no there's
a<00:01:27.869> nice<00:01:28.020> generous<00:01:28.590> loop<00:01:28.829> underneath<00:01:30.380> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
a nice generous loop underneath so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.240 
a nice generous loop underneath so
there's<00:01:31.560> no<00:01:31.710> stress<00:01:32.220> there<00:01:33.860> which<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.950> really

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there's no stress there which is really

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.810 
there's no stress there which is really
nice<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.880> hold<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.900> hat

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.750 

and<00:01:43.390> now<00:01:43.510> what<00:01:43.660> you<00:01:43.750> want<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:43.930> do<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.760> simply

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
and now what you want to do is simply

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.240 
and now what you want to do is simply
make<00:01:45.910> a<00:01:45.970> loop<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.810> smaller<00:01:47.200> bit<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:48.220> idea

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
make a loop in the smaller bit the idea

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.590 
make a loop in the smaller bit the idea
here<00:01:49.150> with<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.360> smaller<00:01:50.010> thing<00:01:51.010> is<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:52.120> not<00:01:52.330> have

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
here with a smaller thing is to not have

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.200 
here with a smaller thing is to not have
any<00:01:53.080> kinks<00:01:53.740> or<00:01:54.040> hard<00:01:56.280> bends<00:01:57.280> into<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.000> yeah

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
any kinks or hard bends into it yeah

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.540 
any kinks or hard bends into it yeah
keep<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.750> sort<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.110> open<00:01:59.530> let's<00:02:00.040> make<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> loop

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
keep it sort of open let's make a loop

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.050 
keep it sort of open let's make a loop
nice<00:02:01.560> generous<00:02:02.560> loop<00:02:02.770> go<00:02:03.640> in<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.910> direction

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
nice generous loop go in the direction

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.230 
nice generous loop go in the direction
of<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:06.930> make<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:08.020> nice<00:02:08.200> loop<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.920> oh<00:02:09.280> whatever

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
of the make a nice loop like oh whatever

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:21.770 
of the make a nice loop like oh whatever
try<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:10.960> way<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.760> direction<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:14.490> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.660 

the<00:02:22.780> plug<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.890> loop<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.220> one<00:02:24.430> time

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
the plug you just loop it one time

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.170 
the plug you just loop it one time
around<00:02:24.970> kind<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:26.459> generous<00:02:27.459> thing<00:02:27.760> there's<00:02:28.600> no

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
around kind of generous thing there's no

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.760 
around kind of generous thing there's no
there's<00:02:31.180> no<00:02:31.240> nothing<00:02:31.540> tight<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.110> just<00:02:32.350> just

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
there's no nothing tight it just just

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.150 
there's no nothing tight it just just
basically<00:02:33.220> loops<00:02:33.610> around<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.950> then<00:02:36.070> you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
basically loops around it and then you

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.600 
basically loops around it and then you
go<00:02:36.310> back<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.910> opposite<00:02:37.450> direction<00:02:37.660> around

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
go back in the opposite direction around

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.530 
go back in the opposite direction around
basically<00:02:39.610> you've<00:02:39.700> just<00:02:39.910> looped<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.360> that's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
basically you've just looped it that's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
basically you've just looped it that's
all<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.900> matters<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.890> made<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> loop

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
all it matters you just made a loop

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.479 
all it matters you just made a loop
around<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:44.260> then<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.530> just<00:02:44.709> do<00:02:44.950> what<00:02:45.160> you

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
around it and then you just do what you

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:52.229 
around it and then you just do what you
normally<00:02:45.670> do<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.450> go<00:02:46.630> round<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:50.910> then<00:02:51.910> fix

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
normally do just go round and then fix

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.840 
normally do just go round and then fix
it<00:02:52.360> as<00:02:52.600> usual<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:54.040> have<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.340> thing<00:02:54.580> down<00:02:54.820> a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
it as usual and have this thing down a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.949 
it as usual and have this thing down a
bit<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.470> little<00:02:56.470> clip<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:58.299> just<00:02:58.480> clip<00:02:58.930> it

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
bit a little clip and you just clip it

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:06.920 
bit a little clip and you just clip it
on<00:02:59.230> as<00:02:59.590> usual<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.890> result<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:05.850> on

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
on as usual now the result is that on

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.880 
on as usual now the result is that on
the<00:03:08.160> power<00:03:09.160> cord<00:03:09.489> here<00:03:10.080> there's<00:03:11.080> no<00:03:11.260> stress<00:03:11.680> at

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
the power cord here there's no stress at

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.710 
the power cord here there's no stress at
the<00:03:12.010> edge<00:03:12.130> which<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.549> always<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.180> place<00:03:13.420> I

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
the edge which is always the place I

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.720 
end up fraying and breaking and that
loop<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:19.930> goes<00:03:20.200> round<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.370> ends<00:03:21.670> up

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
loop just goes round and it ends up

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.920 
loop just goes round and it ends up
going<00:03:22.090> around<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:23.040> big<00:03:24.040> power<00:03:24.280> cord<00:03:24.930> softly

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
going around the big power cord softly

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.750 
going around the big power cord softly
and<00:03:26.140> generously<00:03:26.680> see<00:03:26.950> if<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.100> push<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.549> this<00:03:27.700> way

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
and generously see if I push it this way

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.390 
and generously see if I push it this way
you<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.239> see<00:03:28.540> just<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.590> simple<00:03:30.100> loop<00:03:30.220> around

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
you can see just a simple loop around

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.960 
you can see just a simple loop around
that<00:03:30.670> holds<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.269> thing<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.600> place<00:03:32.970> by

that holds that thing in place by

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.539 
that holds that thing in place by
holding<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.390> in<00:03:34.540> place

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
holding that in place

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.259 
holding that in place
the<00:03:36.549> main<00:03:36.820> cord<00:03:37.209> can't<00:03:37.570> undo<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.850> since<00:03:40.060> the

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
the main cord can't undo and since the

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.170 
the main cord can't undo and since the
name<00:03:40.510> cord<00:03:40.930> comes<00:03:41.440> around<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.370> transformer

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
name cord comes around the transformer

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.460 
name cord comes around the transformer
once<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.260> direction<00:03:45.360> it's<00:03:46.360> nice<00:03:47.170> and

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
once in this direction it's nice and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.090 
once in this direction it's nice and
stuck<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.040> can't<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.850> gonna<00:03:49.120> hook<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:49.750> so

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
stuck you can't it's gonna hook and so

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.120 
stuck you can't it's gonna hook and so
and<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:50.880> when<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.120> put<00:03:51.390> here<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.560> can't<00:03:52.890> let

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
and so when you put here you can't let

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.940 
and so when you put here you can't let
go<00:03:53.160> in<00:03:53.520> any<00:03:53.670> way<00:03:53.880> can<00:03:54.270> really<00:03:54.620> pull<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:55.740> down

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
go in any way can really pull it down

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.040 
go in any way can really pull it down
and<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.190> can<00:03:56.280> carry<00:03:57.270> that<00:03:57.330> baby<00:03:57.600> around

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
and you can carry that baby around

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.560 
and you can carry that baby around
anywhere<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.530> want<00:03:59.240> no<00:04:00.240> stress<00:04:00.600> here<00:04:02.570> no

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
anywhere you want no stress here no

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.600 
anywhere you want no stress here no
stress<00:04:03.930> here

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
stress here

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.680 
stress here
there's<00:04:05.610> not<00:04:05.790> even<00:04:05.850> any<00:04:06.150> stress<00:04:07.340> around

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
there's not even any stress around

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.660 
there's not even any stress around
around<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.870> main<00:04:10.050> socket<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.250> it's<00:04:11.580> a

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
around the main socket because it's a

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.570 
around the main socket because it's a
general<00:04:12.210> easy<00:04:12.510> loop<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.410> just<00:04:13.620> sort<00:04:14.490> of

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
general easy loop and it's just sort of

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.360 
general easy loop and it's just sort of
grabbing<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:16.050> sexually<00:04:16.620> this<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.220> is

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
grabbing so this is sexually this one is

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.160 
grabbing so this is sexually this one is
actually<00:04:17.550> kind<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.030> soft<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.690> easy<00:04:18.840> as<00:04:19.050> you

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
actually kind of soft and easy as you

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.780 
actually kind of soft and easy as you
can<00:04:19.200> see<00:04:20.870> no<00:04:21.870> stress<00:04:22.200> anywhere<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.640> had<00:04:23.760> a

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
can see no stress anywhere and you had a

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.250 
can see no stress anywhere and you had a
super<00:04:24.240> strong<00:04:26.180> hole<00:04:27.830> won't<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.070> do
