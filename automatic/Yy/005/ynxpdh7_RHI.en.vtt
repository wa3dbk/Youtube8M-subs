00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
websites that we didn't expect to have

websites that we didn't expect to have
women<00:00:23.070> pastors<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.789> their<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.900> their<00:00:25.529> marquee

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199

know Bible teaching churches that agreed
with<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.260> what<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> Bible<00:00:31.890> teaches

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
with you know what the Bible teaches

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280 
with you know what the Bible teaches
about<00:00:32.730> roles<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.110> apparently

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
about roles and you know apparently

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
about roles and you know apparently
that's<00:00:34.620> shifting<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> lot<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.610> places<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
that's shifting in a lot of places and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.970 
that's shifting in a lot of places and
clearly<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:37.770> it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
clearly it is we know that but to see it

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760 
clearly it is we know that but to see it
close<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> home<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:39.020> suppose<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.500> tight

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
close to home is suppose it's that tight

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.049 
close to home is suppose it's that tight
yeah<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> brings<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.460> topic<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
yeah and brings that topic to the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.479 
yeah and brings that topic to the
surface<00:00:42.660> again<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.680> yeah<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.070> should<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.370> no

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
surface again but yeah it should be no

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.760 
surface again but yeah it should be no
surprise<00:00:44.539> because<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.680> issues

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
surprise because as with a lot of issues

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.790 
surprise because as with a lot of issues
we<00:00:47.160> want<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.600> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.719> acquiesce<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.620> whatever

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
we want to kind of acquiesce to whatever

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.470 
we want to kind of acquiesce to whatever
the<00:00:50.129> cultural<00:00:50.579> norms<00:00:50.940> are<00:00:51.090> which<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> way

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the cultural norms are which by the way

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.970 
the cultural norms are which by the way
is<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> great<00:00:51.960> classic<00:00:52.350> definition<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
is a great classic definition of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.069 
is a great classic definition of
worldliness<00:00:53.550> right<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.449> worldly<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
worldliness right to be worldly is to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.170 
worldliness right to be worldly is to
adapt<00:00:55.500> ourselves<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.309> whatever<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.699> world<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
adapt ourselves to whatever the world is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
adapt ourselves to whatever the world is
saying<00:00:57.449> whatever<00:00:57.809> they're<00:00:57.989> doing<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> today

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
saying whatever they're doing and today

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.029 
saying whatever they're doing and today
when<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> comes<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.239> roles<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
when it comes to roles we don't want to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.759 
when it comes to roles we don't want to
have<00:01:02.219> distinct<00:01:02.820> roles<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:04.559> know<00:01:04.650> we've

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
have distinct roles and you know we've

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710 
have distinct roles and you know we've
blurred<00:01:04.949> those<00:01:05.220> lines<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.700> culture<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
blurred those lines in culture in the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.649 
blurred those lines in culture in the
home<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.350> certainly<00:01:08.250> people<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.570> know

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
home and certainly people are you know

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.420 
home and certainly people are you know
they're<00:01:09.900> working<00:01:10.110> hard<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> erased

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
they're working hard to see that erased

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
they're working hard to see that erased
in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> church<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.960> biblically<00:01:13.710> speaking

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
in the church and so biblically speaking

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
in the church and so biblically speaking
we<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.520> take<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.240> stance<00:01:15.479> from<00:01:15.930> first

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
we would take the stance from first

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.350 
we would take the stance from first
Timothy<00:01:16.650> chapter<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.119> sense

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
Timothy chapter two and in that sense

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.580 
Timothy chapter two and in that sense
that's<00:01:18.509> what<00:01:18.630> we're<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.960> say<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that's what we're going to say the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
that's what we're going to say the
that's<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.189> shifted<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> church<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that's not shifted in the church but you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.820 
that's not shifted in the church but you
mentioned<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> home<00:01:22.110> too<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.439> well<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.710> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
mentioned the home too as well so this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.140 
mentioned the home too as well so this
maybe<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.159> gets<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:23.970> further

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
maybe this gets out a little bit further

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
maybe this gets out a little bit further
than<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.659> church<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> what<00:01:26.130> are

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
than just a church what are the what are

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.469 
than just a church what are the what are
the<00:01:26.250> different<00:01:26.340> views<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.119> well<00:01:27.390> yeah

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the different views there well yeah

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.760 
the different views there well yeah
we're<00:01:27.689> talking<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.200> well<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.740> know

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
we're talking about that well you know

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
we're talking about that well you know
you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.090> terms<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you can see it just in terms of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
you can see it just in terms of
discussions<00:01:31.049> about<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.530> social<00:01:31.950> order<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
discussions about the social order in

creative order these are not cultural we

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.149 
creative order these are not cultural we
can't<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.930> say<00:02:04.049> well<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:05.040> how

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
can't just say well you know that's how

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.620 
can't just say well you know that's how
they<00:02:05.310> did<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> first<00:02:05.759> century<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
they did it in the first century but of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.059 
they did it in the first century but of
course<00:02:06.840> we're<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> 21st<00:02:07.619> century<00:02:07.950> it's

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
course we're in the 21st century it's

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.309 
course we're in the 21st century it's
different<00:02:08.489> now<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.780> goes<00:02:09.959> back<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
different now because it goes back to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.839 
different now because it goes back to
the<00:02:10.410> biblical<00:02:10.590> order<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> garden

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the biblical order in the garden

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.699 
the biblical order in the garden
and<00:02:12.209> when<00:02:12.299> it<00:02:12.390> comes<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.109> we<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.409> to<00:02:13.439> say

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
and when it comes to that we have to say

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.349 
and when it comes to that we have to say
okay<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.189> where<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.549> way<00:02:14.819> god<00:02:15.030> wants<00:02:15.060> to

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
okay this is where the way god wants to

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.839 
okay this is where the way god wants to
express<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.560> relationship<00:02:17.159> in<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> genders

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
express the relationship in the genders

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.759 
express the relationship in the genders
in<00:02:17.999> a<00:02:18.090> church<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:19.139> men<00:02:19.319> will<00:02:19.499> be<00:02:19.620> the
