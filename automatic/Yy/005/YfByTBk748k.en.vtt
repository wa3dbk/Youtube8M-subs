00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
with us to the other painters is that

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.709 
with us to the other painters is that
why<00:00:42.499> perhaps<00:00:43.069> the<00:00:43.670> gallery<00:00:44.030> focused<00:00:44.600> on

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
why perhaps the gallery focused on

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.809 
why perhaps the gallery focused on
slightly<00:00:45.079> earlier<00:00:45.499> things<00:00:45.739> was<00:00:46.190> commonly

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819 
slightly earlier things was commonly

slightly earlier things was commonly
known<00:00:47.030> as<00:00:47.210> gold<00:00:47.479> grounds<00:00:47.989> when<00:00:48.559> I<00:00:48.589> started<00:00:49.159> the

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
known as gold grounds when I started the

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.790 
known as gold grounds when I started the
market<00:00:49.639> was<00:00:49.789> completely<00:00:50.300> different<00:00:50.449> but<00:00:51.109> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
market was completely different but the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.129 
market was completely different but the
gold<00:00:52.069> grounds<00:00:52.460> my<00:00:52.670> field<00:00:53.030> that<00:00:53.629> is<00:00:53.780> something

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
gold grounds my field that is something

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:56.229 
gold grounds my field that is something
that<00:00:54.199> never<00:00:54.559> lost<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.129> market<00:00:55.549> I<00:00:55.699> think<00:00:55.760> that

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
that never lost the market I think that

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.459 
that never lost the market I think that
the<00:00:56.299> goal<00:00:56.479> grounds<00:00:56.899> are<00:00:57.049> the<00:00:57.139> more<00:00:57.319> dramatic

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
the goal grounds are the more dramatic

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.340 
the goal grounds are the more dramatic
things<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:58.399> can<00:00:58.579> go<00:00:59.299> together<00:00:59.539> with<00:00:59.989> modern

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
things that can go together with modern

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.049 
things that can go together with modern
and<00:01:00.440> contemporary<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:01.219> can<00:01:01.399> see<00:01:01.549> a<00:01:01.609> gold<00:01:01.879> one

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059
