fun really innovative in design you're
going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.059> car<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> again<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
going to have the car here and again the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
going to have the car here and again the
small<00:00:50.219> scanner<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> center<00:00:51.719> is

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
small scanner here and in the center is

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
small scanner here and in the center is
where<00:00:52.020> you're<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> slide<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.710> car<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
card and that's going to determine the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.180 
card and that's going to determine the
speed<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> vehicle<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.129> to
