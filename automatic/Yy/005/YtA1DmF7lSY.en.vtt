the<00:02:09.280> head<00:02:09.430> still<00:02:09.729> felt<00:02:10.030> still<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.630> can<00:02:10.810> see<00:02:10.990> how

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the head still felt still we can see how

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.990 
the head still felt still we can see how
far<00:02:11.410> from<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.710> tower<00:02:11.920> hit<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.370> cart<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.820> from

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
far from the tower hit a cart it from

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.670 
far from the tower hit a cart it from
the<00:02:13.120> bottom<00:02:13.570> as<00:02:14.050> well

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
the bottom as well

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.680 
the bottom as well
now<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.070> birth<00:02:15.370> similar<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:15.940> length<00:02:16.120> are<00:02:16.450> just

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
now the birth similar in length are just

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.560 
now the birth similar in length are just
over<00:02:17.050> 37<00:02:17.950> inches<00:02:18.310> long<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.120> both<00:02:19.330> got

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
over 37 inches long and the both got

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.240 
over 37 inches long and the both got
good<00:02:19.810> Custom<00:02:20.260> Fit<00:02:20.410> options<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.040> I'm<00:02:21.100> gonna

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
good Custom Fit options now I'm gonna

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.760 
good Custom Fit options now I'm gonna
have<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> try<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.000> MCI<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.170> just<00:02:23.470> how<00:02:23.620> it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
have a try with the MCI and just how it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.970 
have a try with the MCI and just how it
compares<00:02:24.510> let's<00:02:25.510> find<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.810> decent<00:02:25.990> line<00:02:26.470> put<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
compares let's find a decent line put a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:36.330 
compares let's find a decent line put a
good<00:02:27.190> swing<00:02:27.460> on<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:28.410> all<00:02:29.410> right<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:36.310> a

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
good swing on it all right that was a

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.449 
good swing on it all right that was a
good<00:02:36.640> strike<00:02:37.150> maybe<00:02:38.080> not<00:02:38.320> quite<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.680> pure<00:02:39.070> feel

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
good strike maybe not quite as pure feel

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.970 
good strike maybe not quite as pure feel
of<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> MP<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:40.390> still<00:02:40.690> solid<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.380> maybe<00:02:41.770> just

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
of the MP but still solid and maybe just

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.949 
of the MP but still solid and maybe just
feels<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.280> bit<00:02:42.310> more<00:02:42.550> powerful<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.330> anything<00:02:43.780> I

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
feels a bit more powerful if anything I

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.480 
feels a bit more powerful if anything I
don't<00:02:44.320> think<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.650> launch<00:02:44.890> was<00:02:45.190> slightly

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
don't think the launch was slightly

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.880 
don't think the launch was slightly
higher<00:02:45.880> as<00:02:46.150> well<00:02:46.390> let's<00:02:46.870> go<00:02:47.050> straight<00:02:47.470> into

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
higher as well let's go straight into

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.920 
higher as well let's go straight into
trying<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.220> hit<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.400> low<00:02:49.120> drawer<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.780> just

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
trying to hit that low drawer and just

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.440 
trying to hit that low drawer and just
how<00:02:50.080> easy<00:02:50.320> it<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.920> get<00:02:51.520> up<00:02:51.550> ball<00:02:51.910> shipping

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
how easy it is to get up ball shipping

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.699 
how easy it is to get up ball shipping
over<00:02:56.640> great<00:02:57.640> strike<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.840> balls<00:02:59.110> moving

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
over great strike and the balls moving

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.790 
over great strike and the balls moving
but<00:02:59.860> maybe<00:03:00.370> not<00:03:00.640> quite<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.270> much<00:03:01.510> as<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.840> MP<00:03:02.170> 54

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
but maybe not quite as much as the MP 54

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.860 
but maybe not quite as much as the MP 54
the<00:03:03.220> blade<00:03:03.459> lengths<00:03:03.700> just<00:03:03.880> seem<00:03:04.300> longer<00:03:04.780> in

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
the blade lengths just seem longer in

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.570 
the blade lengths just seem longer in
the<00:03:04.959> toe<00:03:05.200> profile<00:03:05.770> different<00:03:06.160> as<00:03:06.280> well<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
the toe profile different as well the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.550 
the toe profile different as well the
groove<00:03:07.150> seemed<00:03:07.480> further<00:03:07.750> away<00:03:07.959> from<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.440> edge

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
groove seemed further away from the edge

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.009 
groove seemed further away from the edge
of<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:08.860> club<00:03:09.040> than<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.340> MP<00:03:09.640> 54<00:03:10.209> now<00:03:10.690> that's<00:03:10.870> it

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
of the club than the MP 54 now that's it

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.050 
of the club than the MP 54 now that's it
one<00:03:11.230> more<00:03:11.500> try<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.190> hit<00:03:12.310> one<00:03:12.430> from<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> top

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
one more try and hit one from the top

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.210 
one more try and hit one from the top
plus<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> bit<00:03:13.870> more<00:03:14.050> first<00:03:14.350> tip<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.950> club

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
plus a bit more first tip on the club

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.610 
plus a bit more first tip on the club
try<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:15.910> hit<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.209> similar<00:03:16.660> area<00:03:17.080> then<00:03:17.470> what

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
try and hit it in similar area then what

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:29.210 
try and hit it in similar area then what
I<00:03:17.650> did<00:03:17.739> with<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.100> MP<00:03:18.430> 54<00:03:22.320> alright<00:03:23.320> go<00:03:23.530> on

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.750 

oh<00:03:29.750> that's<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.870> shame<00:03:31.130> I've<00:03:32.130> caught<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.430> more

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
oh that's a shame I've caught it more

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.370 
oh that's a shame I've caught it more
from<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> bottom<00:03:33.510> rather<00:03:33.720> than<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.020> toe<00:03:34.260> you

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
from the bottom rather than the toe you

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.110 
from the bottom rather than the toe you
can<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.710> where<00:03:34.890> I've<00:03:35.010> hit<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.220> from<00:03:35.610> not<00:03:35.820> quite

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
can see where I've hit it from not quite

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.030 
can see where I've hit it from not quite
the<00:03:36.300> same<00:03:36.480> area<00:03:36.960> and<00:03:37.350> it<00:03:37.470> still<00:03:37.740> feels

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
the same area and it still feels

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.640 
the same area and it still feels
powerful<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.180> I'll<00:03:39.330> say<00:03:39.540> that's<00:03:39.780> down<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
powerful and I'll say that's down to the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.860 
powerful and I'll say that's down to the
speed<00:03:41.010> pocket<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.090> blade<00:03:42.360> limp<00:03:42.690> that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
speed pocket and the blade limp that

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.540 
speed pocket and the blade limp that
just<00:03:43.110> basically<00:03:43.530> helps<00:03:43.800> create<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.130> faster

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
just basically helps create a faster

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.790 
just basically helps create a faster
ball<00:03:44.730> speed<00:03:45.090> across<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.870> face<00:03:46.110> now<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:46.710> just

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
ball speed across the face now I'm just

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.080 
ball speed across the face now I'm just
going<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.010> see<00:03:47.130> how<00:03:47.280> far<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.700> balls<00:03:47.910> have

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
going to see how far the balls have

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.490 
going to see how far the balls have
traveled<00:03:50.000> total<00:03:51.000> distance<00:03:51.360> with<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.630> MP<00:03:51.930> 54

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
traveled total distance with the MP 54

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.570 
traveled total distance with the MP 54
177<00:03:53.490> and<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.970> MC<00:03:54.090> slightly<00:03:54.870> longer<00:03:55.050> at<00:03:55.200> 179<00:03:56.070> so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
177 and the MC slightly longer at 179 so

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.100 
177 and the MC slightly longer at 179 so
suppose<00:03:56.820> it's<00:03:57.000> time<00:03:57.180> for<00:03:57.360> me<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.630> some<00:03:58.050> of

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
suppose it's time for me to some of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.080 
suppose it's time for me to some of
these<00:03:58.200> clubs<00:03:58.560> up<00:03:58.770> generally<00:03:59.460> the<00:03:59.580> both<00:03:59.760> very

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
these clubs up generally the both very

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.660 
these clubs up generally the both very
good<00:04:00.360> they've<00:04:00.540> got<00:04:00.690> play<00:04:00.990> style<00:04:01.500> looks<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.280> MC

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
good they've got play style looks the MC

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.730 
good they've got play style looks the MC
comes<00:04:02.940> with<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.150> kbs2<00:04:03.660> shaft<00:04:04.260> that's<00:04:04.440> slightly

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
comes with a kbs2 shaft that's slightly

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.010 
comes with a kbs2 shaft that's slightly
higher<00:04:05.340> launch<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.000> lighter<00:04:06.270> than<00:04:06.840> the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
higher launch and lighter than the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.590 
higher launch and lighter than the
dynamic<00:04:07.230> girl<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.860> MP<00:04:08.160> 54<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.030> would<00:04:09.420> say

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600
