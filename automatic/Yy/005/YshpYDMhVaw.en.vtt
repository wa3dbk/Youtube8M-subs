00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.099
 for sports offers very wide 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.650
 line of rock shoes 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 not always easy to choose the most 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.619
 suitable especially for beginners 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:23.400
 rock climbing there are many factors that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.590
 It is important to consider when choosing skalnik 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.730
 each climber has its own characteristics 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.769
 foot structures 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.119
 We prefer not your eyes and asti 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.119
 beloved rocky terrain 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.010
 Now we will try to analyze 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.710
 three fundamental factors that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.600
 must be considered when choosing a rocky 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 shoe 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.489
 these factors are the shape of the foot 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 climber's habit of wearing smaller shoes 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.300
 size and rocky terrain on which 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:59.219
 skaters i will be used sparta 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 are you trying to create a rock culture 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.239
 shoes just to help you choose 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.239
 imagine perfect rock shoes 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.939
 the first factor on which stands 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.830
 pay attention when choosing rocky 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.830
 shoe this form of the foot 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.299
 There are many different forms but 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.950
 for simplicity we can share everything 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:31.650
 feet on narrow and wide narrow feet 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.420
 usually long thin fingers smoothly 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.570
 decreases in length from large to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.890
 month rise is usually enough 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:51.540
 low and bone foot 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:55.560
 mostly horizontal wide 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.280
 feet fuller usually fingers more 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280
 square 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 the rise of the foot is high curved and the bones 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:15.510
 more upright and our words on 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.070
 collections some models more 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:25.200
 suitable for narrow feet 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:27.120
 and some are ideal for wide for 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.380
 narrow feet better rock shoes 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.050
 symmetric shape 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.270
 and for wide feet it will be more competent 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.940
 choose shoes with more symmetrical 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.220
 be careful when choosing 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.170
 hard shoes because these shoes are not 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 will adapt to your foot 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.510
 your foot will have to adjust 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.170
 under them but when you choose shoes 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.110
 sleepers 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.550
 this factor is less important because 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:02.489
 anyway the shoes will be 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:04.980
 fit to the foot for climbers 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.239
 with narrow feet we recommend and url 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.739
 Jesus and the katana and the number of models now each 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:17.160
 month el futuro solution models as 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:26.100
 analysis with cobra and python adapts to 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:28.350
 all types of feet are not level with toast 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.350
 rose and speedster 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:38.370
 if not new age is more suitable for 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:40.170
 wide feet let's look at 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.110
 the second criterion which is important when choosing 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.410
 skalnik of how small and narrow 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.320
 the shoes we want you must remember that how 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.230
 only you wear skid shoes nagay shoe 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.600
 it becomes one price support which 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.690
 skalnik provides depends on 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.350
 how tight is your leg inside the narrow 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.350
 rock shoes 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.280
 sit insider and on another goal 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.790
 in other words, less space for 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.720
 legs 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:20.180
 the more support climber with 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.280
 the other side the wider the leg the smaller 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.340
 perceptible support which the climber 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.259
 Receives from shoes if skalnik wide 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:36.680
 and it should have a tight sole 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:38.840
 to support the weight of the climbers the same 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.940
 the most can be said about sleepers or 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.280
 less hard shoes that should be 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.990
 slightly smaller than normal shoe size 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.880
 to give the leg the necessary support we 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.560
 always trying to achieve the best 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.470
 balance between density and 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.960
 sensitivity support and feeling 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.880
 relief 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.770
 rock shoes with a dense sole reduces 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.840
 foot sensitivity and ability 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:08.840
 shoes to adapt to different types 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:11.210
 rocks on the other hand we have to choose 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.300
 soft shoes somewhat smaller 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.099
 than our usual 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.900
 they will provide greater sensitivity 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.570
 they will show the best result on 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.610
 different types of terrain and they will provide 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.610
 closer contact with rock 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.870
 with soft shoes we reach the best 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.669
 results 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.490
 especially on certain rocky 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.849
 sections such as overhanging routes 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:43.729
 when we carry extremely low weight on 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:46.970
 legs here is a simple example to explain 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.370
 this concept for beginners only 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.979
 novice climbers and no arrivals to wear 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.370
 narrow shoe does not make sense to buy 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:59.449
 sleepers that should be smaller and already 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:03.759
 ordinary shoes tighter and more spacious 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.759
 the model will be the best choice 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.840
 that kind of rock climbing we 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.389
 we prefer is the third factor 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.139
 which need to be considered when choosing a type 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:21.050
 in the cliff of climbing 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.210
 divided into 3 subcategories 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.970
 bulgarin free climbing and more 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.520
 long rocky routes during 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.470
 bouldering and free main climbing 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.919
 Climber's challenge is to overcome 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.449
 the most difficult tracks 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.580
 climbing shoes used for 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:41.669
 short time and should help 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.430
 achieving such high results 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:46.470
 it is only natural that 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.900
 choosing we look primarily at 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:07:01.560
 technicality to nick it on the degree of 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:04.440
 comfort that means we can 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.270
 use less stiff shoes such 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.400
 like climbing letters which 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.310
 provide better sensitivity and 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.409
 tighter fit to the foot of these soft 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.229
 shoes also provide better 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:23.990
 weight support if we choose smaller 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:26.219
 the size of either side comfort will be 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.599
 fundamental factor for long 

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:29.789
 rocky routes 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.949
 because the climber with less 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:34.650
 interested in overcoming on 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:37.380
 difficult areas but he sure that 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:41.300
 the shoes will stay on his feet for so long 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.300
 that maximum comfort is your life 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:46.680
 anyway i wish you interesting 

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:51.469
 routes and selected best students 

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.469
 I hope that it will be for sports
