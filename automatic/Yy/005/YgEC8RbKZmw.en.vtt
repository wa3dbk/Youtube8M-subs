00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.749 

now<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.320> reason<00:01:57.679> that<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:57.890> use<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.159> hitch<00:01:58.520> like

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
now the reason that we use a hitch like

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.880 
now the reason that we use a hitch like
this<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.149> because<00:01:59.509> a<00:01:59.539> tow<00:01:59.840> ball<00:02:00.049> is<00:02:00.259> in<00:02:00.439> no<00:02:00.679> way

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
this is because a tow ball is in no way

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.669 
this is because a tow ball is in no way
a<00:02:01.159> rated<00:02:01.579> recovery<00:02:02.060> point<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:02.929> please<00:02:03.229> never

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
a rated recovery point so please never

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.330 
a rated recovery point so please never
ever<00:02:04.039> use<00:02:04.429> a<00:02:04.460> tow<00:02:04.789> ball<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.240> recovery<00:02:05.869> point

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
ever use a tow ball as a recovery point

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.559 
ever use a tow ball as a recovery point
with<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.460> recovery<00:02:07.880> hitch<00:02:08.060> correctly
