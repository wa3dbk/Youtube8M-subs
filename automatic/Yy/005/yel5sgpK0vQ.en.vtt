00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
here we are at the top of breath town

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.580 
here we are at the top of breath town
Bald<00:00:07.859> Mountain<00:00:08.809> and<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.990> highest<00:00:10.260> mountains

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
Bald Mountain and the highest mountains

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.250 
Bald Mountain and the highest mountains
around<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:10.920> area<00:00:11.990> our<00:00:12.990> goal<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.559> hike<00:00:13.980> up

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
around this area our goal is to hike up

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.830 
around this area our goal is to hike up
to<00:00:16.260> see<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.100> get<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> shot<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.840> this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
to see if I can get a shot of it this

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.529 
to see if I can get a shot of it this
observation<00:00:19.529> tower<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.449> think<00:00:21.449> it's

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
observation tower up here I think it's

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.370 
observation tower up here I think it's
about<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> mile<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.820> really<00:00:23.820> steep<00:00:24.090> terrain<00:00:24.390> we

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
about a mile of really steep terrain we

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.929 
about a mile of really steep terrain we
were<00:00:25.470> driving<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> car<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.699> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
were driving up here in the car and I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.500 
were driving up here in the car and I
was<00:00:27.750> flooring<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.670> up<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> hill<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> was

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
was flooring it up the hill and it was

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.310 
was flooring it up the hill and it was
barely<00:00:30.779> even<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.750> it's<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:34.079> steep

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
barely even going so it's a really steep

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.959 
barely even going so it's a really steep
and<00:00:34.530> we're<00:00:34.620> pretty<00:00:34.739> high<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> think<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> final

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and we're pretty high I think the final

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.410 
and we're pretty high I think the final
elevation<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.140> top<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:38.660> for<00:00:39.860> 4,700<00:00:40.860> feet

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
elevation to the top is for 4,700 feet

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.279 
elevation to the top is for 4,700 feet
so<00:00:42.420> we're<00:00:42.899> gonna<00:00:42.989> grab<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.500> map<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
so we're gonna grab a map here and I

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.209 
so we're gonna grab a map here and I
don't<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> map<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.010> where<00:00:47.039> we're

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
don't have a map and see where we're

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.220 
don't have a map and see where we're
going<00:00:47.539> all<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.660> we're<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> trailhead

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
going all right we're at the trailhead

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.819 
going all right we're at the trailhead
Brasstown<00:00:50.039> Bald<00:00:51.020> should<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.110> pretty<00:00:52.320> vigorous
