00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 this exercise tells us what 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.779
 next if the clock shows at five o'clock 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.849
 at what time between five o'clock and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.519
 the six will overlap the hands 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.340
 of the schedule with those of the minute hand is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.230
 say here we can see graphically the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.470
 clock that is ticking five in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 point and he asks us between the five 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.199
 and at six o'clock what time the hand of the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.189
 schedule will be superimposed on 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.590
 Minute handles this exercise 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.559
 we will solve it using the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.780
 next formula this would be the formula 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.600
 where by mnemonics we can 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.270
 find the a that the angle is equal to 32 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.910
 minus 11 half dead h represents the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.160
 hour that represents me the minutes and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 this represents the angle in degrees 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.969
 sexagesimal is then if the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.910
 hour and minute hand 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.430
 they superimpose one on top of the other 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.160
 means that the angle formed 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 between these two hands it would come to be 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.090
 zero so that's what 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.109
 we place 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.789
 in this equation here we would have 0 is 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.789
 equal to 30 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.910
 which multiplies in this case the value of 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.440
 h would now be as we repeat 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.330
 and the time would be 5 o'clock since the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.390
 hours will be between 5 and 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.750
 6 o'clock that means it's going to be 5 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.450
 and something more than five minutes in the afternoon 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:41.909
 it would be time minus 11 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.119
 that divides 2 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.289
 and this multiplies the minutes that 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.250
 we want to find then here we have in 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.340
 the equation that 30 by 5 would equal 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.969
 150 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.679
 and this is what we put every 150 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:04.509
 here we have zero and we have 11 means 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.219
 negative all this expression would happen to the 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.090
 another side of the equation with a sign 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:15.050
 changed therefore we would have 11 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 means that multiply am that is to 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.780
 the minutes that we are going to calculate so 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.420
 so much 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.230
 and I would be equal to 150 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.620
 that multiplies to 22 that is dividing 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 will happen here to multiply then 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:40.560
 150 for 2 and all this would be divided 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.910
 between 11 since this 11 that was 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.380
 multiplying on this side of the 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.550
 equation happens to divide the other side 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.610
 resolving 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.650
 this multiplication and division we are going to 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.980
 see that the time you have to 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.980
 elapse would come to be 27 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.340
 point 27 minutes 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.310
 newspaper in 27 is to say this is repeated 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.130
 27.27 27 27 indefinitely then 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.130
 now let's graph this in this 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.740
 graphic we can see graphically that the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.850
 hand of the schedule at this time is 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.700
 superimposed on the hand of the minute hand and 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.740
 that its angle of separation between these 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.350
 two hands would be equal to 0 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.390
 then the answer of this problem to 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.950
 the time at which this happens would come to 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.950
 close 5 hours 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.540
 with 27 minutes 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.080
 in this case we are going to calculate how many 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.490
 seconds here 27.27 would be the same as 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.490
 say 27 more 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.080
 0.27 newspaper in 27 transforming this 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.280
 to seconds 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.420
 the conversion we know it's a minute 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.850
 is equal to 60 seconds 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.140
 simplifying minutes then all this 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.890
 we have it in seconds 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.450
 will give us 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:22.580
 equal to 16 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.530
 point four seconds therefore 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.100
 answer of this problem would come to be 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:33.729
 that this superposition of hands 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:41.080
 It happens at 5 hours with 27 minutes 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:44.879
 and with 16.4 seconds this would be the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.879
 problem solution
