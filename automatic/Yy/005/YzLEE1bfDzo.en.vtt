00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.839
 and hello to all dear friends with you not 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.639
 welcome to Minecraft Reviews 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.390
 mods and this mod us pretty 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.239
 normal but logical guys this mod 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.360
 very logical when you go war 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:27.910
 Produce light dust if you do so here 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.369
 put it doesn't glow yes she doesn't 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.739
 shines this is not logic this is no longer logic 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.820
 in mykraft from already bottom in mykraft here 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.270
 to this 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.610
 found a solution here you say you went into 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.850
 dungeon on dark street is still nothing to see 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.340
 I'll even do it right now so it won't be 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.770
 this quarter as it is like that you come in 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.239
 danzh is dark here is very dark 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.420
 you need it all light you 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.940
 put holy dust and it glows 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.620
 this is very much the logic of this is my personal 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.309
 opinion because it needs light dust 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.430
 shine 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.839
 That's where I jumped naturally all 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.159
 exploded because here I am 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.560
 actually so here is such a mod 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.459
 pretty small but pretty 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.479
 and approx prim approx logical 

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:18.249
 so guys link in the description swing 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.759
 Once again, the mod is very small 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:24.999
 here that and who is not a fashion just 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.009
 light flashes connected with what is holy 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.409
 dust glows well what is it for mat rest 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.649
 but guys can be so logical and so 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.630
 spend like that do well in general as 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:39.719
 I was told this should light of dust 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:43.359
 be now take redstone 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:45.939
 as redstone on the idea of ​​a niche not hiss 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.959
 that's how it is like that 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.090
 hiss redstone 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.689
 but it already hisses addresses immediately 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.060
 redstone now connect it will 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.039
 sizzle invite hiss axis macca than he doesn't 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.380
 hisses and also this light dust should by 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.179
 the idea 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.850
 Cons of light painting I consider all 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.130
 differently 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.080
 actually okay color and Piotr 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.030
 the table does not hiss already the sixth fat when we 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.679
 turn it on so small 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.790
