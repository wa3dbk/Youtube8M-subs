quite<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> bit<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:39.630> doesn't<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.140> lot<00:02:40.290> of

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
quite a bit and it doesn't have a lot of

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.340 
quite a bit and it doesn't have a lot of
tug<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.280> pull<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:42.239> seems<00:02:42.480> pretty<00:02:42.720> solid<00:02:42.959> even

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
tug and pull it seems pretty solid even

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.000 
tug and pull it seems pretty solid even
though<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:44.000> floppy<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.150> guess<00:02:45.680> I'm<00:02:46.680> pretty

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
though it is floppy I guess I'm pretty

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.110 
though it is floppy I guess I'm pretty
sure<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.250> no<00:02:47.430> one<00:02:47.550> would<00:02:47.640> break<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.000> unless

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
sure that no one would break it unless

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.470 
sure that no one would break it unless
you<00:02:48.510> would<00:02:48.750> try<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> improperly<00:02:49.830> close<00:02:50.250> it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
you would try to improperly close it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.370 
you would try to improperly close it
another<00:02:51.480> thing<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.900> may<00:02:51.989> notice<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
another thing that you may notice that

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.520 
another thing that you may notice that
this<00:02:52.620> camera<00:02:52.920> does<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.430> stereo<00:02:54.120> mic<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.440> it

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
this camera does have stereo mic so it

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.830 
this camera does have stereo mic so it
has<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> left<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.580> right<00:02:56.790> audio<00:02:57.000> microphone<00:02:57.660> on

ISO which you push the right button

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.670 
ISO which you push the right button
which<00:05:46.969> brings<00:05:47.000> up<00:05:47.360> your<00:05:47.389> ISO<00:05:47.870> values<00:05:48.199> and<00:05:48.440> one

which brings up your ISO values and one
thing<00:05:48.830> that<00:05:48.860> I<00:05:48.979> really<00:05:49.190> do<00:05:49.280> like<00:05:49.370> about<00:05:49.520> this

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
thing that I really do like about this

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.820 
thing that I really do like about this
camera<00:05:49.909> is<00:05:50.120> that<00:05:50.210> it<00:05:50.389> has<00:05:50.479> very<00:05:50.630> small<00:05:50.990> ISO

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
camera is that it has very small ISO

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.550 
camera is that it has very small ISO
steps<00:05:52.190> and<00:05:53.030> so<00:05:53.360> instead<00:05:53.630> of<00:05:53.719> going<00:05:53.930> from<00:05:54.050> 100

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
steps and so instead of going from 100

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.730 
steps and so instead of going from 100
to<00:05:54.680> 200<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.219> 400<00:05:55.639> and<00:05:55.729> so<00:05:55.940> on<00:05:56.150> you<00:05:56.840> go<00:05:56.990> from<00:05:57.199> 100

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
to 200 to 400 and so on you go from 100

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.300 
to 200 to 400 and so on you go from 100
to<00:05:57.860> 125<00:05:58.479> 168<00:05:59.479> cetera<00:05:59.840> et<00:05:59.900> cetera<00:06:00.169> so<00:06:00.500> you<00:06:01.159> can

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
to 125 168 cetera et cetera so you can

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.170 
to 125 168 cetera et cetera so you can
get<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.430> much<00:06:01.759> cleaner<00:06:02.240> picture<00:06:02.570> in<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:02.930> end<00:06:04.180> so

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
get a much cleaner picture in the end so

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.850 
get a much cleaner picture in the end so
one<00:06:05.360> thing<00:06:05.509> that<00:06:05.539> this<00:06:05.719> camera<00:06:05.990> has<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:06.770> I

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
one thing that this camera has and I

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.560 
one thing that this camera has and I
think<00:06:07.159> that<00:06:07.340> it<00:06:07.460> does<00:06:07.580> better<00:06:07.909> than<00:06:08.060> other

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
think that it does better than other

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.409 
think that it does better than other
cameras<00:06:09.020> that<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:09.440> competes<00:06:09.770> against<00:06:10.190> is<00:06:10.419> that

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
cameras that it competes against is that

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.149 
cameras that it competes against is that
it's<00:06:11.719> pictures<00:06:12.169> effects<00:06:12.590> that<00:06:13.009> are

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:13.159 
it's pictures effects that are

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.330 
it's pictures effects that are
pre-programmed<00:06:13.880> to<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.360> camera<00:06:15.340> actually

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
pre-programmed to the camera actually

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.510 
pre-programmed to the camera actually
work<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:17.000> I<00:06:17.719> really<00:06:17.750> do<00:06:18.259> enjoy<00:06:18.440> that<00:06:18.860> I've

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
work and I really do enjoy that I've

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.010 
work and I really do enjoy that I've
liked<00:06:19.789> most<00:06:20.000> other<00:06:20.210> cameras<00:06:20.599> will<00:06:20.780> give<00:06:20.900> you

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
liked most other cameras will give you

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.350 
liked most other cameras will give you
an<00:06:21.110> HDR<00:06:21.530> mode<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.099> then<00:06:22.729> everything<00:06:23.120> turns

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
an HDR mode and then everything turns

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.209 
an HDR mode and then everything turns
out<00:06:23.539> looking<00:06:23.810> blurry<00:06:24.139> or<00:06:24.440> just<00:06:24.710> waits<00:06:25.070> you

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.850 
out looking blurry or just waits you
blown<00:06:25.520> out<00:06:25.699> and<00:06:25.820> you<00:06:25.880> lose<00:06:26.030> all<00:06:26.150> your<00:06:26.210> detail

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
blown out and you lose all your detail

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.659 
blown out and you lose all your detail

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
camera you just go to menu

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.119 
camera you just go to menu
you<00:06:31.550> go<00:06:31.699> to<00:06:31.759> your<00:06:31.909> camera<00:06:32.239> settings<00:06:32.479> and<00:06:33.129> then

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.129 
you go to your camera settings and then

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:35.739 
you go to your camera settings and then
on<00:06:34.309> the<00:06:34.459> same<00:06:34.610> page<00:06:34.909> that<00:06:35.209> it<00:06:35.300> talks<00:06:35.509> about

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:35.749 
on the same page that it talks about

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:37.570 
on the same page that it talks about
your<00:06:35.869> white<00:06:36.080> balance<00:06:36.289> it<00:06:37.159> should<00:06:37.399> be<00:06:37.489> the

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
your white balance it should be the

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.249 
your white balance it should be the
fourth<00:06:37.849> one<00:06:37.909> down<00:06:38.270> and<00:06:38.569> it<00:06:38.659> just<00:06:38.689> says<00:06:38.929> picture

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
fourth one down and it just says picture

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.359 
fourth one down and it just says picture
effect<00:06:40.389> so<00:06:41.389> usually<00:06:41.779> it<00:06:41.929> should<00:06:42.110> be<00:06:42.169> off<00:06:42.409> and

00:06:43.359 --> 00:06:43.369 
effect so usually it should be off and

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:44.589 
effect so usually it should be off and
once<00:06:43.550> you<00:06:43.639> go<00:06:43.819> in<00:06:43.939> there<00:06:44.089> it's<00:06:44.269> going<00:06:44.360> to<00:06:44.419> give

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
once you go in there it's going to give

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.229 
once you go in there it's going to give
you<00:06:44.689> a<00:06:44.719> bunch<00:06:44.929> of<00:06:45.050> different<00:06:45.349> options<00:06:45.499> like

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:46.239 
you a bunch of different options like

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:48.759 
you a bunch of different options like
toy<00:06:47.239> camera<00:06:47.719> and<00:06:47.899> what's<00:06:48.080> great<00:06:48.319> is<00:06:48.469> that<00:06:48.529> it's

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:48.769 
toy camera and what's great is that it's

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:51.669 
toy camera and what's great is that it's
not<00:06:48.949> just<00:06:48.979> one<00:06:49.519> preset<00:06:50.089> effect<00:06:50.479> add<00:06:50.689> one<00:06:51.379> mode

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:51.679 
not just one preset effect add one mode

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.799 
not just one preset effect add one mode
so<00:06:52.159> for<00:06:52.339> toy<00:06:52.519> camera<00:06:52.939> you<00:06:53.119> guys<00:06:53.330> should<00:06:53.449> go<00:06:53.569> in

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:53.809 
so for toy camera you guys should go in

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:55.449 
so for toy camera you guys should go in
and<00:06:54.080> make<00:06:54.739> it<00:06:54.769> give<00:06:55.189> it<00:06:55.219> a<00:06:55.369> different

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:55.459 
and make it give it a different

00:06:55.459 --> 00:06:57.850 
and make it give it a different
temperature<00:06:55.939> style<00:06:56.330> that<00:06:56.509> cool<00:06:56.779> or<00:06:57.499> warm

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
temperature style that cool or warm

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.029 
temperature style that cool or warm
green<00:06:58.519> magenta<00:06:59.319> more<00:07:00.319> like<00:07:00.529> that<00:07:00.739> there's

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:01.039 
green magenta more like that there's

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:03.339 
green magenta more like that there's
even<00:07:01.249> a<00:07:01.309> pop<00:07:01.550> color<00:07:01.849> which<00:07:02.149> is<00:07:02.330> I<00:07:02.569> guess<00:07:03.139> more

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
even a pop color which is I guess more

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.679 
even a pop color which is I guess more
like<00:07:03.559> an<00:07:03.679> Instagram<00:07:04.159> filter<00:07:04.419> one<00:07:05.419> thing<00:07:05.539> that

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:05.689 
like an Instagram filter one thing that

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:08.589 
like an Instagram filter one thing that
I<00:07:05.749> really<00:07:06.050> do<00:07:06.169> like<00:07:06.409> is<00:07:06.769> that<00:07:07.669> you<00:07:07.819> can<00:07:07.969> do<00:07:08.089> HDR

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 
I really do like is that you can do HDR

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.839 
I really do like is that you can do HDR
painting<00:07:09.229> with<00:07:09.379> it<00:07:09.409> now<00:07:09.830> with<00:07:09.979> HDR<00:07:10.369> painting

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849 
painting with it now with HDR painting

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.719 
painting with it now with HDR painting
you<00:07:11.089> can<00:07:11.269> still<00:07:11.539> choose<00:07:11.809> a<00:07:11.869> low<00:07:12.339> medium<00:07:13.339> and

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
you can still choose a low medium and

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.089 
you can still choose a low medium and
high<00:07:14.300> setting<00:07:14.990> on<00:07:15.110> it<00:07:15.259> I've<00:07:15.529> taken<00:07:15.830> a<00:07:15.949> few

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
high setting on it I've taken a few

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:17.980

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.219 

I<00:07:28.180> felt<00:07:29.180> like<00:07:29.270> when<00:07:29.419> I<00:07:29.479> was<00:07:29.510> using<00:07:29.990> the<00:07:30.080> rich

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:31.659 
I felt like when I was using the rich
black<00:07:30.500> and<00:07:30.710> white<00:07:30.830> mode<00:07:31.070> in<00:07:31.280> the<00:07:31.370> picture

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.760 
just artistic masterpiece so I've had
this<00:07:37.760> camera<00:07:38.120> for<00:07:38.210> about<00:07:38.300> a<00:07:38.389> week<00:07:38.600> now<00:07:38.660> and<00:07:39.229> I'm

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770 
this camera for about a week now and I'm

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.960 
this camera for about a week now and I'm
not<00:07:39.919> going<00:07:40.070> to<00:07:40.130> lie<00:07:40.220> it's<00:07:40.430> really<00:07:40.639> growing<00:07:40.880> on

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:40.970 
not going to lie it's really growing on

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.270 
not going to lie it's really growing on
me<00:07:41.120> for<00:07:41.720> it<00:07:41.810> to<00:07:41.930> be<00:07:42.050> the<00:07:42.229> cheapest<00:07:42.740> compact

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 
me for it to be the cheapest compact

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.890 
me for it to be the cheapest compact
system<00:07:43.430> camera<00:07:43.910> and<00:07:44.030> Sony's<00:07:44.360> lineup<00:07:44.720> right

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:44.900 
system camera and Sony's lineup right

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.290 
system camera and Sony's lineup right
now<00:07:45.050> I<00:07:45.290> really<00:07:46.220> do<00:07:46.340> like<00:07:46.490> it<00:07:46.550> it's<00:07:47.000> not<00:07:47.180> the

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300 
now I really do like it it's not the

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.810 
now I really do like it it's not the
fastest<00:07:47.750> and<00:07:47.990> it's<00:07:48.139> not<00:07:48.320> the<00:07:48.470> best<00:07:48.650> but<00:07:49.040> it's

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:49.820 
fastest and it's not the best but it's

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.980 
fastest and it's not the best but it's
still<00:07:50.030> quick<00:07:50.330> enough<00:07:50.540> for<00:07:50.570> me<00:07:50.840> to<00:07:50.960> really
