00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
 after this movie i have the cinema 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.300
 leave completely distraught 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 Hello everybody 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.139
 the movie factory maps death of the stars is coming 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.050
 Now in theaters and is a movie of 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 David Cronenberg and is such a distant 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 You should not talk so much about it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.850
 tell otherwise you get into the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.849
 I'll try it again 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.429
 small and short summarizes plays 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.740
 in hollywood merckx topstars is the map 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.210
 So the map supposedly indicating where 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 the whole hollywood stars where it is called 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.840
 plays in hollywood and only to these 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.760
 the whole myth is apart once 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.230
 Mr. Werner played by Julie Mohr the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 absolutely wants to finally do the role of her 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.309
 In fact, life gets into the remake 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.350
 from the movie in which her deceased 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
 Mother had the leading role she wanted 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 So play your own mother then 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.460
 is there even the family man 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.199
 played by John Cusack the psychologist 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.750
 psychiatrist is also from hollywood 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.520
 stars and his own son is too 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.559
 his children star completely withdrawn 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.239
 is and he does not even know anymore 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.400
 where is up and down and then there is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.439
 even worse is he is suddenly 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.140
 at once los angeles has a whole 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.630
 strange story is completely disturbed 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.850
 and strangely enough, it gets relatively fast 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.250
 a job namely in men namely as 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.560
 personal assistant and this whole 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.780
 ding with the whole place hollywood myth 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.030
 is completely taken apart and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.140
 he looks like this visually 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.600
 in the trader that speak on the mailbox 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.369
 but damien has to go for it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.200
 looks as is decided and can 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.100
 respect the reasons why the role 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.100
 but it was so important 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.100
 why are they what I call my visit 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.290
 Family at the last season of 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.710
 Gray's goalie the week 300,000 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.280
 deserves what the five then offer 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.750
 I've hired someone 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.150
 It's strange what's up 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.070
 Strange here is not a glamorous one 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.380
 dilemma what is that again 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.780
 she is disfigured in the face she has 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.070
 burns everywhere 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.670
 you know life around as my mother came 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.390
 no, nobody in a fire completely 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.460
 our life we ​​call him rather like 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.990
 suddenly she turns around 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.860
 to look at the city how can you do it 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.440
 be clarified 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.710
 I can not believe it when that really 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.710
 $ 18,000 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.390
 the people from the box have me 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.209
 Called it sees there is in the hospital 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.800
 meant collapsed 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:41.980
 it sounds tactless but do you want the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:44.020
 or not on my forehead 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.810
 friends to each write Transferred hand 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.430
 I your name 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.560
 it's about your sister she is 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.319
 come back I hold for whole 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.410
 important something ready because I see better 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.489
 out as you want this roll but you 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.010
 you will not get it 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.170
 it was like a dream but it was real 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.739
 I am alive and I am 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.739
 not crazy 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.110
 he wants kolberg is known for that 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.360
 he always there to finger presses where it 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.370
 especially he hurts the first time 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.560
 That's why it turned usa 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.750
 Immediately hollywood taken to the chest and 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.450
 I would like to watch the audience once 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.810
 show how is it actually going on and off 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.510
 The cast is really awesome 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.640
 John Cusack is all Julien has been here 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.860
 brilliant or in robert pattinson 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.959
 from him until I'm not there at all 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.840
 great fan of but also in this movie 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.940
 you have to say save is right 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.410
 strong performance even with likely 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.330
 one of the best performance of mine 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.670
 rather in his career 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.270
 he also manages to do it the cliché 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.800
 weigh up against each other and so moments 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.160
 to create where the audience is 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.390
 think so clearly that was logical 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.340
 tell me something new and then really 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.000
 in the next moment directly the screw 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.709
 to turn 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.270
 and that you are very, very, very 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.430
 Surprised there and what also 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.560
 it is interesting that the movie is right 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.420
 mean and evil is still on 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.730
 some pose quite amusing and that 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.769
 partly at the same time so there are 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.750
 Moments you really have to laugh 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.880
 although that is no reason at all 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.410
 for that there is very difficult that in 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.540
 words because he wants cornberg 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.330
 knows films but I believe what 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.410
 I want out that actor 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.120
 such a fantastic achievement 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.950
 lie down is definitely the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.800
 but thanks to director at the same time 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.210
 also an extremely good script what the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.700
 spectators always back to a wrong one 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.110
 The track then sends it to the end 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.810
 to stand and say surprise e 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.820
 mail I want to have with quite different 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.470
 considering I'm really strong and 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.880
 for me in any case straight to the athos 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.770
 area of ​​one of the movies prefer this 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.970
 year should have seen the film is 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.470
 not only in his story very much 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.960
 relentlessly but also in his 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.700
 visual narrative there are 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.660
 Moments then you can see the high 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.220
 society stars also very different and 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.380
 that's how the claim comes in 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.360
 Hollywood star goes completely normal shit 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.100
 everyone else is a brand new one 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.450
 meaning just if you only have july 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.330
 you usually always see them 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.229
 Dirty and very beautiful looks is very 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.550
 I do not want to go crazy anymore 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.870
 betrayed but in any case the 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.700
 would have exciting scene 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.180
 in general, it's just great to see 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.860
 how something happens behind the scenes 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.040
 Unfortunately, loses with kronberg 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.900
 but always very 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.520
 in the clichés and there goes the 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.690
 relevance so a little flute 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.580
 usually if you are just like that 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.950
 satirical to the point is so always 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.140
 only such a piece over it is then 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.430
 it still fits and looks authentic 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.890
 but if you just stop then 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.990
 it loses and so does some 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.090
 minutes only on stereotypes then rest 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.230
 it just works because it is easy 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.240
 not as powerful as if you were 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.270
 Simply right times a raushaut the 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.080
 is a bit too bad nonetheless 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:57.090
 you leave the room with his lousy 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.500
 Feeling and I also had while I was 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.570
 have watched the film ten times already 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.310
 main channel cleared and instagram and 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.960
 twitter and everything deleted i said 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.940
 have okay I better do nothing 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.270
 in this public then the movie 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.820
 can be a bit disillusioned back so 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.770
 all are disturbed all are awful in 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.970
 this this industry 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.260
 and there we are again over the 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.330
 point that's just a bit too 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.410
 cliché overloaded because not everyone is 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.690
 insane 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.360
 but overall, such a powerful film 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.860
 a mellow feeling to go home 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.810
 lets and from you I would like to know what 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.490
 was that the movie he last 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.650
 you saw yourself with queasy 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.880
 feeling left behind when he leaves you 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.920
 not even shocked wrote that 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.600
 below in the comments 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.000
 my personal rating falls 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.800
 Accordingly, also good from eight of 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.500
 there are ten points for max death of the 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.480
 stars great actors really horny 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.920
 story and you just leave the cinema 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.850
 really with his really bad 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.160
 feeling in the belly 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.530
 unfortunately, but then one or the other 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.460
 cliché something out of violence like that 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.800
 I would have a little more 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.540
 fingertip feeling of david cronenberg 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.640
 but desired but it is a strong one 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.620
 movie you should watch eight of 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.570
 ten points for maps death of the stars 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.730
 and who wants to see something else 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.680
 maybe review for example from the movie 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.080
 which now also starts abroad map 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.120
 I link you here and life and 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.380
 If you prefer to watch movies you want them 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.120
 must have seen 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.340
 just linked the whole 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.870
 playlist of the very popular format 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.950
 meanwhile, I'm happy down here 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.720
 right and then we'll meet soon 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:25.850
 again with the film criticism here the 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.850
 film factory with me the domenik
