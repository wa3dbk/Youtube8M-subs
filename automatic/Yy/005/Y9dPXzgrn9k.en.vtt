00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the update but yeah i'll start off with

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.380 
the update but yeah i'll start off with
this<00:00:42.600> mock<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.610> um<00:00:44.610> Chris<00:00:45.090> built<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this mock here um Chris built a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.410 
this mock here um Chris built a
landscape<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.079> mock<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.420> Tatooine

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
landscape for this mock it is a Tatooine

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.770 
landscape for this mock it is a Tatooine
mock<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> yeah<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.039> I'll<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.210> started<00:00:54.539> here

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
mock and yeah so I'll get started here

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
mock and yeah so I'll get started here
so<00:00:55.410> i'll<00:00:55.770> start<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:57.300> base<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.870> mean<00:00:58.250> now

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
so i'll start with the base I mean now

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.549 
so i'll start with the base I mean now
it<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.820> face<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.390> mock<00:01:00.600> you'll<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.379> phase

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it is a face to mock you'll see phase

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.429 
it is a face to mock you'll see phase
two<00:01:01.829> troopers<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> thing<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
two troopers so but the thing is in the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.810 
two troopers so but the thing is in the
base<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.830> guys<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.129> probably<00:01:05.220> recognize

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
base you guys are probably recognize

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.710 
base you guys are probably recognize
that<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.150> used<00:01:07.310> phase<00:01:08.310> one<00:01:08.640> clone<00:01:09.270> bodies

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that I used phase one clone bodies

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.570 
that I used phase one clone bodies
because<00:01:09.990> Chris<00:01:10.350> ran<00:01:10.560> or<00:01:10.890> Chris<00:01:11.130> doesn't<00:01:11.310> have

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
because Chris ran or Chris doesn't have

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.330 
because Chris ran or Chris doesn't have
enough<00:01:11.970> face<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.390> troopers<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:13.020> bodies<00:01:13.350> so

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
enough face two troopers or bodies so

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
enough face two troopers or bodies so
just<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> guys<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.210> base<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.630> used<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
just for the guys in the base I used to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
just for the guys in the base I used to
phase<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.259> trooper<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.130> spammy

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
phase one trooper so don't like spammy

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.080 
phase one trooper so don't like spammy
or<00:01:17.640> flame<00:01:17.939> me<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:19.170> uh<00:01:19.369> yeah<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
or flame me on that but uh yeah so the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.080 
or flame me on that but uh yeah so the
base<00:01:21.439> will<00:01:22.439> start<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.759> speeder

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
base will start here with the speeder

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
base will start here with the speeder
area<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.650> got<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.799> speeder<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
area so you got the speeder you have to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.120 
area so you got the speeder you have to
get<00:01:26.939> repairing<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.470> got<00:01:28.619> whatever<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
get repairing it you got whatever this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.870 
get repairing it you got whatever this
thing<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> generator<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> pump

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
thing is like a generator with a pump

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.609 
thing is like a generator with a pump
pumping<00:01:32.880> into<00:01:33.060> something<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.470> really

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
pumping into something and the really

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.230 
pumping into something and the really
cool<00:01:34.799> thing<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.070> made<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
cool thing I made about this was the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.399 
cool thing I made about this was the
gate<00:01:36.450> right<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.070> now<00:01:38.070> these<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.939> just

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
gate right here now these are just

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.170 
gate right here now these are just
ladders<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.880> know<00:01:42.000> open<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:43.880> like<00:01:44.880> I'll

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
ladders that you know open up like I'll

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.789 
ladders that you know open up like I'll
try<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.420> open<00:01:45.479> them<00:01:45.720> up<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.170> clone<00:01:46.619> is

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
try and open them up here some clone is

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
try and open them up here some clone is
in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> way<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.149> open<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
in the way but they open up so the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.710 
in the way but they open up so the
speeder<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.320> come<00:01:49.470> out<00:01:52.159> notice<00:01:53.159> Pixies<00:01:53.720> but

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
speeder can come out notice Pixies but

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
speeder can come out notice Pixies but
yeah<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.560> thought<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.399> close<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.850> of

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
yeah so I thought that was close kind of

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.200 
yeah so I thought that was close kind of
a<00:01:57.000> first<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.780> me<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.290> design<00:01:58.619> oh

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
a first for me that kind of design oh

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.499 
a first for me that kind of design oh
you<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.409> ladder<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.549> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
you have the ladder going up to this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.959 
you have the ladder going up to this
