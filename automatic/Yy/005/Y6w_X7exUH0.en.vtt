 And then, beauty, I know I usually 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 do top 10 but this theme I do not 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 I managed to find many games and many 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.170
 events that fit the theme that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.270
 I wanted to bring it to you. 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.010
 so I decided to make a top 5 even though 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.449
 anyway even though the half 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.820
 numbers will not be half of the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.410
 quality and I believe it will be up to 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 double because I gave a worked 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.900

 is one of the central characters of the plot and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 his death is considered one of the most 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.280
 notable events of the final story 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 fantasy for being shockingly unexpected 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.390
 the event occurs at the end of the first 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.640
 disc and serves as a motivation for 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.899
 cloud to continue its search for

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.430
 I was really pissed because 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.990
 the most fucking character in the series 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.990
 at least in my opinion 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.200
