00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.699 

well<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.910> think<00:03:20.090> what's<00:03:20.480> what's<00:03:21.080> clear<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.500> that

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
well I think what's what's clear is that

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.860 
well I think what's what's clear is that
both<00:03:22.459> these<00:03:22.670> players<00:03:22.970> actually<00:03:23.510> think<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
both these players actually think the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.259 
both these players actually think the
other<00:03:24.019> guy<00:03:24.230> has<00:03:24.500> nothing<00:03:24.769> I'm<00:03:25.610> trying<00:03:26.000> to

write they you know that's their

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.160 
write they you know that's their
