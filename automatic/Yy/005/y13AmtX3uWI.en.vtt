00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
eight so I was asking her a lot of

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
eight so I was asking her a lot of
pronunciations<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.750> these<00:00:28.080> names<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
pronunciations on these names that I
