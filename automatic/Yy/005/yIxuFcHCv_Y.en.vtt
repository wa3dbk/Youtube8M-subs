welcome<00:00:00.870> back<00:00:01.050> today<00:00:01.740> let's<00:00:02.730> learn<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:03.090> way

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
welcome back today let's learn about way

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.980 
welcome back today let's learn about way
we<00:00:03.990> use<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.650> first<00:00:05.040> gear<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.240> car<00:00:06.450> we're

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
we use the first gear of the car we're

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.650 
we use the first gear of the car we're
starting<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.649> rhythm<00:00:07.980> or<00:00:08.189> when<00:00:09.120> driving<00:00:09.480> an

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
starting the rhythm or when driving an

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.190 
starting the rhythm or when driving an
uphill<00:00:10.080> or<00:00:10.460> while<00:00:11.460> actually<00:00:12.019> he<00:00:13.019> was<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
uphill or while actually he was the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.890 
uphill or while actually he was the
final<00:00:13.740> gear<00:00:14.009> when<00:00:14.429> driving<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.969> hybrid<00:00:15.179> so

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
final gear when driving a hybrid so

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.470 
final gear when driving a hybrid so
before<00:00:16.590> getting<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.060> should<00:00:18.270> know

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
before getting to that you should know

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.260 
before getting to that you should know
the<00:00:18.779> relation<00:00:19.439> between<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:20.730> car<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.240> have

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the relation between the car you have

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.410 
the relation between the car you have
changed<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.230> top<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.920> engine<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:24.000> RPM

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
changed the top of the engine and we RPM

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.470 
changed the top of the engine and we RPM
intention<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.740> let's<00:00:26.010> see<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.970> we<00:00:27.150> use<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
intention now let's see when we use the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.410 
intention now let's see when we use the
first<00:00:27.779> year<00:00:28.340> when<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.490> start<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.970> car<00:00:30.179> or

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
first year when we start a car or

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.770 
first year when we start a car or
driving<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.320> uphill<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:32.279> starting<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.969> car<00:00:33.210> we

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
driving an uphill when starting a car we

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
driving an uphill when starting a car we
need<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.110> maximum<00:00:34.320> talk<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
need the maximum talk because the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.750 
need the maximum talk because the
Whateley<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.450> rest<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> four<00:00:38.340> wheels

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
Whateley is at rest or the four wheels

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.479 
Whateley is at rest or the four wheels
are<00:00:39.140> rustle<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> resistance

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
are rustle so there is a resistance

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.090 
are rustle so there is a resistance
maximum<00:00:42.149> resistance<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.620> start<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
maximum resistance so when we start the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.340 
maximum resistance so when we start the
engine<00:00:44.370> engine<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:45.570> required<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.170> produce

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
engine engine are required to produce

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.639 
engine engine are required to produce
that<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.250> amount<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.760> torque<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.350> we

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that much amount of torque so that we

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
that much amount of torque so that we
can<00:00:49.829> start<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.340> wheels<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.969> rotate<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.899> also

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
can start this wheels to rotate and also

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.930 
can start this wheels to rotate and also
an<00:00:52.350> ocular<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> same<00:00:53.640> situation

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
an ocular so it's the same situation

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
an ocular so it's the same situation
happening<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.530> need<00:00:55.739> maximum<00:00:56.280> torque<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
happening so we need maximum torque and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.750 
happening so we need maximum torque and
the<00:00:57.960> engine<00:00:58.379> delivers<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> maximum<00:00:59.160> torque

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the engine delivers the maximum torque

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
the engine delivers the maximum torque
and<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.690> first<00:01:01.079> gear<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:03.120> minimum<00:01:03.510> speed

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and the first gear and the minimum speed

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.770 
and the first gear and the minimum speed
at<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.409> first<00:01:04.650> wheel<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.430> need<00:01:05.850> maximum

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
at the first wheel so we need maximum

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
at the first wheel so we need maximum
torque<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.350> maximum<00:01:07.890> torque<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> our

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
torque so maximum torque is our

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.789 
torque so maximum torque is our
requirement<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.780> start<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.229> waiter<00:01:10.470> or

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
requirement when we start a waiter or

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.969 
requirement when we start a waiter or
driver<00:01:11.280> Hopkins<00:01:11.820> that's<00:01:12.299> why<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:13.110> select<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
driver Hopkins that's why we select the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
driver Hopkins that's why we select the
first<00:01:14.310> gear<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> maximum

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
first gear which there was the maximum

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.920 
first gear which there was the maximum
bar<00:01:16.650> when<00:01:17.040> starting<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.640> car<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.090> driving<00:01:18.750> an

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
bar when starting a car or driving an

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.859 
bar when starting a car or driving an
uphill<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.700> try<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> behave<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.600> what

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
uphill and when we try to behave in what

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
uphill and when we try to behave in what
happens<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.860> resistance<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
happens is that the resistance is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.340 
happens is that the resistance is
minimum<00:01:24.090> because<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.540> are<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> very

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
minimum because we are going at a very

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.210 
minimum because we are going at a very
high<00:01:25.650> speed

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
high speed

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.090 
high speed
the<00:01:26.580> wheels<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.150> already<00:01:27.470> rotating<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.860> need

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the wheels are already rotating we need

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
the wheels are already rotating we need
the<00:01:29.220> maximum<00:01:29.729> speed<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.570> torque<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the maximum speed and the torque the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520 
the maximum speed and the torque the
requirement<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.159> less<00:01:32.990> because<00:01:33.990> it's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
requirement is very less because it's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.399 
requirement is very less because it's
already<00:01:34.740> rotated<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> be

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
already rotated so what we can do is be

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.899 
already rotated so what we can do is be
the<00:01:38.220> final<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:38.970> when<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.930> try<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.770> highway<00:01:41.729> we

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the final here when we try a highway we

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.499 
the final here when we try a highway we
normally<00:01:42.689> go<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:43.110> 1<00:01:43.320> 2<00:01:43.680> 3<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.280> 4<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.000> 5th<00:01:45.240> gear

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
normally go from 1 2 3 to 4 or 5th gear

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.130 
normally go from 1 2 3 to 4 or 5th gear
and<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.930> available<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.630> it's<00:01:48.630> there

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and it is available so that it's there

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.670 
and it is available so that it's there
was<00:01:49.380> minimum<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.490> maximum<00:01:51.119> space<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.470> be

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
was minimum and maximum space can be

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.639 
was minimum and maximum space can be
achieved<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.549> minimum<00:01:54.270> power<00:01:54.540> means<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.290> fuel

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
achieved so minimum power means the fuel

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.330 
achieved so minimum power means the fuel
economy<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:57.030> much<00:01:57.329> higher<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
economy will be much higher and the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.219 
economy will be much higher and the
spirit<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.880> vehicle<00:02:00.240> will<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.049> its

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
spirit of the vehicle will be at its

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.789 
spirit of the vehicle will be at its
maximum

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
maximum

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.670 
maximum
so<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> toilet<00:02:03.329> worker<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.780> waviness<00:02:04.110> when<00:02:04.560> we

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
so the toilet worker is waviness when we

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.660 
so the toilet worker is waviness when we
drive<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> hybrid<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.820> why

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
drive a hybrid that's why

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.410

so<00:02:10.289> what<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.710> rpm<00:02:11.460> rpm<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.750> simply<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so what is rpm rpm is simply the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.190 
so what is rpm rpm is simply the
revolutions<00:02:14.370> per<00:02:14.430> minute<00:02:14.640> that's<00:02:15.330> simply<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
revolutions per minute that's simply the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.040 
revolutions per minute that's simply the
frequency<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.070> rotation<00:02:17.220> or<00:02:17.790> speed<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.930> is

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
frequency of rotation or speed that is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.520 
frequency of rotation or speed that is
the<00:02:19.080> speed<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:20.040> when<00:02:20.490> an<00:02:20.640> engine<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:22.290> made

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the speed of when an engine and one made

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.830 
the speed of when an engine and one made
that<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.190> rpm

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
that is rpm

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.860 
that is rpm
and<00:02:26.400> Morris<00:02:27.400> thought<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.330> amount<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and Morris thought it is the amount of

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.100 
and Morris thought it is the amount of
rotational<00:02:29.530> power<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:30.430> means<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.330> force<00:02:31.660> or

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
rotational power that means the force or

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.949 
rotational power that means the force or
energy<00:02:32.379> required<00:02:33.310> for<00:02:33.430> an<00:02:33.910> engine<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.780> create

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
energy required for an engine to create

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.820 
energy required for an engine to create
these<00:02:36.060> revolutions<00:02:37.060> okay<00:02:37.989> so<00:02:38.230> that's<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.650> lot

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
these revolutions okay so that's a lot

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.210 
these revolutions okay so that's a lot
better<00:02:39.010> force<00:02:39.489> with<00:02:39.730> West<00:02:40.030> okay<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.530> believe

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
better force with West okay so I believe

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.009 
better force with West okay so I believe
