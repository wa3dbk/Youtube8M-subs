00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.120 

model<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.299> you're<00:01:10.200> looking<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.010> just

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
model so you're looking at this for just

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.910 
model so you're looking at this for just
a<00:01:11.280> replacement<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> 99<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.350> 2000

definitely its stock it can bolt right

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.109 
definitely its stock it can bolt right
on<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.960> what<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.409> right<00:01:22.560> there

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
on it's that's what you get right there

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.969 
on it's that's what you get right there
but<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.600> dealing<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.830> 97<00:01:26.340> 98

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
but if you are dealing with a 97 98

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.039 
but if you are dealing with a 97 98
Wrangler<00:01:28.979> or<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.250> early<00:01:30.000> model<00:01:30.299> YJ<00:01:30.659> Wrangler

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
Wrangler or a early model YJ Wrangler

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
Wrangler or a early model YJ Wrangler
all<00:01:31.710> four<00:01:32.070> leaders<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.520> course<00:01:32.700> 91<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:34.280> 95<00:01:35.280> or

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
all four leaders of course 91 to 95 or

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
all four leaders of course 91 to 95 or
if<00:01:36.630> you've<00:01:36.780> done<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.290> sort<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.530> modification

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
if you've done some sort of modification

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.640 
if you've done some sort of modification
you<00:01:38.189> put<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> four<00:01:38.610> liter<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.909> older<00:01:39.329> Jeep<00:01:39.650> you

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you put a four liter in older Jeep you

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.050 
you put a four liter in older Jeep you
can<00:01:40.829> actually<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.520> upgrade<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.030> well

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
can actually go to this upgrade as well

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.270 
can actually go to this upgrade as well
so<00:01:42.500> essentially<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> wanted<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> verify

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
so essentially what I wanted to verify

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.300 
so essentially what I wanted to verify
is<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:45.439> since<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> harnesses<00:01:47.159> are

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
is that since the harnesses are

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.050 
is that since the harnesses are
different<00:01:48.200> from<00:01:49.200> years<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.829> years<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.399> wanted

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
different from years to years I wanted

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.179 
different from years to years I wanted
to<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> hardware

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to see if all of the hardware

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
to see if all of the hardware
essentially<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.090> comes<00:01:54.299> off<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> old

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
essentially that comes off of the old

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.399 
essentially that comes off of the old
intake<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:56.130> mount<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.119> new<00:01:57.329> intake<00:01:57.750> so

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
intake would mount to the new intake so

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.899 
intake would mount to the new intake so
you<00:01:58.469> could<00:01:58.740> plug<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.159> without<00:01:59.399> having<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
you could plug in without having to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.670 
you could plug in without having to
splice<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.540> put<00:02:00.750> connectors<00:02:01.229> or<00:02:01.469> anything

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
splice or put connectors or anything

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.389 
splice or put connectors or anything

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
on it I'm not going to bolt everything

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.620 
on it I'm not going to bolt everything
down

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630

here's the fuel rail and it goes as you
can<00:02:31.720> see<00:02:31.960> lines<00:02:32.230> up<00:02:32.500> perfectly<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.240> off

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
can see lines up perfectly this is off

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.070 
can see lines up perfectly this is off
the<00:02:34.570> old<00:02:34.720> model<00:02:35.140> YJ<00:02:35.560> this<00:02:35.770> is<00:02:35.950> like<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.240> 93<00:02:37.240> 4

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the old model YJ this is like a 93 4

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.490 
the old model YJ this is like a 93 4
liter<00:02:38.940> intake<00:02:39.940> so<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.480> if<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.020> were<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.200> push

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
liter intake so and if I were to push

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.370 
liter intake so and if I were to push
down<00:02:41.710> in<00:02:41.980> place<00:02:42.240> all<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.300> holes<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.990> can<00:02:44.140> see

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
down in place all the holes you can see

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.340 
down in place all the holes you can see
line<00:02:45.100> up<00:02:45.280> perfectly<00:02:45.490> there<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:47.050> was<00:02:47.170> my

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
line up perfectly there so that was my

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.270 
line up perfectly there so that was my
first<00:02:47.590> concern<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.620> then<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.740> other<00:02:51.070> thing

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
first concern and then the other thing

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280 
first concern and then the other thing
is<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.550> throttle<00:02:51.820> body<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.420> wanted<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.140> make

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
is the throttle body I wanted to make

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.420 
is the throttle body I wanted to make
sure<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:54.220> fit<00:02:54.460> on<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.510> without<00:02:55.840> any<00:02:56.430> hassle

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
sure this fit on so without any hassle

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.400 
sure this fit on so without any hassle
or<00:02:57.580> after<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.000> guy<00:02:58.180> goes<00:02:58.420> on<00:02:58.600> right<00:02:58.900> like<00:02:59.110> so

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
or after that guy goes on right like so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.970 
or after that guy goes on right like so
and<00:02:59.680> I<00:03:00.220> would<00:03:00.400> just<00:03:00.520> tighten<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.240> bolts

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and I would just tighten on the bolts

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.690 
and I would just tighten on the bolts
obviously<00:03:02.980> you're<00:03:03.130> going<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.310> want<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.550> put<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
obviously you're going to want to put a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.190 
obviously you're going to want to put a
new<00:03:03.820> gasket<00:03:03.850> on<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.570> unless<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:04.960> a<00:03:05.080> good

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
new gasket on it unless you have a good

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.440 
new gasket on it unless you have a good
gasket<00:03:05.710> and<00:03:05.860> then<00:03:06.700> your<00:03:06.850> existing<00:03:07.240> harness

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
gasket and then your existing harness

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.760 
gasket and then your existing harness
will<00:03:07.690> plug<00:03:07.780> right<00:03:08.050> in<00:03:08.850> on<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> newer<00:03:10.180> intake

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
will plug right in on the newer intake

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.800 
will plug right in on the newer intake
they<00:03:11.770> have<00:03:12.010> plugged<00:03:12.490> a<00:03:12.820> bolt<00:03:13.240> hole<00:03:13.510> here<00:03:13.780> but

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
they have plugged a bolt hole here but

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.390 
they have plugged a bolt hole here but
I've<00:03:14.050> taken<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.500> out<00:03:14.620> already<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.070> was<00:03:15.130> just<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
I've taken it out already it was just a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.970 
I've taken it out already it was just a
little<00:03:15.520> plastic<00:03:16.030> screw<00:03:16.270> they<00:03:16.390> put<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.980> and

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
little plastic screw they put in and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.960 
little plastic screw they put in and
that<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.310> because<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.480> newer<00:03:19.630> style

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that is because this is the newer style

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.910 
that is because this is the newer style

cable down and everything you can see
one<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.660> clips<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:25.990> I<00:03:26.110> haven't<00:03:26.290> taken

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
one of the clips that I haven't taken

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.220 
one of the clips that I haven't taken
out<00:03:26.710> yet<00:03:26.920> where<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.330> old<00:03:28.510> one<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:29.020> guy

out yet where is the old one this guy

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.920 
out yet where is the old one this guy
here<00:03:29.680> if<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.670> look<00:03:30.850> at<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.060> two<00:03:31.300> side-by-side

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
here if you look at the two side-by-side

one's only got two well the way they

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.460 
one's only got two well the way they
designed<00:03:37.240> this<00:03:37.360> is<00:03:37.540> they<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.720> done<00:03:38.080> screwed

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
perfectly again one two and third is

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.920 
perfectly again one two and third is
back<00:03:45.760> there<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.310> that's<00:03:48.310> about<00:03:48.490> it<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.900> other

things you might have on your old YJ is
a<00:03:54.459> little<00:03:54.820> bit<00:03:54.940> more<00:03:55.090> ports<00:03:55.600> here<00:03:58.050> let's<00:03:59.050> see

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
a little bit more ports here let's see

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.500 
a little bit more ports here let's see
there's<00:03:59.470> four<00:03:59.890> here<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.370> five<00:04:00.610> and<00:04:00.850> then<00:04:00.970> six

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.790 

some<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.660> these<00:04:04.750> are<00:04:04.900> plugged<00:04:05.170> off<00:04:05.410> so<00:04:05.680> you

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
some of these are plugged off so you

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.260 
some of these are plugged off so you
probably<00:04:06.010> won't<00:04:06.370> need<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.730> use<00:04:06.910> all<00:04:07.090> these

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
probably won't need to use all these

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.210 
probably won't need to use all these
this<00:04:07.450> one<00:04:07.600> actually<00:04:07.810> has<00:04:08.170> six<00:04:08.530> as<00:04:08.740> well<00:04:08.920> one

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
this one actually has six as well one

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.610 
this one actually has six as well one
two<00:04:09.430> three<00:04:09.910> four<00:04:10.450> five<00:04:10.660> six<00:04:11.020> they've<00:04:11.290> just<00:04:11.440> put

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
two three four five six they've just put

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.710 
two three four five six they've just put
them<00:04:11.709> in<00:04:11.770> different<00:04:11.860> places<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:12.490> other<00:04:13.420> than

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
them in different places so other than

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.220 
them in different places so other than
that<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.709> last<00:04:14.980> thing<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.730> I<00:04:15.790> haven't

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
that the last thing is and I haven't

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.330 
that the last thing is and I haven't
over<00:04:17.230> should've<00:04:17.500> walked<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.859> over<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.130> tried

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
over should've walked it over and tried

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.599 
over should've walked it over and tried
this<00:04:18.549> but

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
this but

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.439 
this but
see<00:04:21.239> here<00:04:23.509> and<00:04:24.509> I<00:04:24.599> set<00:04:24.870> these<00:04:25.020> side<00:04:25.319> by<00:04:25.470> sides

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
see here and I set these side by sides

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.960 
see here and I set these side by sides
kind<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.539> an<00:04:27.629> over<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:29.250> want<00:04:29.460> they<00:04:29.580> look<00:04:29.789> like

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
kind of an over you want they look like

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.469 
kind of an over you want they look like
next<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.509> each<00:04:30.629> other<00:04:31.520> because<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.909> mounts

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
next to each other because the mounts

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.040 
next to each other because the mounts
you<00:04:34.409> look<00:04:34.560> at<00:04:34.710> here<00:04:35.099> okay<00:04:36.830> here<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:39.479> believe

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
you look at here okay here I believe

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.439 
you look at here okay here I believe
that<00:04:40.229> is<00:04:40.379> where<00:04:41.060> see<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.120> power-steering

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
that is where see the power-steering

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.469 
that is where see the power-steering
bolts<00:04:43.169> up<00:04:43.319> there<00:04:43.879> so<00:04:44.879> there<00:04:45.030> might<00:04:45.240> be<00:04:45.270> a

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
bolts up there so there might be a

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.749 
bolts up there so there might be a
bracket<00:04:46.229> you<00:04:46.379> have<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:48.319> looks<00:04:49.319> like<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:50.610> it's

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
bracket you have to looks like so it's

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.520 
bracket you have to looks like so it's
only<00:04:50.849> two<00:04:51.210> here<00:04:52.969> you<00:04:53.969> have<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.659> don't<00:04:55.469> know

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
only two here you have to I don't know

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.779 
only two here you have to I don't know
you'll<00:04:55.650> have<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.889> look<00:04:56.009> into<00:04:56.159> probably<00:04:56.729> the

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
you'll have to look into probably the

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.770 
you'll have to look into probably the
form<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.300> see<00:04:57.569> how<00:04:58.349> you<00:04:58.409> mount<00:04:58.710> your<00:04:59.389> that<00:05:00.389> but

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
form to see how you mount your that but

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.830 
form to see how you mount your that but
as<00:05:00.990> far<00:05:01.229> as<00:05:01.259> concerned<00:05:02.219> when<00:05:02.430> it<00:05:02.580> goes<00:05:03.509> up<00:05:03.539> to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
as far as concerned when it goes up to

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.810 
as far as concerned when it goes up to
your<00:05:03.990> block

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.000 

mounts<00:05:09.720> are<00:05:09.810> pretty<00:05:10.050> easy<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.560> make<00:05:10.740> on

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
mounts are pretty easy to make on

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.790 
mounts are pretty easy to make on
Wranglers<00:05:11.430> because<00:05:11.730> they're<00:05:11.940> just<00:05:12.650> so<00:05:13.650> this
