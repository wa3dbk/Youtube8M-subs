00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
screws you took apart earlier just

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.970 
screws you took apart earlier just
because<00:02:25.680> they<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.099> different<00:02:26.489> lengths<00:02:27.980> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
you can see the three pin connector

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.350 
you can see the three pin connector
right<00:02:41.940> there

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
right there

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.900 
right there
and<00:02:43.019> now<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.530> flip<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> phone<00:02:44.280> around<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.849> I'm

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and now I flip the phone around and I'm

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.059 
and now I flip the phone around and I'm
gonna<00:02:45.060> start<00:02:45.480> prying<00:02:45.930> down<00:02:46.200> from<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> top<00:02:46.890> of

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
gonna start prying down from the top of

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.750 
gonna start prying down from the top of
the<00:02:47.190> battery<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.890> kind<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> using<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> frame

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the battery just kind of using the frame

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.550 
the battery just kind of using the frame
as<00:02:50.910> leverage<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.510> pushing<00:02:52.049> my<00:02:52.230> pry<00:02:52.530> tool

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
as leverage and pushing my pry tool

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.920 
as leverage and pushing my pry tool
underneath<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.940> battery<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.540> I'm<00:02:54.599> not<00:02:54.750> doing

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
