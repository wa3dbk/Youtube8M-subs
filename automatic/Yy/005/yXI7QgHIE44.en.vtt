 to freeze ice 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.190

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.500
 the skin regenerates and 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.710
 create a one-sided matte gate 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.170
 the skin gets frank force elasticity 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.659

 finished essence in our ice cubes 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.360
 Now form the whole thing in the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.390
 freezer compartment and after a few hours 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.869
