out<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.440> way<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.679> maximize<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.969> space<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:13.019> this

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
out a way to maximize the space in this

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.470 
out a way to maximize the space in this
tiny<00:00:13.830> little<00:00:13.980> cabinet<00:00:14.759> as<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
tiny little cabinet as you can see the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.349 
tiny little cabinet as you can see the
width<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.810> narrow<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.859> each<00:00:20.100> shelf<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
width is narrow on each shelf and the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.439 
width is narrow on each shelf and the
height<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.500> really<00:00:22.949> not<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.550> big<00:00:23.880> so

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
height it's just really not that big so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.170 
height it's just really not that big so
I<00:00:24.900> figured<00:00:25.800> out<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.920> way<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.189> maximize<00:00:26.490> the

I figured out a way to maximize the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.630 
I figured out a way to maximize the
space<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.810> wanted<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.170> utilize<00:00:28.320> all<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.250> space

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
space I wanted to utilize all this space

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.040 
space I wanted to utilize all this space
so<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.939> could<00:00:30.179> put<00:00:30.330> more<00:00:30.510> stuff<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:31.019> here

so I could put more stuff in here

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.709 
so I could put more stuff in here
without<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.650> falling<00:00:31.859> over<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.270> I'll<00:00:33.420> come
