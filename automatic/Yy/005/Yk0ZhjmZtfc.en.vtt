00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Why are we so dependent? 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.020
 This little thing is I know that you are very 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.809
 dependent of the solar can be friends 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.849
 Solar photos but your tablet of these 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.889
 technological things that your voice does not 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.570
 understand why you have so much I 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 I also know you must have thought 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.109
 possibility of having been left without a 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.150
 a week or you've been through a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.619
 very similar situation and you already thought 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.570
 how many things would change if you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.519
 did not have a smartphone for example if 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.619
 Are you with your friends at the bar in you? 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.390
 do not know how to get there or 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.770
 You've just arrived at the bar that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.059
 Do you want to go home responsibly? 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.620
 when you get back from there u already stopped for 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.210
 thinking that you would have to start 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 ask for information I know it seems 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.340
 bizarre saying that but it 's something that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.260
 It really does not happen a few more times. 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 of today but unfortunately you get there 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.710
 the mobile you look at google maps 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.500
 how are you going to come home and 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.750
 independent if you are by bus trains if 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.610
 Do you want to take a taxi anyway? 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.920
 I just wondered, is it easier? 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 you any PT unless he 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.359
 Speak the following phrase that frightens 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 any passenger who has arrived at a 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.689
 very funny situation happened another 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.610
 literature day a friend of mine and the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.490
 people were going to fall after we did not know 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.189
 how to get from there to the bar and she started 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.900
 to look a smartphone it by laser 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.460
 application called and what to do 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.189
 he was not working he was 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.930
 giving a totally wrong way and the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.970
 that she had always forgotten that she had 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.340
 car gps then basically is the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 replace a gps from smartphone 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.110
 give something else also what happens with 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.790
 frequency is bar discussion if the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.710
 Rolling staff arguing a lot 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.140
 time and will have a void does not stop there I 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.759
 I'll confirm this one and speak google. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.700
 regardless of whether you have 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.070
 discussing about some actor has accumulated a 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.649
 movie is not sure he did not do it 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.930
 did another film get there also in the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.490
 Google and you're going to need them is a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.979
 person that last year I got to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.070
 lose two cellphones no not lost type 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.890
 on the street and stole two cell phones one 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.930
 armed and another was with useless knife at last 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 to do is ask two cell phones so I 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.620
 I had some periods that I was without 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 cell phone and really have had 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.490
 great changes great changes can 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.899
 chatted with friends this is a 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.150
 very good conversation, talk to the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.070
 stolen friends sure we will not go 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.260
 have patience for that cell phone trash 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.880
 then you will get much more expected 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.700
 what is happening there at that time? 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.190
 The problem is when all your friends and 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.830
 smartphone does not really care about you and you 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.200
 that moment of five minutes of 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 Until that one answered the attack 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.530
 So, by the way, take the phone or talk to the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.190
 cell phone is also there in the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.860
 cell phone 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.510
 and then you do not have a smartphone anymore 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.000
 and so it should be 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.860
 Look to see you, that little boy passed by. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.690
 Football, you have to like it a lot. 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.360
 interested even did not like football 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.860
 we may not notice that some 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.510
 changes were made for example 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.000
 whatsapp today nobody else send 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.130
 sms to be a good friend of yours I know that 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 you do it because I also spent I 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.489
 a friend had his body so today a 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.780
 new shipment you will laugh your first 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.220
 Real only you laugh today is 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.620
 basically this is that the people I 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.420
 it's only my parents because they do not 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.579
 adhered to the technology I honestly 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.200
 I do not know how they know how to live like this. 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.390
 as much as you are a lucky 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.980
 life you 've never been stolen 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.660
 you have not stayed cell law 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.459
 That moment you had to leave. 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.650
 the cell phone a tour and pick up a 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.950
 substitute you are simply the person 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.870
 luckier but when the battery runs out 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.880
 I know you complicate the cell phone. 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.730
 replaced the mp3 that we the people 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.440
 had a cell phone any mp3 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.329
 he not only one side you already hear everything 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.190
 today for you have the notion 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.140
 technology must say that is proof 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.600
 type of water until then it was only water 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.790
 own self underwater and 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.260
 something else too 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.150
 as we have seen your mouth from 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.340
 technology, we also often 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.219
 make up new excuses for example 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.780
 I still have not seen your message April the sap 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.719
 because you can just close 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.939
 that small screen and close all SAP and 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.829
 see the initial message who sent you to 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.629
 message you can simply 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.099
 want the attack because you do not know who 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.689
 maybe you have not been such a person 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.489
 interesting for you that sent for 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.870
 You 're leaving home already, for example. 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.879
 said you're in the middle of the road 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.799
 But I want to hear from you too. 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.769
 worst experience you've ever had 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.150
 because I do not have a smartphone or I do not know why 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.639
 that you were robbed because you did not have 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.520
 battery and what things do you think 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.680
 that would change even if you did not use it 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.320
 a smartphone and sure do not 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.030
 I liked and liked this video or 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.070

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.470
