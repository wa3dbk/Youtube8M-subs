00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.359
 proud to make these paper cups to 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.450
 which we are going to give a different use 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.059
 to drink water in them we will use them 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.719
 to put things inside only 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.860
 we need a rule we need something 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.890
 with marking scissors adhesive pencil 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.410
 colored or white or patterned sheets 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.630
 on both sides and stamps for 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.840
 decorate them 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 ok let's start taking our 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 ruler 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.600
 and marking a line of 20 centimeters 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:48.180
 vertical and then we mark the horizontal 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.180
 we need a square of 20 x 20 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.670
 Now we take our scissors and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.670
 we just cut it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.260
 they will have a glass more or less 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.720
 size of a real cone of cones that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.450
 you drink water that you want to make them more 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.710
 big buy a card and do it 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 of 25 by 25 or 30 by 30 can 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 increasing the five centimeters in 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.910
 five and so they are going to have the size that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.910
 want 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.630
 now let's proceed to do our 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.299
 little glass let's take the corner and the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.440
 let's join with the other corner and we 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.440
 there will be a triangle 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.980
 and we mark the folds well 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.909
 that we stay all right and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.640
 aligned 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.520
 the right tip of the triangle 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.799
 we move to the left side and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.869
 we mark the fold and the left tip 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.869
 we passed it to the right side 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.780
 and we double-check again 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.020
 now up 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.810
 the triangles are going to be 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.569
 you're going to put it in the triangle of 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.980
 down so they are going to open it 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.980
 and they're going to put them there 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.370
 and good to mark well 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.340
 and the other one we simply fold it towards 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.310
 behind 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.800
 and it's already ready in our glass so 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.400
 simple just have to open it by 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.200
 the middle 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.200
 and it is ready to be used 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.440
 now let's decorate 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.370
 I'll use santistas or magazine clippings 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.370
 what comes to mind 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.860
 and ready 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 well let's do it again ok 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.440
 simple we take the corner towards the other 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.880
 corner 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880
 to form a triangle 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.150
 the right corner we take to the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.150
 left side 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.830
 and we mark the fold 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.160
 the left corner we passed to the 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.160
 right side 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.360
 we mark the fold 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.380
 we put the tip 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.539
 we double 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.230
 we ensure the fold 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.440
 and let's see the other triangle towards 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.440
 behind 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.009
 that simple 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.280
 next well be the vegetable 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.720
 correct because they will see how all 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.200
 you are going to realize is where 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.630
 it's thicker obviously 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.600
 and good and we have to decorate 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.510
 can choose any subject can 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.590
 put the flowers can choose what 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:01.240
 you want 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.240
 and the joke of these two landmarks 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.199
 is that we are going to fill them 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.890
 of popcorn 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.420
 they can be candy popcorn with 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.420
 colored sugar 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.889
 only the most full of the top 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.400
 and ready 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:39.040
 You can also fill it with candy 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:41.170
 pallets of sugar cubes 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.810
 anything you can think of that 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.570
 permee a small cup to give these 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.050
 wonderful only put them in a 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.550
 cellophane bag 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.550
 they close them with a ribbon 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.650
 and they make a doll that looks very cute 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.580
 because it was not for a party is the 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:11.229
 I remember for something or it's a present and 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.229
 you have to see always very nice 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:29.689
 and they 're going to have something like that they can 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:32.419
 do it of all sizes I hope that 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:34.689
 you liked it and upload photos of what 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.689
 make 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.889
 see you in the next video I hope that 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.889
 like it
