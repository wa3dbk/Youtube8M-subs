00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 before starting with what would be the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 video guys tell you two things very 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.690
 important the first is that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.780
 surely as this video I have uploaded 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
 very soon you have a second video to the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.400
 normal time of every day between 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.830
 9 and 10 and the second thing I wanted 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690
 comment is that if you know friends or 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.359
 people who have this problem that stops 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.830
 very bad connection etcetera etcetera 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 pass this video to you if all 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.840
 we can play well so if nothing else 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.640
 what to say we go to it like being in 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.710
 sale right now on screen this is the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.440
 typical problem that we have to play at 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 white color 3 puts us in connection not 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.610
 established and he begins to give us the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.620
 that you awesome guys but very 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.030
 impressive lips as you are 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 watching right now here connection 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.170
 I jump interrupted want to kill 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 that guy and he can not even point him 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.780
 in the end it ends up killing is awesome 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.579
 how bad is the connection in this valid 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 and what we should do to improve 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.960
 the connection guys so the main thing 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.500
 would be to get out of the juicy game that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.300
 we are not going to stay there all the time 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.159
 making the fool not and the main thing that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.480
 we have to do is give it to look for the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.400
 part 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.950
 that we want either domain search and 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.780
 destroy by equipment etcetera and we 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.550
 will always look for departure 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.620
 looking for a party looking for a game and not 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.510
 will find game never by change not 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.490
 has happened before knowing this great 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.290
 council of this trujillo that no 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.520
 I found game guys then what 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.100
 what you have to do is stay there 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.570
 within quiet domain because it's not going 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.490
 to be nothing complicated what we have to 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.770
 do and we have to get into what 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.200
 would be the triangle in 100 the social and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.940
 we get to the recent players and 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.070
 what we have to do is invite them to 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.720
 all that each of them this I what 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.340
 practiced because I was when with 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.200
 subscribers that sincerely has 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.480
 greatly improved the connection at the time of 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.070
 the kids games and then when 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.840
 go joining the players as it would be 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.790
 watching right now on screen they go 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.070
 getting into your team and little by little 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.930
 is going to fill the whole lobby guys and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.090
 so you can have a domain game 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.520
 as with your connection and everything will go 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.320
 perfect in guys so nothing to prove it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.910

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.100

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.380
 beginning kids second video then

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.610
 quite so I do not expect anything 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.800
