00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
food productions here to show you how we

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.370 
food productions here to show you how we
can<00:00:08.820> record<00:00:09.179> with<00:00:09.510> electronic<00:00:10.230> drums<00:00:12.380> one

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
can record with electronic drums one

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.910 
can record with electronic drums one
thing<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.940> route<00:00:15.780> all<00:00:16.289> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
thing I like to do is I I route all the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.689 
thing I like to do is I I route all the
outputs<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.850> all<00:00:18.029> these<00:00:18.180> tracks<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.869> one

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
outputs from all these tracks to one

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.250 
outputs from all these tracks to one
track<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.180> case<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.600> master<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.609> then

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
track in this case this master and then

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.960 
track in this case this master and then
install<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> compressor<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.970> used

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
install a compressor and it just used

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.479 
install a compressor and it just used
this<00:00:31.099> complete<00:00:32.099> mix<00:00:32.780> preset<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:34.980> adjust

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this complete mix preset and then adjust

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.830 
this complete mix preset and then adjust
my<00:00:35.790> game<00:00:36.829> based<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.420> based<00:00:39.660> on

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
my game based on it's really based on

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.750 
my game based on it's really based on
what<00:00:40.079> your<00:00:40.260> input<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.129> how<00:00:41.219> really<00:00:41.550> loud

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
what your input is and how really loud

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.910 
what your input is and how really loud
it<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.870> particular<00:00:43.050> case<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.770> already

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
it is in this particular case I already

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.150 
it is in this particular case I already
know<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.489> bump<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:46.350> 6<00:00:46.739> DB

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
know I can bump this up about 6 DB

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.819 
know I can bump this up about 6 DB
basically<00:00:48.090> what's<00:00:48.300> happened<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.110> when

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
basically what's happened here is when

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.000 
basically what's happened here is when
it<00:00:49.950> went<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> compressor<00:00:51.739> some<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it went into the compressor some of the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.660 
it went into the compressor some of the
volume<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.969> lost<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.100> makes<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.640> for

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
volume was lost and so this makes up for

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.920 
volume was lost and so this makes up for
that<00:00:57.420> volume<00:00:58.289> loss<00:00:59.359> little<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.510> complicated

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
that volume loss little more complicated

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.369 
that volume loss little more complicated
than<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.359> starting<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> compressor

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
than that but starting with a compressor

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.929 
than that but starting with a compressor
on<00:01:04.530> your<00:01:05.040> mix<00:01:05.450> gives<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.810> big<00:01:07.710> leg<00:01:08.520> up<00:01:08.549> on

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
on your mix gives you a big leg up on

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.890 
on your mix gives you a big leg up on
getting<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.900> mix<00:01:10.140> done<00:01:10.380> quickly<00:01:11.630> let's<00:01:12.630> watch

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
getting the mix done quickly let's watch

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.010 
getting the mix done quickly let's watch
the<00:01:13.200> compressor<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.920> action<00:01:14.340> there's<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> job

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
the compressor in action there's a job

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.539 
the compressor in action there's a job
the<00:01:18.020> level<00:01:18.469> right<00:01:19.189> here<00:01:20.049> is<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:22.570> full<00:01:23.570> output

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
the level right here is a full output

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.760 
the level right here is a full output
every<00:01:25.549> pet<00:01:25.819> would<00:01:26.000> in<00:01:26.119> effect<00:01:26.149> be<00:01:26.569> if<00:01:27.079> we<00:01:27.259> mix

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
every pet would in effect be if we mix

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.330 
every pet would in effect be if we mix
this<00:01:28.009> down<00:01:28.310> right<00:01:28.340> now<00:01:28.819> to<00:01:29.240> make<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.829> sign<00:01:30.829> an

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
this down right now to make a sign an

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.029 
this down right now to make a sign an
mp3<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:32.149> WAV<00:01:32.479> file<00:01:33.399> this<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.759> levels<00:01:36.039> we'd

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
mp3 or WAV file this is the levels we'd

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.099 
mp3 or WAV file this is the levels we'd
be<00:01:37.340> having<00:01:37.610> now<00:01:38.299> if<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:38.539> click<00:01:38.600> here<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:41.109> close

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
be having now if I click here I close

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.300 
be having now if I click here I close
this<00:01:42.880> this<00:01:43.880> is<00:01:44.090> telling<00:01:44.479> me<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.840> my<00:01:45.079> peak<00:01:45.619> is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
this this is telling me that my peak is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.499 
this this is telling me that my peak is
at<00:01:46.939> negative<00:01:48.489> point<00:01:49.489> 1<00:01:49.909> dB<00:01:50.750> in<00:01:51.679> other<00:01:51.860> words

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
at negative point 1 dB in other words

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.330 
at negative point 1 dB in other words
point<00:01:53.509> 0<00:01:54.049> would<00:01:54.829> be<00:01:54.969> right<00:01:55.969> at<00:01:56.289> peak<00:01:57.289> so<00:01:58.069> we're

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
point 0 would be right at peak so we're

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.880 
point 0 would be right at peak so we're
one<00:01:58.939> tenth<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.539> a<00:01:59.630> decibel<00:02:00.280> below<00:02:01.280> peak<00:02:02.890> which

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
one tenth of a decibel below peak which

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.219 
one tenth of a decibel below peak which
is<00:02:04.039> ideal
