00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 and there we are with the notebook here 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:13.200
 hp to see four then which defect 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.980
 of this notebook 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.800
 he arrived on our tour which 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:25.439
 I called and it did not give a picture 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:29.519
 It turns out that he was digging his nose. 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.240
 once is the chapter everything was not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 flashing 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.210
 only it was once that interne try 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.850
 always looking once then to the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.129
 check on hp's website if the codes 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.090
 that this floor he is a code of 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.059
 error then checking on a website of the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.559
 hp the error code when a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.289
 instead means processor then notebook 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.770
 indicating that there is a fault in the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.879
 processor when you open a notebook the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.220
 people noticed that there is a trail or 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.780
 show who you are oh the hole was 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:16.020
 completely uprooted here existed 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:19.740
 capacitors 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.390
 shortened and caused the breakup 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.759
 of the track and burned those 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.689
 capacitors 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:32.909
 so what was done in this notebook 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.650
 happens that this name when we see 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.240
 is this error code blood and once 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.350
 everyone will soon want to change the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.470
 processor or else it will try to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.810
 solder and chipset but see the following content 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.619
 the error code was the process of pain 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 only that it verifies in the electric scheme in 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.310
 realized that this is what this 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.430
 theory that has been broken, 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.280
 capacitors is just in the line of v 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.429
 Co which is the line processor 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.710
 so why the laptop to dig it 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.740
 the processor was 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.080
 say burned but in this case the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.440
 process was not burnt was just 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.390
 not aligned in nail not beyond the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.120
 record-setting process was not being 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.560
 fed due to this breach 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.570
 these tracks 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.200
 then it was done only with scheme 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.720
 I put a wire here calling from 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.150
 one of the capacitors that are part of this 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.510
 track and I called directly lunch 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.880
 Buffet then do it 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.330
 The notebook is already working. 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.660
 Calling already normalized so I'll call 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.250
 Here for you only in the time that I go 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.170
 turn on the notebook to show that it is 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.800
 working here in making'll call the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.800
 power 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.370
 Thank you for showing me the screen. 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.130
 it was just a minute 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.290
 connect loose here lcd show is 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.290
 put on 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.750
 I'm connected again 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:05.010
 hp notebook there working so's there 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.370
 staff plus one bug fixed 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.530
 one more plate fixed then that's it 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.530
 ok the hug is worth it
