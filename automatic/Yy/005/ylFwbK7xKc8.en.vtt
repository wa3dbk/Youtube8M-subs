00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
running side by side on these a little

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.040 
running side by side on these a little
little<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.149> hopefully<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.750> that

screen size is not actually as huge as
it<00:01:02.969> used<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> new<00:01:08.280> 3ds<00:01:08.670> XL

next to the smaller new 3d s I don't

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.280 
next to the smaller new 3d s I don't
actually<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.540> console<00:01:15.540> itself<00:01:15.900> quite

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
actually like the console itself quite

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.380 
actually like the console itself quite
as<00:01:16.439> much<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> XL<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> nice

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
as much on the XL it's not not the nice

as much on the XL it's not not the nice
coloring<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> buttons

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
coloring on the buttons

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.520 
coloring on the buttons
it<00:01:20.280> feels<00:01:20.580> really<00:01:20.880> huge<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> point<00:01:22.409> where

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it feels really huge to the point where

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
it feels really huge to the point where
it's<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:22.770> slightly<00:01:23.159> unwieldy<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
it's actually slightly unwieldy but the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.070 
it's actually slightly unwieldy but the
screen<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.500> nice<00:01:25.710> quality<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
screen is really nice quality and it is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.210 
screen is really nice quality and it is
certainly<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.290> colorful<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> bit<00:01:29.130> less

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
certainly more colorful and a bit less

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.999 
certainly more colorful and a bit less
Pixley<00:01:29.640> looking<00:01:29.970> than<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.450> original<00:01:30.869> 3ds<00:01:31.799> XL

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
Pixley looking than the original 3ds XL

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.370 
Pixley looking than the original 3ds XL
screen<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.729> side<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:35.759> side<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.630> these

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
screen so side by side you can see these

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
screen so side by side you can see these
two<00:01:37.650> are<00:01:37.680> exactly<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.490> same<00:01:38.640> size<00:01:38.880> pretty

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
two are exactly the same size pretty

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.880 
two are exactly the same size pretty
much<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.930> move<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.770> more

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
much just move that back to the more

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.889 
much just move that back to the more
interesting<00:01:40.920> icon<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:45.060> main<00:01:45.270> advantage

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
interesting icon so the main advantage

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.319 
interesting icon so the main advantage
of<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:49.220> over<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.790> screen<00:01:51.119> size

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
of this one over this one is screen size

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.999 
of this one over this one is screen size
but<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.200> again<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.470> one's<00:01:52.680> got<00:01:52.799> quite<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
but then again this one's got quite a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.010 
but then again this one's got quite a
nice<00:01:53.189> form<00:01:53.460> factor<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.450> you'll<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
nice form factor so you'll have to

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.240 
nice form factor so you'll have to
decide<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.350> yourself<00:01:55.409> which<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> those<00:01:56.189> is

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
decide for yourself which of those is

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.060 
decide for yourself which of those is
more<00:01:56.490> important<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.000> you
