think we're gonna see the green or white
Ranger<00:00:57.360> though<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.500> gonna<00:00:58.620> focus

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
Ranger though I think it's gonna focus

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.189 
Ranger though I think it's gonna focus
mainly<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> first<00:00:59.879> five<00:01:00.149> Rangers<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
mainly on the first five Rangers and the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.039 
mainly on the first five Rangers and the
villains<00:01:01.559> Rita<00:01:02.010> Repulsa<00:01:02.300> Goldar<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.870> on

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
villains Rita Repulsa Goldar and so on

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.500 
villains Rita Repulsa Goldar and so on
since<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> gonna<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> reboot<00:01:05.939> that's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
since this is gonna be a reboot that's

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
since this is gonna be a reboot that's
the<00:01:06.689> impression<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.400> also<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.760> think

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the impression I get also I don't think

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.730 
the impression I get also I don't think
the<00:01:09.270> movies<00:01:09.540> gonna<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> dark<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> gritty

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the movies gonna have a dark and gritty

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.920 
the movies gonna have a dark and gritty
theme<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> fan<00:01:12.090> film<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.630> think

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
theme to it like in the fan film I think

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
theme to it like in the fan film I think
it'll<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.409> serious<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.430> overly<00:01:14.790> serious

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it'll be serious but not overly serious

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.300 
it'll be serious but not overly serious
will<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> brand<00:01:16.770> new<00:01:16.830> cast<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
will they have a brand new cast of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.920 
will they have a brand new cast of
characters<00:01:17.369> since<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.240> will<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> reboot

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
characters since this will be a reboot

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.530 
characters since this will be a reboot
they<00:01:19.740> might<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.360> might

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
they might but I think they just might

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
they might but I think they just might
recast<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.259> original<00:01:22.650> characters<00:01:23.100> with

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
recast the original characters with

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.070 
recast the original characters with
newer<00:01:23.490> actors<00:01:24.000> since<00:01:24.600> they're<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> most

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
newer actors since they're the most

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
newer actors since they're the most
memorable<00:01:25.439> ones

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
memorable ones

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.660

think<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:25.740> whenever<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.190> MMPR<00:02:26.850> fan<00:02:27.210> film<00:02:27.450> is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
think that whenever the MMPR fan film is

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.690 
think that whenever the MMPR fan film is
finished<00:02:27.890> there<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:29.100> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.430> be<00:02:29.550> that

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
finished there is going to be that

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.030 
finished there is going to be that
question<00:02:30.330> on<00:02:30.540> whether<00:02:30.930> or<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.140> Saban<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.950> do

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
question on whether or not Saban can do

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.340 
question on whether or not Saban can do
better<00:02:32.310> or<00:02:32.610> if<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.300> still<00:02:33.540> put<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.170> good

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350
