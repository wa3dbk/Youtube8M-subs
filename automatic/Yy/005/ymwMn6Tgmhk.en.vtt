00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it doesn't screw all the way down so you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.969 
it doesn't screw all the way down so you
still<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.729> threads<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:21.979> little

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
still see the threads and it is a little

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.690 
still see the threads and it is a little
dirty<00:01:23.159> inside<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:26.549> that

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
dirty inside there you would think that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.210 
dirty inside there you would think that
they<00:01:26.939> could<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.390> least<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:28.220> shot

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
they could have at least you know shot
some<00:01:29.490> compressed<00:01:30.090> air<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.360> something<00:01:30.869> through

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
some compressed air or something through

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.230 
some compressed air or something through
here<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:31.950> least<00:01:32.130> flushed<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.610> out<00:01:32.759> before

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
here or at least flushed it out before

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.560 
here or at least flushed it out before
selling<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.590> sending<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:36.479> know

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570

nice machining
everything<00:02:10.519> looks<00:02:10.819> nice<00:02:11.569> smooth<00:02:12.379> even

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.869 

alright<00:02:16.700> let's<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:18.489> what<00:02:19.489> this<00:02:19.640> thing<00:02:19.849> looks

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
alright let's see what this thing looks

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.199 
alright let's see what this thing looks
like<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.480> dark<00:02:20.659> -<00:02:20.959> oh<00:02:21.879> wait<00:02:22.879> before<00:02:23.060> that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
like in the dark - oh wait before that

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.970 
like in the dark - oh wait before that
this<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.690> what<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.019> comes<00:02:27.140> with<00:02:27.319> mounting

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
this is what it comes with mounting

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:39.960 
this is what it comes with mounting
brackets<00:02:29.409> okay<00:02:30.440> let's<00:02:31.010> show<00:02:31.909> that<00:02:31.940> first

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.780 

these<00:02:40.970> they<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:41.870> slip<00:02:42.470> right<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:43.129> like<00:02:43.549> this

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
these they just slip right on like this

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.509 
these they just slip right on like this
and<00:02:45.730> they're<00:02:46.730> actually<00:02:46.879> pretty<00:02:47.180> strong<00:02:47.540> I

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
and they're actually pretty strong I

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.039 
and they're actually pretty strong I
thought<00:02:49.519> they<00:02:49.639> would<00:02:49.760> have<00:02:49.790> been<00:02:49.970> pretty<00:02:50.120> kind

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
thought they would have been pretty kind

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.860 
thought they would have been pretty kind
of<00:02:51.139> weak<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.500> wouldn't<00:02:51.920> hold<00:02:52.040> too<00:02:52.280> well<00:02:52.459> but

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
of weak and wouldn't hold too well but

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:02.110 
of weak and wouldn't hold too well but
they<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:53.930> pretty<00:02:54.440> good<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.889> it's<00:03:01.790> nice<00:03:01.940> as

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
they do pretty good and it's nice as

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.280 
they do pretty good and it's nice as
they're<00:03:02.269> cleared<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.659> I'm<00:03:02.780> getting<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.139> way

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
they're cleared that I'm getting the way

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.629 
they're cleared that I'm getting the way
either<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:05.900> right<00:03:07.329> these<00:03:08.329> are<00:03:09.260> your<00:03:10.159> nuts<00:03:10.340> and
