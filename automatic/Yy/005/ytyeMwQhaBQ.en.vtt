00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.289
 First of all, welcome to our 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.359
 modern block and do not scare you 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.740
 The pond looks a bit broken 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.199
 at the moment but that would have one 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.429
 landowners temporarily 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.800
 emigrated is not only in 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.439
 germany but has another 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.669
 temporarily withdrawn and 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.100
 Can you remember him before some 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.840
 days now I have not as the the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.579
 temporal relation because we which blog 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.199
 will be released on some days 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.360
 we had a pond presented by 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.160
 Andreas Gössl had mentioned that he 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.510
 this care also wants people in the 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.829
 Holidays are when people are not anymore 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.430
 but can not take care of it anymore 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.710
 want to do 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.090
 and so takes care of this part too 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.890
 Here I asked myself 50,000 plant 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.269
 also with drum find the plant the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.629
 I'll show you the filter system right away 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.600
 and as long as the family is in theirs 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.619
 extended vacation is their 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.390
 temporary domicile andreas dom 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.979
 everything and the way you are here at the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.000
 Water quality at the between singers 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.520
 did that very well 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.280
 One could also have been by some koi's 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.460
 maybe a bit impressed here 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.369
 one of the most beautiful operas we know 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 the organizers know german 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.140
 Of course, building finma will not work 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.490
 single story gave back somewhere 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.229
 in Japan times a bloodline over the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.890
 Ogata buyers have the often times 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.210
 but how did I know where from ? 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.740
 today is just an byproduct in the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.720
 German-speaking Switzerland and the German 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.990
 Coach also not bred so often 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.270
 are we perfectly clear back there down 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.369
 are actually the mainstay of why you 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.270
 really declined significantly during 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.340
 more and more machine so mark 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.530
 they are also rarely prohibited 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.390
 and in the quality are even very 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.860
 seldom then is another fisherman 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.009
 not from is and us is his brother 1 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.020
 1 kg kink you sony is outstanding then 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.380
 from us a world class team ico some 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.330
 very good karasik and one 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.080
 top-class can okazaki I show 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.940
 then right now 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.200
 and yes the pond is 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.370
 very important if you have longer 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.990
 Change time or I can 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.150
 actually recommend to almost everyone 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.710
 is on vacation and you have the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.840
 possibility to cover the pond 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.550
 Do you think there is always a fish? 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.350
 he might be jumping there 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.100
 even the life of the not yet again 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.620
 back in the pond and this is here 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.510
 Just prepare everything very well 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.360
 and i know andreas as well as you come 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.800
 here 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.080
 three times a week arrive at the facility 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.730
 he has your photo automat and i would 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.320
 let's say about the stocking density of everything 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.270
 That's not what we do now 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.880
 the power should fail that here 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.100
 the big dying starts right away 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.570
 outside area anyway but not there 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.340
 we already had a blogger sign 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.920
 let me show you the fish 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:07.540
 we make the filter system here 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:07.540
 I just had to take care of it 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:21.140
 Of course, sitting down there is relative 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.080
 difficult after at the direct 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.989
 Sunlight is not always film 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:33.019
 really simple but down there sense 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:37.640
 because his commitment has janko but 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.849
 So either way 80 centimeters allowed me 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.489
 the estimated so really 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:53.420
 Imposing is her here we see in the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:56.450
 everything just because of that 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.860
 body length of the kg kinky luxury very 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.549
 Well, here we have it 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:10.190
 okazaki also madness very much 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:13.280
 beautiful fisherman is the fish of us 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.030
 was at oliver gies this the way down 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.030
 skier and suri 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:30.840
 then this time biologically the 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.840
 big shy 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.099
 a big help 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:59.649
 down there we do not have the few yet 

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.649
 jimmy's turn 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.869
 so and now I show them the 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.869
 filter system is the camera already below 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.509
 and here is an example so the filter 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.949
 works but if you lock this 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.310
 from 20 to half a meter further 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:26.009
 would have offset right would certainly 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:30.470
 have been more meaningful because these are the 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.789
 usual the remaining filter plants the 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.500
 simply too tight we are 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.479
 have one back here 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.430
 drum filter from the company circle that 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:43.169
 is what andreas installed 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.430
 then we have here once then 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.199
 Here again a cold it came too 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.060
 partly moved to partly static like 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.669
 you can see you have one more here 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.270
 growth filled add a huge error 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:57.030
 built and then stop to the usual 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.719
 madness never a gram portion 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.240
 plant that is here on the Abräumer 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.449
 there are actions registered in the water 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.699
 you can also all here in stainless steel 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.830
 But it works alone 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.199
 I have to run here 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.050
 Difficulties can be any amount of air 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.560
 could have three of the right air pump 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.969
 collection 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:26.120
 we have a normal push i can 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:28.409
 340 altogether believe five air pumps 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.389
 Maybe because of the reason 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:34.110
 now at the moment it does not mean that you 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:37.770
 then again just over several 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.409
 way hedges to prevent that 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.819
 if one fails, the larger one 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.000
 Damage happens then you have now 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:50.909
 in the follow up here much more 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.590
 switched can briefly show then you have 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:54.270
 yes, once again a giant find a bio 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.090
 chamber because the just before the 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.710
 existing fish stock was not enough 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.009
 Has 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:04.819
 that have as here that is not only at 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:07.830
 he was probably improved 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:10.289
 but also here and we have first 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.990
 outside look important too if the 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.719
 ph value due to missing carbon once 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.680
 Crashes that there is enough capital here 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.080
 nachschießen 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.760
 The annoying thing is before the fish 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.400
 first stop a biofilter and 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.810
 So a support of the pH value due 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.930
 lack of carbonates is easy 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.600
 an annoying especially unnecessary 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:36.830
 history so that's had Andreas 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.390
 they are neither reconstructed 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.310
 After the plant in the care 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:43.490
 has taken over because as I said that there 

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:46.010
 below that i can get out of one hand and 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.330
 that certainly is the way they are 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.950
 another plant seen 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.950
 in this sense until the next blog
