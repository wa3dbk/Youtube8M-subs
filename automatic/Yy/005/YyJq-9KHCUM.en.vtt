 but the general before him even go there 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.920
 it's a small plot 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.290
 a happening that come from the united states 1011 including that of the best

 hydrogen and oxygen 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.739
 so we go

 water that go down several months 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.379
 as for him seems 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.649
 to the generators 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.680

 milan 14 years 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.759
 so here in the second half of its members 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.789
 last year among the other names of birds at the time of the events 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:15.789
 it seems difficult 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:20.809
 we will try to extinguish the fire 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.999
 to make it work 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.049
 for geoffrey and married and then we'll have the order reduction for the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.289
 it is in this sense 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:16.699
 then asked 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.239
 it was question of whether it is used 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.239
 this assistance is from 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.080
 he is foolish 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.039
 achieve a

 the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.879
 how it got installed is what this generator follow 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.669
 on this vehicle 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.719
 well because man imposes 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.870
 these passionate mechanics of the conflict 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.870
 the least discovered being always passionate about vincennes wood 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.680
 ecology-the Greens xmas mamere boulouparis others would agree 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 but found on the internet the firat press agency 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.970
 the cause would be a good idea to ride it will be the end of the year it 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.780
 failed to do that before 9 am so that the family and the

 white laurent heard about gas production systems 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.169
 added 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.129
 for a results term 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.400
 do you notice after accepting installed what this 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:22.599
 generator 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.599
 unfortunately it is more than likely 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.969
 we recognize that will not happen 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:31.569
 before joining brest 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.590
 the noble tower of publishers or his diploma with the greenback shattered 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.530
 my opponent for his fuel economy versus consumption 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.960
 therefore only the coatings with the cogs 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.749
 good 55 cents 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:47.419
 ie you pass 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.909
 this is only a postponement 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:51.610
 in the inverted texas for 500 days 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.639
 the agreement it is very easy 11 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.199
 so from 8 o'clock it is the usual consumption on the road on them 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.139
 on a small course on what 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.230
 a judicial source 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.389
 the usual consumption will be slow course 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.729
 rousseau is at 13 his team the smaller parties voted today on 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.449
 is 8 9 on the short course 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.029
 okay we still have our 5 liters 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:15.819
 the country is in the summary 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.689
 what we see pieces with the guts to win the launch on them 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.589
 out of ten certainly exceed much on a large scale it's a little bit 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:26.050
 less favorable 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.449
 with the level behavior of the car 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.839
 but I find that authority as many more 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:36.229
 it also opens to driving that says the companies we walk his 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.369
 box for me it's important you give all common sense 

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:42.849
 earlier to encrypt it shocked to learn that the airlock is pretty 

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.849
 hard to say I agree with you on my car it's the same 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.440
 the most urgent thomas girl have granted us this little interview 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.800
 here and ben continues to unroll and then 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.189
 a obviously the results they are 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.349
 the very very interesting about this kind of vehicle 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.949
 if you have a modern vehicle 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.110
 install it and a hot-h generator maybe you'll have patients 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.610
 of results what we have something that is still 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.610
 very consistent with sound and 50% reduction in consumption 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:17.740
 it's still 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.979
 really very convincing results 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:22.909
 most of the time on a more modern vehicle 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.509
 you will know it 

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:26.539
 we will tell others 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:28.990
 nearly 35% 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.789
 savings with the hotel 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.129
 you lift with a gasoline injection will not save them his mandate handle 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.960
 so if you have tutelage the recipient probes 

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:45.839
 a lot of air pressure 

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:49.219
 greg beugnot if you want to get started you can find us on 

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:51.119
 generator h crazy match 

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:53.240
 common point 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.499
 the versions again for your visit
