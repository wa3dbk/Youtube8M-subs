00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.829 

I<00:00:02.600> wanted<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.720> get<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> little<00:00:04.049> bit<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.440> video<00:00:04.650> of

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 
I wanted to get a little bit of video of

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.910 
I wanted to get a little bit of video of
my<00:00:06.839> burner<00:00:08.179> it's<00:00:09.179> running<00:00:09.540> quite<00:00:10.260> nicely<00:00:10.530> I've

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
my burner it's running quite nicely I've

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.620 
my burner it's running quite nicely I've
been<00:00:11.160> playing<00:00:11.670> with<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.969> for<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.210> past<00:00:12.389> couple

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
been playing with it for the past couple

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.430 
been playing with it for the past couple
days<00:00:13.400> trying<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.460> figure<00:00:14.700> out<00:00:14.960> what<00:00:15.960> settings

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
days trying to figure out what settings

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.599 
days trying to figure out what settings
to<00:00:16.680> use<00:00:16.859> how<00:00:17.220> fast<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.880> get<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> drip<00:00:18.449> feed<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
to use how fast to get the drip feed and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:26.660 
to use how fast to get the drip feed and
what<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> needed<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.210> actually<00:00:21.330> start<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:25.670> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
what I needed to actually start it the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.710 
what I needed to actually start it the
flame<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.180> burning<00:00:28.820> quite<00:00:29.820> optimally<00:00:30.510> right

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
flame is burning quite optimally right

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.510 
flame is burning quite optimally right
now<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.260> mean<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:32.809> really<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:34.079> hot

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.000 

little<00:00:38.520> bit<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.760> noise<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.800> I'll<00:00:40.800> keep

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
little bit of noise but I'll keep

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.660 
little bit of noise but I'll keep
experimenting<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:42.860> drilled<00:00:43.860> patterns<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
experimenting with drilled patterns and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.139 
experimenting with drilled patterns and
hole<00:00:44.850> patterns<00:00:45.270> maybe<00:00:45.660> different<00:00:46.079> hole<00:00:46.200> sizes

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
hole patterns maybe different hole sizes

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.250 
hole patterns maybe different hole sizes
I<00:00:48.950> thought<00:00:49.950> drilling<00:00:50.510> three<00:00:51.510> extra<00:00:51.840> rows<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
I thought drilling three extra rows of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
I thought drilling three extra rows of
holes<00:00:52.410> would<00:00:52.860> make<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.489> fluttering<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.270> away

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
holes would make that fluttering go away

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.830 
holes would make that fluttering go away
but<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:56.070> hasn't<00:00:56.579> seemed<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.660> go

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
but it hasn't seemed to make that go

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.799 
but it hasn't seemed to make that go
away<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.250> perhaps<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.390> little

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
away so perhaps I need to go to a little

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.160 
away so perhaps I need to go to a little
bit<00:01:00.930> larger<00:01:01.350> holes<00:01:02.629> anyway

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.880 

huh<00:01:09.860> it's<00:01:10.460> been<00:01:10.700> running<00:01:10.940> for<00:01:11.090> oh<00:01:12.010> my<00:01:13.010> god

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
huh it's been running for oh my god

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.450 
huh it's been running for oh my god
three<00:01:15.890> hours<00:01:16.190> now<00:01:17.740> two<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.920> half<00:01:19.100> hours

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
three hours now two and a half hours

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.109 
three hours now two and a half hours
probably<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.200> only<00:01:21.380> used<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.880> much

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
probably and it's only used that much

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.630 
probably and it's only used that much
oil<00:01:23.380> that's<00:01:24.380> it's<00:01:24.770> probably<00:01:25.310> three<00:01:25.610> hours

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
oil that's it's probably three hours

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.240 
oil that's it's probably three hours
because<00:01:26.150> I<00:01:26.660> can't<00:01:27.500> even<00:01:27.590> remember<00:01:27.950> when<00:01:28.220> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
because I can't even remember when I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.960 
because I can't even remember when I
came<00:01:28.369> out

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
came out

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.230 
came out
so<00:01:31.330> anyway<00:01:32.770> very<00:01:33.770> very<00:01:34.280> little<00:01:34.640> consumption

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
so anyway very very little consumption

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.540 
so anyway very very little consumption
of<00:01:35.360> oil<00:01:35.680> see<00:01:36.680> if<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:36.860> can<00:01:37.070> show<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.340> the

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
of oil see if I can show you the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:50.550 
of oil see if I can show you the
dripping

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:02:01.190 

there<00:01:51.070> we<00:01:51.250> go

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.720 

and<00:02:02.200> that's<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.650> folks<00:02:05.280> I'll<00:02:06.280> try<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.580> get<00:02:06.670> a

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
and that's it folks I'll try and get a

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.140 
and that's it folks I'll try and get a
video<00:02:07.030> of<00:02:07.240> lighting<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.750> tomorrow
