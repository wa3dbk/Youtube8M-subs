00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.530
 case of abuse of authority require serious research these young people 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.530
 Mexicans from Ciudad Juarez were already on the Mexican side 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.999
 and being on the Mexican side 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:47.159
 there were these shots from the United States side so Mexican thing and that has

 the agents 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.260
 to respond to this type of situation the fact that
