00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:06.160 

so<00:02:54.990> I'll<00:02:55.080> tighten<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.680> clamp<00:02:56.040> back<00:02:56.370> down<00:02:56.700> I

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.480 

see<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:07.200> need<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.500> put<00:03:09.710> other<00:03:10.710> boat<00:03:11.100> back<00:03:11.460> in

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
see I need to put other boat back in

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:31.910 
see I need to put other boat back in
where<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:14.180> other<00:03:15.180> blinker<00:03:15.870> came<00:03:16.140> off<00:03:30.920> all

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
where that other blinker came off all

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:40.020 
where that other blinker came off all
right

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.700 

now<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.060> got<00:03:41.300> to<00:03:41.420> decide<00:03:41.720> where<00:03:42.020> I<00:03:42.050> want<00:03:42.350> that<00:03:42.440> to

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
now I got to decide where I want that to

00:03:42.710 --> 00:04:07.630 
now I got to decide where I want that to
go<00:03:55.870> all<00:04:02.290> right<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.320> think<00:04:03.500> I<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.100> better<00:04:06.640> up

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
go all right I think I like it better up

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.800 
go all right I think I like it better up
at<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.120> top<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:13.430> way<00:04:13.700> it's<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.180> lot<00:04:14.390> easier<00:04:14.600> to

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
at the top that way it's a lot easier to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.900 
at the top that way it's a lot easier to
hide<00:04:15.050> this<00:04:15.320> wire<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:18.250> think<00:04:19.250> that's<00:04:19.430> why<00:04:19.579> I<00:04:19.609> like

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
hide this wire I think that's why I like

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:29.340 
hide this wire I think that's why I like
it's<00:04:20.180> right<00:04:20.390> there

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.150 

now<00:04:30.350> let<00:04:30.560> me<00:04:30.620> get<00:04:30.860> an<00:04:30.980> Allen<00:04:31.460> wrench<00:04:33.160> tighten

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
now let me get an Allen wrench tighten

00:04:34.160 --> 00:05:22.570 
now let me get an Allen wrench tighten
that<00:04:34.340> up

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:29.060 

all<00:05:23.580> right

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:39.470 

now<00:05:30.070> let's<00:05:30.430> say<00:05:30.700> you<00:05:30.760> cut<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.510> wire<00:05:34.170> this<00:05:35.170> one

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.180 

we<00:05:40.480> got<00:05:40.630> plenty<00:05:40.960> of<00:05:41.170> wire<00:05:41.350> from<00:05:41.650> it<00:05:41.830> so<00:05:42.100> it

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
we got plenty of wire from it so it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.940 
we got plenty of wire from it so it
don't<00:05:42.340> really<00:05:42.700> matter
