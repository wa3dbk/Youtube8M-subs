that had gotten me here in the first

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.939 
that had gotten me here in the first
place<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:47.480> just<00:00:47.809> close<00:00:48.230> out<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.500> match<00:00:48.530> that

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
place and just close out the match that

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.340 
place and just close out the match that
way<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.190> know<00:00:49.429> you<00:00:49.489> can't<00:00:49.789> think<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.090> anything

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
way you know you can't think of anything

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.509 
way you know you can't think of anything
differently<00:00:51.350> towards<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:51.859> end<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:52.309> there's

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
differently towards the end with there's

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.069 
differently towards the end with there's
a<00:00:52.579> big<00:00:52.760> pointer<00:00:53.179> big<00:00:53.390> game<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.809> know<00:00:53.899> there's

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
a big pointer big game you know there's

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.810 
a big pointer big game you know there's
no<00:00:54.170> such<00:00:54.379> thing<00:00:54.410> there's<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.399> just<00:00:55.609> go<00:00:55.699> out

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
no such thing there's you just go out

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.099 
no such thing there's you just go out
there<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.030> do<00:00:56.239> what<00:00:56.269> you've<00:00:56.480> been<00:00:56.510> doing<00:00:57.019> and

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
there and do what you've been doing and

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.419 
there and do what you've been doing and
I<00:00:57.199> think<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:57.440> was<00:00:57.559> able<00:00:57.679> to<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.010> that<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.370> that's

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
I think I was able to do that and that's

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.250 
I think I was able to do that and that's
why<00:00:58.579> I<00:00:58.670> was<00:00:58.820> able<00:00:58.910> to<00:00:59.059> close<00:00:59.239> it<00:00:59.390> out<00:00:59.480> when<00:01:00.140> you

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
why I was able to close it out when you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.259 
why I was able to close it out when you
went<00:01:00.440> into<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.649> match<00:01:00.890> what<00:01:01.760> chance<00:01:02.030> did<00:01:02.179> you

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
went into the match what chance did you

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.200 
went into the match what chance did you
give<00:01:02.420> yourself<00:01:02.829> hey<00:01:03.829> you<00:01:03.890> have<00:01:04.190> every<00:01:05.000> match
