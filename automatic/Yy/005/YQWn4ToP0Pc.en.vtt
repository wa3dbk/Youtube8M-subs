00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:10.230
 It is God 706 but this time on the start screen of Playstation vita 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 I would like to teach how to set up and wallpaper 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.389
 Oh, I set my start bottle too 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.389
 What worse but 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:26.510
 Also Well and in this way how to set the first start screen had become the home screen Kaho in 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.320
 Touch and 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:35.020
 Well this is right now on the start screen 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.800
 Like this I like to set 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.370
 It will come out, so for example 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.710
 Choose a monster hunter image 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:50.060
 When you do so, this mark will appear in the lower right corner, so touch this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.410
 It is said that the start screen is given 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.180
 Will you this as I briefly and asked to touch it that out 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.960
 I set it on the start screen 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:09.020
 How to set the start screen will come out 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:14.439
 It's like this, and the method of wallpaper is also back to the home screen 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.439
 Because it's okay even in the lower right, if you leave it for a while 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.710
 Yes, I'm sorry the north Well I like this 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.160
 It will be a little small 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.950
 I think the image quality is bad and I can not see it 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:42.340
 I think I'm coming out of 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.000
 Please come out at the top left of + and touch it to select the background of this page 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.600
 so 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.690
 If you touch here on the top left 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.690
 Like this photo comes out no 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.420
 screenshot or yourself 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.170
 In the other 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.439
 Then it looks like this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.439
 For example , when you choose this day, you can choose 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.649
 Yes like this 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.730
 It has changed the background 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.020
 In Well 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.830
 I think this is confusing 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:25.060
 I was able to set the wallpaper 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 It is easy to do this, so please try it again.
