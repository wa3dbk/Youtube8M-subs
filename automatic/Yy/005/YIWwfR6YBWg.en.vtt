00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.389 
well when developing cush plus this idea
struck<00:00:06.350> me<00:00:06.410> when<00:00:06.680> I<00:00:06.740> was<00:00:06.950> sitting<00:00:07.220> in<00:00:07.310> a

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
struck me when I was sitting in a

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.610 
struck me when I was sitting in a
product<00:00:07.729> review<00:00:08.060> meeting<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:08.780> we<00:00:09.469> were

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
talking about introducing three separate

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.900 
talking about introducing three separate
shoes<00:00:11.900> I<00:00:12.440> thought<00:00:13.040> what<00:00:13.429> if<00:00:13.519> all<00:00:13.670> those

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
shoes I thought what if all those

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.240 
shoes I thought what if all those
attributes<00:00:14.629> from<00:00:15.200> those<00:00:15.440> three<00:00:15.740> products

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
attributes from those three products

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.929 
attributes from those three products
became<00:00:16.550> 1sheeld<00:00:17.510> and<00:00:18.310> started<00:00:19.310> sketching<00:00:19.609> and

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
became 1sheeld and started sketching and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.910 
became 1sheeld and started sketching and
immediately<00:00:20.330> that<00:00:20.600> became<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.140> cookplus<00:00:21.529> and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.609 

that's<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.630> made<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.109> exciting<00:00:31.199> with

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
that's what made it so exciting with

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.460 
that's what made it so exciting with
that<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:33.059> comfortable

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 
hidden feel push Plus has really become
a<00:00:39.930> revolutionary<00:00:40.430> foam<00:00:41.430> compound<00:00:41.970> that<00:00:42.120> we've

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
a revolutionary foam compound that we've

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.090 
a revolutionary foam compound that we've
used<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> key<00:00:43.050> ingredient<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.829> lot<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
used as a key ingredient into a lot of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.020 
used as a key ingredient into a lot of
our<00:00:44.220> shoes<00:00:44.430> across<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.940> New<00:00:45.059> Balance<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:47.030> so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
our shoes across the New Balance one so

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360 
our shoes across the New Balance one so
when<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.330> develop<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> compound<00:00:49.470> we<00:00:50.100> wanted

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
when we develop this compound we wanted

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
when we develop this compound we wanted
to<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.760> lightweight<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.480> soft<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.559> we

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
to make it lightweight and soft but we

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220 
to make it lightweight and soft but we
also<00:00:53.180> incorporated<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> feature<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.870> making

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
also incorporated the feature of making

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.110 
also incorporated the feature of making
it<00:00:55.379> able<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.829> touch<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> ground<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.970> we're

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it able to touch the ground so we're

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.569 
it able to touch the ground so we're
able<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.360> remove<00:00:57.780> areas<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.620> rubber<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
able to remove areas of rubber so you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.279 
able to remove areas of rubber so you
have<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.909> little<00:01:00.180> bit<00:01:00.360> less<00:01:00.600> rubber<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.170> have

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
have a little bit less rubber you have

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
have a little bit less rubber you have
it<00:01:01.440> fully<00:01:01.680> where<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> need<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it fully where you need it in the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.820 
it fully where you need it in the
forefoot<00:01:03.360> where<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.020> need<00:01:04.170> traction<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
forefoot where you need traction and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.400 
forefoot where you need traction and
flexibility<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.700> its<00:01:06.180> segment<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.289> the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
flexibility it's its segment and in the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.740 
flexibility it's its segment and in the
heel<00:01:07.649> where<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.100> land<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.880> lot<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.479> more

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
heel where you land a lot there's more

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
heel where you land a lot there's more
rubber<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.320> everywhere<00:01:10.800> else<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.550> reduced

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
rubber but everywhere else it's reduced

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.900 
rubber but everywhere else it's reduced
we<00:01:12.509> also<00:01:12.660> weren't<00:01:13.380> conscious<00:01:14.310> about<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
we also weren't conscious about the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.700 
we also weren't conscious about the
sculpting<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.690> sole<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> kind<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.440> waste

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
sculpting of this sole to kind of waste

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350 
sculpting of this sole to kind of waste
it<00:01:16.920> through<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.190> middle<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.700> remove<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.119> little

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it through the middle to remove a little

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.150
