00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so Jason is not a competitive feller and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.100 
so Jason is not a competitive feller and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
know that these sweeps that usually go

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.929

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
against people who are too competitively

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.539

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
viable so this is my baton passing

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
viable so this is my baton passing
scolipede<00:01:17.909> actually<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.750> holding<00:01:19.680> black

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
scolipede actually it's holding black

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.120

sludge<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:21.119> has<00:01:21.420> um<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.830> mixed

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
sludge it has um it's actually a mixed

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
Swords Dance baton pass earthquake and I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.660 
Swords Dance baton pass earthquake and I
got<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.710> his<00:01:31.710> Vegas<00:01:31.920> lash<00:01:32.189> went<00:01:32.430> straight

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
got one so his Vegas lash went straight

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.319 
got one so his Vegas lash went straight
for<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> an<00:01:33.450> iron<00:01:34.020> head<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.650> got<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> crit<00:01:35.549> but

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
for a an iron head here got the crit but

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.179 
for a an iron head here got the crit but
I<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.259> care<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.799> survived

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I don't really care because I survived

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
I don't really care because I survived
and<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:39.360> speed<00:01:39.630> boost<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.409> building<00:01:40.710> up

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and my speed boost is just building up

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
and my speed boost is just building up
at<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.250> point<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.049> planning<00:01:43.049> on

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
at this point I was just planning on

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.899 
at this point I was just planning on
passing<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.130> speed<00:01:44.399> boost<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:45.000> my<00:01:46.909> surmises

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
passing the speed boost to my surmises

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.929 
passing the speed boost to my surmises
or<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.750> he<00:01:49.470> goes<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> king's<00:01:50.220> shield<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
or so he goes for the king's shield and

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.710 
or so he goes for the king's shield and
I<00:01:52.520> predict<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> sword

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
I predict that and go for the sword

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.709 
I predict that and go for the sword
stance<00:01:54.990> again<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.979> point<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
stance again at this point just for the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.569 
stance again at this point just for the
purpose<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> passing<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.070> my<00:01:59.340> scissor<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:01.579> I'm

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
purpose of passing to my scissor so I'm

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.459 
purpose of passing to my scissor so I'm
just<00:02:02.909> building<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.329> here<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:03.990> my<00:02:04.409> sister

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
just building up here and then my sister

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.080 
just building up here and then my sister
can't<00:02:04.950> really<00:02:05.130> touched<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.700> aegislash

resists<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.509> I<00:04:18.690> went<00:04:18.959> for<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.229> mega<00:04:19.440> horn<00:04:19.739> and

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
resists it I went for the mega horn and

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.219 
resists it I went for the mega horn and
just<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.209> see<00:04:21.359> what<00:04:21.449> he<00:04:21.539> would<00:04:21.630> do<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.989> he<00:04:22.049> went

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
just to see what he would do and he went

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.840 
just to see what he would do and he went
for<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.410> foul<00:04:22.650> play<00:04:22.919> which<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> pretty<00:04:23.669> good

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
for the foul play which is a pretty good

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.810
