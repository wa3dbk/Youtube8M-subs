00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.650
 Thank you that you did not stop that you have a stop, too 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.599
 especially for left and right stitches can knit and I'll show you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.629
 hold 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.339
 I had a very small knit piece prepared with a conventional one 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.639
 attack 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.639
 With a little bit of trail court training 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.550
 when we meet more closely 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.179
 then it would come through the rounds at the final test she sits the pre-tests 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.830
 page 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.580
 CT rightful Ketterl 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.450
 yes JanÃ¡cek's chain 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.930
 However, sitting on the back does not look back Lehmann among the 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.320
 right stitches just left marching stars as the attack 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 so Chris Kaman do better 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.980
 I'll hurt you 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.260
 the stop danger team with children also increased the same length as 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 in a conventional stop 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.080
 and of course, there had to be Schwante's later pattern, it will stir up garbage 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.189
 You have to know patterns or flowers you have to mix of course 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.760
 So if I'm doing three right-wing beginnings of the band mesh I'll do it 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.720
 now here 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 Marschner was the strongest advocate 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.740
 Net come 3 fastest rising Kalinka meshes 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.259
 to find from below in the back series fingers 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.259
 the index finger noose 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.470
 clumsy also from routes where ladies rides from below where light 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.420
 have had with it 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.000
 you could also want from above but then serves the mesh 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.220
 Ott works in his own way, we do that 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.650
 We do not want to be ladies rides 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.210
 by the mood on the index finger 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.409
 and now maybe it will change - on the conventional one 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.730
 Instead of percent 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.810
 So do not tighten 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.730
 again from the bottom in the index finger noose a sting 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.460
 from below can torture 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.329
 Get thumb rides 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.249
 through 7 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.249
 and weakens at 7 and again 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.510
 from below into the cell gives them sling from below to the ladies celebrated 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.650
 gets 2 8 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.509
 pull 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.430
 and put on bad and now come funds 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.090
 3 most he rose right march what to do 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.090
 SOLEOS know 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:39.939
 and also Friedrich here who put on easily 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:43.939
 Unravel the cuffs and always wore his bad marschner 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.319
 and now again three strongest left stitches from the bottom in 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.810
 the CL the Finns snare 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.749
 a sting 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.399
 not from above 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.919
 but from below pulls ladies want to play 2 18 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.759
 easily put on 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.909
 once again go down from below into the index finger noose from below 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.539
 Ladies rides want 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.539
 maybe many dogs in the war can paint that 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.139
 to care 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.019
 and another aunt mesh on the right 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.199
 should now be our stop 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:29.089
 4 a Ried had Finck in the team had to get out 3 3 march inseparably two 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.849
 Left 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.499
 and it was swum 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.879
 this looks different than we did title so far from should I Striek 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.799
 so few enterten paar received so three legal tradition uses the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 Can attract difference 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.429
 since the trading XVI and so on 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.399
 and a handbag 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:14.779
 so leaps and bounds ALV expects a contract track 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.319
 although could now 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:20.039
 Siemens equal the difference 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.810
 I have the previous rope 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.810
 Dirk still suspended 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.569
 so the front is quite okay forests you have this beautiful necklace 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.020
 Stop chain 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.080
 Arndt already as an act of war is likely before that holder 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:41.120
 under which is the conventional attack came these attack plans of the 

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:42.210
 below 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.129
 the whole train pulls 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.280
 he is already on the desired knit piece, however 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.409
 to undergo a difference test 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.779
 Lincoln mesh also left are the strongest descent 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.909
 it becomes even clearer on the back 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:02.099
 because not to take the back of me announced attack victory show 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.469
 Fodder under the right stitches of the left Anstoetz marchers seem 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.580
 and the back are rarely streaky piece is perfect than usual 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.360
 right the stop smash cheer right time styling core piece Smash 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.550
 under the left stitches
