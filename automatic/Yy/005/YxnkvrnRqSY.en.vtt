00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
overlapping tape on top and you start at

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
overlapping tape on top and you start at
the<00:01:00.300> bottom<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.140> winds<00:01:01.379> gonna<00:01:01.469> start<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the bottom the winds gonna start to get

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680 
the bottom the winds gonna start to get
up<00:01:02.070> underneath<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> tape<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.910> pull<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> off

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
up underneath the tape and pull it off

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.320 
up underneath the tape and pull it off
and<00:01:04.019> you'll<00:01:04.350> actually<00:01:04.500> lose<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:06.240> won't

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and you'll actually lose it and it won't

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.960 
and you'll actually lose it and it won't
be<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> original<00:01:07.080> well<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.320> way<00:01:07.530> is

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
be on the original well this way is

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.100 
be on the original well this way is
everything<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.060> overlapping<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.780> there's<00:01:09.930> no

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
everything is overlapping so there's no

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.250 
everything is overlapping so there's no
air<00:01:10.520> wait<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> air<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.150> into<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
air wait for the air to get into so this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.690 
air wait for the air to get into so this
is<00:01:13.350> what<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> want<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.490> you're<00:01:14.580> gonna

about<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:24.000> cuz<00:01:24.240> it'll<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> little<00:01:24.570> bit

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
about here cuz it'll be a little bit

about here cuz it'll be a little bit
harder<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:24.960> rocks<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.920> can

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
harder for rocks to get to but you can

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
harder for rocks to get to but you can
still<00:01:26.220> see<00:01:26.600> if<00:01:27.600> every<00:01:27.810> ball<00:01:27.900> still<00:01:28.140> goes<00:01:28.290> all

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
still see if every ball still goes all

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
strips right through here I'm also

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.130 
strips right through here I'm also
thinking<00:01:53.880> about<00:01:54.060> coming<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.630> through<00:01:54.780> here

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
