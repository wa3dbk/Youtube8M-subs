now<00:01:25.000> take<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.300> cup<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.840> 91%<00:01:26.320> alcohol<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.640> could

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
now take a cup and 91% alcohol you could

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.580 
now take a cup and 91% alcohol you could
use<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.090> other<00:01:28.240> percentage<00:01:28.660> too<00:01:29.110> but<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:29.440> just

find<00:01:29.740> that<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:29.979> one<00:01:30.160> works<00:01:30.400> better<00:01:30.640> for<00:01:30.970> a

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
find that this one works better for a

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.880 
find that this one works better for a
little<00:01:31.660> bit<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.170> because<00:01:32.470> you<00:01:32.590> only<00:01:32.770> need

little bit and because you only need

focus the pressure on the places where

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.590 
focus the pressure on the places where
the<00:02:37.830> ink<00:02:38.040> isn't<00:02:38.250> really<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:38.910> but<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.540> have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the ink isn't really there but you have

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.910 
the ink isn't really there but you have
to<00:02:39.720> make<00:02:39.960> sure<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.320> careful<00:02:40.710> with<00:02:40.800> this

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
to make sure to be careful with this

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.800 
to make sure to be careful with this
step<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.520> because<00:02:41.880> sometimes<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.480> ink<00:02:42.660> will

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
step just because sometimes the ink will

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.610 
step just because sometimes the ink will
may<00:02:42.930> overlap<00:02:44.690> then<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.990> continue<00:02:46.440> these

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
may overlap then just continue these

00:02:46.620 --> 00:03:28.470 
may overlap then just continue these
steps<00:02:46.920> with<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> rest<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.490> your<00:02:47.640> nails

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.730 

once<00:03:29.480> you're<00:03:29.660> done<00:03:29.780> with<00:03:29.990> that<00:03:30.020> this<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.560> what

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
once you're done with that this is what

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.270 
once you're done with that this is what
we<00:03:30.920> should<00:03:30.980> have

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.920

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
but these nails is very important to put

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.020 
but these nails is very important to put
on<00:03:36.050> a<00:03:36.080> clear<00:03:36.410> top<00:03:36.680> coat<00:03:36.710> or<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.160> ink<00:03:37.460> may<00:03:37.730> start

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
on a clear top coat or the ink may start

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.760 
on a clear top coat or the ink may start
to<00:03:38.150> come<00:03:38.360> off<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.810> feed<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:42.140> now<00:03:42.440> we're<00:03:42.650> all

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
to come off and feed and now we're all

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.780

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
done with our newspaper nails so I think

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.700 
done with our newspaper nails so I think
that<00:03:47.090> was<00:03:47.210> like<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.420> easiest<00:03:47.990> nail<00:03:48.170> tutorial

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
that was like the easiest nail tutorial

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.320 
that was like the easiest nail tutorial
in<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.980> world<00:03:49.190> it's<00:03:49.490> not<00:03:49.580> like<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:49.940> did<00:03:50.150> nine

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
in the world it's not like I did nine

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.750 
in the world it's not like I did nine
you<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.900> literally<00:03:51.500> take<00:03:51.710> a<00:03:51.920> newspaper<00:03:52.370> and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
you just literally take a newspaper and

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.010 
you just literally take a newspaper and
you<00:03:52.850> stick<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.120> on<00:03:53.300> your<00:03:53.450> nail<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:53.870> just

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
you stick it on your nail and then just

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.200 
you stick it on your nail and then just
peel<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.380> off<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.830> ink<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.100> there<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:55.880> um

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
peel it off and the ink is there so um

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.850 
peel it off and the ink is there so um
you<00:03:56.510> don't<00:03:56.630> need<00:03:56.810> any<00:03:57.020> nail<00:03:57.200> art<00:03:57.410> tools<00:03:57.650> or
