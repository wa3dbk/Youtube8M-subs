00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.590
 in response to your previous question of 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.480
 that if Dr. Watson was not 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.029
 involved the answer is not when 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.720
 two objects collide there is always damage 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.860
 of collateral nature 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.710
 now 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.150
 he's sure he wants to play he's beaten 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 arganda long blows like sherlock 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.850
 holmes shadows games should have 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.850
 finished 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.780
 it was worth it now we both go to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.850
 die in this water tomb 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 but you're wrong you'll see me 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.269
 I suspected he was going to be thrown out of the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.070
 shore and that's why I took the liberty of 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.500
 steal my personal cycle tank from 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 my brother are you referring to this tank of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.580
 oxygen 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 I suspect you had a plan so 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.729
 I stole it from your pocket now I 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.649
 I will live and you will die yes clear lament 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.119
 disappoint you suspect that also 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.009
 there would be some trick like this and for 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.060
 that's why I also wear a vest 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.100
 lifesaver 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.810
 but you see I knew it would bring its 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.640
 life jackets so that way 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.960
 secret drill holes while we play 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.060
 Chess 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.619
 but again I suspect you would do something 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.270
 that's why I'm sorry and it hurts 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.909
 inform you that what really 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.990
 you were making holes was a sack of 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.189
 old or a sack of beans good trick 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.640
 we are clearly the same 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.190
 if we put that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.420
 well clearly as we both are going to 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.000
 live awaits an exciting future 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.479
 with you as my archenemy is right 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.479
 so is 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.630
 that water looks pretty cold 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.710
 do not consider the cold 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.710
 nor the rocks 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:08.850
 why homes why 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.850
 we were right in the other room 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.460
 the world 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.220
