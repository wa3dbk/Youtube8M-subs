it's a living heart it's definitely

it's a living heart it's definitely
something<00:00:04.950> very<00:00:05.490> special<00:00:06.710> which<00:00:07.710> is

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
something very special which is

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
something very special which is
different<00:00:08.130> from<00:00:08.429> any<00:00:08.940> other<00:00:09.230> objects<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.530> its

detail but also in this in the whole
composition<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.890> great<00:00:17.010> piece<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.580> art<00:00:18.650> if

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
composition it's a great piece of art if

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.910 
composition it's a great piece of art if
you<00:00:20.730> look<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> very<00:00:21.449> first<00:00:21.600> sketch<00:00:22.320> this

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you look at the very first sketch this

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.700 
you look at the very first sketch this
car<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.699> close<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.330> could<00:00:24.449> almost<00:00:24.710> overlay

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
car is so close you could almost overlay

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.950 
car is so close you could almost overlay
the<00:00:26.189> car<00:00:26.430> next<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> sketch<00:00:27.390> which<00:00:27.660> means

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the car next to the sketch which means

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.589 
the car next to the sketch which means
that<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.859> haven't<00:00:29.160> compromised<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that we haven't compromised the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.299 
that we haven't compromised the
designers<00:00:31.199> thought<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> engineer's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
designers thought and the engineer's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.420 
designers thought and the engineer's
thought<00:00:32.669> into<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> car<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.160> we

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
thought into the car at all it's as we

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.790 
thought into the car at all it's as we
first<00:00:35.700> intended<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.380> complicated

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
first intended it's a very complicated

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.600 
first intended it's a very complicated
project<00:00:38.579> because<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> one-off<00:00:40.680> it's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
project because to do a one-off it's

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.260 
project because to do a one-off it's
probably<00:00:42.090> easy<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> 77<00:00:44.610> morning

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
probably easy but to do a 77 morning

00:00:45.270 --> 00:01:15.609 
probably easy but to do a 77 morning
offs<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.890> more<00:00:46.890> complicated

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.770 

has<00:01:16.619> been<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:17.039> incredible<00:01:17.610> journey<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:18.659> you

has been an incredible journey when you
finally<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> car<00:01:19.860> moving<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:21.090> an<00:01:21.360> amazing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
finally see the car moving as an amazing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.230 
finally see the car moving as an amazing
sound<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> engine<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> grace

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
sound to the engine that there's a grace

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
sound to the engine that there's a grace
and<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:25.170> fabulous<00:01:25.500> movement<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> car<00:01:26.789> when

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and a fabulous movement to the car when

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.149 
and a fabulous movement to the car when
you<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> track<00:01:27.899> it<00:01:28.440> actually<00:01:28.649> does

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you see it on the track it actually does

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.770 
you see it on the track it actually does
make<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.819> hairs<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:30.330> of<00:01:30.479> my<00:01:30.630> neck

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
make the hairs on the back of my neck

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.290 
make the hairs on the back of my neck
stand<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.409> still<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:32.460> everybody<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.909> of

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
stand up still when everybody is of

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.510 
stand up still when everybody is of
course<00:01:33.450> excited<00:01:33.929> about<00:01:34.190> such<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.220> project

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
course excited about such a project

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.460 
course excited about such a project
because<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.270> most<00:01:36.360> people<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
because for most people it is the one a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.010 
because for most people it is the one a
one-off<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.460> their<00:01:38.640> life<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> something

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
one-off in their life to do something

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.380 
one-off in their life to do something
like<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:42.000> details

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
like this now it's all about the details

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.480 
like this now it's all about the details
refinement<00:01:43.700> getting<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.539> proper

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
refinement getting it all in the proper

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
refinement getting it all in the proper
composition<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.020> demonstrates

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
composition I do think it demonstrates

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.020 
composition I do think it demonstrates
the<00:01:50.130> quality<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.819> team<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.299> people

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the quality of the team in the people

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.639 
the quality of the team in the people
we've<00:01:54.030> pushed<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.509> boundaries<00:01:54.929> what<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.470> what

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
we've pushed the boundaries what of what

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
we've pushed the boundaries what of what
an<00:01:55.770> Aston<00:01:56.130> Martin<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.789> actually<00:01:57.149> look<00:01:57.299> like

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
an Aston Martin can actually look like

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.959 
an Aston Martin can actually look like
it's<00:01:57.899> open<00:01:58.350> many<00:01:58.860> many<00:01:59.069> doors<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.520> us<00:01:59.729> in

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's open many many doors for us in

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
it's open many many doors for us in
terms<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.539> developing<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> language<00:02:01.799> of

Aston Martin the DNA of Aston Martin my
favorite<00:02:05.310> line<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.789> actually<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> line<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
favorite line is actually the line that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.900 
favorite line is actually the line that
comes<00:02:06.899> off<00:02:07.109> the<00:02:07.170> top<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> head<00:02:08.039> lamp<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
comes off the top of the head lamp it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.759 
comes off the top of the head lamp it
goes<00:02:09.209> all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.539> way<00:02:09.869> down<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.289> side<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.530> the

single line that from any angle it looks

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.259 
single line that from any angle it looks

the same time this car is everything to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.590 
the same time this car is everything to
become<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:25.040> classic<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.489> at<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.850> moment<00:02:26.970> it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
become a classic but at the moment it's

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.310 
become a classic but at the moment it's
