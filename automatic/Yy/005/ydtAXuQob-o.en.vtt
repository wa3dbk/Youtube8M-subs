00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.430
 the mistral of wind is on the left 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.210
 high performance purpose sailor with 4300 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.210
 meter span 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.769
 The model is a result of technology 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.630
 manufactured and has a three-part 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.489
 wing what it transport 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.500
 friendly makes the wing 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.160
 middle piece is from the top of the hull 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.160
 screwed 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.520
 with just over 6000 grams takeoff weight 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.640
 in the electro version is the west 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.690
 still good to start alone from the hand 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.940
 the prerequisite for this is a strong one 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.640
 drive here a scorpion runaway 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.640
 with traveling gear at a 6 sgb 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.200
 through the thin wing profile and the 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.110
 use of Waste flaps possesses the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.370
 mistral 4300 a great speed 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.370
 spectrum and is very agile 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.539
 even negative figures masters the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.130
 hochmeister apparently effortlessly over the 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.850
 you do not have to worry about strength 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.590
 close 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.219
 The model is very robust and stable 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.219
 built up 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.150
 the generous hood makes cutout 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.880
 the installation of the rc system to the children 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.190
 played the rudder statements belt 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.990
 is also installed ex works as the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.990
 thread to the wing 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.010
 the travelauer compiled 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.230
 drive ensures a level of over 7 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:02.020
 kilograms and an increase in performance 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:03.940
 about 17 meters per second for use 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.000
 consistently high quality forest 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.570
 servus as well as a rx 9 per receiver from 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.570
 multiplex 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.300
 the mistral 4300 from wind left clicks 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.160
 very uncritical and also increases 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.920
 weak conditions well after the bad 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.610
 above is the circle flying behavior 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.890
 impeccable 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.490
 the model needs only minimal tax 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.490
 to have 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.370
 the braking effect of the butterfly position 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.020
 can be very well dosed by the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.210
 six flaps of wings remain the model 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.210
 to fully control the longitudinal axis at all times
