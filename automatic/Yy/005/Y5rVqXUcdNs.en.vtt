 demanded that the un conduct a thorough 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.559
 investigation we recall that earlier 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.330
 some countries promised immediately 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.000
 preached ending violence condemned 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.400
 Wahabi terrorists perverted ical

 interpretation of Islam for which he paid 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.829
 own life despite that 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.170
 European countries took seriously 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.530
 discuss the possibility of legal delivery 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.530

 foreign tour of neighboring countries 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.240
 east 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.540
 thus denoting the importance of the region 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.250
 for us really high visit remember 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.110
 just a stupid case of breakage 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.110
 obama limousine which by mistake 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.239
 refueled diesel fuel everything else 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.030
 Ozersk sparkle teeth before 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.890
 TV cameras and trite 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.850
 statements not affecting the current 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.280
 status 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.650
 far more important was the first foreign 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.709
 visit of the new chairman of the CPR 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.359
 jinping to russia china thereby 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.190
 demonstrated that our country 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.740
 is the most important 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.500
 an organic partner that is definitely not 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.480
 may not please in contrast to the format 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.090
 Batova Obama chairman si 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.890
 was in Chinese restrained but specific 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.080
 the results of the visit did not make themselves 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.810
 wait a long time 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.210
 so countries have agreed on the supply 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.890
 Russian oil to China for the next 25 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.500
 years on a prepaid basis 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.570
 also managed to agree on 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.700
 additional credit line with the bank 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.700
 China's development on profitable for us 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.290
 conditions 2 billion dollars will be 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 aimed at developing new 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.650
 deposits 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.750
 Russian gas stoppers Russneft 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.050
 signed with the Chinese national 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.610
 companies a number of important agreements 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.580
 guaranteeing our close partnership on 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.760
 many years to come but who is not happy about ours 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.430
 rapprochement with China so this is us 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.430
 just growing in defiance of the china crisis 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.140
 serious irritation of the white house 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.930
 offering all the power to contain him 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.240
 however in order to overpower the Chinese 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.020
 the dragon needs to isolate it from 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.910
 resources and cut its trade routes 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.370
 it is impossible to do without the help of Russia 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.520
 therefore the strengthening of trade and military 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.720
 cooperation of china and russia 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.520
 perceived in usa with big 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.140
 nervousness that periodically 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.660
 traced in statements and 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.580
 publications how to slow it down 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.080
 cooperation 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.330
 hit Moscow on the hands and order not 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.320
 friends with China like in Washington 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.310
 no longer possible alignment of forces this 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.269
 offer more profitable cooperation 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.320
 for its part, too , there is no money left 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.690
 only one method 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.290
 connect the propaganda machine and convince 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.419
 Russian perniciousness idea friendship with China 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.940
 this is done very simply through the company 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.900
 Media about what the Chinese dream of chopping 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.910
 our middle east 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.250
 steal our oil while women and children 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.260
 slave into slavery given 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.350
 disastrous pliability of ours 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.950
 public to me 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.600
 I am a task and so difficult I am sure that 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.880
 witnessing a new wave of such 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.150
 information attack we will become the most 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.080
 soon another illustrative 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.630
 visit to Moscow 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.080
 inflicted Cypriot Finance Minister Mihalis 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.000
 Sarris 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.210
 for those who did not follow the development 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.340
 Situations recall the Republic of Cyprus 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.890
 known as gray money laundry 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.870
 from all over the world it suddenly took 17 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.080
 billion dollars to overcome 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.520
 the effects of the crisis since Cyprus go to 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.100
 European Union then to him 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.890
 the European Union was promised 10 billion 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.820
 provided that the remaining 7 he will find 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.640
 by myself 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.890
 and where to get such a small country 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.840
 in which there is nothing but banks and 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.700
 of stores 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.190
 it is clear that in fact the problem is 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.290
 do not suddenly eat but systemic 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.050
 what was the request previously closed for 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.270
 eyes closed because it's scary 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.550
 they who do not fully know how to solve it 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.980
 and here is cyprus 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.230
 was on the verge of default and power 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.620
 European Union offered him the original 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.510
 output 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.000
 take away from investors up to ten 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.150
 percent of their money and thereby recruit 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.890
 missing 7 billion dollars 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.410
 depositors understandably against such 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.860
 proposals rebelled government 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.230
 Cyprus 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.300
 without thinking twice closed all the banks to 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.370
 worried investors did not take away 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.430
 your deposits will not be accepted yet 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.370
 the final decision is such uk 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.590
 European democracy in the end Cypriot 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.930
 the authorities are in a dilemma to please 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.750
 the European Union angered its own citizens 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.090
 or send the European Union and get a default 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.430
 while the first option is not default 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.830
 eliminates and only pushes aside for some 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.040
 time since money is impossible until 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.020
 infinities get cyprus money from money 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.820
 Minister of Finance rushed to Moscow in 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.640
 hoping to get a loan from Russia 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.860
 after all huge stored in cyprus 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.650
 amounts of Russian investors including 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.720
 state-owned companies however moscow 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.030
 I did not agree to save Cyprus 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.950
 coveted even on the proposed Cypriot 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.110
 shelf and gas fields 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.360
 these deposits at near 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.820
 considering so far remain dark 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.129
 a horse and the fact that any lender of Cyprus 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.709
 lose given to him 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.639
 Andy is to the grandmother do not go in general 

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.520
 Cypriot Minister 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.189
 left without result meanwhile the situation 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.479
 Cyprus escalates 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:53.759
 the government returned to the idea of ​​selection 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:56.099
 money from investors is true now 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:59.159
 considering not a 10 bite 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:00.419
 and up to 20 percent of the contributions what else 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.729
 daylight robbery 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.860
 can not regard the most 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:07.319
 interesting will be held on Tuesday when 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.360
 will open banks do not need to be 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:10.889
 an economics professor to guess 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.969
 how fast investors 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:16.199
 empty their deposits and it will be 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.490
 final and irrevocable collapse 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.550
 Cyprus economy 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.009
 which will not save any injections so 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.929
 more important is a lesson for us to build and 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.289
 financial pyramid a real 

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:27.289
 production
