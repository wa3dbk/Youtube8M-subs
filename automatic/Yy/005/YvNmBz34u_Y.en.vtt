00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
same job that you normally would do with

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.270 
same job that you normally would do with
your<00:03:12.570> body<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.109> your<00:03:13.200> voice<00:03:13.319> you<00:03:13.590> know<00:03:13.709> so<00:03:14.250> I

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
your body and your voice you know so I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.009 
your body and your voice you know so I
find<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.000> quite<00:03:15.120> difficult<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.750> think<00:03:15.780> if

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
find it quite difficult and I think if

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.949 
find it quite difficult and I think if
you<00:03:16.109> ask<00:03:16.769> actors<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.880> know<00:03:17.910> great<00:03:18.269> radio<00:03:18.750> work

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
you ask actors you know great radio work

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.630 
you ask actors you know great radio work
is<00:03:19.109> sometimes<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.620> hardest<00:03:19.920> work<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> I

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
is sometimes the hardest work there is I

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.699 
is sometimes the hardest work there is I
don't<00:03:21.090> really<00:03:21.269> know<00:03:21.450> why<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.049> but<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
don't really know why that is but it

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.140 
don't really know why that is but it
seems<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.310> you're<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.579> sitting<00:03:23.880> like

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
I love the bit in the film where all the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.510 
I love the bit in the film where all the
robots<00:03:40.990> indulge<00:03:41.380> in<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.710> armpit<00:03:41.980> farting

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
robots indulge in that armpit farting

it's<00:03:42.970> not<00:03:43.090> something<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.720> all<00:03:43.840> had<00:03:44.020> to

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
it's not something that you all had to

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.510 
it's not something that you all had to
sit<00:03:44.350> in<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.470> studio<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.980> kind<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.250> do<00:03:45.370> that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520

with or did you bring the specialist in

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.770 
with or did you bring the specialist in
I<00:03:47.590> think<00:03:48.580> there<00:03:48.700> must<00:03:48.790> be<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> specialist<00:03:49.630> on

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.570 
I think there must be a specialist on
barter<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.590> does<00:03:50.740> it<00:03:50.920> because<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.520> don't

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
barter that does it because I don't

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.230 
barter that does it because I don't
recall<00:03:51.970> doing<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.420> myself<00:03:53.820> I'm<00:03:54.820> not<00:03:55.030> sure<00:03:55.210> that

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
recall doing it myself I'm not sure that

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.030 
recall doing it myself I'm not sure that
I'm<00:03:55.480> terribly<00:03:55.810> good<00:03:55.990> at<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.470> then<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:56.950> I

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
I'm terribly good at it and then and I

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.260 
I'm terribly good at it and then and I
don't<00:03:57.250> think<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.520> would<00:03:57.670> be<00:03:57.820> able<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.090> I

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
don't think I would be able to I

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.550 
don't think I would be able to I
certainly<00:03:58.630> couldn't<00:03:58.930> give<00:03:59.110> them<00:03:59.260> different

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
certainly couldn't give them different

kinds of armpit farts so I think they

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.960 
kinds of armpit farts so I think they
