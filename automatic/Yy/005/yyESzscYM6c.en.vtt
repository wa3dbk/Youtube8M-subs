00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.230
 Hello Autumn releases, almost everything is already 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.150
 come out but I always have a lot for you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.150
 just go interesting 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.360
 if you have for some reason not yet 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.670
 daisy 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.730
 Or he just does not go with you 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.309
 attentively studio bohemia interactive then 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.410
 the very thing that daisy does and arma did 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.170
 mini daisy 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.150
 browser version of the original game 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.970
 run around abandoned houses collect 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.489
 buns do what you want to kill 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.220
 the zombies are a funny toy after all 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.290
 there is one significant but that but 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.020
 lack of multiplayer 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.370
 and to survive is no longer so fun to 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.440
 the word can be played on the official 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.480
 studio site is completely free if 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.610
 Well, you really wanted to but could not 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.710
 try that racing simulator with 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.040
 vast territories called 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.740
 dhikra then don't miss everything again on 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.050
 next week, yubisoft will again allow 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.570
 all and sundry errands as much as two of 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.090
 five regions of the map completely free 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.550
 I think that it will finally help everyone 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.110
 decide to buy this game or not 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.660
 which goes to the word on December 2 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.600
 everybody has even heard of b n csoft 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.240
 the very same studio that made the line 2 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.660
 blood and soul aion and others 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.660
 legendary m and so recently they 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.209
 announced a new online game and who would 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.289
 might think this time not m and this 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:49.450
 shooter but not a simple shooter but about the fur of 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.060
 the name of the game pro-ject phono and will be released 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:56.770
 she's next year but will she get 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.950
 to the CIS countries is still unknown and yet 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.319
 some news from yubisoft director 4 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.380
 headlight edge and 3 assassins Alex Hutchinson 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.780
 stated that he was given some money and 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.929
 small team to create something 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.790
 new is nice but what 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.180
 most developers are 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.770
 developers 3 and 4 assassins personally me 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.050
 very alarming 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.110
 Well, although who knows once a year and stick 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.050
 shoots so we wish Alex success 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.450
 and good luck with the new project 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.990
 if you play lords of the fallen 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.970
 I have very scary rumors for you 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.830
 some kind of anonymous on the network stated that 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.910
 new super protection 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.680
 because it is so cool that you are constantly 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.420
 overwrites ie there is one code 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.270
 after a couple of seconds he 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.000
 decoded and encoded in a new way with 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.250
 new algorithm you may ask what 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.200
 here is so scary but the bottom line is that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.870
 for gi encoding use ca 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.210
 the space of your disk as well as 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.250
 every hard drive has a time limit 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.490
 shelf life it can be concluded that 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.320
 lords of the fallen just his coffin on 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.540
 counting the same anonymus 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.090
 one hour of playing lords of allan 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.220
 the voltage on the disk is about three 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.890
 days of simple computer use 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.650
 it is easy to calculate that playing for 5-6 hours 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.460
 a day after a month you can buy a new one 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.280
 HDD 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.680
 Of course, the developers refute all this. 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.200
 but we from terminal users to not 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.860
 easier so I warned you and what 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.290
 you do decide yourself do not know remember 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.959
 you but i promised to tell you the date 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.989
 Autumn sales in Steam and will pass about 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.940
 us November 26 to December 2 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.100
 it is worth noting that 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.730
 the sale will be exposed to more than three 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.640
 700 thousand games unfortunately what exactly I 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.459
 I can not say yes and it would take very 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.620
 very very much time so 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.910
 Ask the Nurse money refill 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.970
 wallets and waiting for November 26 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.300
 the world of video games is truly huge and full 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.140
 of surprises and the gta series is the brightest 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.170
 example 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.840
 a huge open world a lot of quests mountains 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.440
 Easter eggs yes there for days you can not sit 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.260
 getting out 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.600
 I don't know how it happened but one guy 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.630
 from the states found a way how to turn 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.820
 in animals in gta5 what is needed for this 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.150
 just eat a strange plant 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.880
 which grows hell knows where it is possible 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.800
 become a killer whale shark and other 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.140
 inhabitants of the deep sea 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.630
 I personally donâ€™t find it strange that after 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.200
 eating strange plants you consider 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.690
 myself 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.800
 animals so go ahead gta reissues 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.140
 and swim to your health and on this
