00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.330 
the upper back
so<00:01:52.229> essentially<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.799> nice<00:01:52.950> smooth

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so essentially you want a nice smooth

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
so essentially you want a nice smooth
contour<00:01:53.909> from<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.720> area<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.320> area<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
contour from this area to this area so

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
contour from this area to this area so
that<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> wear<00:01:56.100> nice<00:01:56.280> snug<00:01:57.149> fitting

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
that when you wear nice snug fitting

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.260 
that when you wear nice snug fitting
dresses<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.439> shirts<00:01:58.790> these<00:01:59.790> areas<00:02:00.119> don't

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
dresses and shirts these areas don't

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
dresses and shirts these areas don't
bulge<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.719> once<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.590> patient<00:02:02.040> has<00:02:02.159> been

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
bulge out once the patient has been

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
bulge out once the patient has been
prepped<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.909> put<00:02:03.149> under<00:02:03.390> anesthesia

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
prepped and put under anesthesia

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740 
prepped and put under anesthesia
dr.<00:02:05.009> recta<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.520> his<00:02:05.610> partner<00:02:06.030> dr.<00:02:06.299> Pritchard

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
dr. recta and his partner dr. Pritchard

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.160 
dr. recta and his partner dr. Pritchard
began<00:02:07.680> cutting<00:02:07.950> out<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> excess

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.020 

dr.<00:02:12.170> Rhetta<00:02:12.410> says<00:02:12.830> those<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.430> benefit<00:02:13.849> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
dr. Rhetta says those that benefit the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.119 
dr. Rhetta says those that benefit the
most<00:02:14.239> from<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.690> surgery<00:02:15.110> are<00:02:15.650> those<00:02:15.920> that

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
most from the surgery are those that

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.339 
most from the surgery are those that
don't<00:02:16.340> have<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.550> lot<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.879> excess<00:02:17.239> fat<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.170> more

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
don't have a lot of excess fat but more

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.680 
don't have a lot of excess fat but more
so<00:02:18.620> loose<00:02:18.920> skin<00:02:19.340> because<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.910> aging<00:02:20.390> or<00:02:20.510> weight

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
so loose skin because of aging or weight

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.440 
so loose skin because of aging or weight
loss<00:02:21.129> can<00:02:22.129> be<00:02:22.160> exercised<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.940> excess<00:02:23.420> skin

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
loss can be exercised that excess skin

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.080 
loss can be exercised that excess skin
and<00:02:23.930> selfish<00:02:24.230> velocity<00:02:24.739> has<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.459> contoured

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
and selfish velocity has to be contoured

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.070 
and selfish velocity has to be contoured
and<00:02:26.239> read<00:02:26.510> Rea

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
and read Rea

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.650 
and read Rea
after<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.800> excess<00:02:28.190> skin<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.610> removed<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
after the excess skin is removed the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.570 
after the excess skin is removed the
back<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.110> pulled<00:02:30.380> together<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.010> stitched<00:02:31.310> up

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
back is pulled together and stitched up

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.759 
back is pulled together and stitched up

the wound a small amount of liposuction

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.380 
the wound a small amount of liposuction

procedure

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.300

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
days after the procedure I believe we

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.610 
days after the procedure I believe we
have<00:03:18.240> some<00:03:18.450> current<00:03:18.780> afters<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.200> were<00:03:19.440> just

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
have some current afters that were just

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.060 
have some current afters that were just
sent<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.950> us<00:03:20.070> from<00:03:20.730> dr.<00:03:21.150> Reza<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.680> patient

sent to us from dr. Reza of the patient

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.540 
sent to us from dr. Reza of the patient
that<00:03:23.370> we<00:03:23.760> saw<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> piece<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:25.310> there<00:03:26.310> we<00:03:26.400> go

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
that we saw in the piece and there we go

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.750 
that we saw in the piece and there we go
that<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.120> believe<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.780> before<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:29.370> there's

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
that I believe is the before and there's

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.880 
that I believe is the before and there's
the<00:03:30.030> after<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.900> she's<00:03:31.560> wearing<00:03:31.740> a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
the after and she's wearing a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.310 
the after and she's wearing a
tight-fitting<00:03:32.460> top<00:03:33.180> there<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.720> there's<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
tight-fitting top there and there's the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.290 
tight-fitting top there and there's the
after<00:03:34.650> with<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.950> bra<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.430> can<00:03:35.610> see<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.030> mean

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
after with the bra so you can see I mean

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.670 
after with the bra so you can see I mean
there<00:03:36.450> definitely<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.020> difference<00:03:37.560> and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680

in her 50s and basically you know as you

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
in her 50s and basically you know as you
get<00:03:45.959> older<00:03:46.230> your<00:03:46.410> skin<00:03:46.650> starts<00:03:46.920> up<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:47.520> it
