00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.099
 the side 10 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.200
 today we will show in one of the looks that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.509
 I use the most in my day to day life. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.760
 practical and simple and it 's nothing much 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.960
 complicated or anything too exaggerated by 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.740
 I think that anyone can 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.689
 do 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 sorry I did not make you more virgin 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 since December but the school has 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.210
 It does not leave much time that I was 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 complicated for me but I'll try 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.850
 How can you use these processes? 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:57.480
 to fix the timbu martyr rosary 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:01:01.140
 the dispute he made to define my 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.149
 That's the reason why people use drugs. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.880
 I usually do is see more or less 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.119
 that and my cheekbones and I 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.549

 Metro to cry I'll use far west 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.870
 the mystery 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.750
 a luxury to use this mac china climate is 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.750
 which is a pink disco with big cries 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:09.910
 like the tests where they used this product 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:15.970

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.220

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.620
 always much more complicated for me 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.450
 make a way who was who in this 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.750
 here because I know that when I went 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.030
 doing only responsible makeup is very 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.830
 thin and then do what they do 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.200
 you want it much easier 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.630

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.720
 I really like that it's on two sides in 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:36.620
 that lasts a long time and therefore be
