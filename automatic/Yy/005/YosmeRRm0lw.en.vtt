iphone 4 which is pretty miserable so

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.570 
iphone 4 which is pretty miserable so
the<00:00:23.609> options<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.119> very<00:00:24.380> slim<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:25.500> 7.1<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:26.340> if

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the options are very slim on 7.1 now if

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.810 
the options are very slim on 7.1 now if
you<00:00:27.090> go<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.420> 7.1<00:00:28.019> 7.0<00:00:29.010> point<00:00:29.220> 6<00:00:29.429> which<00:00:29.640> was

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
you go up to 7.1 7.0 point 6 which was

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.479 
you go up to 7.1 7.0 point 6 which was
the<00:00:30.230> exploitable<00:00:31.230> current<00:00:31.830> version<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the exploitable current version as of

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.750 
the exploitable current version as of
yesterday<00:00:33.739> will<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.130> available<00:00:35.399> for

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
yesterday will not be available for

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
yesterday will not be available for
downgrade<00:00:36.210> they've<00:00:36.450> stopped<00:00:36.780> signing<00:00:37.620> those

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
downgrade they've stopped signing those

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.729 
downgrade they've stopped signing those
blobs<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.550> once<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> go<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.090> 7.1<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.320> can't<00:00:40.590> go

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
blobs so once you go to 7.1 you can't go

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.240 
blobs so once you go to 7.1 you can't go
back<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:42.360> 7.1<00:00:42.989> very<00:00:43.770> little<00:00:44.070> has<00:00:44.219> changed

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
back so in 7.1 very little has changed

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970 
back so in 7.1 very little has changed
if<00:00:44.940> you're<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.149> some<00:00:45.390> point<00:00:45.600> 0.6<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> ssl<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
if you're on some point 0.6 the ssl a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
if you're on some point 0.6 the ssl a
vulnerability<00:00:47.820> has<00:00:48.149> already<00:00:48.300> been<00:00:48.510> fixed<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
vulnerability has already been fixed and

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.270 
vulnerability has already been fixed and
if<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.260> jailbroken<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.070> obviously

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
if you're jailbroken you can obviously

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.410 
if you're jailbroken you can obviously
fix<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> yourself<00:00:51.410> tiny<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.680> changes<00:00:53.390> got<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
fix it yourself tiny you I changes got a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.650 
fix it yourself tiny you I changes got a
few<00:00:54.750> bug<00:00:55.680> fixes<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.670> also

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
few bug fixes here and there also

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.970 
few bug fixes here and there also
everything<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.590> smoother

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
everything is a little smoother

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.549 
everything is a little smoother
especially<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.210> older<00:01:00.449> devices<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
especially on the older devices so you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
especially on the older devices so you
can<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.800> here's<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.730> small<00:01:03.090> example

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
can see here's just one a small example

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.050 
can see here's just one a small example
of<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.830> differences<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.470> 7.1<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.880> really

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
of the differences and 7.1 so not really

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
of the differences and 7.1 so not really
a<00:01:09.180> lot<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.080> jailbreak<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.979> will

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
a lot of the jailbreak for this will

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.570 
a lot of the jailbreak for this will
require<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.640> full<00:01:12.799> completely<00:01:13.799> new<00:01:13.979> exploit

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
require a full completely new exploit

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.240 
require a full completely new exploit
and<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.390> means<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.770> easily<00:01:17.070> take

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and that means that it will easily take

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.350 
and that means that it will easily take
months<00:01:17.759> maybe<00:01:18.320> later<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.560> year<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:20.250> iOS<00:01:20.970> 8

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
months maybe later this year when iOS 8

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
months maybe later this year when iOS 8
comes<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.140> because<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.860> honest<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:24.060> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
comes out because to be honest a lot of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.370 
comes out because to be honest a lot of
the<00:01:24.240> people<00:01:24.509> were<00:01:24.570> already<00:01:24.689> pissed<00:01:25.080> at

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the people were already pissed at

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.969 
the people were already pissed at
developers<00:01:26.280> were<00:01:26.490> pissed<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> taiji

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
developers were pissed about the taiji

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.149 
developers were pissed about the taiji
problems<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.610> top<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.979> Apple<00:01:31.979> has

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
problems and on top of that Apple has

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.710 
problems and on top of that Apple has
been<00:01:32.369> adding<00:01:32.700> more<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:32.939> more<00:01:33.090> security<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
been adding more and more security to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.350 
been adding more and more security to
every<00:01:34.409> version<00:01:34.650> making<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.729> harder<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
every version making it harder and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.090 
every version making it harder and
harder<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> jailbreak<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> honestly<00:01:37.560> don't

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
harder to jailbreak so I honestly don't

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.149 
harder to jailbreak so I honestly don't
I<00:01:38.490> wouldn't<00:01:39.360> expect<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:40.020> jailbreak<00:01:40.560> until

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I wouldn't expect a jailbreak until

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
I wouldn't expect a jailbreak until
later<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.670> year<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.930> Jo<00:01:43.110> broken

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
later this year so if you are Jo broken

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.580 
later this year so if you are Jo broken
and<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:45.110> customizability<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and like your customizability and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.319 
and like your customizability and
everything<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.060> out

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
everything that you have from that out

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.780 
everything that you have from that out
stay<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:49.850> 7.0<00:01:50.850> point<00:01:51.090> 6<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.689> lower<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.790> 7.1

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
stay on 7.0 point 6 or lower because 7.1

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.179 
stay on 7.0 point 6 or lower because 7.1
is<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> bring<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.659> Jewish<00:01:55.380> huge<00:01:55.770> issues

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
is going to bring you Jewish huge issues

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.219 
is going to bring you Jewish huge issues
now<00:01:56.460> another<00:01:56.909> question<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.360> being<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> lot<00:01:58.020> is

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
now another question that being a lot is

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.679
