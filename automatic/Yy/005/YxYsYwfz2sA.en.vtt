because<00:00:05.180> we<00:00:06.180> didn't<00:00:06.450> have<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.690> reading<00:00:07.170> a

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
because we didn't have the reading a

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.720 
because we didn't have the reading a

triple age we didn't have Stephanie we
didn't<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.030> Brock<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.660> thought<00:00:10.590> it<00:00:10.679> was<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
didn't have Brock I thought it was a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.070 
didn't have Brock I thought it was a
good<00:00:11.250> show<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:11.820> grape<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.240> those<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> good<00:00:12.809> show

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
good show not grape I those a good show

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.279 
good show not grape I those a good show
but<00:00:13.860> yet<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.490> rating<00:00:15.330> did<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.719> reflect<00:00:16.049> that

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
but yet the rating did not reflect that

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.070 
but yet the rating did not reflect that
because<00:00:16.740> they<00:00:17.520> did<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.000> guess<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.600> second

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
because they did I guess it's the second

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.420 
because they did I guess it's the second
lowest<00:00:19.289> non-holiday<00:00:20.270> raw<00:00:21.270> rating<00:00:21.869> since<00:00:22.430> 1997

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
lowest non-holiday raw rating since 1997

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.029 
lowest non-holiday raw rating since 1997
with<00:00:23.760> no<00:00:24.300> competition<00:00:25.019> there<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.199> no<00:00:25.350> NFL

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
with no competition there was no NFL

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.310 
with no competition there was no NFL
football<00:00:26.460> there<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:26.849> no<00:00:26.970> NBA<00:00:27.240> Finals<00:00:27.750> there

football there was no NBA Finals there

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.060 
football there was no NBA Finals there
was<00:00:28.470> nothing<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:30.140> think<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> boils<00:00:31.590> down<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
was nothing I think it boils down to a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.150 
was nothing I think it boils down to a
lot<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.640> you're<00:00:33.510> showing<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> same<00:00:34.350> matches

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
lot is you're showing the same matches

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.240 
lot is you're showing the same matches
all<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.390> time<00:00:36.600> mean<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> tag<00:00:37.320> match<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.129> was

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
all the time mean the tag match that was

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.250 
all the time mean the tag match that was
announced<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:39.390> how<00:00:39.570> many<00:00:39.750> times<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.200> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
announced like how many times have we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
announced like how many times have we
seen<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> tag<00:00:40.860> match<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.340> all<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.670> you're

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
seen a tag match and all these it you're

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.299 
seen a tag match and all these it you're
not<00:00:42.149> giving<00:00:42.300> anybody<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.989> reason<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.860> what's

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
not giving anybody a reason to what's

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.130 
not giving anybody a reason to what's
different<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.149> show<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.719> we

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
different about this show that we

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
different about this show that we
haven't<00:00:46.379> seen<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.710> Smackdown<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.430> raw<00:00:47.640> prior

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
haven't seen on Smackdown or raw prior

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
haven't seen on Smackdown or raw prior
and<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> think<00:00:48.600> that's<00:00:48.750> been<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:48.989> problem<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and I think that's been the problem is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.010 
and I think that's been the problem is
you<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.730> been<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> little<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.480> think

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you know it's been a little I think

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.229 
you know it's been a little I think
that's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.469> big<00:00:52.680> thing<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that's a big thing that what do you

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
that's a big thing that what do you
think's<00:00:54.449> missing<00:00:54.840> right<00:00:54.989> now<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.559> show

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
think's missing right now from that show

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.420 
think's missing right now from that show
because<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.750> think<00:00:57.750> when<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.800> look<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:59.399> it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because I think when you look at it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
because I think when you look at it
there's<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> don't<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.079> Brock<00:01:01.469> Lesnar

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
there's when you don't have Brock Lesnar

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.160 
there's when you don't have Brock Lesnar
on<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.190> show<00:01:02.430> something<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.329> missing<00:01:03.539> part

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.560 
on that show something is missing part
of<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:04.760> they<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.970> trying<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> back

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of it is because they are trying to back

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.890 
of it is because they are trying to back
off<00:01:06.810> John<00:01:07.110> Cena<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.490> guy<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.330> rely<00:01:09.510> on

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
focal point like you once was and and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.359 
focal point like you once was and and
that<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:23.640> easily<00:01:23.790> change<00:01:24.049> but<00:01:25.369> what

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that that could easily change but what

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.100 
that that could easily change but what
do<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.759> missing<00:01:27.090> right<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.570> or

do you think is missing right now or
what<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> problem<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
what do you think is a problem that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.179 
what do you think is a problem that
maybe<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.670> turning<00:01:30.060> some<00:01:30.210> people<00:01:30.479> away<00:01:31.189> just

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
maybe is turning some people away just

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
maybe is turning some people away just
the<00:01:32.280> fact<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.659> said<00:01:33.810> formats<00:01:34.439> being

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the fact that like I said formats being

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.859 
the fact that like I said formats being
the<00:01:34.680> same<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.070> think<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> talent<00:01:35.909> people

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.749 
the same and i think the talent people
are<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> lot<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.500> fans<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.610> burned

out about seeing a lot of the talent and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
out about seeing a lot of the talent and
they're<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> hurting<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.540> far<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.960> the

they're kind of hurting as far as on the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
they're kind of hurting as far as on the
roster<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.549> they're<00:01:44.700> they're

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
roster and you know they're they're

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.280 
roster and you know they're they're
using<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.079> know<00:01:46.110> they

using they have a lot of you know they

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.109 
using they have a lot of you know they
have<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.920> new<00:01:47.070> guys<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.520> they're<00:01:47.670> they're

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
have some new guys that they're they're

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.810 
have some new guys that they're they're
pushing<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.100> thing<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.520> NXT

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pushing but that's the thing about NXT

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.550 
pushing but that's the thing about NXT
is<00:01:51.149> every<00:01:51.390> week<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.840> different<00:01:52.259> guys<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
is every week you see different guys and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980 
is every week you see different guys and
every<00:01:53.189> no<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.610> only<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.880> an<00:01:53.970> hour<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.570> it's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
every no they only have an hour so it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.770 
every no they only have an hour so it's
just<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> different<00:01:56.219> shoe<00:01:56.369> quicker<00:01:56.850> show

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
just it's a different shoe quicker show

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
just it's a different shoe quicker show
moves<00:01:58.049> quicker<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> think<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> pacing<00:01:59.399> of

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
moves quicker and I think the pacing of

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.950 
moves quicker and I think the pacing of
it<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> makes<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.390> quicker<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.659> gives<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it is it makes it quicker and gives you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.770 
it is it makes it quicker and gives you
a<00:02:01.020> reason<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> watch<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.579> WB's<00:02:03.360> missing<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a reason to watch so they WB's missing I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.929 
a reason to watch so they WB's missing I
mean<00:02:03.930> they're<00:02:04.110> too<00:02:04.380> big<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
mean they're too big I don't have to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.190 
mean they're too big I don't have to
give<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.180> reason<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> watch<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.990> show<00:02:07.170> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
give you a reason to watch the show I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.389 
give you a reason to watch the show I
think<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.649> wasn't<00:02:07.920> that's<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> main<00:02:08.369> thing

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
think that wasn't that's the main thing

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.219 
think that wasn't that's the main thing
you<00:02:08.610> want<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.239> don't<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:09.989> what

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you want to do I don't know what

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.720 
you want to do I don't know what
compelling<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.009> guess<00:02:11.160> compelling<00:02:11.580> more

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
compelling I guess compelling more

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.250 
compelling I guess compelling more
compelling<00:02:12.120> storylines<00:02:12.629> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
compelling storylines and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.600 
compelling storylines and
instead<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.470> focusing<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.129> same<00:02:14.400> one

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
instead of focusing on the same one

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.330 
instead of focusing on the same one
every<00:02:14.819> week<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> authority<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:17.189> not

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
every week at the authority and and not

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.339 
every week at the authority and and not

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
having you know Brock Lesnar there I

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.679 
having you know Brock Lesnar there I
guess<00:02:19.860> didn't<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.909> know<00:02:21.030> doesn't<00:02:21.239> help<00:02:21.480> them

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
guess didn't you know doesn't help them

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.449 
guess didn't you know doesn't help them
