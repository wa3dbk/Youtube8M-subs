tracking device I haven't seen the movie
yet<00:02:56.180> so<00:02:56.540> but<00:02:57.470> based<00:02:57.710> on<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.010> bio<00:02:58.190> booklet<00:02:58.640> I

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
yet so but based on the bio booklet I

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.700 
yet so but based on the bio booklet I
guess<00:02:59.240> this<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.780> tracking<00:03:00.410> device<00:03:00.680> that
