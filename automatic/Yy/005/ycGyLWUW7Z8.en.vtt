00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.859 
I'm going to make a bit of a Miss play I
go<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.579> X<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.000> ur<00:01:51.030> rather<00:01:51.479> than<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
go for the X is ur rather than the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.569 
go for the X is ur rather than the
u-turn<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.780> really<00:01:54.780> didn't<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
u-turn because I really didn't want to

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
u-turn because I really didn't want to
be<00:01:56.579> stuck<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.119> another<00:01:57.329> poke<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.899> thought

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
be stuck in on another poke I thought

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.990 
be stuck in on another poke I thought
that<00:01:58.200> BG<00:01:58.560> over<00:01:58.799> Seraphin<00:01:59.219> was<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.579> best<00:01:59.759> match

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that BG over Seraphin was my best match

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.609 
that BG over Seraphin was my best match
up<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.420> opted<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.020> go<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.290> u-turn

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
up so I opted not to go for the u-turn

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.100 
up so I opted not to go for the u-turn
although<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.180> really<00:02:03.750> could<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:03.960> in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
although really I I really could have in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.639 
although really I I really could have in
that<00:02:04.140> scenario<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:05.009> thought<00:02:05.340> he<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.670> gonna<00:02:05.759> sub

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
that scenario I thought he was gonna sub

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
that scenario I thought he was gonna sub
and<00:02:07.649> try<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.129> sub<00:02:08.399> para<00:02:08.670> me<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.599> that's

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and try to like sub para me so that's

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.530 
and try to like sub para me so that's
kind<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> my<00:02:10.379> my<00:02:10.800> logic<00:02:11.340> for<00:02:11.520> staying<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.450> at

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
kind of my my logic for staying in so at

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.460

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.780 
thinking I can take whatever he wants to
go<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.860> he<00:02:40.920> does<00:02:41.070> optus<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.550> go<00:02:41.640> for<00:02:41.730> the

go for and he does optus just go for the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.370 
go for and he does optus just go for the
grass<00:02:42.060> knot<00:02:42.270> which<00:02:42.480> obviously<00:02:42.810> had<00:02:43.050> taken

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
grass knot which obviously had taken

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.980 
grass knot which obviously had taken
take<00:02:43.530> very<00:02:43.800> well<00:02:43.980> being<00:02:44.720> resistant<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.870> all

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
take very well being resistant and all

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.780 
take very well being resistant and all
that<00:02:46.140> kind<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.410> stuff<00:02:46.560> even<00:02:47.459> with<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.670> life

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that kind of stuff even with the life

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.970 
that kind of stuff even with the life
orb<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.660> he's<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.650> volt<00:02:49.860> switch

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
orb so he's going to just volt switch

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.500 
orb so he's going to just volt switch
out<00:02:50.220> here<00:02:50.430> while<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.670> ought<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.910> set<00:02:51.150> up<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.330> calm

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
out here while I ought to set up a calm

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.000 
out here while I ought to set up a calm
mind<00:02:51.720> knowing<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.350> be<00:02:52.470> faster<00:02:52.920> and

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
mind knowing that I will be faster and

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.290 
mind knowing that I will be faster and
after<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.250> calm<00:02:53.490> mind<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.820> should<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.090> able<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
after a calm mind I should be able to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.550 
after a calm mind I should be able to
take<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> vault<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:54.900> relatively<00:02:55.230> well

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
take a vault so it's relatively well

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.930 
take a vault so it's relatively well
especially<00:02:55.890> factoring<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.580> leftovers

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
especially factoring in the leftovers

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.880 
especially factoring in the leftovers
recovery<00:02:57.300> which<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.200> going<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> be<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> case

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
recovery which is going to be the case

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.560 
recovery which is going to be the case
so<00:02:59.190> now<00:02:59.310> I'm<00:02:59.520> sitting<00:02:59.790> with<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.030> plus<00:03:00.240> one<00:03:00.300> tenth

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
so now I'm sitting with a plus one tenth

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.449 
so now I'm sitting with a plus one tenth
a<00:03:00.660> which<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.930> pretty<00:03:01.080> nice<00:03:01.260> for<00:03:01.500> me<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.830> know<00:03:02.340> I

later<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:17.459> as<00:03:17.610> we<00:03:17.790> discussed<00:03:17.880> um<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:19.010> was

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
later but as we discussed um I was

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.229 
later but as we discussed um I was
trying<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.280> make<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.550> a<00:03:20.580> little<00:03:20.700> faster<00:03:20.880> be<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
trying to make it a little faster be a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.030 
trying to make it a little faster be a
little<00:03:21.390> more<00:03:21.540> offensive<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.350> wasn't<00:03:22.860> sure

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
little more offensive and I wasn't sure

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.500 
little more offensive and I wasn't sure
that<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.250> fire<00:03:23.400> blast<00:03:23.670> at<00:03:23.820> +1<00:03:24.060> could<00:03:24.360> take<00:03:24.480> it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that the fire blast at +1 could take it

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.300 
that the fire blast at +1 could take it
out<00:03:24.690> or<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.050> I've<00:03:25.530> never<00:03:25.769> fought<00:03:26.040> against

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
out or not I've never fought against

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.460 
out or not I've never fought against
this<00:03:26.430> thing<00:03:26.640> before<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.420> I'm<00:03:27.600> looking<00:03:28.080> at<00:03:28.290> its

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
this thing before but I'm looking at its

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.620 
this thing before but I'm looking at its
stats<00:03:28.950> on<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.030> looking<00:03:30.300> at<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.540> on

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
stats on the you know looking at it on

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.690 
stats on the you know looking at it on
paper<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:31.140> does<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.530> pretty<00:03:32.070> pretty

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
paper it does have a pretty pretty

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.670 
paper it does have a pretty pretty
decent<00:03:33.060> defenses<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.780> I'm<00:03:34.019> not<00:03:34.170> too<00:03:34.320> surprised

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
decent defenses so I'm not too surprised

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.040 
decent defenses so I'm not too surprised
at<00:03:34.860> love<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.209> regardless<00:03:36.209> um<00:03:36.420> obvious

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
at love that regardless um obvious

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.170 
at love that regardless um obvious
revenge<00:03:37.350> kill<00:03:37.590> with<00:03:37.739> Sharpedo<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.250> obvious<00:03:38.730> he

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
revenge kill with Sharpedo is obvious he

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.610 
revenge kill with Sharpedo is obvious he
doesn't<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.540> too<00:03:39.690> much<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.959> switch<00:03:40.200> into<00:03:40.350> it

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
doesn't have too much to switch into it

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.520 
doesn't have too much to switch into it
so<00:03:41.220> oh<00:03:41.489> my<00:03:41.940> screen<00:03:42.510> recording<00:03:42.840> skips<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.200> second

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
so oh my screen recording skips a second

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.990 
so oh my screen recording skips a second
there<00:03:43.680> but<00:03:43.890> he<00:03:43.980> makes<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.280> double<00:03:44.610> switch<00:03:44.820> he

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
there but he makes a double switch he

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.060 
there but he makes a double switch he
brings<00:03:45.239> in<00:03:45.450> his<00:03:45.630> um<00:03:45.959> dude<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.560> then<00:03:46.650> switches

brings in his um dude and then switches

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.410 
brings in his um dude and then switches
to<00:03:47.100> elect<00:03:47.459> Ross<00:03:47.700> thinking<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.360> would

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
to elect Ross thinking that I would

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.840 
to elect Ross thinking that I would
switch<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.620> that's<00:03:50.220> what<00:03:50.340> happened<00:03:50.489> there

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
of what an alien force since my intake

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.469 
of what an alien force since my intake
went<00:04:35.740> down<00:04:35.889> so<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.880> fact<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.090> he<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.240> life

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479

that Sharpedo is not going to be you I I

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.879 
that Sharpedo is not going to be you I I
felt<00:05:40.690> like<00:05:40.840> Sharpedo<00:05:41.200> would<00:05:41.380> not<00:05:41.500> be<00:05:41.650> able<00:05:41.710> to

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
felt like Sharpedo would not be able to

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.640 
felt like Sharpedo would not be able to
KO<00:05:42.039> it<00:05:42.310> at<00:05:42.700> the<00:05:42.940> range<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.300> he<00:05:43.539> was<00:05:43.690> at<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.620> I

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
KO it at the range that he was at so I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.140 
KO it at the range that he was at so I
needed<00:05:45.039> to<00:05:45.099> get<00:05:45.220> a<00:05:45.250> little<00:05:45.340> bit<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.580> damage<00:05:45.789> on

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
needed to get a little bit of damage on

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.210 
needed to get a little bit of damage on
him<00:05:46.389> first<00:05:46.660> even<00:05:47.139> if<00:05:47.260> it's<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.710> life<00:05:47.919> /

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
him first even if it's just the life /

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.190 
him first even if it's just the life /
coil<00:05:48.460> so<00:05:48.940> now<00:05:49.120> I<00:05:49.180> bring<00:05:49.419> in<00:05:49.539> Sharpedo<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.110> I'm

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
coil so now I bring in Sharpedo and I'm

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.990 
coil so now I bring in Sharpedo and I'm
able<00:05:50.470> to<00:05:50.590> kill<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.950> crunch<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.430> really<00:05:51.910> don't

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
able to kill the crunch I really don't

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.700 
able to kill the crunch I really don't
know<00:05:52.180> if<00:05:52.210> I<00:05:52.389> could<00:05:52.539> have<00:05:52.630> without<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.080> because

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
know if I could have without it because

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.680 
know if I could have without it because
this<00:05:53.889> is<00:05:54.039> non<00:05:54.250> natomas<00:05:54.789> speed<00:05:55.030> boost<00:05:55.240> Sharpedo

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
this is non natomas speed boost Sharpedo

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.480 
this is non natomas speed boost Sharpedo
it<00:05:55.870> is<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.229> hasty<00:05:56.940> a<00:05:58.470> rough<00:05:59.470> skin<00:05:59.680> set<00:05:59.949> so<00:06:00.220> that's

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
it is a hasty a rough skin set so that's

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.100 
it is a hasty a rough skin set so that's
gonna<00:06:00.610> be<00:06:00.669> the<00:06:00.789> case<00:06:00.849> there<00:06:01.180> so<00:06:01.750> I'm<00:06:01.870> going<00:06:02.050> to

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
gonna be the case there so I'm going to

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.529 
gonna be the case there so I'm going to
switch<00:06:02.229> into<00:06:02.349> a<00:06:02.699> slow<00:06:03.699> King<00:06:03.970> on<00:06:04.180> this<00:06:04.360> guy

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
switch into a slow King on this guy

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.330 
switch into a slow King on this guy
knowing<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:05.020> I<00:06:05.050> do<00:06:05.139> resist<00:06:05.410> a<00:06:05.650> stab<00:06:05.919> move<00:06:06.160> I

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
knowing that I do resist a stab move I

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.529 
knowing that I do resist a stab move I
should<00:06:06.490> be<00:06:06.610> able<00:06:06.699> to<00:06:06.849> take<00:06:06.970> it<00:06:07.090> fairly<00:06:07.270> well

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
should be able to take it fairly well

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.570 
should be able to take it fairly well
and<00:06:07.660> this<00:06:07.750> is<00:06:07.900> a<00:06:07.960> physically<00:06:08.410> actually<00:06:09.340> no<00:06:09.430> I

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
and this is a physically actually no I

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.860 
and this is a physically actually no I
think<00:06:09.760> this<00:06:09.849> slow<00:06:10.360> king<00:06:10.539> is<00:06:10.630> actually

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
think this slow king is actually

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.080 
think this slow king is actually
specially<00:06:11.199> defensive<00:06:11.590> my<00:06:11.770> mistake<00:06:12.070> so<00:06:12.789> I'm

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
specially defensive my mistake so I'm

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.879 
specially defensive my mistake so I'm
gonna<00:06:13.300> make<00:06:13.539> a<00:06:13.750> pretty<00:06:14.080> good<00:06:14.229> play<00:06:14.470> here<00:06:14.740> and

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
gonna make a pretty good play here and

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.860 
gonna make a pretty good play here and
predict<00:06:15.250> his<00:06:15.400> switch<00:06:15.729> and<00:06:16.030> go<00:06:16.570> back<00:06:16.840> into

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
predict his switch and go back into

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.230 
predict his switch and go back into
rocket<00:06:17.380> man<00:06:17.530> because<00:06:18.340> obviously<00:06:18.370> he<00:06:19.030> had<00:06:19.210> a

this guy and not with his other guy so

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.610 
this guy and not with his other guy so
I'm<00:06:24.669> google<00:06:25.090> for<00:06:25.240> the<00:06:25.330> Aquajet<00:06:25.720> predicting

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
I'm google for the Aquajet predicting

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.409 
I'm google for the Aquajet predicting
his<00:06:26.740> Sucker<00:06:27.010> Punch<00:06:27.340> and<00:06:27.610> that<00:06:27.910> was<00:06:28.060> actually<00:06:28.180> a

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
his Sucker Punch and that was actually a

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.300 
his Sucker Punch and that was actually a
really<00:06:28.660> important<00:06:29.139> play<00:06:29.289> for<00:06:29.500> me<00:06:29.590> I<00:06:29.770> knew<00:06:30.280> that

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
really important play for me I knew that

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.490 
really important play for me I knew that
he<00:06:30.550> had<00:06:30.639> t-wave<00:06:31.090> iron<00:06:31.479> head<00:06:31.720> wasn't<00:06:32.110> sure<00:06:32.380> what

he had t-wave iron head wasn't sure what

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.520 
he had t-wave iron head wasn't sure what
his<00:06:32.680> other<00:06:32.949> move<00:06:33.220> was<00:06:33.849> perhaps<00:06:34.750> swords<00:06:35.320> dance

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
his other move was perhaps swords dance

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.010 
his other move was perhaps swords dance
or<00:06:35.860> something<00:06:36.550> I'm<00:06:37.030> not<00:06:37.360> really<00:06:37.510> sure<00:06:37.630> what

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
or something I'm not really sure what

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.640 
or something I'm not really sure what
the<00:06:38.110> case<00:06:38.289> was<00:06:38.320> but<00:06:39.219> I<00:06:39.250> was

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
the case was but I was

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.930 
the case was but I was
predicting<00:06:39.949> the<00:06:40.040> sucker<00:06:40.220> punch<00:06:40.310> there<00:06:40.699> so

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
predicting the sucker punch there so

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.520 
predicting the sucker punch there so
that<00:06:40.970> really<00:06:41.330> helped<00:06:41.690> me<00:06:41.810> out<00:06:41.840> and<00:06:42.169> not<00:06:42.290> taking

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
that really helped me out and not taking

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.110 
that really helped me out and not taking
damage<00:06:42.919> with<00:06:43.220> Sharpedo<00:06:43.580> other<00:06:43.790> than<00:06:43.970> my<00:06:44.090> own
