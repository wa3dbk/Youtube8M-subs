sanitary protection to girls and women
in<00:01:08.130> Rwanda<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.820> plan<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> use<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> social

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
in Rwanda we plan to use a social

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
in Rwanda we plan to use a social
enterprise<00:01:10.500> model<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.580> women<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.020> own

enterprise model in which women can own
and<00:01:13.470> operate<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.920> machine<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.490> they'll<00:01:14.729> be

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and operate a machine and they'll be

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.280 
and operate a machine and they'll be
able<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.060> sell<00:01:15.330> pads<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.960> their<00:01:16.080> local

able to sell pads in their local

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.710 
able to sell pads in their local
communities<00:01:17.090> we<00:01:18.090> predict<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.450> they'll<00:01:18.630> be

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
communities we predict that they'll be

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.330 
communities we predict that they'll be
able<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> sell<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.350> pads<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> price<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
able to sell these pads for a price of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
able to sell these pads for a price of
75<00:01:21.119> cents<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> pack<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> 10<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
75 cents for a pack of 10 which is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
75 cents for a pack of 10 which is
significantly<00:01:23.340> less<00:01:23.670> than<00:01:23.909> what's<00:01:24.330> currently

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
significantly less than what's currently

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
significantly less than what's currently
available<00:01:24.960> which<00:01:25.470> sells<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:25.860> 2<00:01:26.189> dollars<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
available which sells for 2 dollars and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.969 
available which sells for 2 dollars and
20<00:01:26.939> cents<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> pack<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.600> 10<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.049> Rwanda<00:01:28.500> so

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
20 cents for a pack of 10 in Rwanda so

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
20 cents for a pack of 10 in Rwanda so
there's<00:01:29.189> still<00:01:29.460> work<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.000> needs<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.390> done

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
there's still work that needs to be done

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
there's still work that needs to be done
right<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.020> we're<00:01:31.229> still<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.040> design

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
right now we're still in the design

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.730 
right now we're still in the design
stage

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
stage

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.370 
stage
so<00:01:34.040> we're<00:01:34.189> looking<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.729> improve<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.780> the
