00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.629
 more worrisome is the high cost 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.629
 economic 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.219
 the football stadium of the city

 resistance to medium which forces 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.120
 build 12 new columns which 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.250
 merits a budget edition of 4 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.450
 one billion pesos more so that the 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.520
 structure reach a level of 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.500
 high seismic resistance that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.060
 established by law and by

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.120
 until the new date that is 30 and 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.520
 always asked for a budget addition 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.900
 for 4 billion pesos more to 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.970
 finish the works that currently 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.040
 execute in the structure remaining 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.630
 pending adjudication and execution

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.990
 and 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.870
 It seems committed billion 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.599
 weights more than a year 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.590
 the football stadium that until the 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.590
 moment is not a reality 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.849
 for the World Cup sub-20 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.560

 Pereira which had a cost of 29 thousand 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:18.400
 500 million pesos and its construction 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.709
 it took only 16 months the nation contributed 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.380
 15 billion pesos the government 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.540

 that the city hall contributed 10 billion 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.370
 of pesos we have in mind that this 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.410
 stadium has covered 90% of its 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.440
 tribas and that has the ability 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.210
 of 39 thousand 500 spectators 29 thousand 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.190
 spectators more than what the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.300

 with meanings 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.840
 the oil company deserves to burst in new 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.840
