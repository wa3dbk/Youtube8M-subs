by<00:01:38.070> rotating<00:01:38.280> ahead<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.970> move<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.360> up

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
by rotating ahead we can move this up

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.800 
by rotating ahead we can move this up
and<00:01:40.290> down<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.080> majority<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.170> homo<00:01:43.350> out

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
and down you get a majority the homo out

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
well then why leave it standing up if we

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.979 
well then why leave it standing up if we
lay<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> down<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:14.459> oil<00:02:14.700> will<00:02:15.300> run<00:02:15.330> through<00:02:15.810> one

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
lay it down the oil will run through one

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.720 
lay it down the oil will run through one
side<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> other<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.860> won't<00:02:17.130> get<00:02:17.310> where<00:02:17.610> we

yeah our oil move the mechanism rotate

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.270 
yeah our oil move the mechanism rotate
the<00:03:01.510> mechanism<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.650> we<00:03:02.739> want<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.010> leave<00:03:03.159> it

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
the mechanism and we want to leave it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.069 
the mechanism and we want to leave it

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
right off the race in the middle so what

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.720 
right off the race in the middle so what
we<00:03:13.780> want<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.049> do<00:03:14.170> this<00:03:14.889> want<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.430> move<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.639> about

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
we want to do this want to move it about

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.509 
we want to do this want to move it about
halfway<00:03:16.090> through<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.689> stroke<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.400> about

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
halfway through the stroke so it's about

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.610 
halfway through the stroke so it's about
right<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.879> the<00:03:18.939> middle<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.840> we<00:03:20.230> don't<00:03:20.409> want<00:03:20.560> to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
right in the middle and we don't want to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.500 
right in the middle and we don't want to
use<00:03:20.709> any<00:03:20.950> force<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.790> goes<00:03:22.000> together<00:03:22.180> made

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
use any force it goes together made

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.259 
use any force it goes together made
smooth<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.049> easy<00:03:23.169> it<00:03:24.099> performs<00:03:24.609> in<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.879> we're
