black holes one black ops 2 all the dlc

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
black holes one black ops 2 all the dlc
so<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.619> good<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.130> sight<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.759> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so it's good to see in sight that it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
so it's good to see in sight that it's
something<00:01:39.180> completely<00:01:39.840> new<00:01:39.869> which<00:01:40.290> kind<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
something completely new which kind of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.760 
something completely new which kind of
hints<00:01:41.189> towards<00:01:41.340> kool<00:01:41.790> g<00:01:42.000> 2015<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.409> could

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
hints towards kool g 2015 so this could

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.310 
hints towards kool g 2015 so this could
be<00:01:43.920> our<00:01:43.950> very<00:01:44.399> first<00:01:44.880> look<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.990> brand<00:01:46.170> new

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
be our very first look at the brand new

be our very first look at the brand new
cool<00:01:46.590> GT<00:01:46.829> game<00:01:47.100> which<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.640> awesome<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
cool GT game which is really awesome and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.050 
cool GT game which is really awesome and
also<00:01:48.630> gives<00:01:49.170> us<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.439> few<00:01:49.649> clues<00:01:50.040> into<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
also gives us a few clues into what the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
also gives us a few clues into what the
games<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:51.930> whether<00:01:52.290> it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
games actually going to be whether it's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.499 
games actually going to be whether it's
going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.040> war<00:01:53.159> 2<00:01:53.399> or<00:01:53.700> black<00:01:53.939> ops<00:01:54.149> 3

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
going to be one at war 2 or black ops 3

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.569 
going to be one at war 2 or black ops 3
the<00:01:55.350> first<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.920> noticed<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the first thing that I noticed is the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.760 
the first thing that I noticed is the
shadow<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.450> background<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.680> think

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
shadow in the background because I think

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.620 
shadow in the background because I think
this<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> thing<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.640> gives<00:01:59.880> us<00:02:00.270> quite<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this is the thing that gives us quite a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.260 
this is the thing that gives us quite a
big<00:02:00.899> inclination<00:02:01.250> into<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> time<00:02:02.700> zone<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
big inclination into the time zone that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.520 
big inclination into the time zone that
the<00:02:03.360> game<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.659> going<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.869> settle<00:02:04.259> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the game is going to be settle this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.170 
the game is going to be settle this
particular<00:02:04.950> moment<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.820> set<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
particular moment is going to be set in

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.270 
particular moment is going to be set in
that<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> outline<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.039> very

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that the outline is that that is very

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.150 
that the outline is that that is very
similar<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.360> world<00:02:09.899> war<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.560> German

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
similar to a world war two German

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.520 
similar to a world war two German
soldier<00:02:11.700> very<00:02:12.180> similar<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.720> what<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.959> saw<00:02:13.170> in

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
soldier very similar to what we saw in

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.880 
soldier very similar to what we saw in
war

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
war

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.940

war<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.730> stuff<00:02:15.240> like<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.390> however<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.650> gun

war and stuff like that however the gun
is<00:02:17.250> not<00:02:17.790> an<00:02:17.940> old<00:02:18.090> gun<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.810> very<00:02:19.080> similar<00:02:19.319> to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
shapes like the i was thinking like the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.860 
shapes like the i was thinking like the

tar or the vector very similar to those
sort<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> shapes<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.220> definitely<00:02:26.459> not<00:02:26.850> a

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
sort of shapes but it's definitely not a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.449 
sort of shapes but it's definitely not a
gun<00:02:27.300> from<00:02:27.959> World<00:02:28.260> War<00:02:28.380> two<00:02:28.709> now<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.250> have

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
me thinking as well looking back at

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.840 
me thinking as well looking back at
previous<00:02:37.110> games<00:02:37.590> because<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.370> guys<00:02:38.550> might

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
previous games because you guys might

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.190 
previous games because you guys might
remember<00:02:38.880> back<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.660> black<00:02:39.810> ops<00:02:40.020> 2

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
remember back in the black ops 2

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.500 
remember back in the black ops 2
campaign<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:41.160> actually<00:02:41.459> went<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.120> one<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.330> the

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
campaign we actually went in one of the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.720 
campaign we actually went in one of the
missions<00:02:42.690> back<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.709> play<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.010> World<00:02:44.160> War<00:02:44.340> 2

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
missions back to play in World War 2

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.060 
missions back to play in World War 2
which<00:02:44.970> kind<00:02:45.239> of<00:02:45.330> got<00:02:45.480> me<00:02:45.630> thinking<00:02:45.660> what<00:02:46.650> kool

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
which kind of got me thinking what kool

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.580 
which kind of got me thinking what kool
g<00:02:47.340> 2015<00:02:48.150> could<00:02:48.420> potentially<00:02:48.959> be<00:02:49.140> how<00:02:49.380> from

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
g 2015 could potentially be how from

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.920 
g 2015 could potentially be how from
here<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.250> complete<00:02:50.820> speculation<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.750> I'd

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
here is complete speculation and I'd

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
here is complete speculation and I'd
love<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.380> hear<00:02:52.500> from<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.739> guys<00:02:53.070> definitely

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
may have some ideas that I might not

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.410 
may have some ideas that I might not
have<00:03:01.590> could<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.310> back<00:03:02.550> up<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.000> could<00:03:03.269> it

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
have could it be back up so you could it

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.120 
have could it be back up so you could it
be<00:03:03.540> world<00:03:03.780> at<00:03:03.900> war<00:03:04.080> 2<00:03:04.440> or<00:03:04.800> could<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.040> be

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
be world at war 2 or could it be

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
personally leading to more of a

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.850 
personally leading to more of a
crossover<00:03:08.970> something<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.050> includes<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
crossover something that includes the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.250 
crossover something that includes the
future<00:03:11.430> as<00:03:11.610> well<00:03:11.880> as<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.180> past<00:03:12.390> because<00:03:12.660> in

mixture of weapons or scent which would
be<00:03:20.459> really<00:03:20.670> cool<00:03:20.940> it'd<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.209> really<00:03:21.360> awesome<00:03:21.510> if
