the<00:03:49.540> tava<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.019> hot<00:03:50.319> enough<00:03:50.590> now<00:03:50.860> we<00:03:51.010> place<00:03:51.400> all

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
the tava is hot enough now we place all

00:03:51.670 --> 00:04:00.210 
the tava is hot enough now we place all
the<00:03:52.030> turkeys<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:58.260> we'll<00:03:59.260> put<00:03:59.500> some<00:03:59.860> more<00:04:00.069> oil

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.759 

let's<00:04:14.319> check<00:04:15.570> just<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.720> getting<00:04:17.049> brown<00:04:17.560> as

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
let's check just the getting brown as

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:26.279 
let's check just the getting brown as
you<00:04:17.919> can<00:04:18.100> see<00:04:24.449> moving<00:04:25.449> on<00:04:25.570> little<00:04:25.870> more<00:04:26.080> oil

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
you can see moving on little more oil

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:33.160 
you can see moving on little more oil
and<00:04:26.530> cook<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.860> on<00:04:26.979> another<00:04:27.430> side

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.890 

a<00:04:33.310> potato<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.670> green<00:04:34.910> pea<00:04:35.120> techies<00:04:35.510> are<00:04:35.750> now

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
a potato and green pea techies are now

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:46.200 
a potato and green pea techies are now
cooked<00:04:36.230> from<00:04:36.410> both<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:37.070> sides

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.450 

so<00:04:46.750> now<00:04:46.870> let's<00:04:47.169> go<00:04:47.380> see<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.800> final<00:04:48.160> step

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
so now let's go see to the final step

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.460 
so now let's go see to the final step
that<00:04:48.639> is<00:04:48.940> assembling<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.690> chart

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
so now we'll assemble it for one portion

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.740 
so now we'll assemble it for one portion
we<00:04:53.560> will<00:04:53.680> place<00:04:53.830> 2<00:04:54.100> turkeys<00:04:54.490> on<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:55.360> serving
