middle again I was starting to realize

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090

right<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:26.909> he<00:01:26.970> does<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.330> same<00:01:27.570> thing<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
right here he does the same thing and I

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.230 
right here he does the same thing and I
take<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.590> away<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.920> he<00:01:29.340> has<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> roll<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
take it away so he has to roll out and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
take it away so he has to roll out and
try<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.540> improvise<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.220> idea<00:01:32.250> Tim

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
try to improvise not a good idea Tim

Jennings<00:01:33.509> gets<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.900> pic<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.380> really<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.250> know

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
Jennings gets a pic I really do not know

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.179 
Jennings gets a pic I really do not know
why<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.970> threw<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.450> pass<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.590> guess<00:01:37.950> it's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
why he threw that pass but I guess it's

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.410 
why he threw that pass but I guess it's
just<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.880> away<00:01:38.909> people's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
just when you take away people's

just when you take away people's
