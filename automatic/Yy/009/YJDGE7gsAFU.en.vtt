and I stood and tears and tears my eyes

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.449 
and I stood and tears and tears my eyes
started<00:03:22.590> welling<00:03:22.769> up<00:03:22.949> because<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.310> had

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
started welling up because I had

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.140 
started welling up because I had
realized<00:03:23.879> that<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:26.150> deeply<00:03:28.849> shouted<00:03:29.849> really

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
realized that that deeply shouted really

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.089 
realized that that deeply shouted really
heartfelt<00:03:30.540> prayer<00:03:31.379> was<00:03:32.480> was<00:03:33.480> heard<00:03:33.989> but<00:03:34.769> it

heartfelt prayer was was heard but it

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.890 
heartfelt prayer was was heard but it
would<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.459> seemed<00:03:35.730> weird<00:03:36.120> at<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.480> time<00:03:36.690> of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
would have seemed weird at the time of

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.259 
would have seemed weird at the time of
somebody<00:03:37.229> with<00:03:37.409> wings<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:39.120> know<00:03:39.239> a

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
down but my conscious mind my

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.330 
down but my conscious mind my
intellectual<00:03:45.540> mind<00:03:45.720> was<00:03:45.900> able<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.379> accept<00:03:47.129> it

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
intellectual mind was able to accept it

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.530 
intellectual mind was able to accept it
like<00:03:47.669> that<00:03:47.909> yes<00:03:48.479> and<00:03:49.340> I've<00:03:50.340> always<00:03:50.790> felt<00:03:51.389> like

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
like that yes and I've always felt like

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.689 
like that yes and I've always felt like
that<00:03:51.750> was<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:52.290> was<00:03:52.470> either<00:03:52.739> my<00:03:53.190> guardian

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
that was that was either my guardian

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.000 
that was that was either my guardian

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
angel or a an angel did it did you ever

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.629 
angel or a an angel did it did you ever
think<00:03:59.280> perhaps<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.359> was<00:04:00.510> one<00:04:00.659> of<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.840> masters

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
think perhaps it was one of the masters

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.490 
think perhaps it was one of the masters
well<00:04:02.639> from<00:04:03.599> time<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.989> time<00:04:04.019> I've<00:04:04.260> heard<00:04:04.440> that
