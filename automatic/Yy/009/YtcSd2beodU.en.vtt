00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.160
 less 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.630
 and goes against him he tried to accelerate the 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.880
 actions and that was when rubén or 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.260
 develop all the grima to take 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.840
 the final distance 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.150
 would allow him to be what allows him 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.390
 to be in the final here we continue 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 63 was at that time remained about 52 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.570
 up to that level 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.880
 louis what we talked about that was the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.090
 breaking point with that 73 with that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.030
 Advantage of 4 immediately in front of a bolt 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.399
 forget a little the defense tried to get 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.989
 directly rubén looking for course 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.809
 everything is nothing you have to do 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.489
 when you get a final instance we see 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.300
 to a ruben with a lot of calm patience in 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.640
 what has been working then 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.750
 of getting the Olympic gold medal 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.670
 exactly one year and eight days ago 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.829
 London 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.859
 what the rubén himself said 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.659
 evolve in the climate because all the 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:07.630
 world goes by the Olympic champion and has 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.299
 done not only the arrow that arrow 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.690
 we have there that he evaded it very well and 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:18.460
 achieved the counter point but also the 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.320
 tactical defense game mental part 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.869
 that has been working very well nobel 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.299
 with the last times with his coach 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.979
 expert prayer also the confidence that 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.920
 you have rubén that of course achieves 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.259
 competitive maturity of giving that first 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.000
 assault with ease he knew he 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.730
 had enough time to handle the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.460
 combat we also assume that the Swiss 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.500
 had the same intention and started to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.900
 work your fencing from the second 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.870
 assault 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.120
 there was less wear greater control greater 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.280
 accuracy is not anything what 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.380
 is doing the robbery today 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.390
 it's not just that it's a medal for 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.190
 venezuela the first story but that 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.670
 would become the door to 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.950
 Latin America in the history of the 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 world championships the championships 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.180
 world not officially according to recognizes 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.310
 the federation began to be disputed in 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.370
 1937 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.730
 and from there it has been Cuba 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.330
 which has been able to give me medals in 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.330
 Latin America 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.250
 here we have the first medal in 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.720
 a world 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.860
 he won it 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.860
 roberto tucker 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.430
 the third was for a Latin American 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.960
 it's more feminine they have a Cuban 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.240
 Miranda Soto 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.620
 wow he also had a love or team 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:51.159
 in the male foil 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.159
 in Budapest 91 and 95 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.250
 and with the almallanera our second 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.250
 international 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.319
 we are reliving the semifinal combat 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.670
 of ruben limardo nation that just 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.849
 beat Swiss cancer fabian and now 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.230
 will be looking for the gold medal for 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.170
 become just the second 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.540
 Espadist in the history of this sport 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.889
 that wins gold in Olympic games and 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:30.489
 immediately in the subsequent year 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:34.000
 wins the world championship that only 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.120
 could do and baiser him of france in the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.680
 Olympic Games of the Angels in 1984 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.810
 and then at the Barcelona World Cup 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.540
 Spain in 1985 why 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.750
 have a small sample of what 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.060
 difficult that is this sport throughout 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.640
 of history how difficult it is 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.700
 maintain a domain 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.700
 because it really is very complicated 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.560
 fencing especially the sword all the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.000
 ruben limardo base obtaining the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.040
 Olympic games and then the championship 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.840
 world there are 2 fencers who 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.380
 they managed to reverse the championship first 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.580
 world and then the Olympics in 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.620
 1951 in stockholm
