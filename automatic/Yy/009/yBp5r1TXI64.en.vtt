00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.700
 this hobby I have 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.280
 I do not know since last year that I 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.590
 interest more because I like the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.150
 performance of jack nicholson and do not believe 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.760
 that it is easy to make a suit of 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.070
 these the least delayed this week 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.650
 is cooking and arming his character color 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.010
 until being this good with the help of a 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.770
 friend who works in fiberglass 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.479
 first we made the matrix one as the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.430
 model as it were in wooden 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.440
 this a tough cardboard in a carton 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.810
 corrugated although it is so resistant both 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.810
 to armor protections 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.930
 this month and with everything new in three months 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.790
 the majority dressed here but those who 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.800
 they come from the house with the suit they call the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.950
 attention of all especially women 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.050
 with these outfits is super entertaining 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.780
 for them to see something different and always 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.310
 how I like to see you characterize me already 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.900
 I'm just a little used to that 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.450
 look at art on the street but I hope 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.340
 give them a good day someday more 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.260
 entertaining people the most 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.450
 late arrived by finishing the suit 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.000
 seconds before entering the selection 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.000
 he turned around and of course 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.780
 now the makeup because inside I have 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.000
 a little impossible makeup is in 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.890

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.239
 with one of these costumes when you go to 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.190
 bathroom you have to enter through the window 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.470
 without anyone seeing you and you take all the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.049

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.440
 believe a character 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.780
 I am no longer surprised at the truth that today 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.599
 this is part of one of the attractions 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.060
 of the comicon people who are personified and 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.349
 that finally lives live a little in the 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.630
 character to which I obviously 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.520
