00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
up into different parts of the video

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370 
up into different parts of the video
because<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.549> mattress<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.299> too<00:01:15.570> big<00:01:15.810> too

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
because this mattress is too big too

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.399 
because this mattress is too big too
tall<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.670> basically<00:01:18.330> what<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
tall so basically what you do is you

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.030 
tall so basically what you do is you
shoot<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.040> minecart<00:01:20.700> before<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> falls<00:01:21.630> down

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
shoot that minecart before it falls down

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
shoot that minecart before it falls down
because<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.340> chicken<00:01:23.759> pushed<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.500> it's<00:01:25.500> cool

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
because that chicken pushed it it's cool

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.590 
because that chicken pushed it it's cool
dunk<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> chicken<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.150> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
dunk the chicken in it I think it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.780

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
so it basically got all of it ready so
let's<00:01:45.060> give<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.930> pig<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.500> push<00:01:46.829> start

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
let's give this little pig a push start

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.050 
let's give this little pig a push start
and<00:01:47.750> then<00:01:48.750> jump<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.560> ours<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:50.640> once<00:01:50.850> he

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and then jump into ours and then once he

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.039 
and then jump into ours and then once he
falls<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.060> so

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
falls down there go and here we go so

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:12.180 
falls down there go and here we go so
I'll<00:01:55.290> speed<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.619> up

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.660

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
tutorial on how I built this I think

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.760 
tutorial on how I built this I think
it's<00:02:28.550> pretty<00:02:28.730> cool<00:02:29.060> actually<00:02:29.239> how<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.170> built<00:02:30.560> it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
it's pretty cool actually how I built it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.390 
it's pretty cool actually how I built it
and<00:02:31.239> hopefully<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.569> yeah<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.950> pigs<00:02:34.160> gone

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.240 
and hopefully that yeah the pigs gone
where<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.180> he<00:02:35.269> gone

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
where is he gone

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.850 
where is he gone
and<00:02:37.250> if<00:02:37.370> he<00:02:37.519> goes<00:02:37.670> into<00:02:37.970> here<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.410> like

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and if he goes into here this is like

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.850
