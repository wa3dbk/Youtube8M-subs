last day or so and this one is stick
with<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.859> pretty<00:00:22.859> cool<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.490> you

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
with it which is a pretty cool if you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.790 
with it which is a pretty cool if you
ask<00:00:23.670> me<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:26.160> simplistic

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
ask me now it's it's simplistic

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800 
ask me now it's it's simplistic
essentially<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.920> control<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.810> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
essentially you control the the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.630 
essentially you control the the
cricketer<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> robot<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.430> it's

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
cricketer here and the robot there it's

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.690 
cricketer here and the robot there it's
going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> find<00:00:32.969> both<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.480> you've<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.700> two

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
going to find both of you you've got two

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.060 
going to find both of you you've got two
controllers<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.230> left<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
controllers one on the left one on the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.840 
controllers one on the left one on the
right<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:40.710> dictates<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.489> way<00:00:41.700> you're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
right so that dictates which way you're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.410 
right so that dictates which way you're
going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> hit<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.420> ball<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:44.420> essentially

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
going to hit the ball and essentially

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.869 
going to hit the ball and essentially
that's<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> start<00:00:46.980> with<00:00:49.700> you<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
that's it so to start with you get a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.270 
that's it so to start with you get a
little<00:00:51.180> marker<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> red

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
little marker as you see there the red

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.350 
little marker as you see there the red
marker<00:00:53.699> showing<00:00:54.000> where<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.149> ball<00:00:54.329> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
marker showing where the ball is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.180 
marker showing where the ball is
actually<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> bounce<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
actually get a bounce and you have to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
actually get a bounce and you have to
decide<00:00:56.489> whether<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> hit<00:00:57.180> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
decide whether you're going to hit it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.900 
decide whether you're going to hit it
left<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:58.039> obviously<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.550> further<00:00:59.789> you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
left or right obviously the further you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.760 
left or right obviously the further you
hit<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> more<00:01:00.510> points<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
hit it the more points you get and you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.310 
hit it the more points you get and you
can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> background<00:01:02.719> your<00:01:03.719> score<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
can see in the background your score and

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.100 
can see in the background your score and
the<00:01:04.409> actual<00:01:04.769> level<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.610> you're<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.240> as

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the actual level that you're on and as

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.480 
the actual level that you're on and as
things<00:01:07.470> progress<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.990> ball<00:01:10.170> gets<00:01:10.490> faster

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
things progress the the ball gets faster

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.280 
things progress the the ball gets faster
there's<00:01:11.850> different<00:01:12.150> sorts<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.810> balls<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
there's different sorts of balls and

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.609 
there's different sorts of balls and
it's<00:01:16.290> actually<00:01:17.000> pretty<00:01:18.000> cool<00:01:18.619> there's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it's actually pretty cool there's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.190 
it's actually pretty cool there's
nothing<00:01:19.860> better<00:01:20.009> than<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.280> free<00:01:20.520> game<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
what they booed because I missed that

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.340 
what they booed because I missed that
ball

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.570 

and<00:01:53.920> now<00:01:54.040> I'm<00:01:54.159> not<00:01:54.280> doing<00:01:54.460> very<00:01:54.490> well

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.850 

oh<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:02.760> hit<00:02:02.880> me<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.480> face<00:02:03.770> now<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
oh that hit me right in the face now you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
oh that hit me right in the face now you
only<00:02:04.980> get<00:02:05.160> three<00:02:05.400> lives<00:02:05.550> obviously<00:02:06.180> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
only get three lives obviously that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.450 
only get three lives obviously that
previous<00:02:07.350> level<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.710> stumps<00:02:08.009> were<00:02:08.100> removed

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
previous level the stumps were removed

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.720 
previous level the stumps were removed
but<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.820> stumps<00:02:09.090> are<00:02:09.180> now<00:02:09.270> back<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:13.580> if<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
but the stumps are now back so if the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.100 
but the stumps are now back so if the
ball<00:02:14.850> hits<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.090> stumps<00:02:15.390> three<00:02:15.570> times<00:02:15.810> it's

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
ball hits the stumps three times it's

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
ball hits the stumps three times it's
game<00:02:16.350> over<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> idea<00:02:17.100> really<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.880> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
game over so the idea really is just to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.870 
game over so the idea really is just to
get<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> highest<00:02:18.900> God<00:02:19.230> possible<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.920> see<00:02:20.730> how

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
get the highest God possible and see how

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:32.120 
get the highest God possible and see how
many<00:02:20.940> levels<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:22.340> progress<00:02:23.340> through<00:02:31.130> now

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
many levels you can progress through now

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.010 
many levels you can progress through now
that<00:02:32.310> hit<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.520> stumps<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.030> that's<00:02:33.270> one<00:02:33.840> life

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
that hit the stumps to that's one life

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.880 
that hit the stumps to that's one life
lost

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
