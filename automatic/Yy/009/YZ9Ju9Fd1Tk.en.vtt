00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.439 

all<00:06:14.160> right<00:06:14.430> here<00:06:14.610> we<00:06:14.699> go<00:06:14.849> I<00:06:14.880> just<00:06:15.180> felt<00:06:15.360> the

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
all right here we go I just felt the

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.240 
all right here we go I just felt the
vibration<00:06:16.020> so<00:06:16.259> it's<00:06:16.500> going<00:06:16.620> to<00:06:16.710> boot<00:06:16.889> up<00:06:17.069> here

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
vibration so it's going to boot up here

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.580 
vibration so it's going to boot up here
in<00:06:17.370> just<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.669> second<00:06:18.060> and<00:06:18.150> we<00:06:19.080> should<00:06:19.259> go<00:06:19.349> to<00:06:19.410> our

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
in just a second and we should go to our

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.320 
in just a second and we should go to our
home<00:06:19.800> screen<00:06:20.130> there<00:06:21.060> it<00:06:21.270> is<00:06:22.970> so<00:06:23.970> that's<00:06:24.180> how

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
home screen there it is so that's how

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.809 
home screen there it is so that's how
you<00:06:24.419> use<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.900> aroma<00:06:25.259> installer<00:06:25.500> on<00:06:26.160> roms<00:06:26.550> like

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:26.819 
you use the aroma installer on roms like

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.330 
you use the aroma installer on roms like
the<00:06:26.940> beans<00:06:27.120> custom<00:06:27.599> ROM<00:06:27.979> and<00:06:28.979> I<00:06:29.039> know<00:06:29.099> there's

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
the beans custom ROM and I know there's

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.400 
the beans custom ROM and I know there's
a<00:06:29.430> couple<00:06:29.729> other<00:06:29.940> ones<00:06:30.090> I<00:06:30.270> think<00:06:30.330> clean<00:06:31.139> ROM

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
a couple other ones I think clean ROM

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.800 
a couple other ones I think clean ROM
also<00:06:31.830> uses<00:06:32.250> the<00:06:32.490> aroma<00:06:33.180> installer<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.750> I

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
also uses the aroma installer and I

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.089 
also uses the aroma installer and I
believe<00:06:34.080> that's<00:06:34.259> where<00:06:34.380> beans<00:06:34.530> got<00:06:34.770> it<00:06:34.889> from

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:35.099 
believe that's where beans got it from

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.670 
believe that's where beans got it from
if<00:06:35.669> I'm<00:06:35.880> not<00:06:36.000> mistaken<00:06:36.389> but<00:06:36.750> a<00:06:37.020> very<00:06:37.199> cool<00:06:37.410> tool

if I'm not mistaken but a very cool tool

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.040 
if I'm not mistaken but a very cool tool
to<00:06:37.860> be<00:06:37.949> able<00:06:38.069> to<00:06:38.310> let<00:06:38.940> you<00:06:38.970> customize<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.870> ROM

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
to be able to let you customize the ROM

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.770 
to be able to let you customize the ROM
