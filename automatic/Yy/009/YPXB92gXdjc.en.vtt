00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
fan I guess not it's a little bit bitter

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.400 
fan I guess not it's a little bit bitter
little<00:02:33.709> cream<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.160> there<00:02:34.280> would<00:02:34.400> be<00:02:34.519> good<00:02:35.320> if<00:02:36.320> I

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
little cream in there would be good if I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.600 
little cream in there would be good if I
had<00:02:36.560> something<00:02:36.709> up<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.010> half<00:02:37.160> probably<00:02:37.489> it'd

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
had something up and half probably it'd

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.120 
had something up and half probably it'd
be<00:02:37.700> pretty<00:02:37.880> good<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:39.470> like<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.650> strong<00:02:39.890> cup<00:02:40.040> of

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
be pretty good it's like a strong cup of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.069 
be pretty good it's like a strong cup of
coffee

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
coffee

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.479 
coffee
definitely<00:02:42.079> watered<00:02:42.320> down<00:02:42.350> yeah<00:02:42.709> yeah<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.400> a

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
definitely watered down yeah yeah it's a

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.910 
definitely watered down yeah yeah it's a
strong<00:02:43.730> cup<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.970> coffee<00:02:44.180> okay<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.590> was<00:02:45.769> not

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
strong cup of coffee okay so it was not

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.400 
strong cup of coffee okay so it was not
grotesque<00:02:46.519> on<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.239> rocket<00:02:47.600> so<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.049> would<00:02:48.260> be

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
grotesque on the rocket so this would be

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.550 
grotesque on the rocket so this would be
a<00:02:48.440> suitable<00:02:48.799> machine<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.400> do<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.760> yeah<00:02:50.560> it's

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
a suitable machine to do it on yeah it's

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920 
a suitable machine to do it on yeah it's
not<00:02:51.829> I<00:02:52.040> guess<00:02:52.340> for<00:02:52.820> me<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.180> would<00:02:53.359> put<00:02:53.660> some<00:02:53.780> half

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
not I guess for me I would put some half

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.900 
not I guess for me I would put some half
in<00:02:54.109> half<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:54.530> well<00:02:55.010> yeah<00:02:55.220> but<00:02:55.549> we're<00:02:55.730> just

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
in half of that well yeah but we're just

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.310 
in half of that well yeah but we're just
doing<00:02:56.000> some<00:02:56.239> straight<00:02:56.540> tastes<00:02:56.900> here<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.170> see

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
doing some straight tastes here to see

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.289

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
if it you can even do it we're gonna try

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:05.599 
if it you can even do it we're gonna try
the<00:02:59.359> all<00:03:00.320> scattered<00:03:01.010> same<00:03:01.880> Cup

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.069 

we<00:03:06.609> did<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.819> test<00:03:07.090> shot<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.510> make<00:03:07.689> sure<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
we did a test shot to make sure that the

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.709 
we did a test shot to make sure that the
ground<00:03:08.609> grain<00:03:09.609> was<00:03:09.879> dialed<00:03:10.269> in<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.629> we

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
ground grain was dialed in and we

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.270 
ground grain was dialed in and we
