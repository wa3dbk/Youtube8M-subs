weirdest<00:00:22.199> thing<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.500> happened<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> create

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
weirdest thing that happened so I create

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
weirdest thing that happened so I create
a<00:00:24.750> new<00:00:24.990> character<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> prior<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
a new character and this is prior to the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.060 
a new character and this is prior to the
fact<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> iron<00:00:28.199> banner<00:00:28.470> event<00:00:28.890> has

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
fact that the iron banner event has

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.999 
fact that the iron banner event has
ended<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.820> only<00:00:30.240> went<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:31.109> two<00:00:31.140> hours<00:00:31.289> so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
ended it only went on for two hours so

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
ended it only went on for two hours so
by<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> time<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.850> got<00:00:33.000> home<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.780> wasn't

event before it ended which was really

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.380 
event before it ended which was really
weird<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.370> accept<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.239> had

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
weird because you have to accept you had

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.150 
weird because you have to accept you had
to<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:00.570> level<00:01:00.840> five<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.440> order<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> enter<00:01:01.949> into

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
to be level five in order to enter into
the<00:01:02.399> beta<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.910> mean<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.629> crucible<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the beta I mean they are crucible and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.920 
the beta I mean they are crucible and
you<00:01:05.369> got<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> accept<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> from<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> crucible

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you got to accept it from the crucible

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
you got to accept it from the crucible
quartermaster<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.340> had<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> little

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
quartermaster so you had to be a little

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
quartermaster so you had to be a little
five<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.540> order<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> play<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> crucible

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
five in order to play in the crucible

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.460 
five in order to play in the crucible
but<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.159> able<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> play<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.350> level

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
but I was able to play it at the level

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
but I was able to play it at the level
that<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.770> was<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.030> why<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.240> see<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that I was at so that's why you see the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.179 
that I was at so that's why you see the
question<00:01:16.110> marks<00:01:16.380> over<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.740> people<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.100> I'm

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
question marks over the people that I'm

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.289 
question marks over the people that I'm
shooting<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.689> iron<00:01:19.110> banner<00:01:19.380> II<00:01:19.530> event<00:01:19.830> was

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
shooting so the iron banner II event was

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.090 
shooting so the iron banner II event was
showcasing<00:01:21.299> off<00:01:21.630> two<00:01:21.900> maps<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
showcasing off two maps one from the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640 
showcasing off two maps one from the
Alpha<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.820> new<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:24.180> on<00:01:24.210> Mars<00:01:24.659> which<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
Alpha and a new one on Mars which is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
Alpha and a new one on Mars which is
pretty<00:01:25.799> cool<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.549> got<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.030> short

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
pretty cool so you got to see some short

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.200 
pretty cool so you got to see some short
gameplay<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.430> relatively<00:01:29.909> good<00:01:30.150> i

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
gameplay of that I do relatively good i

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
gameplay of that I do relatively good i
get<00:01:30.360> five<00:01:30.570> kills<00:01:30.900> only<00:01:31.409> because<00:01:31.920> i<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.759> have

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
get five kills only because i don't have

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.480 
get five kills only because i don't have
a<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.450> weapons<00:01:33.780> i'm<00:01:33.960> only<00:01:34.110> level<00:01:34.350> 3<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.890> that

a good weapons i'm only level 3 and that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.800 
a good weapons i'm only level 3 and that
was<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> weirdest<00:01:36.090> thing<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.270> happened<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
was the weirdest thing that happened to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.120 
was the weirdest thing that happened to
me<00:01:36.930> though<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> was<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.530> expecting<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
me though I was not expecting that to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.710 
me though I was not expecting that to
happen<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.759> either<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.299> I'm<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
happen but either way I'm just going to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.600 
happen but either way I'm just going to
let<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.900> go<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.320> indulging<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.250> old<00:01:41.400> furnace

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
let it go in indulging the old furnace

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.260 
let it go in indulging the old furnace
but<00:01:41.790> apparently<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:43.290> unlocks<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.890> new<00:01:44.009> area<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but apparently it unlocks a new area the

I'm<00:02:13.439> trying<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.950> name<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.280> you

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
legendary items but um I think that the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.959 
legendary items but um I think that the
cloak<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.359> the<00:02:21.420> hunter<00:02:21.810> looks<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.230> best<00:02:22.469> it's

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
cloak for the hunter looks the best it's

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.610 
cloak for the hunter looks the best it's
white<00:02:23.969> it's<00:02:24.390> got<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> wolf<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.140> side<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.439> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
white it's got a wolf on the side of it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.660 
white it's got a wolf on the side of it
and<00:02:25.769> also<00:02:26.579> its<00:02:27.209> trim<00:02:28.079> is<00:02:28.319> gold<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.370> it's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
and also its trim is gold so it's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.979 
and also its trim is gold so it's
definitely<00:02:30.060> legendary<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:30.689> there's<00:02:30.810> two

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
definitely legendary and there's two

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.210

obviously<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.639> he's<00:03:29.879> only<00:03:30.120> he's<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> level

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
obviously because he's only he's a level

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.430 
obviously because he's only he's a level
8<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.310> max<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.729> a<00:03:32.760> little<00:03:33.060> 8<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.449> not<00:03:33.659> 20

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
8 and the max is a little 8 it's not 20

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.059 
8 and the max is a little 8 it's not 20
I<00:03:34.979> can't<00:03:35.370> even<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:35.609> up<00:03:35.639> to<00:03:35.819> 20<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.620> he<00:03:37.620> can't<00:03:37.859> use

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
I can't even go up to 20 so he can't use

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.439 
I can't even go up to 20 so he can't use
those<00:03:38.250> weapons<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:38.790> he<00:03:38.879> was<00:03:39.000> able<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.209> buy

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:39.449 
those weapons but he was able to buy

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.460 
those weapons but he was able to buy
some<00:03:39.780> with<00:03:40.349> his<00:03:40.560> ranks<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.840> just<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:43.019> him<00:03:43.139> so

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
some with his ranks and just have him so

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.899 
some with his ranks and just have him so
I<00:03:43.709> don't<00:03:44.069> know<00:03:44.159> if<00:03:44.220> those<00:03:44.370> weapons<00:03:44.549> going<00:03:44.849> to

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
I don't know if those weapons going to

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.819 
I don't know if those weapons going to
transfer<00:03:45.299> over<00:03:45.389> to<00:03:45.540> his<00:03:45.720> profile<00:03:46.199> or<00:03:46.500> anything

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
transfer over to his profile or anything

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.830 
transfer over to his profile or anything
like<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:47.010> if<00:03:47.340> if<00:03:47.669> destiny<00:03:48.389> is<00:03:48.479> going<00:03:48.690> to

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
like that if if destiny is going to

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.280 
like that if if destiny is going to
allow<00:03:49.400> data<00:03:50.400> transferring<00:03:50.970> from<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:51.810> beta<00:03:52.019> to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
allow data transferring from the beta to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.780 
allow data transferring from the beta to
the<00:03:52.319> real<00:03:52.560> game<00:03:52.799> but<00:03:53.099> hopefully<00:03:53.579> they<00:03:53.729> do

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the real game but hopefully they do

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.030 
the real game but hopefully they do
because<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.329> really<00:03:54.870> don't<00:03:55.229> want<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.590> restart

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
because I really don't want to restart

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.830 
because I really don't want to restart

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
it's going to take me a while for me to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.619 
it's going to take me a while for me to
get<00:03:57.930> my<00:03:57.989> character<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.479> yeah<00:04:00.479> it's
