throughout the rest of my workout when I

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.670 
throughout the rest of my workout when I

was I did chest and triceps and biceps

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.520 
was I did chest and triceps and biceps
so<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:02.240> was<00:02:02.719> feeling<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:03.110> little<00:02:03.229> nauseous

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
so I was feeling a little nauseous

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.950 
so I was feeling a little nauseous
during<00:02:04.159> it<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.700> I<00:02:04.820> had<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.060> headache<00:02:05.390> I'll<00:02:05.719> say

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
that but I'm pretty sure that's because

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.180 
that but I'm pretty sure that's because
my<00:02:08.269> body<00:02:08.539> wasn't<00:02:08.869> used<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.350> pre-workout<00:02:09.950> since

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
I still noticed the same improvements

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.750 
I still noticed the same improvements
with<00:03:04.140> my<00:03:04.260> running<00:03:04.680> going<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.130> ran<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.550> mile

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
with my running going in I ran my mile

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.760 
with my running going in I ran my mile
in<00:03:05.970> six<00:03:06.240> minutes<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.840> thirty<00:03:07.080> seconds<00:03:07.560> which

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
in six minutes and thirty seconds which

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.920 
in six minutes and thirty seconds which
I<00:03:07.890> usually<00:03:08.160> run<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.340> mile<00:03:08.580> at<00:03:08.820> 7<00:03:09.570> minutes<00:03:09.690> would

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
I usually run a mile at 7 minutes would

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.080 
I usually run a mile at 7 minutes would
be<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.110> good<00:03:10.320> mile<00:03:10.590> for<00:03:10.860> me<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.670> cuts<00:03:11.910> some

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
be a good mile for me so it cuts some

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.390 
be a good mile for me so it cuts some
time<00:03:12.330> off<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.110> still<00:03:13.830> felt<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.220> little

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
time off of that I still felt a little

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.520 
time off of that I still felt a little
bit<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.790> nauseousness<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:15.540> nowhere<00:03:15.930> near<00:03:15.990> the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
bit of nauseousness but nowhere near the

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.380 
bit of nauseousness but nowhere near the
amount<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.950> yesterday<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:17.760> I'm<00:03:17.910> saying<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
amount of yesterday like I'm saying I

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.760 
amount of yesterday like I'm saying I
think<00:03:18.840> my<00:03:18.960> body<00:03:19.170> I've<00:03:19.380> never<00:03:19.590> taken

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
think my body I've never taken

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.770 
think my body I've never taken
pre-workout<00:03:20.400> before<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:20.940> my<00:03:21.060> body's<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:21.450> not

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
pre-workout before so my body's just not

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.840 
pre-workout before so my body's just not
used<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.470> was<00:03:22.830> my<00:03:23.040> hypothesis<00:03:23.820> that

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
used to it that was my hypothesis that

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.060 
used to it that was my hypothesis that
this<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.870> confirming<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.590> that's<00:03:25.860> why<00:03:25.980> I'm

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
this is confirming it that's why I'm

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.070 
this is confirming it that's why I'm
going<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> find<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.820> video<00:03:27.030> series<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.900> this
