00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
now I like to make this high-fiber

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.950 
now I like to make this high-fiber
product<00:01:30.939> because<00:01:31.240> when<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.540> have<00:01:31.689> diabetes

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
product because when you have diabetes

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960 
product because when you have diabetes
you<00:01:32.320> want<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.799> have<00:01:32.920> more<00:01:33.130> high-fiber<00:01:33.610> foods

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
you want to have more high-fiber foods

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.249 
you want to have more high-fiber foods
it's<00:01:34.299> going<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.509> slow<00:01:34.750> down<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.170> absorption

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
it's going to slow down the absorption

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.940 
it's going to slow down the absorption
of<00:01:36.540> sugars<00:01:37.540> from<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:37.960> breads<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.770> you're

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
of sugars from the breads that you're

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.410 
of sugars from the breads that you're
having<00:01:39.159> so<00:01:39.460> you're<00:01:39.579> going<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.729> want<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.090> a

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.730 
having so you're going to want to have a
lot<00:01:40.689> of<00:01:40.720> fiber<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.170> there<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:41.470> I'm<00:01:41.590> going<00:01:41.680> to

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
lot of fiber in there so I'm going to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.380 
lot of fiber in there so I'm going to
use<00:01:41.950> 1/4<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.820> cup<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:43.240> whole<00:01:44.110> wheat<00:01:44.170> flour

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.950 

and<00:01:49.390> then<00:01:49.990> here<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.649> have<00:01:50.890> one<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.729> 1/4<00:01:52.240> cup<00:01:52.329> of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
and then here we have one and 1/4 cup of

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.350 
and then here we have one and 1/4 cup of
buttermilk<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.979> this<00:01:54.310> is<00:01:54.520> wonderful<00:01:55.149> it's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
buttermilk and this is wonderful it's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.560 
buttermilk and this is wonderful it's
going<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.570> give<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.079> a<00:01:56.110> very<00:01:56.409> moist<00:01:56.829> texture

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
very very moist and tender cornbread

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.649 
very very moist and tender cornbread
sometimes<00:02:03.189> clone<00:02:03.490> bread<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.850> be<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:04.149> bit<00:02:04.390> dry

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
sometimes clone bread can be a bit dry

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.929 
sometimes clone bread can be a bit dry
but<00:02:05.320> when<00:02:05.409> we<00:02:05.590> add<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:06.009> buttermilk<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.759> makes

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
but when we add this buttermilk it makes

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.960 
but when we add this buttermilk it makes
it<00:02:07.149> delicious<00:02:07.329> and<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.920> then<00:02:09.579> the<00:02:09.790> next

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
it delicious and so then the next

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.630 
it delicious and so then the next
ingredient<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.840> an<00:02:11.019> a<00:02:11.350> it's<00:02:11.920> one<00:02:12.160> egg<00:02:12.549> and<00:02:12.940> one
