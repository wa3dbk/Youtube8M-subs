00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 Hello! Today I am going to teach you how to use some tips to create a double eye! 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.780
 Ready? 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.200
 After finishing the makeup, first take the pupil to enlarge. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.260
 I am taking the hc-104 of geo to increase my eyes. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.520
 Use the dark eyebrow powder to draw the eyebrows, because it is Japanese makeup, so the eyebrows are drawn a little, with a little curvature. 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.780
 Fill the shadow with a light eyebrow powder. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.200
 First make the eyelids base, and spread it over the eye sockets, so that the color will be more obvious! 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.980
 Apply a white eye shadow to the center of the eye to highlight this position, then find the eyelid fold. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.700
 If your eyelids are narrow, you can use your double eyelids to widen your eyelids and your eyes will become bigger! 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.080
 Then brush back and forth to add depth to the eyes. 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.760
 Add a little dark brown to the bottom of the lower eye. This will create a visual effect of the big eyes. 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.900
 Using eyeliner to lengthen my eyes, I chose brown, and the effect is softer. 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.040
 A thin eyeliner is fine, because this makeup needs to show most of the double eyelids. 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.780
 Extend the eyeliner according to your eye shape, then draw a triangle in the inner corner of the eye to lengthen the eye inward. 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.680
 Add a little dark brown eyeshadow at the end of the eye, above the eyeliner, the eyes will be deeper. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.520
 If you don't have half eyelashes, you can choose a short eyelash with a short length inside and outside. 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.720
 Need this arc and length, then split into two. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.840
 Stick the false eyelashes a little higher at the end of the eye, which will also increase the effect of the eyes. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.120
 If you want to increase your natural appearance, use an eyeliner to draw your eyelashes on the lower eyelid. 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.500
 Then use the pink pearlescent pen to draw the inner eyeliner. As the range of whitening of the eye increases, the eye becomes larger. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.640
 After rolling the eyelashes, apply the mascara to the lashes that are not covered by the false eyelashes! 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.560
 Mix two light-colored eyeshadows together to brighten the inner corner of the eye and the position of the silkworm. 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.280
 Since the eyes are the focus of this makeup, the pink blush is applied to the position of the humerus and the lower eye socket. 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.140
 This blush can help focus on the eyes. 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.980
 Then the facial features are more three-dimensional, using high-gloss powder on the cheeks, the C-part, the bridge of the nose, 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 Forehead, and chin. 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.020
 Because you want to create a spring-colored petal lip, first apply orange lipstick to your lips. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.940
 Then apply a pink lipstick to the periphery of the lips. 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.960
 You can refer to my last teaching film to create a perfect lip/petal lip! 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.060
 Thank you for watching! I hope you find the film useful! 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.080
 Remember to watch the Korean petal lip/bite lip teaching last week!
