00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.550
 hello here is and we'll take a look 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.410
 you should get the pc version of dark souls 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.210
 2 how could i possibly do it? 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.190
 Remember the developer has announced 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.900
 that the pc should be the platform and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.800
 the other extreme engine for use 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.859
 should come 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.679
 because let's look at a beginning 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.880
 we are doing here with the start screen stands 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.239
 State express good sign 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.280
 I already have a controller 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:37.210
 but 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.210
 that is not connected that is 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.320
 we expect a very console that 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.320
 menu included 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.260
 the xbox buttons are not 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.269
 buttons for the mouse can then 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.430
 you click on it but nothing is 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.230
 but you can do it now 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.420
 actually graphics settings 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.060
 which also have an impact 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.399
 that's we switched to ok that 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.310
 So it does not work as it is 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.790
 the first part still sampled high and we 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.000
 have a few pc exclusive features like 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.840
 to filter these squads or even one 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.170
 Ambient occlusion that's it 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.920
 very nice and now let's see how 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 that looks in the game 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:38.259
 longo rudolf land waited for dark 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.390
 Souls 2 starts promising with 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.040
 a very successful intro video that 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.570
 the player with the usual cryptic 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.190
 literally the series to the new 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.190
 world of games urgently matches family 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.310
 but hardly in the game is after the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.930
 full-bodied expressions of the developers 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.930
 to full version in direction and wide 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.119
 immediately there is a strong flicker 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.429
 vegetation disturbing the eye 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.140
 the level architecture polygon arm and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.090
 edgy the shadows are low 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.560
 dissolved and out of focus and also the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.380
 figurine does not look straight 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.270
 impressive is indeed a sad thing 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.739
 Atmosphere brand of the series 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.840
 but that would be different 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.370
 can be realized very special 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.620
 negative makes a feature of 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.520
 alleged hd textures for the pc 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.680
 attentive 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.600
 and not just by a very 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.390
 low resolution but also through 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.530
 annoying compression artifacts 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.180
 In many places these are optical 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.700
 derailment also awkward by 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.709
 the lightning highlighted others 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.600
 textures should obviously suggest depth 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.200
 as overcome by roots 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.130
 wand fail but on the whole line 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.290
 This is the angular and the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.650
 attendance level architecture just so much 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.090
 clearer overall, a schaler remains 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.130
 impression of the fans of the series 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.110
 could disappoint though this 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.060
 of course, know that in the hard rock 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.930
 action roleplay by no means the graphics 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.150
 stands in the foreground 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.280
 and also if the optics to wish 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.470
 After all, developer is left 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.970
 software the version for the pc this 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.280
 times succeeded much better than in the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.930
 predecessor but internally only with ps3 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.500
 resolution ran and virtually none 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.360
 option to customize boat in dark souls 2 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.730
 There are also countless numbers 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.680
 other qualities already minutes after 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.329
 Game start opens the world and us 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.489
 may urge on the kingdom 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.410
 Exploration tour also go if you 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.610
 not seldom daring with the death of 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.610
 playing figure goes along 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.680
 not only big opponents are one 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.390
 threat like this obviously 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.860
 dangerous monstrum us here in 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.960
 shortest time down and 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.850
 but also rather harmless 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.070
 acting creatures like this zombie 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.320
 piglets but the death of the play figure 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.940
 always central element of dark 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.940
 souls and the predecessor demon's souls 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.470
 the gameplay is then again 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.300
 impressively succeeded 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.470
 the player will be right at the beginning 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.200
 the harbor difficulty level 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.350
 but this is confronted in davos 2 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.450
 play at least a little introduced 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.980
 By the way, you should urgently take dax 2 with you 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.750
 the controller the mouse and 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.870
 keyboard control was indeed improved 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.310
 but she is still awkward and 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.110
 getting used to with two 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.010
 analog sticks control character and 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.010
 camera just better 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.189
 in spite of wall technique, dark souls 2 is a 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:43.800
 very successful game and deserves 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.990
 definitely a chance fans beat 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.490
 anyway you should go to the row 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.889
 you have not played yet 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.029
 definitely one of the most extraordinary 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.759
 missed game concepts of recent years 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:55.800
 and every now and then dark souls 2 has 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:05:03.749
 a special moment and is almost 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:05.580
 pretty technically the wood 2 is unfortunately 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.050
 not very well done it is 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.729
 significantly better than the predecessor 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.090
 really a catastrophic one 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.319
 implementation was for the pc but the graphics 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.719
 is not very good 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.370
 the textures are partly extreme 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.830
 Low resolved are the shadows 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.300
 pixelated the picture flickers 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:26.279
 So what luck the dax course 2 or 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.810
 not at all at dark souls is the 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.210
 graphic in the foreground but that 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.569
 Gameplay and that is great times 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.849
 again 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.460
 So you can recommend the game if 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.159
 you are graphics but then you have to with 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.909
 a few compromises that would be it 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.629
 then from me 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.629
 See you
