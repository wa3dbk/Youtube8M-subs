00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.429
 Welcome to the film analysis 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.410
 today with men of steel from zak snyder 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.960
 I stand in this movie before 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.270
 difficulty because this is a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.189
 Cinema experience of a special kind 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.470
 I have not experienced them yet 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.350
 I usually would have done 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.420
 Now tell about how the story is about 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.189
 then individual would be constructed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.619
 Scenes may introduce the texture 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.450
 of the film and the first 15 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.860
 minutes of the film you want it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.930
 also like to let one 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.690
 the film tells how it all started 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.270
 clark kent superman the world comes 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 namely on another planet there 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.320
 does something like a goddamn r 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.850
 can not stay there must be alive 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.920
 will somehow be protected because of this 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 he totaled on another planet 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.180
 he lives under the earth there 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.760
 normal people must be his 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.510
 supernatural abilities secret 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.489
 hold 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.500
 until then the world is really threatened 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.280
 And then he has to become the one we do 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.470
 that's what superman knows about him 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.840
 problem with this film, however, is 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 that this is not a usual comic film adaptation 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 It is not very good 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.490
 comic filming thinks of the batman 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.210
 trilogy, it's not a normal one either 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.549
 comic filming just something 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.820
 But entertaining is not much more 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.619
 The problem is that one is strict 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.330
 taken here is not at all anymore 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.189
 with a comic filming with a comic 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.720
 action film has to do yes one has it 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.770
 not even with a real one 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 to do film 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.299
 you just can not do this movie anymore 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.299
 why should enjoy 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.590
 there is the action first 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.479
 This is so awkward so cheesy 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.400
 tells you that after noon 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.110
 hour she had no desire anymore 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.810
 to follow somewhere 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.340
 then there is this dialog structure like that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.570
 Messianic patriotic is that one it 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.220
 hardly wants to endure 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.290
 that is an ideology of 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.420
 fundamentalism preached here 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.220
 I would say that everyone 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.979
 propaganda film would proceed more subtly 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.690
 and then there's this newly composed one 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 Music by Hans Zimmer 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.459
 and that is actually an impudence 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.580
 because it's strictly speaking 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.410
 no music anymore everything sounds in the beginning 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.400
 maybe as well as an extremely well 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.739
 her wagner 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.360
 but then there is only one left 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.440
 incredibly brutal loud 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.600
 background noise 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.430
 you might think that in the back 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.459
 cinema purely straight jackhammer with the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.769
 it is such a noise 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.989
 the case arises, the one each 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.430
 sensual pleasure in this film 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.730
 completely gone 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.600
 and then there is this camera work 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.850
 Of course it had to be at one 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.310
 comic filming 3d be but then 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.320
 zack snyder decides too 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.900
 for the wobble camera and that has to 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.950
 Do not follow that anymore 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.320
 able to see 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.940
 in many places I even have the 3d 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.769
 glasses just taken off at all 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.690
 still to understand who just into 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.570
 bild comes who is talking to whom 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.579
 the whole is such a tohuwabohu to us 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.500
 We are exposed to this movie 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.810
 not even on the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.940
 perceive the most primitive level at all 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.430
 and he can enjoy closing himself 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.019
 actually in front of the audience in the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.880
 best moments see the pictures yet 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.489
 like a poor imitation Terrence Malick 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.220
 but otherwise nothing is more 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.049
 but what does that mean if one does 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.130
 the easiest enjoyment as a spectator 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.130
 fails 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.770
 the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.900
 rapid cultural criticism and 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.480
 ideology criticism is also the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.240
 Filmanalyse feels obliged, yes 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.640
 following a movie 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.980
 analyzed and it is shown that 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.050
 behind the colorful illusion it still falls 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.360
 another message is hidden 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.440
 titanic, for example, as a failed 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.470
 class fight black swan as 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.750
 misogynist manifest or hangover 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.640
 as a plea for intolerance this 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.440
 form of the criticism assumes, however, that 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.010
 These movies just because they are so light 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.140
 edible are just very fast one 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.620
 to be able to cheer dangerous ideology 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.900
 but these films do one undisputed 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.890
 they entertain and they are just 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.380
 edible 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.870
 but that's exactly what you do not do steel 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.480
 not even more normal 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.850
 entertain the insane use of 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.490
 wobbly cameras makes it impossible this 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.140
 enjoy movie 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.000
 is often on such cultural criticism 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.710
 your comparison to fast food to 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.420
 ordered one goes into a fast food 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.600
 restaurant you know the food is not 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.220
 it is simply very high quality 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.590
 makes perhaps tired of ecologically 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.330
 not correct and then you feel 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.240
 often not good but while you are there 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.800
 you can actually enjoy it 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.110
 But now we enter before we enter 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.480
 fast food restaurant order a menu 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.970
 pay and then get only empty 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.919
 cardboard boxes so it is when you are in men 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.830
 of steel sits this movie is 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.690
 actually just a simulation of one 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.419
 big blockbusters we get 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.550
 simulates that we have a big cinema here 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.850
 but experience in front of us have in truth 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.090
 All that remains for us is this experience 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.440
 It looks like it might 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.600
 be entertaining experience the trailer 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.240
 that has also announced but exactly 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.160
 this enjoyment does not occur 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.810
 maybe this is a new form of 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.090
 abundance after you get things done 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.220
 you did not necessarily produce that 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.020
 you also need to produce things now 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.340
 you do not need it anymore yes 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.650
 with which you really nothing more 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.570
 You can start to experience something like that 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.780
 longer in the party culture in the 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.270
 party scene in event culture there 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.200
 we experience the events without 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.030
 sense and understanding are the 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.130
 no more reason to have one 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.860
 Celebrate the consequences of the consequences 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.450
 Martin Walser said that and that 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.720
 interesting is that you then 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.940
 always motivated for fun or self 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.770
 that the fun is indeed a downright 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.410
 Talk about it says great mood 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.840
 here today we want to have fun but in 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.430
 truth is everything you watch 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.380
 yourself in the process of thinking 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.440
 suddenly, what am I doing here? 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.500
 is it synonymous with men of steel 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.300
 The cinema is in a crisis of it can 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.580
 You can not doubt it anymore 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.340
 and now you simulate only one 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.420
 great cinema experience men of steel can 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.800
 you can not look anymore 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.800
 let alone see
