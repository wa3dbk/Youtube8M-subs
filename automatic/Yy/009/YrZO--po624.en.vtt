00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 about a final training of 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.490
 Netherlands before the semifinal against 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.410
 Argentina are all players on board 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.130
 a good news for coach louis 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.769
 van gaal 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.719
 and yet only a side note because all 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.089
 Eyes are aimed at an arjen 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.400
 Robben be the world championship so far 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 Tournament experts are acting on it as yet 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.730
 best player of the wm 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.800
 And so does Argentina's coach 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 alejandro sabella the bayern star 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.910
 paid special attention 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.859
 he must be in one on one 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.809
 we have to be incredibly strong 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.059
 be careful to be close to him 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.340
 and we have to watch him hit the ball 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.870
 can not take with tempo gets 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.219
 he played the ball in full swing 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.480
 then he can hardly be separated from the ball 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.680
 argentina in the tournament but so far with 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.629
 strong defensive 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.760
 just the right team so that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.649
 strong oranje offensive to stop 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 too simple a thought for the 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.480
 Argentinian coach has only there 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.670
 offensive or only defensive that goes 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.739
 not football lives off the balance 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 of course, our defense in the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.430
 increased tournament but can on it 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 we do not rely and by all 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 Praise for Argentina's defensive work too 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.159
 on the offensive can the albis 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.030
 so far lets on his superstars 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.030
 leave 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
 especially lionel messi to the joy 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.180
 He finally convinces his compatriots 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.490
 also in the national jersey 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.869
 one more reason for oranje coach louis 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.680
 van gaal of a close game 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.680
 to go 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.229
 it's a 50 50 game that's us 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.430
 also need a bit of luck 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.119
 Dutch where do we have one 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.250
 saying 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.619
 the coin must point in our direction 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.920
 the netherlands against argentina robben 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.930
 against messi south america against europe it 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820
 is an evening of great duels 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.880
 hopefully it will be the evening of one 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.540
 big game who we currently are 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.540
 very close
