00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.460 
said let's take a hard look at Alice and
why<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.890> worked<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:11.120> try<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.510> duplicate<00:03:12.260> that

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
why it worked and try to duplicate that

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.930 
why it worked and try to duplicate that
I<00:03:12.620> mean<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:12.830> think<00:03:12.950> there's<00:03:13.250> still<00:03:13.489> some<00:03:13.550> Sam

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
I mean I think there's still some Sam

I mean I think there's still some Sam
Raimi<00:03:14.269> flair<00:03:14.540> but<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.319> very<00:03:15.530> much<00:03:15.680> from

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
Raimi flair but this is very much from

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.970 
Raimi flair but this is very much from
the<00:03:16.040> same<00:03:16.630> playbook<00:03:17.630> as<00:03:18.019> Alice<00:03:18.440> in<00:03:18.560> Wonderland

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the same playbook as Alice in Wonderland

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.680 
the same playbook as Alice in Wonderland
and<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.370> movie<00:03:19.580> was<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> huge<00:03:19.940> success<00:03:20.209> even

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
and that movie was a huge success even

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.090 
and that movie was a huge success even

like<00:03:22.130> it<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.760> still<00:03:23.030> made<00:03:23.150> over<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.390> billion

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
like it it still made over a billion

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.539 
like it it still made over a billion
dollars<00:03:24.140> at<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.319> box<00:03:24.440> office<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.160> have<00:03:25.430> to

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
dollars at the box office and I have to

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.949 
dollars at the box office and I have to
say<00:03:25.670> considering<00:03:26.060> how<00:03:26.180> good<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.390> time<00:03:26.630> I<00:03:26.660> had

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
say considering how good a time I had

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.570 
say considering how good a time I had
seeing<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.380> was<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.650> Great<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:27.950> Powerful<00:03:27.980> I

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
seeing I was the Great and Powerful I

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.009 
seeing I was the Great and Powerful I
think<00:03:29.209> that<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.720> could<00:03:30.019> do<00:03:30.790> equally<00:03:31.790> well<00:03:32.019> it

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
think that it could do equally well it

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.300 
think that it could do equally well it
doesn't<00:03:33.290> have<00:03:33.380> Johnny<00:03:33.560> Depp<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.190> has

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
doesn't have Johnny Depp in it it has

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.039 
doesn't have Johnny Depp in it it has
James<00:03:34.519> Franco<00:03:34.910> not<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> big<00:03:35.269> box<00:03:35.450> office<00:03:35.690> draw

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
James Franco not a big box office draw

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.660 
James Franco not a big box office draw
but<00:03:36.319> I'm<00:03:36.530> hoping<00:03:37.040> that<00:03:37.160> maybe<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.400> will<00:03:37.640> put

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
but I'm hoping that maybe this will put

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.210 
but I'm hoping that maybe this will put
this<00:03:38.269> will<00:03:38.420> raise<00:03:38.900> James<00:03:39.290> Franco<00:03:39.680> up<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.950> level

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
this will raise James Franco up a level

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.250 
this will raise James Franco up a level
in<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.430> opening<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:40.880> said<00:03:41.090> he<00:03:41.180> was<00:03:41.299> second-rate

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
in the opening I said he was second-rate

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.949 
in the opening I said he was second-rate
quirkiness<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.610> think<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.120> he<00:03:44.599> impressed

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
quirkiness and I think that he impressed

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.259 
quirkiness and I think that he impressed
me<00:03:45.170> I'm<00:03:45.830> upgrading<00:03:46.220> him<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.849> first-rate

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
me I'm upgrading him to first-rate

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.009 
me I'm upgrading him to first-rate
quirkiness

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
quirkiness

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.599 
quirkiness
he<00:03:48.319> was<00:03:48.470> really<00:03:48.590> good<00:03:48.769> this<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.099> the<00:03:49.130> best<00:03:49.400> work

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
he was really good this is the best work

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.340

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
some depth for that character and it

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.550 
some depth for that character and it

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
little china doll girls um i think the

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.219 
little china doll girls um i think the
weakest<00:04:49.580> parts<00:04:49.850> were<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.090> witches<00:04:50.450> not<00:04:50.960> only

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
weakest parts were the witches not only

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.680

from<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.039> acting<00:04:52.490> but<00:04:52.669> also<00:04:52.789> i<00:04:52.910> think<00:04:53.240> from

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
from the acting but also i think from

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.690 
from the acting but also i think from
the<00:04:53.750> script<00:04:54.050> point<00:04:54.289> of<00:04:54.409> view<00:04:54.620> Rachel<00:04:55.490> Weitz

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.170 
the script point of view Rachel Weitz
and<00:04:56.060> Mila<00:04:56.690> Kunis<00:04:57.050> had<00:04:57.229> surprisingly<00:04:57.800> little

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
and Mila Kunis had surprisingly little

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.240 
and Mila Kunis had surprisingly little
to<00:04:58.240> do<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:59.259> the<00:04:59.350> person<00:04:59.680> came<00:04:59.830> across<00:05:00.009> the

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
to do that the person came across the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.439 
to do that the person came across the
best<00:05:00.430> was<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.639> ship<00:05:00.789> up<00:05:00.970> was<00:05:01.150> Michelle

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
best was the ship up was Michelle

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.700 
best was the ship up was Michelle
Williams<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.960> think<00:05:02.110> she<00:05:02.169> did<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:02.350> really<00:05:02.500> nice

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
Williams I think she did a really nice

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.189 
Williams I think she did a really nice
job<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:03.340> think<00:05:03.610> some<00:05:03.940> people<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:04.810> know<00:05:04.900> some

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
job I think some people you know some

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:06.360 
job I think some people you know some
people<00:05:05.410> after<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.710> screening<00:05:05.979> felt<00:05:06.250> that

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
people after the screening felt that

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.920 
people after the screening felt that
maybe<00:05:06.520> she<00:05:06.789> overreacted<00:05:07.479> a<00:05:07.509> little<00:05:07.539> bit

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
maybe she overreacted a little bit

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.060 
maybe she overreacted a little bit
but<00:05:08.259> I<00:05:08.289> think<00:05:08.380> that<00:05:08.590> if<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:08.740> looked<00:05:08.889> at<00:05:08.949> the

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
but I think that if you looked at the

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.129 
but I think that if you looked at the
original<00:05:09.190> 1939<00:05:09.970> version<00:05:10.449> with<00:05:10.570> Glenda<00:05:10.960> I

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
original 1939 version with Glenda I

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.719 
original 1939 version with Glenda I
think<00:05:11.770> that<00:05:11.889> Michelle<00:05:12.130> Williams<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.520> trying

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
think that Michelle Williams is trying

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.040 
think that Michelle Williams is trying
to<00:05:12.789> base<00:05:12.940> her<00:05:13.060> performance<00:05:13.570> off<00:05:13.690> of<00:05:13.870> that

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
to base her performance off of that

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.510 
to base her performance off of that
which<00:05:14.259> I<00:05:14.440> don't<00:05:14.500> anything<00:05:15.070> wrong<00:05:15.250> with<00:05:15.400> that

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
which I don't anything wrong with that

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.400 
which I don't anything wrong with that
and<00:05:15.699> she<00:05:15.759> was<00:05:16.150> very<00:05:16.300> likable<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:17.020> liked<00:05:17.229> her<00:05:17.380> a

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
and she was very likable I liked her a

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.010 
and she was very likable I liked her a
lot<00:05:17.590> here<00:05:17.800> too<00:05:18.009> um<00:05:18.280> Rachel<00:05:19.180> White's<00:05:19.360> again<00:05:19.600> not

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
lot here too um Rachel White's again not

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.260 
lot here too um Rachel White's again not
really<00:05:20.199> much<00:05:20.350> to<00:05:20.380> do<00:05:20.680> she<00:05:21.100> was<00:05:21.430> nice<00:05:21.669> I<00:05:21.940> liked

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
really much to do she was nice I liked

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.820 
really much to do she was nice I liked
her<00:05:22.360> costumes<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:23.169> I<00:05:23.560> think<00:05:23.740> she's

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
her costumes and I think she's

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.439 
her costumes and I think she's
definitely<00:05:24.220> pulled<00:05:24.430> off<00:05:24.610> what<00:05:24.910> she<00:05:25.060> was<00:05:25.150> asked

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
definitely pulled off what she was asked

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.930 
definitely pulled off what she was asked
to<00:05:25.539> do<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:25.960> Mila<00:05:26.410> Kunis<00:05:26.889> I<00:05:27.070> think<00:05:27.460> Mila<00:05:27.639> Kunis

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
to do and Mila Kunis I think Mila Kunis

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.760 
to do and Mila Kunis I think Mila Kunis
is<00:05:28.030> a<00:05:28.060> little<00:05:28.360> bit<00:05:28.479> of<00:05:28.570> unfortunate<00:05:29.199> situation

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
is a little bit of unfortunate situation

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.430 
is a little bit of unfortunate situation
here<00:05:29.919> because<00:05:30.509> all<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.900> whole<00:05:32.020> time<00:05:32.199> I<00:05:32.320> was

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
here because all the whole time I was

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.930 
here because all the whole time I was
watching<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.860> movie<00:05:33.099> I<00:05:33.130> was<00:05:33.310> thinking<00:05:33.580> of<00:05:33.699> Meg

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
watching the movie I was thinking of Meg

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.879 
watching the movie I was thinking of Meg
from<00:05:34.180> Family<00:05:34.690> Guy<00:05:34.720> because<00:05:35.530> her<00:05:35.650> character

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
from Family Guy because her character

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.830 
from Family Guy because her character
had<00:05:36.280> kinda<00:05:36.490> has<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.639> similar<00:05:37.000> situation<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:37.570> Meg

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
had kinda has a similar situation to Meg

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.290 
had kinda has a similar situation to Meg
where<00:05:38.310> she's<00:05:39.310> not<00:05:39.430> liked<00:05:39.729> as<00:05:39.880> much<00:05:40.030> as<00:05:40.210> the

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
where she's not liked as much as the

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.180 
where she's not liked as much as the
other<00:05:40.449> sisters<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.169> she's<00:05:41.590> kind<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.830> like<00:05:41.979> put

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
other sisters and she's kind of like put

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.460 
other sisters and she's kind of like put
down<00:05:42.370> upon<00:05:42.669> a<00:05:42.699> lot<00:05:42.970> and<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:44.139> know<00:05:44.229> people<00:05:44.410> are

telling<00:05:44.740> her<00:05:44.830> she's<00:05:45.009> stupid<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.699> so<00:05:46.389> when<00:05:46.539> she

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
telling her she's stupid and so when she

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.180 
telling her she's stupid and so when she
loses<00:05:46.930> her<00:05:46.960> temper<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.500> stuff<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.039> just

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
loses her temper and stuff it just

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.710 
loses her temper and stuff it just
reminded<00:05:48.520> me<00:05:48.669> a<00:05:48.699> whole<00:05:48.970> lot<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.240> Meg<00:05:49.539> from

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
reminded me a whole lot of Meg from

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.279 
reminded me a whole lot of Meg from
Family<00:05:50.139> Guy

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
Family Guy

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.719 
Family Guy
so<00:05:50.500> that<00:05:50.620> pulled<00:05:51.099> me<00:05:51.160> out<00:05:51.340> a<00:05:51.370> couple<00:05:51.550> times

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
so that pulled me out a couple times

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:53.999 
so that pulled me out a couple times
from<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.240> film<00:05:52.479> but<00:05:52.690> she<00:05:53.139> did<00:05:53.289> a<00:05:53.320> nice<00:05:53.470> job<00:05:53.500> I

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:54.009 
from the film but she did a nice job I

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.040 
from the film but she did a nice job I
don't<00:05:54.970> you<00:05:55.120> know<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.240> think<00:05:55.539> most<00:05:55.750> people<00:05:55.870> know

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
don't you know I think most people know

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.420 
don't you know I think most people know
who<00:05:56.199> the<00:05:56.320> wicked<00:05:56.530> witches<00:05:56.830> at<00:05:56.949> this<00:05:57.070> point<00:05:57.280> but

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
who the wicked witches at this point but

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.550 
who the wicked witches at this point but
I<00:05:57.490> will<00:05:57.729> say<00:05:57.970> not<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.630> lot<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:58.960> wicked<00:05:59.259> witch<00:05:59.410> in

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
I will say not a lot of wicked witch in

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.290 
I will say not a lot of wicked witch in
the<00:05:59.680> film<00:05:59.919> there's<00:06:00.280> not<00:06:00.490> even<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.759> cold<00:06:01.000> fire

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
the film there's not even that cold fire

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.140 
the film there's not even that cold fire
tornado<00:06:01.840> shot<00:06:02.380> from<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.800> trailer<00:06:03.190> but<00:06:03.940> the

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
tornado shot from the trailer but the

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.550 
tornado shot from the trailer but the
movie<00:06:04.360> was<00:06:04.479> so<00:06:04.630> good<00:06:04.870> that<00:06:04.900> I'm<00:06:05.110> actually<00:06:05.289> not

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
movie was so good that I'm actually not

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.350 
movie was so good that I'm actually not
disappointed<00:06:06.130> in<00:06:06.159> that<00:06:06.370> at<00:06:06.490> all<00:06:06.580> and<00:06:06.820> I<00:06:07.120> can

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
disappointed in that at all and I can

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.570 
disappointed in that at all and I can
see<00:06:07.599> I<00:06:07.900> very<00:06:08.380> strongly<00:06:08.710> see<00:06:08.949> the<00:06:09.039> possibility

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
see I very strongly see the possibility

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.740 
see I very strongly see the possibility
of<00:06:09.610> a<00:06:09.669> sequel<00:06:10.030> with<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.240> Wicked<00:06:10.449> Witch<00:06:10.479> and

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
of a sequel with the Wicked Witch and

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.839 
of a sequel with the Wicked Witch and
when<00:06:10.840> she<00:06:10.960> was<00:06:11.199> on<00:06:11.380> screen<00:06:11.680> I<00:06:12.010> think<00:06:12.550> that<00:06:12.699> the

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
when she was on screen I think that the

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:14.610 
when she was on screen I think that the
fish<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.630> prosthetics<00:06:14.199> on<00:06:14.320> the<00:06:14.409> face

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
fish the the prosthetics on the face

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.469 
fish the the prosthetics on the face
didn't<00:06:14.919> work<00:06:15.070> so<00:06:15.099> well<00:06:15.520> but<00:06:16.000> I<00:06:16.030> think<00:06:16.120> that

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
didn't work so well but I think that

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.879

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.659 
movie was just a lot of fun and on that
point<00:06:25.090> with<00:06:25.240> visuals<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:26.830> 3d<00:06:27.190> in<00:06:27.280> this<00:06:27.400> film

point with visuals the 3d in this film

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.820 
point with visuals the 3d in this film
is<00:06:27.909> spectacular<00:06:28.199> the<00:06:29.199> opening<00:06:29.530> credits

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
is spectacular the opening credits

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.499 
is spectacular the opening credits
sequence<00:06:29.860> is<00:06:30.400> just<00:06:30.639> as<00:06:30.820> worth<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.270> price<00:06:31.449> of

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
sequence is just as worth the price of

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.899 
sequence is just as worth the price of
admission<00:06:31.720> alone<00:06:32.080> and<00:06:32.560> it's<00:06:33.490> some<00:06:33.729> of<00:06:33.849> the

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
admission alone and it's some of the

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.580 
admission alone and it's some of the
best<00:06:34.090> 3d<00:06:34.330> I've<00:06:34.479> ever<00:06:34.659> seen<00:06:34.900> I<00:06:35.020> would<00:06:35.139> say<00:06:35.289> it's

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
best 3d I've ever seen I would say it's

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.830 
best 3d I've ever seen I would say it's
even<00:06:35.949> better<00:06:36.220> than<00:06:36.400> amazing<00:06:36.909> spider-man's<00:06:37.419> 3d

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
even better than amazing spider-man's 3d

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.990 
even better than amazing spider-man's 3d
and<00:06:38.080> I<00:06:38.289> thought<00:06:38.500> that<00:06:38.710> was<00:06:38.860> very<00:06:39.190> good<00:06:39.400> 3d<00:06:39.729> this

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
and I thought that was very good 3d this

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.129 
and I thought that was very good 3d this
is<00:06:40.150> excellent<00:06:40.419> I<00:06:40.539> think<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:40.810> would<00:06:40.930> be<00:06:40.990> doing

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
is excellent I think you would be doing

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.080 
is excellent I think you would be doing
yourself<00:06:41.320> a<00:06:41.560> disservice<00:06:41.590> not<00:06:42.190> to<00:06:42.699> see<00:06:42.849> this<00:06:42.940> on

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
yourself a disservice not to see this on

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.399 
yourself a disservice not to see this on
the<00:06:43.120> biggest<00:06:43.389> screen<00:06:43.599> possible<00:06:44.229> which<00:06:44.380> means

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 
the biggest screen possible which means

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:46.320 
the biggest screen possible which means
IMAX<00:06:45.070> if<00:06:45.220> you<00:06:45.310> can<00:06:45.490> if<00:06:45.699> you<00:06:45.789> can<00:06:45.940> do<00:06:46.060> it<00:06:46.210> and

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
IMAX if you can if you can do it and

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.930 
IMAX if you can if you can do it and
also<00:06:46.750> in<00:06:46.990> 3d<00:06:47.320> but<00:06:47.860> the<00:06:48.009> very<00:06:48.159> least<00:06:48.370> don't<00:06:48.550> miss

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
also in 3d but the very least don't miss

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.790 
also in 3d but the very least don't miss
seeing<00:06:49.180> it<00:06:49.300> in<00:06:49.389> 3d<00:06:49.539> it<00:06:49.690> was<00:06:49.810> great<00:06:50.050> so<00:06:50.590> at<00:06:50.710> the
