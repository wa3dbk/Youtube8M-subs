Hey welcome back to Diode Press, I'm Graham!

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.089
Today’s video is going to show you a few
ways to transfer an image onto your wood panel

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.109
for a woodcut print.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.680
The links to the other videos in this series
are at the end of the video, as well as listed

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.539
down in the description box. I’ll also have
all of the materials and supplies down there

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:19.810
as well.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.960
So to quickly discuss drawing an image for
a woodcut, If you are new to printmaking,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.039
you’ll most likely want to start off with
a simple image to carve. This will make the

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:25.750
learning experience much more fun.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.230
What you draw is entirely up to you.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.820
For this print I’m drawing these pistons
and piping coming up at you.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.870
you’ll want to think about a few things
before you get started.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.090
Obviously the size of the print, but also
how many colors the print will be and how

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.760
many blocks. I would start with a single block
single color woodcut for your first one.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.969
Also remember that whatever is on your block
when you carve it is going to get flipped

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.469
when you print. So this is really obvious
with things like letters and numbers.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.059
You’ll also want to keep it in mind if you
making a print of a recognizable building

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.289
or landscape, so the final print is oriented
the same as the real thing.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.760
The detail you can get into a print is going
to be largely effected by the wood or linoleum

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.140
block you are using.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.920
If you are using cherry plywood or other harder
wood, you’ll be able to carve very fine

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.380
lines and details, and they’ll hold up well,
but it can be a bit more effort to carve.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.140
If you are using a Shina plywood like I am
you’ll need to work a little larger, or

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.590
a little less detailed. Keeping your tools
sharp will also make it easier to get fine

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.990
details without tearing the wood up.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.119
The same goes for linoleum. There are different
brands and styles. You can get fluffy foamy

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.970
blocks, or high quality lino, and they’ll
hold lines very differently.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.750
So I’d buy a few small pieces of different
materials and just play around with some test

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.670
carving and see what fits your style.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.640
There are lots of ways to get your image onto
your block. Traditional woodblock printing

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.790
uses a thin sheet of paper with your image
on it which is adhered down to the block.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.340
But I’m going to just focus on my favorite
methods that I use.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.930
Number one is the easiest…. Just draw your
image right onto the block. Make sure you

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.880
flip text or numbers when you draw, and you’re
good to go and ready to carve! You can use

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.009
a sharpy marker, or pens and pencils.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:11.009
You can also use carbon transfer paper and
transfer your drawing.

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.669
I like to draw my images first in traditional
mediums, but I usually will scan them into

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:21.269
the computer and manipulate them or do color
separations before carving, so my preferred

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.709
method is the blender marker technique.

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.909
I believe this is similar to an acetone transfer.
I’ve use this on woodcuts as well as linocuts.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:37.909
First I draw or enlarge my black and white
image to the size I want, in the orientation

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:45.549
I want the final print to be, meaning not
flipped. Then make a photocopy of it.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.120
There are two critical things here. You need
to use a photocopier that uses toner to make

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.219
the copy. So most commercial photocopiers
at places like fedex, or in a grocery store

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:02.219
work. You also want the image to be dark.
So I typically increase the darkness setting

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.330
when I make the copy.

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.949
You can see on my copy I marked the corners
of the image so I can cut down the paper copy

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.290
to the exact size.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.359
Now you can line up the copy, image side against
the wood or lino block. Since it’s just

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.209
a copy, you can slide it around, and get it
perfectly positioned, and then I tape it down.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.629
Now you use a blender marker, and draw over
your image through the paper.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.339
This marker smells very strong, so you definitely
need ventilation or do it outside. But basically

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:39.579
it’s a marker with no color.

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.719
What it does is releases the black toner from
the photocopy, and transfers it to your wood

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.680
or lino block.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.219
I do a segment of the print then use a block
of wood, or a spoon would work, and I burnish

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.790
it down against the wood.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.489
Once I’m done, I check it, and then re-do
a few light areas. That’s where taping the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:02.489
paper down comes in handy. The marker evaporates
quickly, and you’re all done.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.919
So that works great and makes a nice dark
transfer. But blender markers smell very strong.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.619
Maybe there is a different brand/chemical
that other people can recommend that is not

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:13.559
as potent of a smell.

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.549
The final method is doing an ink-jet transfer.

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.549
All you need to do is print your image on
a typical ink-jet printer, but instead of

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:33.060
using printer paper, print it on a piece of
label paper with all the labels removed. So

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:43.460
it’s just the waxy feeling backing paper.
Make sure to print onto the waxy side of the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.180
paper. I’ve heard of using parchment paper
instead, but I’ve only tested label paper.

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.439
Again with this method you don’t need to
worry about flipping your original image,

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.849
since it will be flipped once you transfer
it.

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.150
So you go through the same steps as the blender
marker method, but as you can see here, the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.800
ink is just sitting on top of the paper, so
if you touch it or move it once it’s against

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.789
the wood, it will smudge. But the advantage
is that it’s odorless, and you can transfer

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.580
any colors you want.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.710
So just line it up on the block, press it
down, and then burnish the paper against the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.860
block. This ink dries very quickly just like
the blender marker method.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.599
I have not tried this on linocut blocks, so
I don’t know if it will work. I’d be afraid

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:27.860
that the ink would not dry out once transferred,
but me know if you’ve done this with lino.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.120
These methods all work well, and depending
on the complexity of the image, or the amount

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.759
of blocks I’ll be using in a print, I might
use different methods.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.469
and finally before we start carving your woodcut,
you might want to consider doing a light wash

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:43.620
over the wood. You can do this before or after
you transfer your image.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.389
Some people make the block completely black,
and then draw with a white pen or pencil,

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.810
but I like use a little bit of india ink and
water and do a few light coats over the block

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.960
after my image is on it.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.530
You don’t want to soak the wood or anything;
the goal is to just stain the top layer of

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.860
the wood. So when we get into carving in the
next video, it’s really easy to see the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.610
areas of the block that you’ve carved out,
since it can be hard to tell if it’s all

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.740
raw wood. This makes the block a fairly accurate
representation of the finished print, albeit

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.759
reversed.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:19.580
Alright so that’s how I go about transferring
my image. You can draw it directly on the

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.349
block, transfer it with carbon paper, do a
blender marker transfer, or do an ink-jet

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:24.409
transfer.

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:25.830
And again just make sure to take a moment
and make sure that whatever ends up on the

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.819
actual block is a flipped image, so when you
print, it looks correct.

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.710
In the next video I’ll be carving and printing
this block. So make sure to subscribe to keep
