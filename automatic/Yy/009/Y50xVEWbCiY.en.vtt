00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's not that new but still I hopefully

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.450 
it's not that new but still I hopefully
I<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:19.949> get<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.420> fixed<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.350> don't<00:00:23.310> have

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
I can get it fixed so that I don't have

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.359 
I can get it fixed so that I don't have
to<00:00:23.640> worry<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:24.300> not<00:00:25.050> uploading<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> while

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to worry about not uploading for a while

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.509 
to worry about not uploading for a while
if<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.880> however<00:00:27.779> don't<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> fixed<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.400> know

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
if I however don't get it fixed you know

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.519 
if I however don't get it fixed you know
that<00:00:29.730> might<00:00:29.970> mean<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.240> next<00:00:31.109> week<00:00:31.230> there

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that might mean that next week there

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.160 
that might mean that next week there
might<00:00:31.769> be<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.009> bit<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.640> gap<00:00:32.969> between<00:00:33.420> uploads

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
might be a bit of a gap between uploads

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.610 
might be a bit of a gap between uploads
but<00:00:34.890> hopefully<00:00:35.370> everything<00:00:35.790> will<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.620> salt

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
but hopefully everything will get a salt

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.069 
but hopefully everything will get a salt
and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.910> computer<00:00:39.180> working<00:00:39.780> again

we know is a beast of a wall even though
it's<00:02:05.549> not<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.939> good<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.329> standard<00:02:06.960> play<00:02:07.200> but

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
it's not that good in standard play but

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.609 
it's not that good in standard play but
we<00:02:08.190> all<00:02:08.369> know<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:08.970> beauteous<00:02:09.690> elia<00:02:10.050> still<00:02:10.349> is

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
we all know how beauteous elia still is

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
we all know how beauteous elia still is
and<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.310> goes<00:02:11.489> what<00:02:11.640> couple<00:02:11.910> carmines<00:02:12.330> hit<00:02:12.569> me

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and he goes what couple carmines hit me

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.170 
and he goes what couple carmines hit me
hit

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
hit

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.080 
hit
with<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.599> heat<00:02:13.930> wave<00:02:14.400> which<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.549> kind<00:02:15.909> of<00:02:15.969> a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
with the heat wave which is kind of a

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.660 
with the heat wave which is kind of a
weird<00:02:16.480> move<00:02:16.870> because<00:02:17.439> usually<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.280> just<00:02:18.310> see

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
weird move because usually you just see

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.780 
weird move because usually you just see
flame<00:02:19.000> power<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.750> Fire<00:02:20.109> Blast<00:02:20.549> okay<00:02:21.549> but<00:02:21.730> I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
flame power and Fire Blast okay but I

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.539 
flame power and Fire Blast okay but I
guess<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.719> know<00:02:22.900> flame<00:02:23.170> tower<00:02:23.409> is<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> bit<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.459> a

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
guess you know flame tower is a bit of a

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.000 
guess you know flame tower is a bit of a
middleman<00:02:24.939> but<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.900> i<00:02:26.019> don't<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.709> i<00:02:26.980> don't

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
middleman but I i don't know i don't

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.270 
middleman but I i don't know i don't
know<00:02:27.219> whatever<00:02:28.030> i<00:02:28.359> digress<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.170> he<00:02:30.069> actually

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
know whatever i digress and he actually

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.849 
know whatever i digress and he actually
has<00:02:30.639> real<00:02:30.670> always<00:02:31.239> too<00:02:31.540> so<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> guess<00:02:32.049> he's<00:02:32.620> like

and you know call mine and then moved to

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.520 
and you know call mine and then moved to
sweep<00:02:41.439> with<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.310> know<00:02:42.489> fire<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.930> grass

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
sweep with the you know fire and grass

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.830 
sweep with the you know fire and grass
moves<00:02:44.950> being<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.760> heat<00:02:45.939> wave<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.419> the<00:02:46.569> solar

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
moves being the heat wave and the solar

mind instead of the moonlight and this

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.720 
mind instead of the moonlight and this
is<00:02:58.659> going<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.959> come<00:02:59.169> real<00:02:59.469> close<00:02:59.680> if<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.280> can

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
is going to come real close if I can

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.869 
is going to come real close if I can
survive<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.510> next<00:03:01.930> hit<00:03:02.139> and<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:03.459> do<00:03:03.519> not

but uh not gonna have a chance after the
frayed<00:03:13.870> even<00:03:14.139> if<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.379> had<00:03:14.590> moonlighted<00:03:15.219> there

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the life or Draco meteor he can easily

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.809 
the life or Draco meteor he can easily
take<00:03:48.879> down<00:03:48.939> my<00:03:49.299> wall<00:03:49.540> pics<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.250> he<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.519> still

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.759 
take down my wall pics and he is still
able<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.150> live<00:03:52.359> but<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.019> since<00:03:53.229> he<00:03:53.349> is<00:03:53.500> at<00:03:53.709> a

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
able to live but it since he is at a

able to live but it since he is at a
minus<00:03:54.340> 2i<00:03:54.609> just<00:03:54.879> go<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.299> my<00:03:55.419> SP<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.840> set<00:03:56.079> up<00:03:56.169> the

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
minus 2i just go in my SP on set up the

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.110 
minus 2i just go in my SP on set up the
reflect<00:03:56.650> but<00:03:57.220> he<00:03:57.400> actually<00:03:57.549> carries<00:03:58.000> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
reflect but he actually carries the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.330 
reflect but he actually carries the
aldrich<00:03:58.509> but<00:03:58.780> with<00:03:59.199> the<00:03:59.349> reflect<00:03:59.739> up<00:03:59.919> I<00:04:00.069> should

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
aldrich but with the reflect up I should

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.479 
aldrich but with the reflect up I should
be<00:04:00.519> able<00:04:00.609> to<00:04:00.729> take<00:04:00.909> a<00:04:00.939> hit<00:04:01.209> but<00:04:01.829> he<00:04:02.829> creates<00:04:03.280> me

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
be able to take a hit but he creates me

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.030 
be able to take a hit but he creates me
which<00:04:03.909> is<00:04:04.180> really<00:04:04.419> unfortunate<00:04:04.840> but<00:04:05.500> uh<00:04:05.560> you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
which is really unfortunate but uh you

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.110 
which is really unfortunate but uh you
know<00:04:06.389> this<00:04:07.389> is<00:04:07.419> just<00:04:07.599> game<00:04:08.109> again<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:09.849> will

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
know this is just game again and I will

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.849 
know this is just game again and I will
just<00:04:10.599> go<00:04:10.659> into<00:04:10.930> my<00:04:10.989> ship<00:04:11.229> free<00:04:11.439> because<00:04:11.650> it's

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
just go into my ship free because it's

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.219 
just go into my ship free because it's
my<00:04:12.009> chlorophyll<00:04:12.579> user<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:13.180> fastest<00:04:13.599> guy<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.199> I

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
my chlorophyll user the fastest guy so I

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.080 
my chlorophyll user the fastest guy so I
decided<00:04:14.829> that<00:04:14.949> it<00:04:15.400> would<00:04:15.489> be<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.699> good<00:04:15.849> play<00:04:16.060> to

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
decided that it would be a good play to

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.479 
decided that it would be a good play to
go<00:04:16.659> into<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.079> but<00:04:17.109> uh<00:04:17.320> he<00:04:18.039> sees<00:04:18.280> this

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
go into it but uh he sees this

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.750 
go into it but uh he sees this
opportunity<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.560> set<00:04:20.560> up<00:04:20.680> his<00:04:20.829> spike<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.579> he

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
opportunity to set up his spike so he

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.640 
opportunity to set up his spike so he
just<00:04:21.940> goes<00:04:22.120> into<00:04:22.360> ferrothorn<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:23.080> will<00:04:23.409> have<00:04:23.620> to

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
just goes into ferrothorn I will have to

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.370 
just goes into ferrothorn I will have to
switch<00:04:24.070> out<00:04:24.310> because<00:04:25.029> I

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
switch out because I

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.320 
switch out because I
have<00:04:25.440> anything<00:04:25.710> I<00:04:25.950> can<00:04:26.130> do<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.940> thing

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
have anything I can do to that thing

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
what does he have on his watchamacallit

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.310 
what does he have on his watchamacallit
reuniclus<00:04:50.430> that<00:04:50.910> he<00:04:51.090> has<00:04:51.300> on<00:04:51.330> his<00:04:51.600> team<00:04:51.990> but<00:04:52.290> I

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
reuniclus that he has on his team but I

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.930 
reuniclus that he has on his team but I
set<00:04:52.590> up<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.770> trick<00:04:52.980> room<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.310> lived<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.730> sucker

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
set up the trick room I lived the sucker

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.840 
set up the trick room I lived the sucker
punch<00:04:54.060> easily<00:04:54.720> because<00:04:55.140> of<00:04:55.320> reflect<00:04:55.830> but<00:04:56.580> he

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
punch easily because of reflect but he

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.180 
punch easily because of reflect but he
goes<00:04:57.090> in<00:04:57.330> his<00:04:57.540> reuniclus<00:04:58.170> and<00:04:58.560> at<00:04:58.710> this<00:04:58.920> point

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
goes in his reuniclus and at this point

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.010 
goes in his reuniclus and at this point
I'm<00:04:59.370> pretty<00:04:59.490> sure<00:04:59.790> he<00:05:00.090> has<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.330> shadow<00:05:00.750> ball

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
I'm pretty sure he has the shadow ball

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.650 
I'm pretty sure he has the shadow ball
otherwise<00:05:01.890> he<00:05:02.130> would<00:05:02.490> not<00:05:02.520> have<00:05:02.880> gone<00:05:03.120> into<00:05:03.420> it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
otherwise he would not have gone into it

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.910 
otherwise he would not have gone into it
although<00:05:04.080> he<00:05:04.200> doesn't<00:05:04.380> have<00:05:04.590> too<00:05:04.770> many

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
although he doesn't have too many

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.530 
although he doesn't have too many
options<00:05:05.040> but<00:05:05.400> I'm<00:05:05.610> fearing<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.150> shadow<00:05:06.360> ball

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
options but I'm fearing the shadow ball

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.630 
options but I'm fearing the shadow ball
but<00:05:06.930> he<00:05:07.110> actually<00:05:07.290> goes<00:05:07.590> for<00:05:07.860> his<00:05:07.980> own<00:05:08.220> trick

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
but he actually goes for his own trick

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.660 
but he actually goes for his own trick
room<00:05:08.990> reversing<00:05:09.990> my<00:05:10.320> trick<00:05:10.680> room<00:05:10.890> which<00:05:11.490> was

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
room reversing my trick room which was

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.990 
room reversing my trick room which was
really<00:05:12.000> confusing<00:05:13.340> because<00:05:14.340> he<00:05:14.640> definitely

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
really confusing because he definitely

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.600 
really confusing because he definitely
could<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.540> used<00:05:15.960> my<00:05:16.320> trick<00:05:16.680> room<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:17.190> you

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
could have used my trick room and you

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.270 
could have used my trick room and you
know<00:05:17.730> just<00:05:18.000> Shadow<00:05:18.270> Ball<00:05:18.570> bald<00:05:19.380> but<00:05:19.740> i<00:05:20.070> don't

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
know just Shadow Ball bald but i don't

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.520 
know just Shadow Ball bald but i don't
know<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.880> i<00:05:21.000> go<00:05:21.180> for<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.390> sucker<00:05:22.020> punch<00:05:22.110> but

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
know and i go for the sucker punch but

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.020 
know and i go for the sucker punch but
he<00:05:22.710> of<00:05:22.860> course<00:05:23.010> goes<00:05:23.250> back<00:05:23.490> into<00:05:23.700> his<00:05:23.880> bed

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
he of course goes back into his bed

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.670 
he of course goes back into his bed
alone<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.540> he's<00:05:24.990> going<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.170> set<00:05:25.350> up<00:05:25.440> more

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
alone and he's going to set up more

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.950 
alone and he's going to set up more
spikes<00:05:26.040> putting<00:05:26.520> more<00:05:26.940> pressure<00:05:27.150> on<00:05:27.390> my<00:05:27.720> team

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
spikes putting more pressure on my team

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.870 
spikes putting more pressure on my team
because<00:05:28.530> i<00:05:28.740> don't<00:05:28.920> have<00:05:29.040> my<00:05:29.190> ass<00:05:29.370> beyond<00:05:29.700> to

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
because i don't have my ass beyond to

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.570 
because i don't have my ass beyond to
block<00:05:30.150> those<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:30.810> now<00:05:31.110> i<00:05:31.140> will<00:05:31.500> just<00:05:31.980> have<00:05:32.310> to

even<00:06:16.680> off<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.040> leftovers<00:06:17.910> it's<00:06:18.210> gonna<00:06:18.390> be<00:06:18.600> a

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
even off the leftovers it's gonna be a

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.020 
even off the leftovers it's gonna be a
solid<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.290> eat<00:06:19.470> kale<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.190> I'm<00:06:20.610> kind<00:06:20.910> of<00:06:20.970> hoping

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
solid to eat kale and I'm kind of hoping

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.660 
solid to eat kale and I'm kind of hoping
to<00:06:21.330> live<00:06:21.510> even<00:06:21.750> a<00:06:22.020> psychic<00:06:22.560> because<00:06:22.770> here<00:06:23.220> he

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
to live even a psychic because here he

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.910 
to live even a psychic because here he
seems<00:06:24.120> to<00:06:24.210> be<00:06:24.330> carrying<00:06:24.540> left<00:06:24.900> 0<00:06:25.080> is<00:06:25.260> not<00:06:25.560> life

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
seems to be carrying left 0 is not life

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.300 
seems to be carrying left 0 is not life
orb<00:06:26.370> but<00:06:27.090> he<00:06:27.360> goes<00:06:27.540> for<00:06:27.810> Shadow<00:06:28.560> Ball<00:06:28.860> so<00:06:29.160> I'm

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
orb but he goes for Shadow Ball so I'm

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.280 
orb but he goes for Shadow Ball so I'm
guessing<00:06:29.550> he<00:06:29.910> doesn't<00:06:30.120> even<00:06:30.360> have<00:06:30.690> psychic<00:06:31.140> he

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
guessing he doesn't even have psychic he

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.440 
guessing he doesn't even have psychic he
has<00:06:31.470> like<00:06:31.650> a<00:06:31.680> recover<00:06:32.310> I<00:06:32.640> guess<00:06:33.180> that<00:06:33.210> would

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
has like a recover I guess that would

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.420 
has like a recover I guess that would
make<00:06:33.510> sense<00:06:33.930> with<00:06:34.140> leftovers<00:06:34.800> but<00:06:35.070> uh<00:06:35.130> since

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
make sense with leftovers but uh since

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.050 
make sense with leftovers but uh since
he<00:06:35.700> did<00:06:36.180> set<00:06:36.450> up<00:06:36.570> his<00:06:36.780> a<00:06:36.810> own<00:06:37.500> trick<00:06:38.220> room<00:06:38.460> again

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
he did set up his a own trick room again

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.060 
he did set up his a own trick room again
I<00:06:39.090> can<00:06:39.300> actually<00:06:39.510> use<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.080> against<00:06:40.650> him<00:06:40.740> and

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
I can actually use it against him and

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.770 
I can actually use it against him and
out<00:06:41.250> speed<00:06:41.550> his<00:06:41.760> eye<00:06:41.790> with<00:06:42.030> teenie<00:06:42.300> with<00:06:42.630> my
