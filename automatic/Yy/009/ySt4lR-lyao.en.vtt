00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
access to a few hundred channels so it's

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.640 
access to a few hundred channels so it's
easy<00:04:45.699> to<00:04:45.820> find<00:04:46.030> something<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.630> also<00:04:47.349> that

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
easy to find something that also that

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.379 
easy to find something that also that
would<00:04:47.740> like<00:04:47.889> to<00:04:48.039> watch<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:48.820> just<00:04:49.030> flip<00:04:49.270> that

if<00:04:51.160> you<00:04:51.280> have<00:04:51.430> access<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.120> some<00:04:52.810> more

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
if you have access to some more

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.050 
if you have access to some more
sophisticated<00:04:53.440> technology<00:04:54.070> like<00:04:54.250> TiVo<00:04:54.820> or

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
sophisticated technology like TiVo or

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.790 
sophisticated technology like TiVo or
digital<00:04:55.720> video<00:04:55.990> recorders<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.650> can

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
digital video recorders and you can

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.439 
digital video recorders and you can
easily<00:04:57.160> skip<00:04:57.550> by<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.759> commercials<00:04:58.270> and

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
easily skip by the commercials and

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.040 
easily skip by the commercials and
that's<00:04:59.139> another<00:04:59.440> way<00:04:59.889> that<00:04:59.919> you<00:05:00.099> can<00:05:00.220> do<00:05:00.490> that

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
that's another way that you can do that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.909 
that's another way that you can do that
so<00:05:02.050> clearly<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.910> take-home<00:05:04.690> messages<00:05:05.320> do<00:05:05.889> not

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
so clearly the take-home messages do not

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.730 
so clearly the take-home messages do not
fall<00:05:06.880> into<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.180> trap<00:05:07.419> don't<00:05:07.570> consume<00:05:07.990> 175

fall into the trap don't consume 175

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.379 
fall into the trap don't consume 175
pounds<00:05:08.979> of<00:05:09.070> sugar<00:05:09.220> otherwise<00:05:10.090> you're<00:05:10.270> going
