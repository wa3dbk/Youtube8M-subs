00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.430 

the<00:00:00.299> first<00:00:00.570> thing<00:00:00.810> we're<00:00:00.960> going<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.230> do<00:00:01.560> is

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.440 
the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.909 
the first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:04.440> lucky<00:00:05.009> actually<00:00:05.339> that<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:07.649> has

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
we're lucky actually that the it has

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.459 
we're lucky actually that the it has
already<00:00:08.220> been<00:00:08.639> drilled<00:00:09.059> if<00:00:09.330> somebody<00:00:09.719> drilled

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
already been drilled if somebody drilled

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.209 
already been drilled if somebody drilled
this<00:00:10.650> at<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.340> time<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:12.690> long<00:00:13.500> time<00:00:13.830> ago<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
this at some time a long time ago it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.529 
this at some time a long time ago it
looks<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:16.010> so<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.490> have<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> door

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
looks like so what we have on the door

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.359 
looks like so what we have on the door
is<00:00:18.869> two<00:00:19.439> basic<00:00:20.400> parts<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
is two basic parts we have the the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.740 
is two basic parts we have the the
doorknob<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.650> section<00:00:25.699> this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.910> used<00:00:27.390> one

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
doorknob a section this is a used one

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.419 
doorknob a section this is a used one
but<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.080> still<00:00:28.289> perfectly<00:00:28.740> good<00:00:29.039> we're

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
but it's still perfectly good we're

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.069 
but it's still perfectly good we're
gonna<00:00:29.519> put<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.019> then<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.600 

and<00:00:37.129> then<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.280> also<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> put<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
and then we're also going to put on a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.319 
and then we're also going to put on a
another<00:00:41.610> piece<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:43.590> go<00:00:43.620> into<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.820> now

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
another piece that will go into here now

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.400 
another piece that will go into here now
right<00:00:46.230> off<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:46.649> seeing<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.850> piece<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
right off I'm seeing that this piece is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
right off I'm seeing that this piece is
hitting<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.070> inside<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.090> we'll<00:00:51.239> probably

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
hitting on the inside so we'll probably

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.279 
hitting on the inside so we'll probably
need<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:53.270> see<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> does<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.930> sit<00:00:55.260> down

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
need to see how this does not sit down

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.189 
need to see how this does not sit down
in<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.739> quite<00:00:55.920> far<00:00:56.190> enough<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.360> this

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
in there quite far enough so this this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
in there quite far enough so this this
wasn't<00:00:58.559> supposed<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.760> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
wasn't supposed to do this but this is a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
wasn't supposed to do this but this is a
common<00:01:00.600> problem<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.219> run<00:01:02.430> into

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
common problem that you can run into

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.660 
common problem that you can run into
when<00:01:03.359> you're<00:01:04.140> replacing<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> type<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
when you're replacing it now the type of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.539 
when you're replacing it now the type of
doorknobs<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.750> recommend<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
doorknobs that I recommend is a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.710 
doorknobs that I recommend is a
manufacturer<00:01:09.360> called<00:01:09.570> quick-set<00:01:10.560> kwi<00:01:11.689> kset

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
manufacturer called quick-set kwi kset

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.160 
manufacturer called quick-set kwi kset
this<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.650> brand<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:15.210> works<00:01:15.659> pretty<00:01:16.049> well

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
this this brand just works pretty well

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.420 
this this brand just works pretty well
and<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.570> design<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.470> it's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and it's a pretty good design and it's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.880 
and it's a pretty good design and it's
pretty<00:01:20.700> easy<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.330> install<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.560> that's<00:01:22.740> my

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
pretty easy to install so that's my

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.010 
pretty easy to install so that's my
recommendation<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> appears<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:24.990> though

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
recommendation but it appears as though

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.760 
recommendation but it appears as though
somebody<00:01:25.530> has<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> different<00:01:27.689> style<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
somebody has put in a different style of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
somebody has put in a different style of
a<00:01:29.460> lock

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
a lock

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.140 
a lock
I<00:01:30.240> don't<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.810> back<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> 1940s<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.909> 50s

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I don't know back in the 1940s or 50s

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149 
I don't know back in the 1940s or 50s
there's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.049> little<00:01:34.259> bit<00:01:34.380> different<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.950> also

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
there's a little bit different and also

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.200 
there's a little bit different and also
it<00:01:35.610> looks<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:36.119> though<00:01:36.829> this<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it looks as though this the this is the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.920 
it looks as though this the this is the
back<00:01:39.420> set<00:01:40.369> but<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> back<00:01:41.729> set<00:01:42.180> looks<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
back set but the back set looks like it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.249 
back set but the back set looks like it
is<00:01:43.079> proper<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.579> but<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> hole<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.259> it's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is proper for this but the hole is it's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.069 
is proper for this but the hole is it's
hitting<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.130> won't<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.810> far<00:01:48.810> enough

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
hitting so this won't go in far enough

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
hitting so this won't go in far enough
and<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:49.950> starting<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.670> like

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
and you know it's starting to look like

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.490 
and you know it's starting to look like
that<00:01:51.600> hole<00:01:51.899> may<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:54.000> wrong<00:01:54.210> size<00:01:54.780> also

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that hole may be the wrong size also

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.370 
that hole may be the wrong size also
this<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.579> need<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.689> through<00:01:58.020> here

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this is going to need to go through here

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
this is going to need to go through here
and<00:01:58.560> I'm<00:01:59.369> seeing<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.630> bolts<00:02:01.700> won't<00:02:02.700> go

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and I'm seeing that the bolts won't go

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
and I'm seeing that the bolts won't go
through<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> need<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.189> make

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
through so we are going to need to make

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.259 
through so we are going to need to make
this<00:02:05.700> hole<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.360> little<00:02:06.930> bit<00:02:07.229> bigger
