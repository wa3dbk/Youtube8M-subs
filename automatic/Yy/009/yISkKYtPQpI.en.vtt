still<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> pickup<00:01:48.570> truck<00:01:48.689> i<00:01:48.899> guess<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.259> use

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
still a pickup truck i guess and use

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.300 
still a pickup truck i guess and use
that<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.399> main<00:01:51.000> vehicle<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:52.220> it<00:01:53.220> only

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
that as your main vehicle but it only

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
that as your main vehicle but it only
has<00:01:53.640> two<00:01:53.880> seats<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:55.079> if<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> encounter<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
has two seats so if you encounter a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.450 
has two seats so if you encounter a
survivor<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:57.439> don't<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.040> person<00:01:59.219> will

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
survivor I don't know if the person will

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.560 
survivor I don't know if the person will
be<00:01:59.520> able<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.700> fit<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.119> mean<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.299> might<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.509> able

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
be able to fit I mean you might be able

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
be able to fit I mean you might be able
to<00:02:00.719> fit<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.020> survivor<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.939> it's<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.119> going

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.990 
to fit one survivor but it's not going
to<00:02:03.299> work<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.600> guess<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.640> according<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.820> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
to work I guess and according to the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.900 
to work I guess and according to the
developer<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.719> guess<00:02:07.340> skip<00:02:08.340> truck<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.670> really

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
developer I guess skip truck is really

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.540 
developer I guess skip truck is really
more<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.479> carrying<00:02:09.899> supplies<00:02:10.220> not<00:02:11.220> for

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
more for carrying supplies not for

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.900 
more for carrying supplies not for
survivors<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.840> probably<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.349> be

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
survivors so it will probably just be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.270 
survivors so it will probably just be
you<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.720> Mauro<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.560> whole<00:02:15.710> way<00:02:15.860> if<00:02:16.160> you

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
you and Mauro the whole way if you

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.310 
you and Mauro the whole way if you
decide<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.790> use<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.180> pickup<00:02:17.420> truck<00:02:17.600> but

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
decide just to use the pickup truck but

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.720 
decide just to use the pickup truck but
uh<00:02:19.150> there's<00:02:20.150> also<00:02:20.450> i<00:02:21.250> mean<00:02:22.250> along<00:02:22.490> with<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
uh there's also i mean along with the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.050 
uh there's also i mean along with the
survivors<00:02:23.180> thing<00:02:23.330> there's<00:02:23.480> also<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
survivors thing there's also the the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.510 
survivors thing there's also the the
fact<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.960> survivors<00:02:27.290> can<00:02:27.710> help<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.250> and

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
to do their own mission it's kind of

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.880 
to do their own mission it's kind of
like<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.110> send<00:02:36.380> them<00:02:36.470> out<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.740> mission

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
like you can send them out on a mission

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.460 
like you can send them out on a mission
to<00:02:37.190> go<00:02:37.340> scavenge<00:02:38.090> for<00:02:38.240> supplies<00:02:38.300> or<00:02:38.900> go<00:02:39.230> find

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
food or just whatever it's up to you I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.790 
food or just whatever it's up to you I
mean<00:02:42.050> you're<00:02:42.170> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> leader<00:02:42.710> of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
mean you're going to be the leader of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.910 
mean you're going to be the leader of
the<00:02:43.040> group<00:02:43.250> until<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.120> kind<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.690> gets

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
the group until it kind of just gets

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.610 
the group until it kind of just gets
disbanded<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.950> suppose<00:02:46.250> because<00:02:47.200> as<00:02:48.200> far<00:02:48.230> as<00:02:48.470> I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
disbanded I suppose because as far as I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.020 
disbanded I suppose because as far as I
know<00:02:48.740> Daryl<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.220> Merle<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.700> only<00:02:49.850> two<00:02:50.000> people

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
know Daryl and Merle the only two people

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.660 
know Daryl and Merle the only two people
that<00:02:50.360> make<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.870> puts<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:52.240> anyways<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:55.460> get<00:02:55.550> to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
that make it puts on anyways you get to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.490 
that make it puts on anyways you get to
choose<00:02:55.880> what<00:02:56.180> survivors<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:57.290> big<00:02:57.470> thing

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
choose what survivors the big thing

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.430 
choose what survivors the big thing
losing<00:02:58.460> your<00:02:58.550> group<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.910> not<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.150> your<00:02:59.210> group

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
losing your group is not in your group

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.840 
losing your group is not in your group
but<00:03:00.440> uh<00:03:00.470> another<00:03:01.070> disadvantage<00:03:01.250> would<00:03:01.760> be

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
but uh another disadvantage would be

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.240 
but uh another disadvantage would be
that<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.390> survivors<00:03:02.720> actually<00:03:03.290> share<00:03:04.130> your

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
that the survivors actually share your

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.790 
that the survivors actually share your
resources<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:05.060> if<00:03:05.930> they<00:03:06.080> get<00:03:06.230> hurt<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.680> have

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
resources so if they get hurt you have

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.400 
resources so if they get hurt you have
the<00:03:06.920> option<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.420> kind<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.450> heal<00:03:08.660> them<00:03:08.960> and<00:03:08.990> give

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
the option to kind of heal them and give

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.540 
the option to kind of heal them and give
them<00:03:09.440> food<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:10.130> whatever<00:03:12.190> all<00:03:13.190> right<00:03:13.370> in

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
them food and just whatever all right in

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.940 
them food and just whatever all right in
this<00:03:13.760> game<00:03:14.060> there<00:03:14.360> are<00:03:14.540> two<00:03:15.140> main<00:03:15.590> missions

the road missions these occur whenever

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
there's situations where for example

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.660 
there's situations where for example
your<00:03:33.170> car<00:03:33.380> breaks<00:03:33.620> down<00:03:33.740> or<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:34.340> runs<00:03:34.490> out<00:03:34.610> of

whole bunch of walkers or if your dive
bars<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.390> wherever<00:03:41.570> but<00:03:42.380> basically<00:03:42.530> someplace

near you has supplies you have to make

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.860 
near you has supplies you have to make
the<00:03:45.800> decision<00:03:45.830> whether<00:03:46.430> or<00:03:47.420> not<00:03:47.600> it's<00:03:47.810> worth

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
the decision whether or not it's worth

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.350 
the decision whether or not it's worth
it<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.230> go<00:03:48.500> into<00:03:48.739> that<00:03:48.950> building<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.489> risk

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
it to go into that building and risk

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.600 
it to go into that building and risk
getting<00:03:50.540> killed<00:03:50.870> by<00:03:51.050> walkers<00:03:51.470> or<00:03:51.520> even<00:03:52.520> up

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
getting killed by walkers or even up

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.370 
getting killed by walkers or even up
just<00:03:52.820> other<00:03:52.910> people<00:03:53.000> really<00:03:53.600> because<00:03:54.260> that's

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
just other people really because that's

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.740 
just other people really because that's
a<00:03:54.500> pretty<00:03:55.160> big<00:03:55.340> factor<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:55.940> any<00:03:56.239> zombie

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
a pretty big factor in any zombie

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.600 
a pretty big factor in any zombie
apocalypse<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.290> think<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:59.570> know<00:03:59.660> people

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
apocalypse I think that you know people

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.250 
apocalypse I think that you know people
are<00:04:01.610> going<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:01.850> be<00:04:01.910> looking<00:04:02.030> for<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:03.050> same

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
are going to be looking for the same

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.010 
are going to be looking for the same
stuff<00:04:03.470> you're<00:04:03.680> looking<00:04:03.920> for<00:04:04.270> so<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:05.720> have<00:04:05.900> to

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
stuff you're looking for so you have to
