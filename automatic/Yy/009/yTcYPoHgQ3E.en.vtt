00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 I came here on hers today to show you how 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.629
 you can lose up to 25% that 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.450
 The fat that bothers you knows in a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.759
 time to go to bed like you liked it 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.699
 krill slim then only knows the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.189
 Vignette does not leave, we 'll meet 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.109
 a cril slim that explained to people who 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.820
 this procedure the crisis line 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.560
 Creole policy equipment that will 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 promote the freezing of the cells of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.449
 fat through two peltier plates 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.059
 these plates promotes a cooling of the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.340
 skin at a therapeutic temperature of -7 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.140
 degrees for 60 minutes 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.579
 so my body understands that 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.239
 that fat cell is a body 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.770
 strange and sends out macrophages to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.110
 phagocytic cells 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.149
 or break that fat cell 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.860
 in very small pieces to be 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.140
 eliminated in the body 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.270
 so I get a reduction of up to 25% 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.980
 of body fat in the region 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.579
 who can do this procedure? 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.470
 the ideal is to be that person with fat 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.900
 located that is the person with the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 ideal weight but that has that fat 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 that does not go out at all and in the region 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.119
 lower abdomen and lower abdomen 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.820
 top and sides which age can do 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.340
 any age can do the important thing 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.960
 the physical biotype is localized fat 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.479
 but with ideal weight 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.810
 who can not do it at all 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.820
 pregnant women with pacemakers 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.890
 decompensated diabetics and people 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 intolerant or cold as does the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.200
 people will evaluate the region that will be 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.140
 cleaned the area and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.880
 we put a protective film 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.460
 antifrizz aim to protect your skin during 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.110
 the application after that we connect the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.320
 equipment you will watch a suction 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.000
 super strong it's going to be a bit 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.280
 uncomfortable in the first three minutes 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.170
 then you will not feel anything else 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.409
 because the cold it promotes empty manaus 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.380
 on the skin after the 60 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.140
 minutes we will have a massage in the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.049
 region where it will return to circulation 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.929
 local and improve the appearance of the skin 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.610
 because with the suction and crystallization of 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.440
 fat room 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.940
 have as if it were a skin lift 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.800
 at the place of application 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 then this message will make your skin 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.790
 back to normal now we have little 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.830
 a small pouch has a small side 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.960
 can be anything but the same session the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.030
 each session is an area as it works 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.730
 you can do multiple sessions in the same 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.980
 day several areas on the same day since 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.320
 are not nearby areas so if you 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.670
 did lower abdomen today only in two 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.780
 months you'll be able to make a living 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.400
 bottom 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.890
 now if you want to do in abdomen 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.050
 lower abdomen and upper abdomen than the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.660
 from below the top there you can 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.280
 do 15 days after each other and the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.440
 result in how long I can see 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.150
 immediate and takes a little while to 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.530
 result it takes a little bit because 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.480
 he is gradual 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.190
 you will see the result after 60 days 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.530
 two months 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.020
 so I have a time for there to be a 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.250
 process of breaking all these 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.290
 fat cells that have been 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.090
 crystallized with touch treatment now 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.110
