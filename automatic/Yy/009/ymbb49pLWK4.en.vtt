00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello people as you probably know 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.379
 I was at Gamescom 2013 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:15.299
 there you could test the playstation 4 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.710
 and in this video you show yourself yes 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.090
 therefore we already see the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.039
 playstation 4 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.890
 unfortunately she was in such a plastic or im 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.150
 casket he really has 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.529
 very mirrored that 's why they are 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 recordings have not become perfect now 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.910
 but you can actually do it completely 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.109
 Well, there we see it is from 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.989
 black box 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.149
 so we have a white not 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.390
 white light strip which symbolizes 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.950
 that the console is turned on yes 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.940
 if not yet knew the console has 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.239
 1 8 core amd main processor also has 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 still amd graphics 8 gb of RAM 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.800
 The next few years are enough 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.300
 should we have on the front where 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.149
 He joined what the pictures show 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.840
 are two usb 3.0 ports 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.320
 we have an aux connection hdmi output 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.479
 optical audio output 500 gb hard disk 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.770
 is it integrated and how is that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.650
 we also have a playstation 3 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.990
 Blu-ray drive to over the console 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 you see the playstation camera too 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.250
 again new 3d sensor technology 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.600
 integrated has unfortunately not in 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.509
 scope of supply will also contain 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.280
 100 to 150 euro extra cost so if 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.350
 you could have you ever wanted that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.369
 even with calculations yes we come to 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.900
 controller 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.549
 you certainly already have 1000 pictures 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.700
 wanted from the controller anyway 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.110
 I mention it all now 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.270
 in comparison to the playstation 3 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.710
 I am really super controller 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.970
 I was impressed when I got that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.369
 Playstation 4 controller in hand 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.079
 that was really great 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.149
 High quality has worked great in 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.070
 hand-held and he has become easy 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.540
 high quality and not so cheap 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.920
 like the playstation 3 controller 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.869
 that is now a dual shock four 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.950
 controller of course again 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.450
 wireless is the better 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 motion sensors and so on us 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.729
 also have touchpad on the top 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.140
 and a light bar so you stop 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.129
 can identify better 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.270
 ob's controller 1 2 or 3 is we have 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.009
 also a new share button 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.750
 there we can do screenshots or videos 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.870
 out of the game 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.370
 post live or if you have any 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.990
 wanted to make friends look what they wanted 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000
 it could also be about this 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.680
 release key 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.900
 unfortunately could not apply to the menu 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.460
 grab from the playstation 4 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900
 it was just locked so you stop 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.610
 nothing in the system can do around 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.700
 but just test the games 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.700
 can 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.959
 yes I still have a little gameplay 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.370
 recorded so you can see what the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.980
 new motion control with the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.800
 dualshock four controller as running 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:49.200
 The graphic is above all yes and how 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.830
 generally the controller learned so 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.830
 play beats 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.000
 Here we also see gameplay 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.700
 from the game drive works there we see 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.100
 the control with the motion sensors 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.900
 from controller so like the iphone or 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.770
 so in such a racing game just go 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.690
 and move the controller again 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.910
 close up of the playstation 4 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.860
 as I said it has unfortunately very mirrored 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.950
 but I think you can still do that 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.020
 console as I said not strip and 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.020
 then just this chic design 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.400
 I have this drive myself 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.650
 works with the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.030
 motion control at the controller and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.070
 In my opinion , I can do that now 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.630
 not so cool was a bit difficult 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.390
 In any case , we will see again here 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.850
 the playstation camera and again that 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.540
 logo from the playstation 4 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.180
 the playstation 4 will cost 399 euros 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.240
 germany costs and she arrives on 29 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.130
 november so it's still out 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.860
 little bit over month so just two 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.570
 months if you want to release 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.930
 I recommend you to book in advance 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.609
 and then it was with the video I hope 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.510
 you liked it that was not so 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.060
 great reception 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.440
 but I still tried if 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.300
 this video has thumb after thumb 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.919
 up more truly great and writes 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.710
 give me the comments if you one 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.680
 playstation fanboy or an xbox fanboy 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.580
 then thank you for watching 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.580
 Until next time
