I'll<00:04:29.690> install<00:04:30.050> some<00:04:30.229> programs<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.190> mess<00:04:31.370> with

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
I'll install some programs and mess with

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.520 
I'll install some programs and mess with
the<00:04:31.550> computer<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:31.970> bit<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.389> we're<00:04:32.870> roots<00:04:33.320> and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
the computer a bit and we're roots and

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.469 
the computer a bit and we're roots and
see<00:04:33.770> if<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:33.949> actually<00:04:33.979> works<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.639> i<00:04:35.300> went

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
see if it actually works it's i went

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.390 
see if it actually works it's i went
ahead<00:04:35.539> and<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:36.139> of<00:04:36.289> mess<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.979> computer<00:04:37.370> a

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
ahead and kind of mess the computer a

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.969 
ahead and kind of mess the computer a
bit<00:04:37.669> I'd<00:04:37.789> lead<00:04:38.000> some<00:04:38.210> icons<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.080> did<00:04:39.800> some

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
bit I'd lead some icons and did some

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.800 
bit I'd lead some icons and did some
little<00:04:40.190> foolish<00:04:40.550> stuff<00:04:40.849> change<00:04:41.599> the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
little foolish stuff change the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.379 
little foolish stuff change the
wallpaper<00:04:41.990> may<00:04:42.560> need<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.710> high<00:04:42.860> contrast<00:04:43.389> so

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
wallpaper may need a high contrast so

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.240 
wallpaper may need a high contrast so
anyway<00:04:44.780> what<00:04:45.199> I<00:04:45.229> do<00:04:45.440> now<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.620> will<00:04:45.860> restart<00:04:46.190> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
anyway what I do now is will restart the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.420 
anyway what I do now is will restart the
computer<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:51.590> when<00:04:51.860> we<00:04:51.919> start<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.190> computer

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
computer and when we start the computer

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.640 
computer and when we start the computer
when<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.030> come<00:04:53.180> back<00:04:53.360> it<00:04:53.630> should<00:04:53.900> be<00:04:53.930> back<00:04:54.620> to

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
when you come back it should be back to

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.939 
when you come back it should be back to
how<00:04:55.070> we<00:04:55.099> had<00:04:55.400> before<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:56.030> much<00:04:56.900> nicer<00:04:57.080> look<00:04:59.949> so

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
how we had before a much nicer look so

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.950 
how we had before a much nicer look so
you<00:05:01.039> can<00:05:01.159> see<00:05:01.310> that<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.699> reboot<00:05:02.360> restore<00:05:02.720> our

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
you can see that the reboot restore our

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.170 
you can see that the reboot restore our
X<00:05:03.199> program<00:05:03.470> comes<00:05:04.340> into<00:05:04.580> play<00:05:04.820> right<00:05:05.000> the

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
X program comes into play right the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.940 
X program comes into play right the
boots<00:05:05.389> it<00:05:05.930> takes<00:05:06.139> about<00:05:06.229> an<00:05:06.380> extra<00:05:06.710> four

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
boots it takes about an extra four

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.290 
boots it takes about an extra four
seconds<00:05:07.430> or<00:05:07.550> three<00:05:07.760> seconds<00:05:08.120> for<00:05:08.240> the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
seconds or three seconds for the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.209 
seconds or three seconds for the
computer<00:05:08.539> on<00:05:08.840> so<00:05:09.620> it's<00:05:09.740> in<00:05:09.830> common<00:05:10.130> right

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
computer on so it's in common right

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.839 
computer on so it's in common right
before<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.580> boot

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
before the boot

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.719 
before the boot
logo<00:05:11.059> a<00:05:11.689> bar<00:05:12.499> jungle<00:05:12.800> crash<00:05:12.949> pretty<00:05:13.189> fast<00:05:13.429> and

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
logo a bar jungle crash pretty fast and

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.339 
logo a bar jungle crash pretty fast and
then<00:05:14.089> as<00:05:14.179> I<00:05:14.240> continue<00:05:14.629> on<00:05:14.749> as<00:05:14.929> if<00:05:15.110> it<00:05:15.259> was

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
then as I continue on as if it was

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.029 
then as I continue on as if it was
booting<00:05:15.679> normally<00:05:16.179> in<00:05:17.559> that<00:05:18.559> time<00:05:18.830> you

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
booting normally in that time you

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.579 
booting normally in that time you
basically<00:05:19.779> restore<00:05:20.779> the<00:05:20.869> computer<00:05:20.959> back<00:05:21.409> to

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:21.589 
basically restore the computer back to

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.219 
basically restore the computer back to
how<00:05:21.709> you<00:05:21.770> liked<00:05:21.979> it<00:05:22.039> before<00:05:23.139> so<00:05:24.139> it's

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
how you liked it before so it's

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.719 
how you liked it before so it's
automatically<00:05:24.559> going<00:05:24.619> to<00:05:24.740> log<00:05:24.919> in<00:05:25.069> again<00:05:25.099> and

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
automatically going to log in again and

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.119 
automatically going to log in again and
we're<00:05:26.059> going<00:05:26.179> to<00:05:26.209> see<00:05:26.449> right<00:05:27.319> now<00:05:27.349> that<00:05:27.529> our

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:28.129 
we're going to see right now that our

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.040 
we're going to see right now that our
computer<00:05:28.669> is<00:05:28.699> pretty<00:05:29.300> much<00:05:29.449> back<00:05:29.629> to<00:05:29.689> how

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
computer is pretty much back to how

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.219 
computer is pretty much back to how
liked<00:05:30.319> it<00:05:34.300> so<00:05:35.300> now<00:05:35.389> in<00:05:35.479> as<00:05:35.539> bad<00:05:35.719> you<00:05:35.899> can<00:05:36.020> see<00:05:36.199> I

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
liked it so now in as bad you can see I

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.589 
liked it so now in as bad you can see I
do<00:05:36.349> have<00:05:36.619> my<00:05:36.770> icons<00:05:37.189> back<00:05:37.429> along<00:05:38.240> with<00:05:38.270> my

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
do have my icons back along with my

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.839 
do have my icons back along with my
desktop<00:05:39.080> so<00:05:39.319> there<00:05:39.889> you<00:05:39.949> go<00:05:39.979> guys<00:05:40.069> you<00:05:40.729> guys

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
desktop so there you go guys you guys

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.499 
desktop so there you go guys you guys
can<00:05:41.029> see<00:05:41.209> how<00:05:41.330> it<00:05:41.449> works<00:05:41.659> and<00:05:42.519> yeah<00:05:43.519> so<00:05:44.149> if<00:05:44.360> you

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
can see how it works and yeah so if you

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.409 
can see how it works and yeah so if you
the<00:05:44.929> one<00:05:45.080> downfall<00:05:45.349> to<00:05:45.860> this<00:05:46.069> program<00:05:46.699> I<00:05:47.089> found

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
the one downfall to this program I found

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.839 
the one downfall to this program I found
was<00:05:48.169> when<00:05:48.379> the<00:05:48.469> computer<00:05:48.619> is<00:05:48.860> turning<00:05:49.309> on<00:05:49.459> if

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
was when the computer is turning on if

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.269 
was when the computer is turning on if
you<00:05:50.029> press<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.389> HOME<00:05:50.599> key<00:05:50.629> it<00:05:51.529> will<00:05:51.830> go<00:05:52.129> into

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
you press the HOME key it will go into

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:53.320 
you press the HOME key it will go into
the<00:05:52.459> settings<00:05:52.669> and<00:05:52.939> you<00:05:52.999> can<00:05:53.059> actually

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
the settings and you can actually

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.779 
the settings and you can actually
uninstall<00:05:53.929> this<00:05:54.080> so<00:05:54.919> if<00:05:55.069> someone<00:05:55.429> knows<00:05:55.639> the

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
uninstall this so if someone knows the

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.329 
uninstall this so if someone knows the
program<00:05:56.209> or<00:05:56.509> is<00:05:56.689> decent<00:05:57.199> with<00:05:57.289> computers<00:05:57.800> they

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
program or is decent with computers they

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.350 
program or is decent with computers they
can<00:05:58.490> probably<00:05:58.819> figure<00:05:58.969> out<00:05:59.179> how<00:05:59.269> to<00:05:59.360> do<00:05:59.509> this

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
can probably figure out how to do this

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.969 
can probably figure out how to do this
the<00:06:02.360> main<00:06:02.569> way<00:06:02.779> if<00:06:02.929> it's<00:06:03.289> probably<00:06:03.589> fix<00:06:03.800> this

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
the main way if it's probably fix this

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.189 
the main way if it's probably fix this
would<00:06:04.429> be<00:06:04.580> going<00:06:04.819> into<00:06:05.179> the<00:06:05.330> motherboard
