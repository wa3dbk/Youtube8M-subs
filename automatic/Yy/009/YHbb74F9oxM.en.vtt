have gone on in the beef cattle industry

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.850 
have gone on in the beef cattle industry
in<00:00:56.330> recent<00:00:56.659> years<00:00:56.690> of<00:00:56.989> course<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:57.500> hear<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.680> lot

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
in recent years of course you hear a lot

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.920 
in recent years of course you hear a lot
of<00:00:58.040> talk<00:00:58.220> about<00:00:58.400> genomics<00:00:59.150> and<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.390> advances

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
of talk about genomics and the advances

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.170 
of talk about genomics and the advances
there<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.890> these<00:01:01.040> genomic<00:01:01.370> tools<00:01:01.699> are<00:01:02.000> being

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
there and these genomic tools are being

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.530 
there and these genomic tools are being
integrated<00:01:03.050> into<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.330> national<00:01:05.330> sire

what<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:08.840> results<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:09.500> is<00:01:09.710> increased

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
what this results in is increased

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.610 
what this results in is increased
accuracy<00:01:10.670> of<00:01:10.940> those<00:01:11.210> epd<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.170> producers

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
accuracy of those epd so that producers

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.289 
accuracy of those epd so that producers
can<00:01:12.799> make<00:01:12.950> better<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:13.460> more<00:01:13.880> informed

can make better and more informed
decisions<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.020> that's<00:01:15.680> going<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.979> result<00:01:16.159> in

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
decisions and that's going to result in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.630 
decisions and that's going to result in
greater<00:01:16.729> genetic<00:01:17.720> progress<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.130> other<00:01:19.280> area

where technology is really going to play

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.310 
where technology is really going to play
a<00:01:21.649> big<00:01:21.950> role<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.460> our<00:01:22.909> ability<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.930> estrus

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
a big role is our ability and estrus

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.050 
a big role is our ability and estrus
synchronization<00:01:24.439> keeps<00:01:25.280> getting<00:01:25.610> better<00:01:25.789> and

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
our seed stock industry because there

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.639 
our seed stock industry because there
may<00:01:38.030> be<00:01:38.060> fewer<00:01:38.420> opportunities<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:39.439> sell

commercial bulls because commercial

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.810 
commercial bulls because commercial
producers<00:01:42.590> may<00:01:42.740> be<00:01:42.799> using<00:01:43.130> artificial

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.330 
producers may be using artificial
insemination<00:01:44.570> instead<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.590> they're<00:01:46.159> both

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
insemination instead so they're both

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.399

advances<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.450> opportunities<00:01:48.140> and

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
advances and opportunities and

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.109 
advances and opportunities and
challenges<00:01:48.649> for<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.159> seed<00:01:49.399> stock<00:01:49.640> industry

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
challenges for the seed stock industry

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.660 
challenges for the seed stock industry
as<00:01:50.210> well<00:01:50.649> so<00:01:51.649> what<00:01:51.920> are<00:01:52.100> some<00:01:52.130> other

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
as well so what are some other

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.999 
as well so what are some other
opportunities<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:53.869> you<00:01:53.990> see<00:01:54.289> coming<00:01:54.500> down

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
opportunities that you see coming down

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.940 
opportunities that you see coming down
in<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.850> future<00:01:56.179> within<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.499> the<00:01:57.770> seed

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
in the future within the in the seed

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.510 
in the future within the in the seed
stock<00:01:58.159> industry<00:01:58.729> as<00:01:58.939> a<00:01:59.030> result<00:01:59.359> of<00:01:59.509> Technology

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
stock industry as a result of Technology

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.649 
stock industry as a result of Technology
well<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.549> think<00:02:01.700> there's<00:02:02.030> going<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.240> be<00:02:02.270> some

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
well I think there's going to be some

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.310 
well I think there's going to be some
increased<00:02:03.640> specialization<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.320> we're

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
increased specialization and we're

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.840 
increased specialization and we're
learning<00:02:06.469> more<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:06.890> more<00:02:07.039> about<00:02:07.159> what<00:02:07.729> is

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
learning more and more about what is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
stock producers focus on things like

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.380 
stock producers focus on things like
producing<00:02:22.220> cattle<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.640> will<00:02:22.790> perform<00:02:23.180> well

producing cattle that will perform well

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.760 
producing cattle that will perform well
in<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.660> Mountain<00:02:23.930> West<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.470> they're<00:02:24.560> worried

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
in the Mountain West and they're worried

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.410 
in the Mountain West and they're worried
about<00:02:24.800> brisket<00:02:25.370> disease<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.000> altitude

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
about brisket disease and altitude

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.680 
about brisket disease and altitude
disease<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.900> these<00:02:27.020> types<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.380> things

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
disease and these types of things

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.400 
disease and these types of things
so<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:29.310> new<00:02:29.520> tools<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:31.200> going

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
so the new tools that we have are going

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.110 
so the new tools that we have are going
to<00:02:31.470> allow<00:02:31.680> us<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:32.130> better<00:02:32.340> study<00:02:32.790> these

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to allow us to better study these

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.360 
to allow us to better study these

why<00:02:35.880> some<00:02:35.940> bulls<00:02:36.450> perform<00:02:36.960> better<00:02:37.170> or<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
why some bulls perform better or the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.710 
why some bulls perform better or the
progeny<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.340> symbols<00:02:38.790> perform<00:02:39.240> better<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.480> one

continue to advance in that technology

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.340 
continue to advance in that technology
we<00:02:44.940> will<00:02:45.060> what<00:02:45.240> enable<00:02:45.570> producers<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.200> make

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
we will what enable producers to make

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.230 
we will what enable producers to make
better<00:02:46.530> decisions<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.430> better<00:02:47.640> suit<00:02:48.000> the

better decisions to better suit the
animals<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.080> environment<00:02:49.470> now<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.520> is

animals to the environment now this is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.130 
animals to the environment now this is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
that are specific to one environment but

question what do you see as your vision

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.940 
question what do you see as your vision
say<00:03:06.000> 10<00:03:06.360> 20<00:03:06.810> years<00:03:06.840> down<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.440> road<00:03:07.470> for<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
say 10 20 years down the road for the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.350 
say 10 20 years down the road for the
seed<00:03:08.130> stock<00:03:08.370> industry<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.150> some

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
seed stock industry do you have some

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.260 
seed stock industry do you have some
ideas<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.870> where<00:03:09.990> we<00:03:10.170> might<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:11.150> there's<00:03:12.150> going

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
ideas of where we might be there's going

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.390 
ideas of where we might be there's going
to<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.390> change<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.680> number<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.920> seed<00:03:14.190> stock

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
to be change the number of seed stock

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.340 
to be change the number of seed stock
producers<00:03:14.850> has<00:03:15.030> been<00:03:15.270> declining<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.080> think

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
producers has been declining and I think

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.620 
producers has been declining and I think
that<00:03:16.500> trend<00:03:16.800> will<00:03:16.860> continue<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.700> think<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
that trend will continue I think the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.690 
that trend will continue I think the
market<00:03:19.050> for<00:03:19.350> commercial<00:03:19.980> Bulls<00:03:20.160> has<00:03:20.430> been

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
market for commercial Bulls has been

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.060 
market for commercial Bulls has been
declining<00:03:21.090> because<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.470> decline<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:22.830> the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
declining because of a decline in the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.160 
declining because of a decline in the
number<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.340> commercial<00:03:23.580> cows<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.780> really

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
number of commercial cows but I really

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.930 
number of commercial cows but I really
see<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.500> big<00:03:25.680> challenge<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.460> the<00:03:26.490> commercial

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
see the big challenge to the commercial

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.300 
see the big challenge to the commercial
bull<00:03:27.120> market<00:03:27.540> being<00:03:27.750> what's<00:03:28.740> coming<00:03:29.100> with<00:03:29.130> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
bull market being what's coming with the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.550 
bull market being what's coming with the
AI<00:03:29.430> industry<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.720> think<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.110> commercial

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
AI industry so I think the commercial

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.470 
AI industry so I think the commercial
industry<00:03:31.680> 20<00:03:32.430> years<00:03:32.610> down<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.940> road<00:03:32.970> will<00:03:33.330> be

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
industry 20 years down the road will be

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.840 
industry 20 years down the road will be
smaller<00:03:33.840> it<00:03:34.470> will<00:03:34.860> be<00:03:35.010> technically<00:03:35.550> more

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
smaller it will be technically more

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.600 
smaller it will be technically more
advanced<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.660> will<00:03:37.200> be<00:03:37.320> more<00:03:37.560> specialized<00:03:38.160> and

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
advanced it will be more specialized and

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.400 
advanced it will be more specialized and
I<00:03:38.760> think<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> seed<00:03:39.390> stock<00:03:39.600> producers<00:03:40.080> today

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
I think the seed stock producers today

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.780 
I think the seed stock producers today
need<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.800> start<00:03:41.010> thinking<00:03:41.070> towards

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
need to start thinking towards

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.420 
need to start thinking towards
positioning<00:03:42.450> themselves<00:03:42.660> in<00:03:43.250> certain<00:03:44.250> areas

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
positioning themselves in certain areas

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.580 
positioning themselves in certain areas
that<00:03:45.239> will<00:03:45.360> allow<00:03:45.600> them<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.959> continue<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.470> be

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
that will allow them to continue to be

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.650 
that will allow them to continue to be
successful<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:47.880> may<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.270> to<00:03:48.420> start

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
successful and we may have to start

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.840 
successful and we may have to start
thinking<00:03:48.870> about<00:03:49.020> different<00:03:49.380> models<00:03:50.190> economic

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
thinking about different models economic

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.530 
thinking about different models economic
models<00:03:51.239> for<00:03:51.540> how<00:03:51.800> we<00:03:52.800> sustain<00:03:53.760> our<00:03:53.970> systems<00:03:54.390> in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
models for how we sustain our systems in
