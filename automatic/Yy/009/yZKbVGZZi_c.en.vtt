00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
would be C G and then after the c e g

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
would be C G and then after the c e g
you<00:00:49.860> go<00:00:50.039> G<00:00:50.760> D<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.010> after<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.520> go<00:00:53.640> D

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
and then you basically just sift your

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
and then you basically just sift your
hands<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.890> note<00:01:08.100> after<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
hands down one note after this and you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.920 
hands down one note after this and you
go<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> you're<00:01:11.909> playing<00:01:12.060> C<00:01:12.479> F<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.930> afterward

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
go so you're playing C F in a afterward

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
go so you're playing C F in a afterward
so<00:01:16.409> throwing<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.310> all<00:01:17.400> together<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:18.090> fairly

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so throwing it all together it's fairly

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.960 
so throwing it all together it's fairly
simple<00:01:18.659> I'll<00:01:18.930> go<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.409> more<00:01:19.560> time

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
simple I'll go over it one more time

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:43.999 
simple I'll go over it one more time
just<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.409> safe<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.780> why<00:01:43.590> playing<00:01:43.890> these

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
just to be safe and why playing these

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.649 
just to be safe and why playing these
keys<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.310> also<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:45.030> course<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
keys are also of course don't need to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.179 
keys are also of course don't need to
play<00:01:45.750> keys<00:01:45.990> down<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.799> left<00:01:46.979> hand
