it's not going to do much for you but if
you<00:04:15.490> really<00:04:15.790> try<00:04:16.360> to<00:04:16.390> find<00:04:16.660> out<00:04:16.780> why<00:04:17.110> you're

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
you really try to find out why you're

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.140 
you really try to find out why you're
playing<00:04:17.590> poker<00:04:17.920> how<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.340> want<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.820> play<00:04:18.940> and

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
playing poker how you want to play and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.400 
playing poker how you want to play and
create<00:04:19.390> your<00:04:19.480> mantra<00:04:19.840> from<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.140> it<00:04:20.290> will<00:04:20.380> be

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
create your mantra from that it will be

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.680 
create your mantra from that it will be
much<00:04:20.799> more<00:04:21.010> effective<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.060> for<00:04:22.330> example<00:04:22.360> if

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
much more effective so for example if

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.360 
much more effective so for example if
you<00:04:22.840> want<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.110> play<00:04:23.290> aggressive<00:04:24.100> and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
you want to play aggressive and

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.850 
you want to play aggressive and
controlled<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:26.350> would<00:04:26.470> be<00:04:26.590> your<00:04:26.710> mantra

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
controlled that would be your mantra

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.220 
controlled that would be your mantra
right<00:04:27.430> aggressive<00:04:28.210> in<00:04:28.330> control<00:04:28.660> aggressive

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
right aggressive in control aggressive

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.810 
right aggressive in control aggressive
and<00:04:29.380> control<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:29.890> if<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.040> keep<00:04:30.250> reminding

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
and control so if you keep reminding

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.460 
and control so if you keep reminding
yourself<00:04:30.880> that<00:04:31.300> saying<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.990> over<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.320> over

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
yourself that saying it over and over

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.050 
yourself that saying it over and over
again<00:04:32.740> you're<00:04:33.490> going<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.670> start<00:04:33.850> believing

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
again you're going to start believing

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.900 
again you're going to start believing
and<00:04:34.660> acting<00:04:35.170> like<00:04:35.680> that<00:04:35.950> right<00:04:36.250> it's<00:04:36.580> much

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
and acting like that right it's much

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.420 
and acting like that right it's much
more<00:04:37.120> specific<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.170> rather<00:04:38.830> than<00:04:38.980> I'm<00:04:39.400> a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
more specific to you rather than I'm a

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.030 
more specific to you rather than I'm a
good<00:04:39.670> poker<00:04:40.030> player<00:04:40.060> or<00:04:40.770> you<00:04:41.770> know<00:04:41.860> I'm

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
good poker player or you know I'm

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.710 
good poker player or you know I'm
mathematically<00:04:42.760> correct<00:04:43.150> because<00:04:43.390> that's

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
mathematically correct because that's

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.200 
mathematically correct because that's
still<00:04:44.440> too<00:04:44.620> broad<00:04:44.890> you<00:04:45.160> know<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:45.490> maybe<00:04:46.060> I

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
still too broad you know like maybe I

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.630 
still too broad you know like maybe I
pay<00:04:46.900> attention<00:04:46.930> to<00:04:47.290> pods<00:04:47.800> or<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.550> know

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
pay attention to pods or you know

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.040 
pay attention to pods or you know
something<00:04:48.820> really<00:04:49.180> specific<00:04:49.420> to<00:04:49.840> how<00:04:49.990> you

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
something really specific to how you

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.470 
something really specific to how you
want<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.560> play<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:51.100> becomes<00:04:51.880> your<00:04:52.000> mantra

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
want to play that becomes your mantra

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.630 
want to play that becomes your mantra
and<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.320> that<00:04:53.590> can<00:04:53.740> actually<00:04:53.860> tie<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.340> circle

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
and so that can actually tie in a circle

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.100 
and so that can actually tie in a circle
breathing<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.150> so<00:04:55.270> what<00:04:55.420> I<00:04:55.450> like<00:04:55.660> people<00:04:55.900> to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
breathing and so what I like people to

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.590 
breathing and so what I like people to
say<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.620> there<00:04:57.070> inhaling<00:04:57.910> their<00:04:58.060> mantra<00:04:58.240> so

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
say is there inhaling their mantra so

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.290
