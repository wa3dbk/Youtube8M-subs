like<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:20.430> all<00:05:21.430> right<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:22.780> our<00:05:22.810> chords<00:05:23.500> are<00:05:23.680> a

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
like that all right so our chords are a

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.080 
like that all right so our chords are a
minor

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
minor

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.660
