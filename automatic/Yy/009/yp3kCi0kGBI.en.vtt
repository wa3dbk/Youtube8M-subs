00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello and welcome to the shop 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.150
 the picture today I introduced you 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.910
 the special edition pack the return of the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.889
 duelist with machines of 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.309
 magicians of megaliths but especially a 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.100
 golem then as usual in the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.400
 bins special edition of our little 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 cardboard producers of the aforementioned edition 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.300
 so the return of ulysses the last 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.400
 bio action one of the two variant cards 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.489
 so here it is either a map 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:39.210
 simple either from a map x hills of 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:41.640
 pages we have the striker and the map x6 so 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 it's a new 30 can even 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.550
 as well as the phrase removed from 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.670
 plastic to reflect So here she is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.390
 it is a x6 top of level 3 in front of 3 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.010
 per year rock xxi effect it takes two 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 Level 3 monsters for carpeting 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.609
 so I call you back to invoke a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.320
 x6 you have to have monsters there 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.550
 are level 3 requests have them 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.870
 same on the other and we had 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.439
 directly shows it here since 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 extranet 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.540
 during your stand by phase detach a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.549
 hardware ixis of this card or receive 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.200
 two draws tip damage you can only 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.720
 not specially summon monsters 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.880
 as long as this card does not have hardware 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.890
 x ismail not attacking but especially his 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.920
 big force what she at 3000 attack 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.320
 and 3000 defense so what happens on 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 will see 2003 we will end up with a 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.720
 mosquito 6 2 in three with 3000 attack 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 already on the tax his opponent once 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 twice with silva not the defenses 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.020
 consequent we will have started well its 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.720
 points of life against the negative effect 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.030
 if she has more material x6 we receive 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.369
 1000 points of damage to the stand by 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.120
 phase so usually once we have it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.010
 attacked twice we are good either 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.630
 the simple finances to the blind France 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.160
 offside for wasted trout either with 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.620
 creatures either for the birthday and 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.450
 so it is he who benefits from this effect 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:04.280
 who lose 2010 that means very 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:07.370
 interesting then magic dolls is connected 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.080
 magic punch now me I give I 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.080
 am profession so the archetypes of 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.780
 prophecy magic touch 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.290
 ah bah always wanted to see at the time his 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.080
 covedettes inbox number 33 umag matches 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.990
 noval cro so a number like 2009 to 30 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.330
 this is a v6 light in front of 5 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.720
 it takes two simple level monsters for 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.310
 the carpet 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.930
 once a lap you detach a 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.280
 material exists from this map for 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.990
 target a world do rather than 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.340
 prepare your opponent to inflict 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.630
 damage to our opponent who commits 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.860
 difference between his original attack 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.330
 and his current attack 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.740
 if you do this this range this 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.050
 card wins an ideal attack for 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.660
 damage inflicted to 2400 points the cac 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.660
 so the clubs we have two options and the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.130
 chronicle reumann chrono ball 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.000
 majid hunch very well that a super has 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.730
 so a third magic mixes 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.680
 alchemical magician of rank 4 notes he 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.350
 must 3 in this time little magician 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.060
 level 4 for the lawyer this 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.560
 guardian 200 attacks for each card 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.840
 maginot lake saint pierre once a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.610
 turn during your hate phase for 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.440
 detach a materialist from this map 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.860
 and sent a card from the other - 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.360
 graveyard 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.800
 I was doing a magic card since your 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.680
 deck more laid there in your cards area 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.750
 magic trap 1500 attacks a symphony 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.070
 so allow all our promo card 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.610
 and in the three scorers but a 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.420
 superb and she works in reaction the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.959
 testament that the second axis to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.959
 daily 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.560
 it chatters with the tenderness lost to 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.360
 so test the card five very rockets 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.730
 wanted because we could see it 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.349
 just by winning while waiting for them 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.690
 best big big tournaments to 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.660
 the time is the first time she 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.379
 was like that in attack 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.510
 so it's a synchro of water 5 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.489
 we need a tuner and we invent 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.319
 forbidden at most a magician 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.150
 when a monster is invoked by 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.829
 synchronization hide a card 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.440
 this card may be facing somewhat 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.940
 save 1 to activate solve and so 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.010
 2000 cases of taxes but the two defenses 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.780
 so in an act and I'm really trying 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.729
 great the same we can use it 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.590
 in most dec where there is not bad 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:28.350
 of sync also the opponent is making 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:31.470
 five robots and it's still magical 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.570
 mytouch that evil we gave the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.570
 material just now nÃ®mes Thursday you 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:41.669
 can sign a second magic success 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.950
 the prophecy magic book of the 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.169
 wisdom so that for bishop prophecies 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.150
 it's still the carabins 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.620
 we are happy to have these peaks targeted 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.479
 to the little wizards because everything about 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.889
 the terrain is activated its effects 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.820
 turns is not affected by the prefect 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.449
 imagine that for us is not 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:02.499
 affected by the effects of traps 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:06.770
 wizard to have something 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:08.599
