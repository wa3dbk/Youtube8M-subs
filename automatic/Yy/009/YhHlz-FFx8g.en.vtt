00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.410 
34% speed now this is really useful
because<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:23.100> only<00:02:23.280> way<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> tell<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.180> stuff

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
because the only way to tell this stuff

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.390 
because the only way to tell this stuff
before<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.049> was<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.530> sit<00:02:25.739> here<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.040> jump

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
before it was just to sit here and jump

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.910 
before it was just to sit here and jump
and<00:02:26.579> be<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.820> yeah<00:02:27.359> seems<00:02:27.780> like<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.140> jump<00:02:28.650> is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
and be like yeah seems like that jump is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.759 
and be like yeah seems like that jump is
better<00:02:29.310> than<00:02:29.609> this<00:02:29.970> jump<00:02:30.390> over<00:02:30.780> here<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.410> think

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
better than this jump over here I think

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.620 
better than this jump over here I think
well<00:02:32.370> maybe<00:02:32.579> I<00:02:32.670> just<00:02:32.940> did<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.209> wrong<00:02:33.390> or

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
well maybe I just did it wrong or

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.360 
well maybe I just did it wrong or
something<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.680> now<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.859> actually<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.250> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
something so now you actually have a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.500 
something so now you actually have a
quantifiable

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
quantifiable

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.539 
quantifiable
way<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> whole<00:02:38.280> bunch<00:02:38.459> of

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
way to do it I have a whole bunch of

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.130 
way to do it I have a whole bunch of
forces<00:02:38.850> over<00:02:39.000> here<00:02:39.180> oops<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.780> let<00:02:40.049> me<00:02:40.109> just

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
forces over here oops and let me just

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.890 
forces over here oops and let me just
jump<00:02:40.560> off<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:40.829> my<00:02:41.250> my<00:02:42.180> house<00:02:42.359> here<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.780> just

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
jump off of my my house here and just

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.710 
jump off of my my house here and just
hurt<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.290> hurt<00:02:43.530> myself<00:02:43.709> all<00:02:44.070> over<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.730> it's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
hurt and hurt myself all over and it's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.690 
hurt and hurt myself all over and it's
good<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.140> note<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.769> need<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.549> your

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
good to note that you need to have your

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.220 
good to note that you need to have your
horse<00:02:47.940> tame<00:02:48.269> so<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.540> have<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.840> horse<00:02:49.079> who

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
horse tame so I have this horse who

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.199 
horse tame so I have this horse who
which<00:02:49.410> isn't<00:02:49.650> tamed<00:02:50.130> at<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> moment<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.850> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
which isn't tamed at the moment and you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.960 
which isn't tamed at the moment and you
can't<00:02:51.570> open<00:02:51.810> up<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.320> horse's<00:02:52.650> inventory<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
can't open up the horse's inventory to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
can't open up the horse's inventory to
look<00:02:54.180> at<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.600> horse<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.230> have<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.769> go

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
look at the horse so you have to go

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.250 
look at the horse so you have to go
through<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.400> process<00:02:56.640> of<00:02:57.120> taming<00:02:57.599> horse<00:02:58.050> in

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
through the process of taming horse in

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.460 
through the process of taming horse in
order<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.190> see<00:02:59.489> the<00:03:00.269> stats<00:03:00.569> but<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.959> do<00:03:01.080> have

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
order to see the stats but I do have

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.660 
order to see the stats but I do have
right<00:03:01.709> here<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.010> donkey

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
right here this donkey

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.230 
right here this donkey
and<00:03:02.910> it's<00:03:03.720> good<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.080> note<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.260> his<00:03:04.590> health<00:03:04.890> is

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
and it's good to note that his health is

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.740 
and it's good to note that his health is
zero<00:03:06.650> so<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.310> donkey<00:03:08.640> may<00:03:09.060> not<00:03:09.330> be<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
zero so this this donkey may not be the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.430 
zero so this this donkey may not be the
best<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:11.010> I'm<00:03:11.580> wanting<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
best if I'm wanting to have like a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.620 
best if I'm wanting to have like a
really<00:03:13.740> really<00:03:14.010> useful<00:03:14.340> steed<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.510> have

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
really really useful steed and we have

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.660 
really really useful steed and we have
just<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:15.959> few<00:03:15.990> others<00:03:16.470> where<00:03:16.950> his<00:03:17.130> health<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.520> at

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
just a few others where his health is at

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.430 
just a few others where his health is at
sixteen<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.240> can<00:03:18.390> see<00:03:18.540> lots<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.959> hearts<00:03:19.200> over

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
sixteen you can see lots of hearts over

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.510 
sixteen you can see lots of hearts over
there<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.000> one<00:03:21.000> more<00:03:21.330> where<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:23.100> is<00:03:23.220> kind<00:03:23.430> of

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
there and one more where this is kind of

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.699 
there and one more where this is kind of
average<00:03:23.940> except<00:03:24.330> for<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> speed<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.260> he<00:03:25.470> seems

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
average except for the speed so he seems

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.250 
average except for the speed so he seems
to<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> much<00:03:26.400> faster<00:03:26.910> horse<00:03:27.360> than<00:03:27.720> all<00:03:27.959> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
