00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
it is quite pricey to do this detox I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.610 
it is quite pricey to do this detox I
mean<00:03:01.400> eating<00:03:02.360> organic<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.170> eating<00:03:03.440> only

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
mean eating organic and eating only

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.400 
mean eating organic and eating only
fruits<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.250> vegetables<00:03:04.700> is<00:03:05.090> actually<00:03:05.990> pretty

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
fruits and vegetables is actually pretty

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.090 
fruits and vegetables is actually pretty
expensive<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:08.350> I'm<00:03:09.350> keeping<00:03:09.560> my<00:03:09.770> fingers

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
expensive so I'm keeping my fingers

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.190 
expensive so I'm keeping my fingers
crossed<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:11.120> actually<00:03:11.630> is<00:03:11.750> beneficial

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
crossed that this actually is beneficial

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.830 
crossed that this actually is beneficial
and<00:03:12.740> that<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.700> know<00:03:13.820> after<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.300> first<00:03:14.540> week

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
and that you know after this first week

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.930 
and that you know after this first week
of<00:03:15.020> nine<00:03:15.710> pounds<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.160> water<00:03:16.370> weight<00:03:16.520> coming
