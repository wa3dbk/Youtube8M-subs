00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
gonna have to go to a firing range of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.810 
gonna have to go to a firing range of
this<00:00:33.210> things<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.540> wanted<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> feed<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.820> let's

they<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.350> give<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> person<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.730> some

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
they can give like a person and some

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.189 
they can give like a person and some
padding<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:54.780> stouter<00:00:55.050> than

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
padding but it's actually stouter than

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.810 
padding but it's actually stouter than
Evalia<00:00:55.590> belly<00:00:55.920> would<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.219> much<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.699> than

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
Evalia belly would get much more than

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
Evalia belly would get much more than
that<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.270> let's<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that so let's see what we can do with a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.899 
that so let's see what we can do with a
sword<00:00:59.219> here<00:01:04.070> I'm<00:01:05.070> gonna<00:01:05.250> say<00:01:05.400> we'll<00:01:05.580> cut<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
sword here I'm gonna say we'll cut it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.550 
sword here I'm gonna say we'll cut it
first<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> already<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.170> not<00:01:07.260> going

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
first but I already know it's not going

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
first but I already know it's not going
to<00:01:07.650> cut<00:01:07.830> through<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:10.880> yeah<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
axe to it see if we can go through it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.800 
axe to it see if we can go through it
with<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:37.670> let's<00:01:38.670> all<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.000> hands<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.600> for
