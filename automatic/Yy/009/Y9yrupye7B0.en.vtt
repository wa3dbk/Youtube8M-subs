half an inning that would make you come

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.290 
half an inning that would make you come
all<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.320> way<00:01:35.350> from<00:01:35.500> Iowa<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.789> talk<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.180> me

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
all the way from Iowa to talk to me

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.400 
all the way from Iowa to talk to me
about<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.720> fifty<00:01:38.170> years<00:01:38.380> after<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.800> happened<00:01:39.190> I

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
about it fifty years after it happened I

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.060 
about it fifty years after it happened I
didn't<00:01:41.410> really<00:01:41.679> know<00:01:41.860> till<00:01:42.100> just<00:01:42.130> now<00:01:42.460> but<00:01:42.910> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
didn't really know till just now but I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.100 
didn't really know till just now but I
think<00:01:45.070> it's<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.460> ask<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:46.000> if<00:01:46.179> you<00:01:46.330> could<00:01:46.539> do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
think it's to ask you if you could do

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.850 
think it's to ask you if you could do
anything<00:01:47.350> you<00:01:47.530> wanted<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.119> could<00:01:49.270> have<00:01:49.420> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
anything you wanted if you could have a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.810 
anything you wanted if you could have a
wish

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.870
