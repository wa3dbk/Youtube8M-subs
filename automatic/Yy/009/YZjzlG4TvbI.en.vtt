00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.980
 sony alpha camera line with a 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.500
 challenging purpose produce the commercial 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.200
 of television that you just saw 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.210
 We are in the company of Ricardo ManÃ¡ Veil 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.900
 one of the two directors of photography 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.390
 for the 2012 advertising campaign of 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.970
 sony alpha for latin america 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.430
 Ricardo welcome and thanks for being 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.080
 with us today before 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.570
 work with this project 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.310
 you knew that sony had products in the 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.930
 segment of good and solid dslr cameras 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.060
 but I had never had the opportunity 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.910
 of appeal but what model 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:19.450
 you worked with the sony alpha to 37 to 57 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.669
 of the 77 what do you think is the 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.020
 feature that was most called the 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.900
 model attention to 37 imagine that 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.650
 in a take on a thousand things and throw to the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.200
 light the talent acting the sound and 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.610
 that in making the talent actor 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.770
 he has to be a little bit all the time 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.100
 good since you do not have to worry 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.710
 by the focus you can focus on the 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.379
 more important things or in case 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.080
 example are you a dad 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.969
 in a sport or playing an instrument and 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.770
 The only thing that matters to you is having the 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:57.400
 take in focus and you do not have to 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.620
 worry about the technical details how 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.930
 do it and another thing you think is 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.080
 important to highlight your experience 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.719

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.870
 good the quality of the image of 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:13.300
 print look for weather issues 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.759
 we were forced to run under the 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.349
 rain in almost every shot so 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:21.039
 that we had to support the scenes with 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:24.370
 lament teams of alignment and but 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:27.159
 the results were urbanists and 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.750
 we enjoy a world for example in this 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:32.379
 scene the child was under a 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:36.219
 umbrella we had passed a storm and 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:39.879
