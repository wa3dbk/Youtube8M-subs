my living room into a photo studio so
the<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.350> thing<00:00:16.440> i<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.220> set<00:00:17.730> up

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.189 
the first thing i have to do is set up
my<00:00:18.000> backdrop<00:00:18.830> which<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.070> quite<00:00:20.850> large<00:00:21.199> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
my backdrop which is quite large it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.320 
my backdrop which is quite large it
basically<00:00:22.590> fills<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.340> entire<00:00:23.880> living<00:00:24.180> room

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
for this particular headshot i wanted to

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
for this particular headshot i wanted to
use<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> black<00:00:32.460> background<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.120> i<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.510> white

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
use a black background so i use my white

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.560 
use a black background so i use my white
vinyl<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.770> main<00:00:35.270> backdrop<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:36.510> i

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
vinyl as the main backdrop and then i

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
vinyl as the main backdrop and then i
used<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.930> black<00:00:37.320> muslin<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> front<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
used a black muslin in front of that

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.299 
used a black muslin in front of that
just<00:00:39.329> because<00:00:39.840> i<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.379> some<00:00:40.950> windows

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
just because i have a some windows

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.160 
just because i have a some windows
behind<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.120> blinds<00:00:42.480> closed<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
behind it in with the blinds closed the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
behind it in with the blinds closed the
light<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.800> shine<00:00:43.829> through<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.520> black<00:00:44.730> muzzle

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
light can shine through the black muzzle

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.770 
light can shine through the black muzzle
it's<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.510> cheap<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.489> white<00:00:48.030> helps

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it's really cheap so the white helps

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.750 
it's really cheap so the white helps
protect<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.770> nothing<00:00:50.070> bleeds<00:00:50.430> through

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
protect that so nothing bleeds through

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.330 
protect that so nothing bleeds through
my<00:00:50.940> black<00:00:51.180> background<00:00:51.829> then<00:00:52.829> i<00:00:52.860> set<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.309> my

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
my black background then i set up my

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.950 
my black background then i set up my
lights<00:00:53.789> i<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.199> soft<00:00:55.500> boxes<00:00:56.010> behind<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
lights i have two soft boxes behind and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.110

my<00:00:57.960> main<00:00:58.199> key<00:00:58.530> light<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> giant's<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.820> think

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
my main key light is a giant's I think

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.329 
my main key light is a giant's I think
it's<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> 60-inch<00:01:00.750> umbrella<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> used<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.649 
it's a 60-inch umbrella then I used a
basically<00:01:05.339> built<00:01:05.700> myself<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.330> light

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
started shooting I was decided to use my

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.480 
started shooting I was decided to use my
24<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> 72<00:01:51.270> eight<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.649> we're<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.159> doing<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
24 to 72 eight and we're just doing a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.550 
24 to 72 eight and we're just doing a
head<00:01:53.729> shot<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.240> pretty<00:01:54.540> much<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:54.990> 50

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
head shot as pretty much at about 50

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.749 
head shot as pretty much at about 50
millimeters<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.490> i<00:01:56.549> probably

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
millimeters with this so i probably

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.990 
millimeters with this so i probably
could<00:01:57.000> use<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.299> 51<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:59.040> 24<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.670> 70

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
could use my 51 for but the 24 to 70

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.920 
could use my 51 for but the 24 to 70
gave<00:02:00.180> me<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.540> bit

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
gave me a little bit

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.090 
gave me a little bit
range<00:02:01.230> I<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.920> was<00:02:02.040> around<00:02:02.340> f<00:02:02.730> 10<00:02:03.380> 12<00:02:04.380> 15<00:02:04.740> of

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
range I think I was around f 10 12 15 of

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.330 
range I think I was around f 10 12 15 of
a<00:02:05.130> second<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.470> iso<00:02:07.470> 100<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:10.530> between<00:02:10.679> each

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
a second and iso 100 so in between each

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.330 
a second and iso 100 so in between each
like<00:02:12.030> shirt<00:02:12.780> change<00:02:13.170> really<00:02:13.560> did<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:13.770> couple<00:02:13.980> I

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
like shirt change really did a couple I

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.330 
like shirt change really did a couple I
would<00:02:14.790> put<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.300> photos<00:02:16.200> into<00:02:16.530> my<00:02:16.650> computer<00:02:16.830> so

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
would put the photos into my computer so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.410 
would put the photos into my computer so
then<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:17.550> can<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.270> quicker<00:02:18.720> when<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.140> ended

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
then we can do it quicker when we ended

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.620 
then we can do it quicker when we ended
and<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:22.010> shot<00:02:23.010> not<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:23.940> many<00:02:24.090> shot<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.450> think

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and we shot not that many shot I think

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.330 
and we shot not that many shot I think
we<00:02:24.690> shot<00:02:24.810> about<00:02:24.990> 60<00:02:25.530> shots<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.010> we<00:02:26.070> got<00:02:26.220> what

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
we shot about 60 shots and we got what

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.140 
we shot about 60 shots and we got what
we<00:02:26.430> wanted<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> once<00:02:28.920> we<00:02:29.070> got<00:02:29.220> all<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.550> these

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
we wanted so once we got all of these

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.000 
we wanted so once we got all of these
shots<00:02:30.390> completed<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.260> brought<00:02:31.590> them<00:02:31.740> into<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
shots completed I brought them into the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.979 
shots completed I brought them into the
computer<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.550> then<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.940> did<00:02:33.120> my<00:02:33.150> typical<00:02:33.810> like

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
computer and then I did my typical like

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.050 
computer and then I did my typical like
sorting<00:02:34.650> method<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:36.230> did<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.470> really<00:02:38.130> basic<00:02:38.430> edit

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
sorting method I did a really basic edit

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.110 
sorting method I did a really basic edit
just<00:02:39.920> simple<00:02:40.920> stuff<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.550> had<00:02:41.700> dropped<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
just simple stuff I had dropped the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.030 
just simple stuff I had dropped the
black<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.050> background<00:02:43.650> faded<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.010> black

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
black so the background faded to black

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.949 
black so the background faded to black
something<00:02:44.520> my<00:02:45.120> brother<00:02:45.180> could<00:02:45.510> see<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:45.870> was

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
something my brother could see what was

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.440 
something my brother could see what was
going<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:47.489> then<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.880> started<00:02:48.270> at<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
going on and then I started at the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750 
going on and then I started at the
beginning<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.709> cycled<00:02:50.010> through<00:02:50.280> each

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
beginning and I cycled through each

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760 
beginning and I cycled through each
image<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.630> my<00:02:51.750> brother<00:02:51.989> set<00:02:52.410> next<00:02:52.650> to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
image and I have my brother set next to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.220 
image and I have my brother set next to
me<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.100> say<00:02:53.370> yes<00:02:54.150> or<00:02:54.420> no<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.690> each<00:02:55.020> one

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
me and say yes or no to each one

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.650 
me and say yes or no to each one
basically<00:02:55.590> thumbs<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.100> thumbs<00:02:56.280> down<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.970> likes

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
basically thumbs up thumbs down it likes

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.050 
basically thumbs up thumbs down it likes
it<00:02:57.870> doesn't<00:02:58.350> like<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.730> when<00:03:00.030> he

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
it doesn't like it and then when he

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.060 
it doesn't like it and then when he
liked<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.110> would<00:03:01.200> give<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.620> rating<00:03:01.860> of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
liked one I would give it a rating of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.699 
liked one I would give it a rating of
three<00:03:02.489> we<00:03:02.940> go<00:03:03.120> through<00:03:03.330> all<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.230> pictures

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
three we go through all of the pictures

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.550 
three we go through all of the pictures
and<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.120> was<00:03:06.209> our<00:03:06.269> first<00:03:06.630> pass<00:03:06.930> leading<00:03:07.320> out

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
and that was our first pass leading out

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.170 
and that was our first pass leading out
the<00:03:07.590> ones<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:07.980> did<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.340> blinks<00:03:08.940> or

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the ones we did like blinks or

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.380 
the ones we did like blinks or
expressions<00:03:10.080> or<00:03:10.200> something<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:10.620> didn't<00:03:10.860> like

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
expressions or something we didn't like

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.680 
expressions or something we didn't like
so<00:03:12.390> then<00:03:12.570> next<00:03:13.500> after<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.549> would<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:15.060> sub

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
so then next after that I would I sub

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.650 
so then next after that I would I sub
sorted<00:03:16.080> all<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:17.130> radiant<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.510> we're

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
sorted all of that to a radiant so we're

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.990 
sorted all of that to a radiant so we're
only<00:03:18.780> seeing<00:03:19.110> ones<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.650> liked<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.190> then

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
only seeing ones that you liked and then

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.390 
only seeing ones that you liked and then
we'll<00:03:21.209> go<00:03:21.330> through<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.900> second<00:03:22.739> pass<00:03:22.950> we'll

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
we'll go through a second pass we'll

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.830 
we'll go through a second pass we'll
look<00:03:23.519> at<00:03:23.670> each<00:03:23.850> one<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.060> those<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.450> know<00:03:24.510> pick

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
look at each one of those you know pick

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360 
look at each one of those you know pick
the<00:03:24.989> ones<00:03:25.140> he<00:03:25.290> likes<00:03:25.470> even<00:03:25.860> more<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.220> give

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
the ones he likes even more and I give

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.520 
the ones he likes even more and I give
those<00:03:26.459> already<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.850> four<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.390> then<00:03:28.200> once<00:03:28.410> we

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
those already in a four and then once we

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.140 
those already in a four and then once we
get<00:03:28.620> through<00:03:28.769> all<00:03:28.890> those<00:03:29.070> all<00:03:29.400> sub<00:03:29.760> sort<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
get through all those all sub sort the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.520 
get through all those all sub sort the
fours<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:30.840> we'll<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.170> again<00:03:31.260> we're

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
fours and then we'll do it again we're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.110 
fours and then we'll do it again we're
going<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.920> devise<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.610> usually<00:03:32.760> knows

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
going to devise and that usually knows

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.350 
going to devise and that usually knows
it<00:03:33.299> down<00:03:33.420> about<00:03:33.570> ten<00:03:34.140> shots<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:35.070> are<00:03:35.360> really

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
it down about ten shots that are really

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.440 
it down about ten shots that are really
the<00:03:36.480> keepers<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:38.459> then<00:03:38.730> we'll<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.150> through

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
the keepers and then we'll go through

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.360 
the keepers and then we'll go through
and<00:03:39.720> we'll<00:03:39.930> examine<00:03:40.110> each<00:03:40.590> one<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.920> those<00:03:41.130> i'll

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and we'll examine each one of those i'll

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.840 
and we'll examine each one of those i'll
do<00:03:41.489> some<00:03:41.700> more<00:03:42.239> extensive<00:03:42.870> edits<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.950> those

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
do some more extensive edits and those

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.030 
do some more extensive edits and those
are<00:03:45.000> like<00:03:45.209> my<00:03:45.390> final<00:03:45.810> proofs<00:03:46.170> i'll<00:03:46.560> send<00:03:46.860> those

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
are like my final proofs i'll send those

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.120 
are like my final proofs i'll send those
