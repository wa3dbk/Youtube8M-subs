again for the antenna where's ipod touch
is<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:44.650> aluminum<00:02:45.520> all<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.760> way<00:02:45.850> around<00:02:48.209> then

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
is this aluminum all the way around then

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.930 
is this aluminum all the way around then
both<00:02:49.450> have<00:02:49.750> orange<00:02:50.410> screens<00:02:50.770> with<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> same

both have orange screens with the same

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.910 
both have orange screens with the same

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.060 
resolution so it's the new 16 by 9
resolution<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.690> still<00:02:55.989> retina<00:02:56.410> so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
resolution and it is still retina so

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.970 
resolution and it is still retina so
it's<00:02:57.600> quite<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.310> clever<00:03:00.310> viewing<00:03:00.760> experience

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
