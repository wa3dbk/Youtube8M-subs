been<00:02:25.590> successful<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.580> iodine<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
been successful I think in iodine and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.330 
been successful I think in iodine and
we're<00:02:27.810> ahead<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.260> many<00:02:28.410> other<00:02:28.680> micronutrients

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
we're ahead of many other micronutrients

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
we're ahead of many other micronutrients
in<00:02:29.430> terms<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.790> global<00:02:29.940> progress<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.810> because

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
in terms of global progress is because

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.530 
in terms of global progress is because
we<00:02:31.680> do<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.100> common<00:02:32.580> shared<00:02:32.820> metric<00:02:33.330> that's

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
we do have a common shared metric that's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.420 
we do have a common shared metric that's
robust<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:35.240> can<00:02:36.240> be<00:02:36.390> widely<00:02:36.870> applied<00:02:37.290> but<00:02:38.160> one

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
robust and can be widely applied but one

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.790 
robust and can be widely applied but one
of<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.670> things<00:02:38.700> when<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.360> comes<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.840> any<00:02:40.560> kind

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
of the things when it comes to any kind

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.160 
of the things when it comes to any kind

of data collection is paying attention
to<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.410> quality<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.460> believe

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
to the quality can you really believe

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.370 
to the quality can you really believe
what<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.420> find<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.960> have<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.170> confidence

what you find and have the confidence

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.250 
what you find and have the confidence
that<00:02:46.710> you're<00:02:47.430> basing<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> program<00:02:48.510> design<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that you're basing a program design on a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.380 
that you're basing a program design on a
clear<00:02:50.040> understanding<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.970> couple<00:02:51.300> of

clear understanding of a couple of

clear understanding of a couple of
things<00:02:51.630> trying<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.380> make<00:02:52.920> sure<00:02:52.950> we<00:02:53.610> have

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
things trying to make sure we have

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.990 
things trying to make sure we have
quality<00:02:54.780> data<00:02:54.990> coming<00:02:55.890> from<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.370> lab<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.790> very

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
quality data coming from the lab is very

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.680 
quality data coming from the lab is very
important<00:02:57.570> because<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.590> based<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:59.160> that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
important because it is based on that

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.720 
important because it is based on that
measurement<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.840> we<00:03:00.900> decide<00:03:01.590> which<00:03:02.220> period

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
measurement that we decide which period

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.150 
measurement that we decide which period
is<00:03:03.030> good<00:03:03.360> which<00:03:03.900> breathing<00:03:04.350> techniques<00:03:04.920> to

are in the correct charge we put

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.090 
are in the correct charge we put
sometimes<00:03:14.580> too<00:03:14.790> much<00:03:15.260> emphasis<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
sometimes too much emphasis in the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.699 
sometimes too much emphasis in the
equipment<00:03:17.850> when<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:19.020> need<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.290> put<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.560> more

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
equipment when we need to put in more

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.160 
equipment when we need to put in more
emphasis<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.459> how<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.570> sampling<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
emphasis in how to do the sampling and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.470 
emphasis in how to do the sampling and
now<00:03:22.830> we<00:03:22.890> have<00:03:23.040> really<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.700> go<00:03:23.910> into<00:03:24.120> more

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
now we have really to go into more

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.470 
now we have really to go into more
remote<00:03:24.870> areas<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.590> work<00:03:26.459> with<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.270> people

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
remote areas and work with the people

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.120 
remote areas and work with the people
they<00:03:27.810> are<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.170> measure<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.709> baseline

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
they are and measure the baseline

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.640 
they are and measure the baseline
nutrient<00:03:29.760> status<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.900> can<00:03:31.080> only<00:03:31.290> do

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
nutrient status but that you can only do

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.820 
nutrient status but that you can only do
if<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.489> have<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.150> equipment<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.290> machinery

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
if you have the equipment the machinery

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.190 
if you have the equipment the machinery
that<00:03:34.950> can<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.430> can<00:03:35.640> take<00:03:35.910> into<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.390> field<00:03:36.630> so

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
that can you can take into the field so

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.229 
that can you can take into the field so
for<00:03:37.560> me<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.950> think<00:03:38.250> quantification<00:03:39.120> is

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
for me I think quantification is

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.610 
for me I think quantification is
important<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.959> number<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.470> different

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
important for a number of different

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.949 
important for a number of different
reasons<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.370> brings<00:03:41.670> greater<00:03:42.060> clarity<00:03:42.510> I

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
reasons it brings greater clarity I

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.770 
reasons it brings greater clarity I
think<00:03:43.800> both<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.730> program<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.390> understand

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
think both for the program to understand

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.080 
think both for the program to understand
where<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.190> be<00:03:47.459> able<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.820> improve

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
where it is and to be able to improve

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.090 
where it is and to be able to improve
its<00:03:48.300> performance<00:03:48.450> that<00:03:49.080> it's<00:03:49.620> important<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
its performance that it's important to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.250 
its performance that it's important to
have<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.250> feedback<00:03:50.730> loop<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.900> think<00:03:52.110> that's

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
have a feedback loop and I think that's

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.400 
have a feedback loop and I think that's
what<00:03:52.470> quantitative<00:03:53.040> analysis<00:03:53.580> can<00:03:53.790> improve

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
what quantitative analysis can improve

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.800 
what quantitative analysis can improve
we're<00:03:55.040> aiming<00:03:55.310> really<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:56.060> support<00:03:56.570> countries

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
we're aiming really to support countries

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.790 
we're aiming really to support countries
