00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.879
 hello everyone welcome to nutrition with 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.500
 taste where we are going to learn to eat 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.500
 healthy and delicious 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.740
 today we are going to talk about hunger 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.080
 and the appetite there are two impulses that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.930
 influence the desire to eat and for 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.770
 consequence of eating energy or calories 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.730
 of food these two are hunger 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.849
 and the appetite 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.430
 these concepts are not synonymous with 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.800
 fact they are processes completely 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.430
 different 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.930
 Hunger is the impulse mainly 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.899
 physical to eat and is controlled 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.960
 internally by the body the appetite is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.290
 the impulse to eat mainly of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.989
 psychological way in other words the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.199
 desire to eat and is affected by 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.010
 external mechanisms such as reading or seeing a 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.530
 poster that seems to us a lot 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 when we satisfy any of the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.430
 two impulses with enough food 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.740
 we generate a state of satiety 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.180
 and now what do these have to do 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.130
 concepts with nutrition feed us 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.980
 correctly is related to knowing 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.729
 to our body and know how to differentiate 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.040
 these two concepts to eat 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.280
 consciously for example when 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.560
 we are hungry we eat a hot dog 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.800
 after that the appetite can 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.979
 Take us to eat 2 or more for the simple 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.550
 fact that they know or look delicious 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.160
 the simplest way to differentiate the 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.620
 hunger and appetite is paying attention 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.800
 to our body 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.500
 before eating or serving us for second 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.400
 once we must ask is 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.490
 mainly hungry or appetite many 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.470
 Sometimes hunger can be felt 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.130
 physically and we can differentiate it from 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.590
 appetite to avoid eating more when 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.920
 we are hungry a good advice would be 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.750
 start with foods high in fiber and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.910
 low in calories 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.730
 in this way we fill our stomach 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.330
 and we feel less hungry when we arrive 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.210
 to the main course that usually has 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.910
 more calories 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.100
 with this advice we can control better 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.920
 our food intake 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.890
 Another advice is to not let it give us 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.200
 so hungry during the day eat a 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.440
 Healthy snack prevents us from getting there 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.160
 very hungry to strong meals and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.800
 do not over fill we eat slowly when 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.590
 we eat quickly we do not control 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.020
 our slow eating appetite allows us 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.610
 receive the signals of satiety of 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.250
 our body 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.560
 in conclusion although it seems a subject 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.710
 simple many times we forget that 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.960
 there are two impulses when we eat and it is 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.740
 important to know them to be able to 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.590
 master them and eat with conscience 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.300
