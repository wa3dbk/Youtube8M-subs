be<00:02:36.120> improved<00:02:36.660> with<00:02:36.780> most<00:02:37.080> other<00:02:37.200> implants<00:02:37.800> how

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
be improved with most other implants how

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.309 
be improved with most other implants how
are<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:41.269> placement<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.360> muscular<00:02:42.810> implants

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
are the placement of muscular implants

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.559 
are the placement of muscular implants
done<00:02:43.799> like<00:02:44.190> at<00:02:44.370> what<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:44.910> procedure<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
done like at what is the procedure the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.650 
done like at what is the procedure the
procedure<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:46.290> simple<00:02:46.560> actually<00:02:47.660> you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
procedure is very simple actually you

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.360 
procedure is very simple actually you
need<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.959> create<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.290> pocket<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.920> implant

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
need to create a pocket for the implant

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.940 
need to create a pocket for the implant
and<00:02:50.580> usually<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.629> can<00:02:51.810> use<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.049> small<00:02:52.500> incision

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
and usually you can use a small incision

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.979 
and usually you can use a small incision
to<00:02:53.430> insert<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.970> implant<00:02:54.420> most<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.870> these

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
to insert the implant most of these

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.020 
to insert the implant most of these
muscle<00:02:55.860> implants<00:02:56.190> are<00:02:56.370> not<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.730> big

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
muscle implants are not that big

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.380 
muscle implants are not that big
actually<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.900> just<00:02:58.200> use<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.799> as<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.390> contouring

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
actually you just use it as a contouring

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.720 
actually you just use it as a contouring
or<00:03:00.720> shaping<00:03:01.110> device<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.950> they<00:03:02.519> can<00:03:02.700> be

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
or shaping device and they can be

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.490 
or shaping device and they can be
slipped<00:03:03.209> because<00:03:03.420> they're<00:03:03.720> flexible<00:03:04.230> they

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
slipped because they're flexible they

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.569 
slipped because they're flexible they
can<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.769> slipped<00:03:05.099> through<00:03:05.280> small<00:03:05.549> incisions

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
can be slipped through small incisions

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.110 
can be slipped through small incisions
into<00:03:06.299> these<00:03:06.540> areas<00:03:07.670> how<00:03:08.670> long<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:09.000> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
into these areas how long is the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.110 
into these areas how long is the
recovery<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.950> recovery<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.489> generally<00:03:11.940> one

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
recovery the recovery is generally one

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.720 
recovery the recovery is generally one
week<00:03:12.329> over<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.049> surgery<00:03:13.610> what's<00:03:14.610> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
week over this surgery what's the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.900 
week over this surgery what's the
individual<00:03:15.239> look<00:03:15.390> out<00:03:15.540> for<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.700> think<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> most

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
individual look out for I think the most

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.740 
individual look out for I think the most
important<00:03:18.480> thing<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.690> look<00:03:18.959> out<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:20.750> to

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
important thing to look out for is to

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.020 
important thing to look out for is to
make<00:03:21.959> sure<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.790> procedure<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:24.000> done

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
make sure that the procedure is done

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.690 
make sure that the procedure is done
correctly<00:03:24.769> muscular<00:03:25.769> implants<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.430> any

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
correctly muscular implants like any

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.059 
correctly muscular implants like any
other<00:03:27.000> implant<00:03:27.420> actually<00:03:27.840> if<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:28.829> not

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
other implant actually if it's not

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.789 
other implant actually if it's not
placed<00:03:29.579> correctly<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.840> look<00:03:31.049> awkward<00:03:31.319> and

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
placed correctly it can look awkward and

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.680 
placed correctly it can look awkward and
it<00:03:31.950> could<00:03:32.100> look<00:03:32.250> fake<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.239> want<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.630> make

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
it could look fake so you want to make

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.559 
it could look fake so you want to make
sure<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:34.380> how<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.650> put<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.639> correct

them to get back to work in terms of

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.699 
them to get back to work in terms of

getting back into their routine of

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.280 
getting back into their routine of
exercising<00:04:08.489> i<00:04:08.669> would<00:04:08.849> say<00:04:09.000> closer<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.569> four

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
exercising i would say closer to four

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.699 
exercising i would say closer to four
weeks<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.750> if<00:04:12.900> an<00:04:12.989> individual<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.440> really

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
weeks and if an individual is really

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.500 
weeks and if an individual is really
seeking<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.190> get<00:04:14.340> muscular<00:04:14.669> implants<00:04:15.150> what

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
seeking to get muscular implants what

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.479 
seeking to get muscular implants what
should<00:04:15.720> they<00:04:15.810> do<00:04:15.870> i<00:04:16.370> think<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.459> most

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
should they do i think the most

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.039 
should they do i think the most
important<00:04:18.120> thing<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.299> they<00:04:18.570> should<00:04:18.810> do<00:04:19.019> is

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
important thing that they should do is

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.259 
important thing that they should do is
to<00:04:19.440> first<00:04:19.680> talk<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.280> qualified<00:04:20.549> plastic

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
to first talk to a qualified plastic

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.159 
to first talk to a qualified plastic
surgeon<00:04:21.690> i<00:04:21.870> think<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:23.039> with<00:04:24.030> any<00:04:24.570> implant

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
surgeon i think that with any implant

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.070 
surgeon i think that with any implant
surgery<00:04:25.800> they<00:04:26.340> need<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.729> understand<00:04:27.389> that

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
surgery they need to understand that

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.460 
surgery they need to understand that
there<00:04:28.620> are<00:04:28.680> risks<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.340> implant<00:04:29.789> placement

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
there are risks to implant placement

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.170 
there are risks to implant placement
these<00:04:31.470> risks<00:04:31.950> are<00:04:32.099> not<00:04:32.310> very<00:04:32.520> much<00:04:32.820> and

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
these risks are not very much and

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.060 
these risks are not very much and
they're<00:04:33.270> not<00:04:33.450> very<00:04:33.750> dangerous<00:04:34.260> but<00:04:34.620> they<00:04:34.860> are

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
they're not very dangerous but they are

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.519 
they're not very dangerous but they are
real<00:04:35.580> nonetheless

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:36.529 
real nonetheless

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.639 
real nonetheless
and<00:04:36.649> a<00:04:37.449> qualified<00:04:38.449> plastic<00:04:38.899> surgeon<00:04:39.319> can

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:39.649 
and a qualified plastic surgeon can

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:42.509 
and a qualified plastic surgeon can
explain<00:04:40.189> to<00:04:40.399> them<00:04:40.609> what<00:04:40.819> their<00:04:40.999> risks<00:04:41.389> are

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:42.519 
explain to them what their risks are

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:45.609 
explain to them what their risks are
