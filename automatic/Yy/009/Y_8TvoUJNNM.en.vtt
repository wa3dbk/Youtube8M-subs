00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.810
 the home is welcome to hear more than gauge 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.850
 I like too much of 2010 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.319
 if the braga seal 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.319
 in fact untrue 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.659
 export or animation 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.659
 create the signed bndes 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 and can later be used for on their websites 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.449
 I refer to the animation I was created 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.449
 we even have a 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.720
 dismissed from the real that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.130
 I previously recorded 5 dress up as a magician 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.440
 in three of them 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 also create animation 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.230
 the animation makes money 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.950
 not very interesting 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.220
 he after the piaui too 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.220
 black mouth 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.810
 improve your performance 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.040
 only there you are dealing here is about the invasion of objects 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.930
 lets help 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.390
 surrender in the afternoon 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 he has 107 25 fronts 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.580
 I'll 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.880
 usually 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.930
 three tenths point art 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.810
 nan 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 as trainers 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.070
 last week and that is option 5 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.300
 then go 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 one of them only 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.500
 so we can imagine 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.010
 I chose 0 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.740
 I chose 0 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.250
 to 750 complement those who go ahead 0 partial 7/6 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.870
 the island we are well that in the sharing 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.870
 I know they will do 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.290
 I know that here 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.820
 still exists here previously 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 I have here all the animation rio 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.990
 the sentence goes 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.790
 then that's it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.060
 I chose 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.840
 was excepted 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.869
 has important format also the access to a ball 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.499
 dr 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.499
 to save 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 But what are these people? 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.049
 or just review 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.279
 will be envious all animation 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.279
 the friends is a substance 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.279
 how to handle this idea I thought I would not do it anymore andersen 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 We're going to do it now with flash. 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.500

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.569

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.569

 from this time around here is a touchdown the half tinga 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.969

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.219
 I will not show your value 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.549
 believe impressions but not only 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.849

 import successfully if you import the normal file 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.579
 worse than the animation 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:26.419
 he 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.689
 worse is not what i imagine 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.819
 but I did not follow 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.699
 the conversation you heard 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.309
 like thousand 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.459

 want to import all of us and more in the sequence 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.229
 Clicking on top 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.469
 It will take a while to get what you give. 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.219
 import all of them 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.629
 are 177 pictures 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.729
 175 injured 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.729
 already defended image 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.639
 changes a lot 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.569
 that decreases 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.240
 so our image 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.749

 several works here in the neighborhood but it was an action 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 from ukraine 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.439

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.029

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:44.029
 It is very very interesting the 70's houses 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 with the downside and only issues and a bit weary 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.099
 for the exclusive sale of use of the emerson site 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:56.509

 We got here when I lit the corporation. 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.770
 that you can point the little finger at the ivox site remains a bit impossible 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.770
 as we can see on the website 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.969
