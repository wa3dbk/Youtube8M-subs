00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 This is because over and over again 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.099
 the question comes up a rap prosa and the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.110
 Price of his machine depends heavily 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.800
 from how much you are ready yourself 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.380
 to do if you to the side grf 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.180
 punkt.de that is the german 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.430
 representation then you will find there 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.710
 printer for about 750 799 euro finished 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.810
 built as far as I know 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.759
 complete electronics all 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.070
 stepper motors everything set 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.380
 you basically just have to be his 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.680
 adapt software and it works 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.590
 mainly to the slicer that is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.059
 For example, that program is no 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.770
 or even quieter and these 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.699
 Software is solely for this purpose 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 the sdl files you previously with a 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.980
 cad programs of his choice together 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.809
 has built and designed in individual 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.690
 small layers to divide the man 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.129
 now how can print here and the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 Configuration is actually that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.530
 elaborate on such a pressure back to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.840
 Price on this system here is almost 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.689
 everything is self-built that means I have 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 at that time only on ebay 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.759
 a hardworking rapper this 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.460
 bought plastic parts here that was a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.340
 price of about 77 euro as far as me 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.890
 I remember the stepper motors I 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.890
 used everywhere 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.830
 throughout the system are printers 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.840
 exploited that means that has none 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.540
 costs cause however also 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.060
 to that I am here only unipolar 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.700
 have stepper motors and not like all 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.390
 other rapper is actually bipolar 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.030
 stepper motors what is the difference 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.490
 a unipolar stepper motor is first time 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 easier to control because I have no 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.940
 full of harbrÃ¼cker need the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.619
 two motors that are in principle so 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.950
 really talked in there now 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.530
 run because it's in such a way 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.399
 obsolete that I always spool two 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.989
 against each other forward and backward 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.120
 must serve practically and at 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.160
 There are unipolar stepper motors 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.600
 actually always only forward I can 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.950
 So I can only have to reel 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.890
 switch on accordingly 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.860
 Turn on turn on and then turn 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.500
 the motor is practically the disadvantage 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.079
 I can maximally half a step 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.950
 drive operation 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.440
 unless I have a lot 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.360
 complex control electronics and at 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.910
 bipolar stepper motors 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.790
 usually also in 32 step operation 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.160
 possible and that's why they are 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.980
 quieter because they run much finer a lot 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.480
 However, it was cleaner for me 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.269
 No matter, I just wanted it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.720
 try because my motors have 18 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.120
 Degree 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.590
 I drive with 0.9 degrees and I have 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.530
 about a printer accuracy of 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.940
 0.2 millimeters 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.709
 that is of course exaggerated that is 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.769
 a purely theoretical accuracy 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.810
 Of course, the printhead has only one 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.910
 limited precision if you look now 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.660
 take a look 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.550
 here in the middle exist those who have 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.530
 just a certain amount of grease 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.890
 a bit on there you can not do anything 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.560
 against and that is in the principle of 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.630
 limiting factor of such a printer 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.140
 back to the price if you look at the whole 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.910
 electronics and everyone builds like this 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.800
 Now, for example, the board happened 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.690
 you see here is from me 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.500
 be it with me in my export 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.690
 been set 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.430
 this is behind the window that is 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.110
 So a normal expert what you 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.650
 at reichelt electronics can get 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.430
 or so 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.770
 that is soldered together here in the house 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.120
 I have some parts on this 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.980
 are also from printers 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.160
 so exploited all the way 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.720
 of course the loan end-stops for as 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:02.320
 stepper driver and cost point with 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.420
 the avr on it maybe 20 euro and 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.860
 that means the entire printer if 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.240
 Now here are the metal bars 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.690
 still looking that are maybe still 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.560
 20 euros at hornbach or so then 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.500
 is there at 200 euros including the 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.750
 first roll abs and that's not 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.160
 you have to say that extra money 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.870
 means when you are ready everything yourself 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.040
 to build if you have the know how say 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.710
 me or the middle 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.040
 the tool then is such a system 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.810
 built up relatively quickly 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.520
 it is then in detail you have to 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.800
 simply detailed questions solve the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.630
 In the end, questions of detail will be the time 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.330
 eat and time is actually that 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.100
 Expensive to me was the time but take a fall 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.570
 No matter, because I'm only there for now 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.180
 wanted to learn how to do something like 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.650
 This 3d printer works too 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.890
 I have to pay attention I think I have a lot 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.660
 also learned a lot in construction 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.169
 and that's why I'm pretty happy 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.260
 but the conclusion of this video is very much 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.580
 cheap if you invest the time 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.560
 want and if you are a bit ready 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.740
 is to tinker so the neighbors are happy 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.349
 always with something like that 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.550
 The printer is reasonably body 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:13.310
 my plan is pretty quiet but it 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.830
 It seems to be through the whole room 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.330
 containing entire building 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:24.289
 although actually proportionate 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:26.139
 is quiet and as cameraman on 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:29.419
 to watch the picture where you are filming 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:31.789
 which unfortunately does not always happen makes 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.940
 but nothing to dampen the whole thing here 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:37.940
 my printer here are countless layers 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.650
 the material under pressure 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.259
 vibration actually make the system 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.349
 not at all because yes his 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.819
 Always adjust its own position above if 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.440
 the printer itself a bit now 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.389
 it actually vibrates relatively 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.280
 no matter 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.759
 In any case, these three are enough 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.580
 layers of bubble wrap styrofoam and 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:01.099
 a quick handkerchief pack handy 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.190
 not out to the printer against the 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:06.710
 base plate or the building too 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.150
 decouple there you have to actually still 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.229
 times any balloons or 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.060
 tennis balls or something under it 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.039
 Squad games are said to be outstanding 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.669
 are 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.960
 I will someday 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.960
 try when I have more time
