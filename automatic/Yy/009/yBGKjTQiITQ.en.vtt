into<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.760> third<00:02:16.940> sector<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:18.170> really<00:02:18.470> is

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
into the third sector and this really is

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.620 
into the third sector and this really is
quite<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.890> depressing<00:02:19.489> scenario<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.269> only<00:02:20.480> car

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
quite a depressing scenario the only car

quite a depressing scenario the only car
behind<00:02:20.959> me<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.470> Sauber<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.040> crashed<00:02:22.340> out

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
behind me is the Sauber that crashed out

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.520 
behind me is the Sauber that crashed out
and<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.390> becoming<00:02:23.690> clear<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.019> me<00:02:24.290> now<00:02:24.320> that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and it's becoming clear to me now that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.380 
and it's becoming clear to me now that
we<00:02:24.799> need<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.459> need<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.730> do<00:02:25.850> something<00:02:26.269> to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
what could we do to try and boost things

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.690 
what could we do to try and boost things
more<00:02:32.269> in<00:02:32.420> my<00:02:32.630> favor<00:02:32.989> oh<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:34.010> know<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.430> we<00:02:34.549> could

more in my favor oh I know what we could
do<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.510> could<00:02:35.540> introduce<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:36.200> dirty<00:02:36.470> baseline

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
do we could introduce a dirty baseline

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.309 
do we could introduce a dirty baseline
immediately<00:02:38.150> that's<00:02:38.239> not<00:02:38.450> really<00:02:38.780> me<00:02:38.930> on<00:02:39.170> the
