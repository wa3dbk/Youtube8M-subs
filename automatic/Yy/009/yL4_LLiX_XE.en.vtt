00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.570 

alright<00:00:01.140> so<00:00:01.290> another<00:00:01.410> example<00:00:01.650> here<00:00:02.159> finding

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
alright so another example here finding

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.090 
alright so another example here finding
missing<00:00:03.090> angles<00:00:03.480> so<00:00:03.689> we're<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> use<00:00:04.799> the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
missing angles so we're going to use the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.710 
missing angles so we're going to use the
law<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.279> sines<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.879> find<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.359> measure<00:00:06.569> of

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
law of sines to find the measure of

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.110 
law of sines to find the measure of
angle<00:00:07.020> alpha<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.130> nearest<00:00:08.370> degree<00:00:08.550> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
angle alpha to the nearest degree and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.330 
angle alpha to the nearest degree and
we're<00:00:09.840> not<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.200> use<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.769> law<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.950> sines

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
we're not going to use the law of sines

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.839 
we're not going to use the law of sines
to<00:00:11.639> find<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.240> angle<00:00:12.809> alpha<00:00:13.019> directly<00:00:13.849> we're

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
to find the angle alpha directly we're

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.460 
to find the angle alpha directly we're
first<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.599> actually<00:00:15.780> find<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
first going to do is actually find the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.550 
first going to do is actually find the
angle<00:00:17.010> beta<00:00:17.880> or<00:00:18.300> B<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:19.020> we're<00:00:19.199> going<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> find

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
angle beta or B here we're going to find

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.620 
angle beta or B here we're going to find
the<00:00:19.710> measure<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.220> angle<00:00:20.449> again<00:00:21.449> then

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the measure of that angle again then

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.910 
the measure of that angle again then
we'll<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.930> use<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> fact<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.740> all

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
we'll just use the fact that they all

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.810 
we'll just use the fact that they all
add<00:00:23.160> up<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.369> 180<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.580> thing<00:00:26.730> I'm

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
add up to 180 so the first thing I'm

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.570 
add up to 180 so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.689> figure<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.650> our

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
going to have to do is figure out our

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.410 
going to have to do is figure out our
again<00:00:29.970> our<00:00:30.119> angle<00:00:30.539> B<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.910> we<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.030> say<00:00:33.239> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
again our angle B here so we can say it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.650 
again our angle B here so we can say it
say<00:00:33.719> side<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.260> angle<00:00:34.680> B<00:00:34.920> over<00:00:35.550> four<00:00:36.000> point<00:00:36.329> one

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
say side of angle B over four point one

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.310 
say side of angle B over four point one
that's<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> equal<00:00:37.890> well<00:00:38.579> sine<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.570> 25

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that's going to equal well sine of 25

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.729 
that's going to equal well sine of 25
degrees<00:00:42.079> over<00:00:43.079> three<00:00:43.770> point<00:00:44.160> eight<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
degrees over three point eight and to

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.190 
degrees over three point eight and to
solve<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.430> B<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.539> first<00:00:48.750> thing<00:00:48.899> I'll<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
solve for B the first thing I'll do is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
solve for B the first thing I'll do is
just<00:00:49.440> multiply<00:00:49.590> both<00:00:50.100> sides<00:00:50.370> by<00:00:50.489> four<00:00:50.879> point

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
just multiply both sides by four point

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.880 
just multiply both sides by four point
one<00:00:52.820> so<00:00:53.820> we'll<00:00:53.940> get<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> sine<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> B<00:00:55.079> equals

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
one so we'll get the sine of B equals

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.450 
one so we'll get the sine of B equals
okay<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.730> let's<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> start<00:00:58.460> plugging

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
okay so let's see we can start plugging

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.959 
okay so let's see we can start plugging
this<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> calculator

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.560 

so<00:01:04.540> we've<00:01:04.750> got<00:01:04.960> sine<00:01:05.379> of<00:01:05.430> 25<00:01:06.430> degrees

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
so we've got sine of 25 degrees

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
so we've got sine of 25 degrees
I'm<00:01:07.630> getting<00:01:08.049> sine<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:08.409> 25<00:01:08.950> degrees<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.880> be

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I'm getting sine of 25 degrees to be

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.539 
I'm getting sine of 25 degrees to be
0.42<00:01:12.390> 3<00:01:13.390> after<00:01:13.960> rounding<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:15.310> I'm<00:01:15.369> going<00:01:15.520> to

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
0.42 3 after rounding so I'm going to

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.210 
0.42 3 after rounding so I'm going to
multiply<00:01:15.670> that<00:01:16.240> by<00:01:16.299> four<00:01:16.810> point<00:01:17.170> one<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.920> then

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
multiply that by four point one and then

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.420 
multiply that by four point one and then
divided<00:01:18.549> by<00:01:18.580> three<00:01:19.390> point<00:01:19.690> eight<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.130> point

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
divided by three point eight so point

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.380 
divided by three point eight so point
four<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:22.180> three<00:01:22.860> times<00:01:23.860> four<00:01:24.700> point<00:01:25.180> one

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.600 

let's<00:01:29.810> try<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.050> one<00:01:30.350> more<00:01:30.530> time<00:01:30.590> point<00:01:31.310> four

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
let's try this one more time point four

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.880 
let's try this one more time point four
to<00:01:31.820> three<00:01:32.650> times<00:01:33.650> four<00:01:34.310> point<00:01:34.970> one<00:01:35.680> ok<00:01:36.680> then

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
to three times four point one ok then

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.460 
to three times four point one ok then
I'm<00:01:36.980> going<00:01:37.160> to<00:01:37.220> divide<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.820> by<00:01:37.900> three<00:01:38.900> point

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
I'm going to divide that by three point

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.680 
I'm going to divide that by three point
eight<00:01:39.910> I'm<00:01:40.910> getting<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.570> be

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
eight I'm getting this to be

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.620 
eight I'm getting this to be
approximately<00:01:43.210> 0.4<00:01:44.210> five<00:01:44.780> six<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:47.030> we've<00:01:47.450> got

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
approximately 0.4 five six so we've got

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.950 
approximately 0.4 five six so we've got
sine<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:47.930> B<00:01:50.440> equals<00:01:51.440> point<00:01:51.770> four<00:01:52.190> five<00:01:52.670> six<00:01:53.150> all

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
sine of B equals point four five six all

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.450 
sine of B equals point four five six all
I'm<00:01:54.050> going<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.229> do<00:01:54.380> at<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.590> case<00:01:54.860> at<00:01:55.220> this

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
I'm going to do at this case at this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.210 
I'm going to do at this case at this
point<00:01:55.760> is<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.510> take<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.560> inverse<00:01:57.890> sine<00:01:57.950> of

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
point is just take the inverse sine of

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.570 
point is just take the inverse sine of
both<00:01:58.430> sides<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.210> we'll<00:02:00.050> get<00:02:00.260> B<00:02:00.530> equals<00:02:01.250> inverse

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
both sides so we'll get B equals inverse

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.790 
both sides so we'll get B equals inverse
sine<00:02:02.240> at<00:02:02.690> point<00:02:03.170> four<00:02:03.560> five<00:02:04.100> six<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:06.410> let's<00:02:06.590> see

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
sine at point four five six so let's see

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.830 
sine at point four five six so let's see
what<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.160> gives<00:02:07.369> us<00:02:08.000> here

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.160 

I'm<00:02:11.410> getting<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.010> be<00:02:12.129> roughly<00:02:12.780> 27<00:02:13.780> point

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
I'm getting this to be roughly 27 point

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.009 
I'm getting this to be roughly 27 point
one<00:02:16.260> three<00:02:17.260> degrees<00:02:17.890> after<00:02:18.250> rounding<00:02:19.019> since

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
one three degrees after rounding since

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.210 
one three degrees after rounding since
we're<00:02:20.140> doing<00:02:20.230> things<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.769> nearest<00:02:21.040> degree

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
we're doing things to the nearest degree

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.619 
we're doing things to the nearest degree
I<00:02:21.489> think<00:02:21.790> I'm<00:02:21.849> just<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.180> round<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.599> off

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
I think I'm just going to round that off

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.180 
I think I'm just going to round that off
to<00:02:23.050> 27<00:02:24.010> degrees<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.510> our<00:02:25.959> angle<00:02:26.200> B<00:02:26.650> here<00:02:27.040> is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
to 27 degrees so our angle B here is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.759 
to 27 degrees so our angle B here is
going<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.370> be<00:02:27.519> roughly<00:02:28.060> equal<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:29.640> 27<00:02:30.640> degrees

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
going to be roughly equal to 27 degrees

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.930 
going to be roughly equal to 27 degrees
well<00:02:32.769> now<00:02:33.099> again<00:02:33.489> we're<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:33.790> just

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
well now again we're really just

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.710 
well now again we're really just
interested<00:02:34.569> in<00:02:34.660> finding<00:02:35.110> angle<00:02:35.530> alpha<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.730> 27

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
interested in finding angle alpha so 27

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.770 
interested in finding angle alpha so 27
degrees<00:02:38.110> plus<00:02:39.180> 25<00:02:40.180> degrees<00:02:41.459> plus<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:43.000> measure

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
degrees plus 25 degrees plus the measure

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.809 
degrees plus 25 degrees plus the measure
of<00:02:43.900> alpha<00:02:44.470> that's<00:02:44.799> now<00:02:45.130> we're<00:02:45.280> adding<00:02:45.400> up<00:02:45.670> all

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
of alpha that's now we're adding up all

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.430 
of alpha that's now we're adding up all
the<00:02:46.000> angles<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:46.690> would<00:02:46.810> simply<00:02:47.200> have<00:02:47.230> to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the angles so that would simply have to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.250 
the angles so that would simply have to
add<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:48.069> 180

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
add up to 180

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.620 
add up to 180
well<00:02:50.260> 27<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.190> 25<00:02:51.640> that's<00:02:52.120> going<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.360> give<00:02:52.480> us

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
well 27 and 25 that's going to give us

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.369 
well 27 and 25 that's going to give us
52<00:02:53.260> degrees<00:02:54.060> plus<00:02:55.060> alpha<00:02:56.250> equals<00:02:57.250> 180<00:02:58.000> degrees

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
52 degrees plus alpha equals 180 degrees

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.770 
52 degrees plus alpha equals 180 degrees
we<00:02:59.379> can<00:02:59.470> simply<00:02:59.829> subtract<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.700> 52<00:03:01.329> from<00:03:01.569> both

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
we can simply subtract the 52 from both

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.119 
we can simply subtract the 52 from both
sides<00:03:02.110> that'll<00:03:03.099> leave<00:03:03.400> us<00:03:03.430> with

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
sides that'll leave us with

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.759 
sides that'll leave us with
128<00:03:06.129> degrees<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:08.170> looks<00:03:08.349> like<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.680> this

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
128 degrees so it looks like in this

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.190 
128 degrees so it looks like in this
case<00:03:09.010> our<00:03:09.280> angle<00:03:09.760> alpha<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.480> simply<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:11.140> to

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
case our angle alpha is simply going to

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.140 
case our angle alpha is simply going to
give<00:03:11.379> us<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.680> hundred<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.370> we'll<00:03:12.970> have<00:03:13.120> a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
give us a hundred and we'll have a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.580 
give us a hundred and we'll have a
measure<00:03:13.629> of<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.900> hundred<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.319> twenty-eight

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
measure of a hundred and twenty-eight

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.460 
measure of a hundred and twenty-eight
degrees<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:16.359> could<00:03:16.480> always<00:03:16.690> use<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.260> law<00:03:17.440> of

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
degrees you could always use the law of

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.770 
degrees you could always use the law of
sines<00:03:17.859> again<00:03:18.340> again<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.970> actually<00:03:19.120> figure<00:03:19.750> out

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
sines again again to actually figure out

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.290 
sines again again to actually figure out
that<00:03:20.139> missing<00:03:20.590> length<00:03:20.829> but

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
that missing length but

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.390 
that missing length but
in<00:03:22.600> this<00:03:22.780> case<00:03:22.990> all<00:03:23.320> we're<00:03:23.500> interested<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.190> is

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
in this case all we're interested in is

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.350 
in this case all we're interested in is
just<00:03:24.430> finding<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.270> angle<00:03:25.780> alpha
