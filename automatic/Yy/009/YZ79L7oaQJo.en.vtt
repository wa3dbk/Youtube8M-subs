00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.930
 academy 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 follows 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.340
 the first 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.340
 but 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.260
 beautiful 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.260
 no 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.980
 now its turn 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.770
 seventh edition of the festival of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.760
 popular song arranged 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 from the association free badolatesi in 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.470
 collaboration with the administration 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 municipal president two evenings in the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.390
 before they had a chance to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.610
 the emerging artists perform 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.940
 emerging in the second practically there is 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.530
 was the real race and certainly the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.250
 early evening was dedicated to groups 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.310
 emerging 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 no to groups and individuals a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 who still wanted to participate though 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.060
 not competing while the latter 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.790
 evening was dedicated to both individuals and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.250
 both professional groups then of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 consequence as you already knew from 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.460
 posters there the winner will go to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.830
 participate in the power tarantella 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.840
 I think it's a unique opportunity for me 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.660
 a group that is emerging now more 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.220
 so we could not do many 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:40.470
 the artists signed up for the race 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.369
 there are 15 three groups and single and a beautiful one 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.380
 competition also because it is both 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.810
 of those traditional songs 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.220
 traditional Badolatese and both groups 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.520
 who are doing the new e 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 a tendency now to limit riders 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.789
 so more than anything else if you want that kind 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.350
 of music it seemed a nice one 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.660
 demonstration 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.360
 what elements distinguish the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.910
 Badolatese festival compared to the others 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.330
 singing manifestations taking place 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.160
 in our district and appearance is 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.560
 very important also because in general 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.780
 we talk about festivals though they take it 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.930
 of musical groups and let them play 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.680
 practically here, instead, it doesn't take us there 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.239
 wants 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.549
 a mountain of evidence because who comes to 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.739
 playing non-professionals in practice 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.120
 they put there closes once they don't know 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.950
 well the song they have to do then 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.079
 looking for you advice must put there a 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.540
 try the shades, etc. here is one 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.640
 very elaborate and worked on 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.079
 double that of the event if 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.000
 same that is the ball parties that generally 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.129
 we talk about festivals but this is not it 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.920
 which this valley is this class 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.290
 there is participation by both singles and 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.019
 both non-professionals say I 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.139
 I think so it's okay that is for me it's a 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.879
 satisfaction for how his was 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.150
 association is working on others 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.069
 projects wants us to anticipate something 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.840
 we will have to present a book on the 13th 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.700
 in bad upper but a lot 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.700
 indeed I call for citizenship 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.560
 padova di badolato and also those of the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.819
 compressor to participate absolutely 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.819
 a very important event 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.850
 is that you wash with dream 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.580
 to us from Calabria 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.580
 agi 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.430
 We were shooting 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.640
 no 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.049
 no 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.180
 never 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.449
 the transmission process continues 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.610
 to the new generations of the rich 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.620
 full musical heritage 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.570
 recorded in these two series the 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.120
 demonstration of the fact that the public 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.330
 liked the effort 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.400
 yes I have believed it and continues to believe it 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.949
 at this event and that someone 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.310
 tell me why I am of the opinion that 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.810
 common people must be made aware of 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.539
 Young people 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.039
 the locals always keep up 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.650
 and those that are the traditions of the 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:28.759
 thesis word popular songs and this is 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.489
 a means of doing it because 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:35.009
 they have the chance these let's say 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:37.439
 amateurs of the song to perform 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:41.009
 also such an important moment of 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:42.659
 face such a vast audience 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:45.269
 what was shown yesterday and 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.789
 tonight which events will characterize 

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:48.509
 summer badolatese elements that 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.159
 feature 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.720
 besides what we're doing 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:55.120
 tonight that I believe that 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.680
 I think the song populates the muse 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.240
 the beautiful ethnic and popular candle both 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.330
 a very important message from 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.010
 communication and fight time this is 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.980
 the music that takes you that involves you 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:14.140
 and the tarantella power that will be carried out 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.390
 from 21 to 25 August in the village and we hope 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.450
 that is like all other events 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.780
 in past years also this year a 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.780
 exceptional event 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.890
 no 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.749
 Yup 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.380
 no 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.490
