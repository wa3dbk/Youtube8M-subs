that's<00:00:11.370> for<00:00:11.580> sync<00:00:12.380> yeah<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.920> basic

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
that's for sync yeah so this is a basic

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.330 
that's for sync yeah so this is a basic
microphone<00:00:14.910> test<00:00:15.240> I've<00:00:15.870> got<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
microphone test I've got a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
microphone test I've got a
scientific<00:00:17.940> microphone<00:00:18.300> anyways<00:00:18.660> I've<00:00:18.960> got

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
scientific microphone anyways I've got

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.519 
scientific microphone anyways I've got
three<00:00:19.500> microphones<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.930> my<00:00:21.930> right<00:00:22.199> your<00:00:22.470> left

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
three microphones on my right your left

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.470 
three microphones on my right your left
is<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.789> Zen<00:00:24.449> Iser<00:00:25.070> mk8<00:00:26.070> 160<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.090> t-pod

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
is a Zen Iser mk8 160 it's a t-pod

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.679 
is a Zen Iser mk8 160 it's a t-pod
microphone<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.590> bit<00:00:28.800> odd<00:00:29.689> it's

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
microphone so it's a little bit odd it's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.180 
microphone so it's a little bit odd it's
quite<00:00:30.900> old<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> early<00:00:32.940> 80s

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
quite old it's from the early 80s

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.150 
quite old it's from the early 80s
perhaps<00:00:35.190> even<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> late<00:00:35.700> 70s<00:00:36.440> then<00:00:37.440> we've<00:00:37.920> got

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
perhaps even the late 70s then we've got

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.369 
perhaps even the late 70s then we've got
a<00:00:38.309> road<00:00:38.579> anti<00:00:38.969> five<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.600> small<00:00:39.930> capsule

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
a road anti five it's a small capsule

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.130 
a road anti five it's a small capsule
condenser<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.719> we've<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> road

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
condenser and then we've got the road

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.110 
condenser and then we've got the road
entity<00:00:43.800> eight<00:00:43.950> which<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> reasonably<00:00:44.820> long

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
entity eight which is a reasonably long

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.690 
entity eight which is a reasonably long
rifle<00:00:45.629> mic<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:47.100> relatively<00:00:47.520> new

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
rifle mic it's it's relatively new

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700 
rifle mic it's it's relatively new
compared<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> other<00:00:48.899> mics<00:00:49.170> although<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
compared to the other mics although the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
compared to the other mics although the
other<00:00:50.010> rode<00:00:50.340> mic<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.059> also<00:00:51.570> relatively<00:00:52.020> new

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
other rode mic is is also relatively new

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.290 
other rode mic is is also relatively new
and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> course<00:00:53.190> before<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.579> forget<00:00:53.730> I've

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and then of course before I forget I've

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.490 
and then of course before I forget I've
got<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.840> little<00:00:55.649> mic<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.160> my<00:00:56.699> shirt<00:00:57.140> which<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
got a little mic on my shirt which is a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.369 
got a little mic on my shirt which is a
wireless<00:00:59.370> lapel<00:00:59.550> mic<00:01:01.370> yes<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.899> idea<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
wireless lapel mic yes so the idea is to

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
wireless lapel mic yes so the idea is to
sort<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.979> look<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.309> quality<00:01:05.519> differences

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
sort of look at the quality differences

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.550 
sort of look at the quality differences
between<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.840> different<00:01:07.140> microphones

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
between the different microphones

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.039 
between the different microphones
obviously<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> rifle<00:01:08.820> mics<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.360> quite

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
obviously the rifle mics are quite

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.170 
obviously the rifle mics are quite
they've<00:01:10.710> got<00:01:10.950> quite<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> narrow<00:01:11.640> pickup

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they've got quite a narrow pickup

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080 
they've got quite a narrow pickup
pattern<00:01:12.619> so<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> should<00:01:14.010> hear<00:01:14.280> me<00:01:14.460> quite

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
pattern so you should hear me quite

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.130 
pattern so you should hear me quite
nicely<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.570> those<00:01:15.900> mics<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.450> small<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
nicely on those mics the the small the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
nicely on those mics the the small the
small<00:01:19.350> capsule<00:01:19.770> condenser<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> obviously<00:01:21.299> got

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
small capsule condenser is obviously got

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
small capsule condenser is obviously got
quite<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> large<00:01:21.990> pickup<00:01:22.470> pattern<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.009> you'll

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
quite a large pickup pattern so you'll

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.960 
quite a large pickup pattern so you'll
hear<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> lot<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.759> reverb<00:01:24.689> from<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> roof<00:01:25.970> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
hear a lot of reverb from the roof and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.660 
hear a lot of reverb from the roof and
this<00:01:27.780> should<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> compression<00:01:29.579> on

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this should have a lot of compression on

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.690 
this should have a lot of compression on
it<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> isn't<00:01:30.270> distorting<00:01:30.990> its<00:01:31.920> yeah

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it if it isn't distorting its yeah

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
it if it isn't distorting its yeah
anyway<00:01:33.229> right<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
anyway right so I'm going to take a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.910 
anyway right so I'm going to take a
little<00:01:35.280> walk<00:01:35.549> around<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.320> we<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.680> hear

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
little walk around and we can just hear

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.380 
little walk around and we can just hear
what<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> different<00:01:38.460> pickup<00:01:38.880> patterns<00:01:39.240> do

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
what the different pickup patterns do

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.060 
what the different pickup patterns do
obviously<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.960> mic<00:01:40.170> shouldn't<00:01:40.560> change<00:01:40.829> very

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
obviously this mic shouldn't change very

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.700 
obviously this mic shouldn't change very
much<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.579> mics<00:01:41.909> cool<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
much these mics cool so I'm going to
talk<00:01:43.890> about<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:44.310> dog<00:01:44.610> which<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> don't<00:01:45.180> actually

okay<00:02:11.300> whatever<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.780> case<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.680> as<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.130> can<00:02:13.280> see

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
okay whatever the case so as you can see

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.600 
okay whatever the case so as you can see
the<00:02:14.360> my<00:02:15.020> voice<00:02:15.260> should<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:15.650> shifting<00:02:16.280> quite<00:02:16.580> a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
the my voice should be shifting quite a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.450 
the my voice should be shifting quite a
lot<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.840> walk<00:02:18.020> around<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.440> room<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.590> my

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
lot as I walk around the room and my

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.640 
lot as I walk around the room and my
voice<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.670> remaining<00:02:20.240> relatively<00:02:21.230> constant

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
voice is remaining relatively constant

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.400 
voice is remaining relatively constant
you<00:02:22.520> know<00:02:22.550> in<00:02:22.850> terms<00:02:23.570> of<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.930> know<00:02:23.990> average

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
you know in terms of you know average

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.880 
you know in terms of you know average
amplitude<00:02:25.780> but<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:27.080> should<00:02:27.410> be<00:02:27.440> changing

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
amplitude but it should be changing

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.530 
amplitude but it should be changing
about<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.100> lot<00:02:28.310> because<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.240> pickup

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
about a lot because of the pickup

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.090 
about a lot because of the pickup
happens<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.110> microphone<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.710> look<00:02:30.950> at

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
happens on the microphone if I look at

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.890 
happens on the microphone if I look at
the<00:02:31.190> microphone<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.820> talked<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.390> look<00:02:32.600> away

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
the microphone I talked and I look away

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.720 
the microphone I talked and I look away
you<00:02:33.560> know<00:02:33.680> obviously<00:02:34.160> it's<00:02:34.310> going<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.580> change

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
you know obviously it's going to change

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.530 
you know obviously it's going to change
quite<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.090> lot

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
quite a lot

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.870 
quite a lot
this<00:02:36.080> will<00:02:36.560> wireless<00:02:37.040> mic<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.580> shouldn't

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
this will wireless mic you shouldn't

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.250 
this will wireless mic you shouldn't
really<00:02:38.000> hear<00:02:38.270> much<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.690> difference<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.140> it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
really hear much of a difference on it

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.470 
really hear much of a difference on it
except<00:02:39.650> perhaps<00:02:39.860> if<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.310> walk<00:02:40.520> up<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> wall<00:02:41.210> or

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
except perhaps if I walk up to a wall or

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.060 
except perhaps if I walk up to a wall or
I<00:02:41.570> look<00:02:41.780> at<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.020> ceiling<00:02:42.440> or<00:02:42.560> something<00:02:42.920> like

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
I look at the ceiling or something like

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.890 
I look at the ceiling or something like
that

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.320 
that
so<00:02:45.410> that's<00:02:45.830> that<00:02:46.070> next<00:02:46.640> test<00:02:46.880> will<00:02:47.120> be

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
so that's that next test will be

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.880 
so that's that next test will be
interference<00:02:48.880> right<00:02:49.880> we're<00:02:50.480> back<00:02:50.630> I'm<00:02:51.560> back

music of this volume playing it's quite

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.070 
music of this volume playing it's quite
low<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.910> know<00:03:17.060> you're<00:03:17.480> generally<00:03:17.810> going<00:03:17.870> to

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
low you know you're generally going to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.020 
low you know you're generally going to
have<00:03:18.170> an<00:03:18.470> air<00:03:18.830> conditioner<00:03:19.040> or<00:03:19.520> something<00:03:19.880> but

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
have an air conditioner or something but

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.460 
have an air conditioner or something but
it's<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.239> bit<00:03:20.390> difficult<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.780> replicate<00:03:21.320> in

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
it's a bit difficult to replicate in

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.650 
it's a bit difficult to replicate in
this<00:03:21.650> room<00:03:21.890> because<00:03:22.459> there's<00:03:23.300> no<00:03:23.480> air

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660

conditioner<00:03:24.080> in<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.440> room<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.870> yeah<00:03:27.709> I'm

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
conditioner in this room so yeah I'm

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.949 
conditioner in this room so yeah I'm
just<00:03:27.890> going<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.160> do<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> little<00:03:28.640> walk<00:03:28.910> around

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.360 
just going to do a little walk around
obviously<00:03:29.959> as<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.230> go<00:03:30.410> off<00:03:30.620> access<00:03:31.190> you're

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
obviously as I go off access you're

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.199 
obviously as I go off access you're
going<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.670> hear<00:03:31.850> more<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.830> audio

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
going to hear more of the audio

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.120 
going to hear more of the audio
microphone<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.780> I'm<00:03:35.989> working<00:03:36.350> on<00:03:36.470> here<00:03:36.800> and
