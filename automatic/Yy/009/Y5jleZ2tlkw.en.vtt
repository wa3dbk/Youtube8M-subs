00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 nothing has long been recorded 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello everyone with you alex and on the past 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.330
 week the company Apple presented on 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.440
 wwdc ios mobile operating system 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.119
 8 for iPhones and iPads and I wanted 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.910
 make a video about 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.949
 where did the new functions of aus-8 go? 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.350
 then I realized that it was enough 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.320
 boring form because legs are functions 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.660
 his with 8 came because of earlier versions 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.550
 android i don't think it's bad we are all 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.219
 we know that google and apple are you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.570
 each other all sorts of features but in principle yes 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 and this form will be 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 about my impressions both aus-8 and davydov 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.040
 Odessa as a whole to begin with and that it and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.590
 urgently is not some big 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.469
 updates in fact it is even visually 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.629
 very soon with ios 7 it is rather a meeting 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.579
 new features and improvements which 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.620
 allows you to call aus-8 new 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.840
 operating version from apple right away 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.350
 I say that after a presentation about you 8 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.239
 on wwdc i put in beta on 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.299
 I popolzovalsya phone and something which is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.640
 time and then in the end I demolished it because 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.070
 that everything is very bad working board that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.650
 nothing worked at all and yet I 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.380
 decided to wait for the final version which 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.119
 we will see in the fall that same juice 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.939
 lies a feature called katte nuri 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.740
 what with Odessa brought as continuity 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.740
 This is for people who have in addition 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 iphone is also a mark and your magician 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.759
 identifies your ios device if it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.680
 is near and automatically 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.720
 starting to film all the information 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 between computer and your mobile 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.650
 for example, if you 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.869
 found writing any note on 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.820
 iPhone you understand that you will be long 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.240
 write you come on your mac and 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.670
 kick b fully print than a such 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.700
 The same situation can be with the program as 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.159
 page with messages and so on if your 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.990
 the magician sees your iphone nearby then you 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.240
 can use your phone like 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.070
 access point with just one click 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.740
 now you finally have 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.469
 the ability to transfer files between yours 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.520
 mac and about your ios device with 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.320
 using airdrop 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.060
 now appeared if my sync 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.869
 and massage between your computer and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.310
 by telephone 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.130
 and now you can use 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.870
 his 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.270
 it's the same dice speaker when you call 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.790
 anyone with your iphone 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.280
 I think this is very cool and many 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.620
 developers of various instant messengers 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.570
 it is worth paying attention to it besides 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.310
 This singer has a couple of features which 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.840
 will be well acquainted with the owner android 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.860
 interactive notifications appeared 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.630
 now when you come to you 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.070
 notification you can swapping down 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.200
 Like for example, to put on 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.850
 facebook or reply to a message and 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.350
 you do not need to leave the application anymore 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.090
 in which you are in the center 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.530
 notifications appeared widgets that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.030
 can be added by third-party 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.100
 developers and now the center 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.510
 Notifications is totally changeable 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.580
 that is, you can add any 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.920
 widgets any information in general all that 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.900
 want a spotlight search got 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.850
 significant improvement now searches 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.640
 besides the information on your phone and you 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.190
 see results of itunes search maps 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.410
 google app in the appstore and so on 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.720
 in general, the controversy has become even steeper 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.360
 You 8 were improved keyboard and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.040
 the first is the improved of the correct and and 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.240
 Now system march you suggest 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.110
 following words 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.030
 it's just like pour on android 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.640
 and the second is third-party support 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.500
 keyboard gallant sex messages have 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.390
 the ability to record video and voice 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.250
 posts again this is all see no 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.020
 for the first time, Iâ€™m not sure whether 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.000
 thousands to be popular because 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.980
 that when I don't want to call I don't want 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.290
 talk i just write messages about 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.360
 than we see what happens the same way 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.340
 I had icloud drive that works 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.860
 like any other cloud service 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.620
 for example google drive, too, yes, yes 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.810
 google drive yes and a new thing under 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.310
 called i have hit which uses 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.800
 sensors to monitor your health 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.840
 but it seems to me that the program can 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.440
 use any device that 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.530
 you can wear for example on hand in 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.700
 general, again, let's see what of this 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.790

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.380

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.970
 the apple direction is moving now if 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.100
 someone would tell me three years ago 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.959
 about the fact that in and you will be support 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.359
 side of the keyboard, I would have laughed you 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.310

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.710
 make fun android presentation afterwards 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.900
 check chips out of it yes but I think that 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.630
 this part of the game is not worth it to rush 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.130
 as 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.750
