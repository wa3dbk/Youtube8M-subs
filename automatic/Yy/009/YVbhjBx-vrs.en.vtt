00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the technic pack this is on a different

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.720 
the technic pack this is on a different
world<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:17.550> nuclear<00:00:18.090> reactor<00:00:18.570> because<00:00:19.020> I

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
world to my nuclear reactor because I

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.939 
world to my nuclear reactor because I
accidentally<00:00:20.730> corrupted<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.449> world<00:00:21.949> trying

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
accidentally corrupted that world trying

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.040 
accidentally corrupted that world trying
to<00:00:24.619> add<00:00:25.619> another<00:00:26.130> mod<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.930> which<00:00:27.930> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
to add another mod to it which is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.609 
to add another mod to it which is
probably<00:00:28.320> not<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.560> best<00:00:28.590> idea<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:31.380> on

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
probably not the best idea so I'm on

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.010 
probably not the best idea so I'm on
this<00:00:32.160> new<00:00:32.489> world<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.149> was<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.390> exploring

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this new world and I was just exploring

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.569 
this new world and I was just exploring
found<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.860> bit<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> oil<00:00:35.219> thought

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
found this little bit of oil thought

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.299 
found this little bit of oil thought
that's<00:00:35.790> nice<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.690> looked<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.070> saw

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
that's nice and I looked up and I saw

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
that's nice and I looked up and I saw
that<00:00:39.110> now<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.200> any<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.829> familiar<00:00:42.230> with

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that now if any of you are familiar with

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.740 
that now if any of you are familiar with
this<00:00:44.100> mod<00:00:46.520> mode<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.730> pack<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.420> built

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
this mod mode this pack this is built

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.299 
this mod mode this pack this is built
rocks<00:00:52.250> thing<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.149> an<00:00:54.770> oil<00:00:55.770> Kaiser

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
rocks thing here and it is an oil Kaiser

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.660 
rocks thing here and it is an oil Kaiser
and<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:59.449> geyser<00:01:00.649> means<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.129> there<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.640> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and the geyser means that there is a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.690 
and the geyser means that there is a
large<00:01:04.220> reservoir<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.309> oil<00:01:05.519> underground<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
large reservoir of oil underground and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.960 
large reservoir of oil underground and
it's<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:09.270> normally<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.290> about<00:01:10.979> three

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it's there normally you know about three

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.219 
it's there normally you know about three
blocks<00:01:12.299> high<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.729> 20<00:01:15.720> blocks<00:01:15.869> high

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
blocks high this is about 20 blocks high

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.039 
blocks high this is about 20 blocks high
so<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.640> either<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> complete<00:01:18.659> glitch

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
so it's either just to complete glitch

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.880 
so it's either just to complete glitch
and<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> means<00:01:19.500> nothing<00:01:19.939> or<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.890> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and it means nothing or it is the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.530 
and it means nothing or it is the
world's<00:01:23.369> biggest

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
world's biggest

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.720 
world's biggest
oil<00:01:26.110> supply<00:01:26.980> ever<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.890> oil<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.310> looks<00:01:30.640> a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
oil supply ever is the oil that looks a

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.820 
oil supply ever is the oil that looks a
bit<00:01:30.760> green<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.400> I'm<00:01:34.210> fairly<00:01:34.780> short

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.340

be me tapping this well and then
powering<00:01:48.830> some<00:01:49.130> stuff<00:01:49.400> with<00:01:49.580> it<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:51.159> will<00:01:52.159> be

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
powering some stuff with it so I will be

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.550 
powering some stuff with it so I will be
back<00:01:52.880> in<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.119> sec<00:01:53.330> once<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.720> figured<00:01:54.080> out<00:01:54.170> how<00:01:54.409> I'm

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
have built myself a little tower here up

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.770 
have built myself a little tower here up
to<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.530> very<00:02:03.740> top<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:05.080> oil<00:02:06.080> geyser<00:02:07.780> so

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
to the very top of this oil geyser so

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.630 
to the very top of this oil geyser so
now<00:02:09.050> I'll<00:02:09.679> show<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.039> how<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.429> set<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.900> pump

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
now I'll show you how to set up the pump

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.210 
now I'll show you how to set up the pump
so<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:15.080> here<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.410> pump<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:16.040> some

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
so I have here the pump just some

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.540 
so I have here the pump just some
stirring<00:02:16.489> fighters<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:19.280> redstone<00:02:19.550> engine

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
stirring fighters and a redstone engine

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.270 
stirring fighters and a redstone engine
so<00:02:22.550> put<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:25.269> directly<00:02:26.269> over<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:27.130> middle<00:02:28.130> of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so put the directly over the middle of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.100 
so put the directly over the middle of
the<00:02:28.400> geyser<00:02:28.610> where<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.360> actual<00:02:29.480> source<00:02:29.870> block

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
the geyser where the actual source block

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.059 
the geyser where the actual source block
is

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.319 

and<00:02:33.989> then<00:02:34.989> just<00:02:35.379> connect<00:02:38.310> these<00:02:39.329> starting

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
and then just connect these starting

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.020 
and then just connect these starting
pipe<00:02:41.280> don't<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.370> don't<00:02:42.609> need<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.849> use<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
pipe don't you don't need to use a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.479 
pipe don't you don't need to use a
wooden<00:02:43.719> pipe<00:02:44.019> for<00:02:44.379> this<00:02:47.069> yeah<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:48.159> can<00:02:48.310> just

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
wooden pipe for this yeah you can just

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.509 
wooden pipe for this yeah you can just
use<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.760> stone<00:02:48.969> pipe<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.010> can't<00:02:51.250> use<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
use the stone pipe but you can't use the

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.330 
use the stone pipe but you can't use the
wooden<00:02:51.700> pipe<00:02:51.909> it<00:02:52.060> doesn't<00:02:52.150> work<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:54.040> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
wooden pipe it doesn't work and then you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.220 
wooden pipe it doesn't work and then you
just<00:02:55.650> give<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:59.370> how<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> pump<00:03:01.120> directly<00:03:01.480> with

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
just give the how the pump directly with

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.390 
just give the how the pump directly with
an<00:03:02.349> engine<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.139> course<00:03:05.319> using<00:03:05.769> two

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
an engine this is of course using two

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.790 
an engine this is of course using two
point<00:03:06.900> one

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
point one

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.589 
point one
bill<00:03:09.670> craft<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:10.690> there<00:03:10.990> are<00:03:11.020> engines

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
bill craft so there are engines

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.550 
bill craft so there are engines
and<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.379> getting<00:03:13.560> night<00:03:13.890> time<00:03:14.189> so<00:03:14.609> I<00:03:15.560> will

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.459 
and it's getting night time so I will
just<00:03:16.829> finish<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.969> pipeline<00:03:18.510> after<00:03:19.109> summer

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:19.469 
just finish this pipeline after summer

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:22.339 
just finish this pipeline after summer
tanks<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.159> then<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.269> will<00:03:21.389> activate<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.019> and

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
tanks and then we will activate this and

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.069 
tanks and then we will activate this and
see<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.129> what<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.400> does<00:03:23.519> okay<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:23.909> I'm<00:03:24.359> back<00:03:24.659> I

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
see if what it does okay so I'm back I

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.619 
see if what it does okay so I'm back I
have<00:03:25.920> six<00:03:26.450> pump<00:03:27.709> six<00:03:28.709> tank<00:03:29.310> sorry

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
have six pump six tank sorry

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.809 
have six pump six tank sorry
reservoirs<00:03:31.439> down<00:03:31.739> there<00:03:32.010> hooked<00:03:32.280> up<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.670> my

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
reservoirs down there hooked up to my

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.039 
reservoirs down there hooked up to my
pipeline<00:03:33.469> and<00:03:35.120> I've<00:03:36.120> modified<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.750> pump

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
pipeline and I've modified this pump

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.890 
pipeline and I've modified this pump
slightly<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:38.760> lift<00:03:38.969> it<00:03:39.120> up<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.689> see

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
slightly just lift it up so you can see

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.229 
slightly just lift it up so you can see
this<00:03:40.079> thing<00:03:40.349> and<00:03:40.590> put<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.280> steam<00:03:42.030> engine

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
this thing and put a steam engine

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.429 
this thing and put a steam engine
instead<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.230> redstone<00:03:44.209> engine<00:03:45.260> because<00:03:46.260> it

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
instead of a redstone engine because it

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.259 
instead of a redstone engine because it
didn't<00:03:46.859> seem<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:47.129> work<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.790> work<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.239> think

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
didn't seem to work to work I think

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.059 
didn't seem to work to work I think
might<00:03:48.719> have<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:48.930> been<00:03:49.049> too<00:03:49.260> slow<00:03:49.439> or<00:03:49.889> not

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
might have just been too slow or not

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.720 
might have just been too slow or not
enough<00:03:50.340> power

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
enough power

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.289 
enough power
I<00:03:50.879> can't<00:03:51.750> remember<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.409> yeah<00:03:52.799> so<00:03:53.099> put<00:03:53.969> a<00:03:54.030> steam

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
I can't remember but yeah so put a steam

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.039 
I can't remember but yeah so put a steam
engine<00:03:54.480> on<00:03:54.930> your<00:03:54.959> pump<00:03:56.060> put<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.209> fuel<00:03:57.449> in<00:03:57.540> and

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
engine on your pump put the fuel in and

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.020 
engine on your pump put the fuel in and
then

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.820 

there<00:04:02.330> we<00:04:02.420> go<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:03.819> this<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:04.940> what<00:04:05.090> happens<00:04:05.480> when

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
there we go so this is what happens when

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.559 
there we go so this is what happens when
you<00:04:06.830> first<00:04:07.069> start<00:04:10.000> when<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.090> first<00:04:11.270> start

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
you first start when you first start

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.360 
you first start when you first start
pumping<00:04:11.959> out<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:13.209> big<00:04:14.209> geyser<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:15.830> pumps<00:04:16.190> one

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
pumping out the big geyser it pumps one

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.550 
pumping out the big geyser it pumps one
source<00:04:16.700> block<00:04:16.970> at<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.239> time<00:04:17.540> which<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:17.870> this

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
source block at a time which is this

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.420 
source block at a time which is this
much<00:04:18.799> oil<00:04:20.169> and<00:04:21.169> then<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.500> has<00:04:21.680> to<00:04:21.859> lower<00:04:22.100> again

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
much oil and then it has to lower again

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.180 
much oil and then it has to lower again
another<00:04:25.430> source<00:04:25.790> block<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.630> then<00:04:27.070> pump<00:04:28.070> it

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
another source block and then pump it

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.750 
another source block and then pump it
out<00:04:28.280> again<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:30.320> first<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:30.889> can<00:04:31.250> take<00:04:31.550> a

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
out again so this first it can take a

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.180 
out again so this first it can take a
while

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.580 

and<00:04:36.550> this<00:04:36.790> is<00:04:37.000> very<00:04:37.300> far<00:04:37.600> wrong<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.050> take<00:04:38.380> what

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
and this is very far wrong so take what

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.200 
and this is very far wrong so take what
makes<00:04:41.590> quite<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> loud<00:04:41.980> noise<00:04:42.280> on<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.550> it's

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
makes quite a loud noise on it it's

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.980 
makes quite a loud noise on it it's
there<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:45.310> we<00:04:45.400> have<00:04:45.520> three<00:04:45.910> blocks<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.720> oil

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
there so we have three blocks of oil

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:55.410 
there so we have three blocks of oil
which<00:04:47.290> is<00:04:47.500> three<00:04:47.740> buckets<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.220> oil<00:04:49.290> so<00:04:50.290> far<00:04:54.420> but

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
which is three buckets of oil so far but

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.670 
which is three buckets of oil so far but
again<00:04:55.810> once<00:04:56.790> we<00:04:57.790> start<00:04:58.150> getting<00:04:58.630> a<00:04:58.990> nice<00:04:59.200> solid

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
again once we start getting a nice solid

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.050 
again once we start getting a nice solid
stream<00:05:00.010> okay<00:05:00.520> guys<00:05:00.760> so<00:05:01.120> we<00:05:01.420> are<00:05:01.450> back<00:05:01.870> and

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
stream okay guys so we are back and

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.200 
stream okay guys so we are back and
Boop's

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
Boop's

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.880 
Boop's
the<00:05:04.480> pump<00:05:04.960> has<00:05:05.610> got<00:05:06.610> all<00:05:06.820> of<00:05:07.120> this<00:05:07.300> oil<00:05:07.540> out<00:05:08.410> of

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
the pump has got all of this oil out of

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:18.560 
the pump has got all of this oil out of
here<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:11.440> now<00:05:13.230> slowly<00:05:14.310> making<00:05:15.310> its<00:05:15.610> way

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.380 

down<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.680> large<00:05:21.190> underground<00:05:21.790> reservoir

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
down to the large underground reservoir

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.500 
down to the large underground reservoir
so<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:23.050> is<00:05:23.140> doing<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.590> very<00:05:24.580> slow<00:05:24.940> bumpy

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
so it is doing that very slow bumpy

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.230 
so it is doing that very slow bumpy
thing<00:05:25.690> that<00:05:25.900> it<00:05:25.960> was<00:05:26.020> doing<00:05:26.260> before<00:05:26.410> but<00:05:27.090> we<00:05:28.090> do

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
thing that it was doing before but we do

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.520 
thing that it was doing before but we do
have<00:05:28.480> a<00:05:29.010> decent<00:05:30.010> amount<00:05:30.130> of<00:05:30.550> oil<00:05:31.320> you<00:05:32.320> know<00:05:32.440> our

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
have a decent amount of oil you know our

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.420 
have a decent amount of oil you know our
tanks<00:05:33.040> and<00:05:37.260> in<00:05:38.260> this<00:05:38.530> update<00:05:38.980> there's<00:05:39.370> a

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
tanks and in this update there's a

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.880 
tanks and in this update there's a
little<00:05:39.640> bug<00:05:39.820> where<00:05:40.260> little<00:05:41.260> bits<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.500> oil<00:05:41.650> can

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
little bug where little bits and oil can

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.820 
little bug where little bits and oil can
get<00:05:42.100> stuck<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:42.880> pipes<00:05:43.650> it's<00:05:44.650> a<00:05:44.680> bit

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
get stuck in the pipes it's a bit

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.700 
get stuck in the pipes it's a bit
annoying<00:05:45.130> but<00:05:45.520> you<00:05:45.670> know<00:05:45.930> plenty<00:05:46.930> of<00:05:47.140> oil<00:05:47.440> I'm

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
annoying but you know plenty of oil I'm

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.810 
annoying but you know plenty of oil I'm
probably<00:05:47.860> gonna<00:05:48.040> feel<00:05:48.280> all<00:05:48.460> these<00:05:48.580> tanks<00:05:48.850> up

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
probably gonna feel all these tanks up

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:57.720 
probably gonna feel all these tanks up
anyway<00:05:51.820> so<00:05:53.310> now<00:05:55.320> with<00:05:56.320> a<00:05:56.350> fairly<00:05:57.250> steady

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
anyway so now with a fairly steady

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.450 
anyway so now with a fairly steady
supply<00:05:58.240> of<00:05:58.660> oil

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.140 

we<00:06:02.850> will<00:06:03.060> build<00:06:03.300> something<00:06:03.780> useful<00:06:04.590> that<00:06:05.150> uses

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
we will build something useful that uses

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.290 
we will build something useful that uses
oil<00:06:07.910> cuz<00:06:08.910> that<00:06:09.240> makes<00:06:09.600> perfect<00:06:09.870> sense<00:06:10.140> so<00:06:11.300> I'll

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
oil cuz that makes perfect sense so I'll

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.480 
oil cuz that makes perfect sense so I'll
do<00:06:12.540> that<00:06:12.570> in<00:06:12.840> part<00:06:13.110> two<00:06:13.590> of<00:06:13.620> this<00:06:14.280> video

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
do that in part two of this video
