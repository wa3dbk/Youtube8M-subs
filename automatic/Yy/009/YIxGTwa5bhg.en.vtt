00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.740 
show you the wide viewing angle you can
see<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.500> clearly<00:02:30.000> IPS<00:02:31.000> screen<00:02:31.150> which<00:02:31.510> means

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
see it clearly IPS screen which means

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.430 
see it clearly IPS screen which means
it's<00:02:31.900> anti<00:02:32.230> glare<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:36.069> let's<00:02:37.060> see<00:02:37.329> i<00:02:37.599> think<00:02:38.290> we

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
it's anti glare and let's see i think we

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:51.030 
it's anti glare and let's see i think we
already<00:02:38.590> went<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.310> deals<00:02:39.579> Prime<00:02:40.560> let's<00:02:41.560> see

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.660 

so<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:52.390> actually<00:02:52.569> just<00:02:52.780> did<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.019> search<00:02:53.319> for

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
so we actually just did a search for

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.399 
so we actually just did a search for
zenfone<00:02:54.670> 6<00:02:56.040> zenfone<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.400> 62<00:02:58.329> different<00:02:58.480> like

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
zenfone 6 zenfone and 62 different like

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.309 
zenfone 6 zenfone and 62 different like
separate<00:02:59.799> don't<00:03:00.010> know<00:03:00.370> type<00:03:00.549> in<00:03:00.700> min<00:03:00.819> together

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
separate don't know type in min together

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:09.240 
separate don't know type in min together
so<00:03:02.319> let's<00:03:02.379> write<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.769> that<00:03:08.010> here<00:03:09.010> are<00:03:09.069> some

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
so let's write like that here are some

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.619

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
again it's in Chinese though so I kind

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.259 
again it's in Chinese though so I kind
of<00:03:33.790> translated<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.569> for<00:03:34.599> everyone<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.120> yeah

stars

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.120 

not<00:03:48.940> really<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.319> guess<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.950> one<00:03:51.069> thing

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
not really but I guess the one thing

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.100 
not really but I guess the one thing
that<00:03:51.310> could<00:03:51.640> maybe<00:03:51.819> have<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.959> could

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
that could maybe have is is it could

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.800 
that could maybe have is is it could
have<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:54.930> higher<00:03:56.069> pixel<00:03:57.450> megapixel<00:03:58.450> camera<00:03:58.750> on

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
have a higher pixel megapixel camera on

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.360 
have a higher pixel megapixel camera on
the<00:03:58.870> front<00:03:59.050> so<00:03:59.380> like<00:03:59.530> two<00:03:59.650> megapixel<00:03:59.890> camera

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
the front so like two megapixel camera

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.490 
the front so like two megapixel camera
on<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.489> front<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.390> yeah<00:04:01.569> for<00:04:01.750> some<00:04:01.840> reason<00:04:01.900> TVs

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
on the front so yeah for some reason TVs

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.460 
on the front so yeah for some reason TVs
not<00:04:02.650> loading<00:04:03.040> over<00:04:03.280> here<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:04.360> guess<00:04:05.319> we'll

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
not loading over here so I guess we'll

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.729 
not loading over here so I guess we'll
just<00:04:05.530> uh<00:04:05.800> ran<00:04:06.610> up<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:06.880> review<00:04:07.349> here<00:04:08.349> I'll<00:04:08.590> just

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
just uh ran up the review here I'll just

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.900 
just uh ran up the review here I'll just
there<00:04:09.069> you<00:04:09.160> go<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.370> go<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:09.970> Google<00:04:11.760> it's<00:04:12.760> not

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
there you go to go to Google it's not

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.220 
there you go to go to Google it's not
really<00:04:13.060> many<00:04:13.330> sites<00:04:13.660> we<00:04:13.810> can<00:04:13.959> go<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.260> hear

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.719 

actually<00:04:20.230> it<00:04:20.979> was<00:04:21.010> probably<00:04:21.400> going<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.669> be

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
actually it was probably going to be

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:43.390 
actually it was probably going to be
okay<00:04:22.000> either

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.719 

it<00:04:44.360> looks<00:04:44.509> like<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.690> lot<00:04:44.870> of<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.199> new<00:04:46.040> sites<00:04:46.370> are
