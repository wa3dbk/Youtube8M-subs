00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 today we're not going to do a teeth whitening that we're going to do live 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.860
 when talking about the meadows 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.970
 and the cons 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.679
 that has this release 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.200
 everything is that such but as a little author I see 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.020
 rejuvenates a lot having a smile 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.459
 blanquita no 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.609
 good to have a French blanquita and time to hit rejuvenates a lot is to have 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.380
 all your teeth well aligned well placed and that serve you 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.369
 Really 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.259
 for what they serve that chewing nothing to eat 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 not have cavities 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 lack 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.700
 or gum disease 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.280
 is to try to preserve the greatest 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.260
 possible time the holidays that are our 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.930
 although now there are many crown repositioning bridges this ctera but the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.310
 Take care of your mouth keep in mind mari what the mouth is the inc the door of 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.600
 entrance of the organism a healthy mouth 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.980
 will not only make it heal from the pharynx the amygdala, even the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.180
 stomach like that does not chew well 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 I have had problems stomach problems a bad obturation when 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.370
 Chew badly we can not have problems in the temporomandibular joint 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.230
 efe having decay or infection in the mouth can result from the fall of the 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.580
 hair like we were talking about recently the bad breath the loss of the of the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.580
 tooth piece even appreciate in the heart 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.280
 very important part and within it and the aesthetic part that is having these 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 they are white laugh I think more than white 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.250
 white lean 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.869
 is having teeth without spots 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.310
 within the color that we have each of our dentin and people who do not have a 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 little bit more pure and other people who have it a little bit clearer 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.360
 that's what I think is what aesthetics really was and then the smile no longer 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.630
 we are seeing how I do not work as a team 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.329
 the hospital quirón to what extent this morning closed live that 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:57.460
 demonstration 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.770
 not in can not be done 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.899
 without medical review we want to put a lot of emphasis on this because poet 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.420
 naviego for health 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.880
 the acer notwithstanding winds and good 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.720
 you are embraced by interpreters and that you use a series of compounds 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.079
 aggressive 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.709
 aggressive not so much for the client as for the energy and if we have 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.409
 to affection of the background gum a civilian agent that is a lot of people have 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.359
 limit and does not know that you have to decide whether so far that you will eat bread and 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:32.349
 record a gain you have to have very good gum quality you have to 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.310
 go through the dentist who will guide you and tell you what kind of 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.340
 approaches or how to do it because those products 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.749
 that have reflective bands present for the apparent bues of the band 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.390
 every time we're all going to see what we're talking about 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.089
 it did not wake up modern 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.129
 on-site 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.250
 it is proceeding to the same to this 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.349
 feel that you set 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 or dental we are going to put here 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.719
 Thank you so much for coming this morning 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.329
 and right now at what time we got good now I'm going to be an island 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.049
 while it's essential because as the doctor said 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.260
 that in abrasive products that can cause burns and tissues 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.879
 soft because they are a product are prepared for 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.959
 sharpen survivor world 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.829
 then the first thing we do 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.799
 It is a consultation to assess which has the healthy teeth and gums 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.829
 and from that moment we can start working 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.079
 by ciarán we just do is place peroxides that are really what I was going 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.509
 to produce the release of the tooth 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.469
 and we will activate it with a light the being this laser light what it is going to do is 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.989
 enhance the effect of the year 200 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.089
 chrysler 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:40.429
 so 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:43.709
 We apply business methods iese 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.410
 the product that really 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.450
 that is the project that raises whitening this attitude 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.059
 then they pay 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:55.049
 with laser light you can not you can not look at people's new grindstone 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.209
 bad smells of the web 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.389
 dozens of them work together / exactly 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.009
 I do not ask anything else the patient does not get glasses 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.699
 everything closes your eyes earth the local mental society can not look 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:11.609
 directly to the trip directly to what is reflected the good people in that 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.609
 act that affect has light on the tooth because one can think 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.650
 it is good to wear the enamel veneers 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.920
 it is an approach 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.139
 so aggressive he could take 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.610
 the veneers 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.620
 I will not be cuddling 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.940
 so networks treats the western variant in which the enamel the 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.889
 tooth if tooth enamel 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.289
 there is no structural alteration and hardness 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.280
 there is not the 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.780
 it is an immediate treatment 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.430
 because what we do with this with this device 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.310
 percent is to activate and enhance the effect then we when the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.319
 patient in the hospital quirón 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.519
 what we do is in a single session in just one hour 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.009
 she would be made to lie she has her teeth bank and we are going to 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.130
 give a home treatment with speculation this what we want 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.800
 get is the maximum level of whitening to ensure the 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.529
 success 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:05.759
 and how long a whitening lasts 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.919
 It costs to understand what is behind 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.860
 According to your parental habits of tobacco, parental leave 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.910
 see it anderlecht and that we are also using bedoya 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.339
 there is a graveyard that does an enhance the effect 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.279
 of the first group of 30 years that can not be done 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:27.269
 the legend says that he is going to make lara that he has been on the ladder is a good 

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:29.259
 candidate to present to the world 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.680
 it is clear starting from a state of health 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.309
 dental health gingival essalud in the part of that moment we can do to 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.490
 everyone to all patients 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.580
 the repressor schedule of the town hall people with medical treatment not 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.370
 they have problem 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.949
 no there is no complication 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.979
 much less when they consult for fear that their intention will not achieve only that 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.889
 yes you have to take into consideration that during the launch time there 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.319
 you can take foods that produce staining 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.490
 so that the entity is more respect that we have interest in coffee that amount 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.110
 of people feel precedent while it lasts this is the dental approach 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.639
 yes no ap other 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.919
 to another type of 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.339
 The treatment is also can be done 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.160
 if we can simply do outpatient treatment 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.529
 or we can deal with this kind of light 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:15.889
 the kind of those who are not 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.029
 to the heat that is going to make it potent 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.310
 but in any case 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.830
 between the teeth they stay 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.389
 targets of asilar to that most of these people get far behind in the 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.690
 quirón hospital 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.200
 Most of the patients that come to us are referred by their own 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.120
 patients that we have to go really happy leave and this usually does not 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.940
 we do not have anything given I do it relaxed is in the middle of a thunderous and 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.680
 diverted invited the entity the only thing that produces in some houses is something of 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.360
 sensitivity that when you finish the treatment disappears this sensitivity 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.159
 come down 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.729
 is the only complication of July the transcendent 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.629
 Well, I believe that fast and effective treatment does not require local anesthesia 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:01.370
 no one or nothing is not punctured the work is not punctured 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.750
 this way they use device terminals of these denunciations since we have nothing nothing bad 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.010
 invasive is not a minor fact that the mind does not behave luminous 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.949
 dentist 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.880
 We can not do it without ivu without any problem and not paid to give the grace 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:17.960
 erc for having been here and especially for this one 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.419
 between demonstration of whitening 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:21.949
 oo dental 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:26.169
 right now but we are not going to separately but I of course from those of 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:28.849
 up and a little bit more white than the ones below 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.550
 if that dark side of a home an applause to be almost 

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:35.279
 make
