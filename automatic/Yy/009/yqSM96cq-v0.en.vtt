00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
losing this one which is not a typical

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.220 
losing this one which is not a typical
at<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.620> moment<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.160> pretty<00:03:22.030> constant<00:03:22.630> the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
at the moment it's pretty constant the

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.259 
at the moment it's pretty constant the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
losing of matches a lot of people are

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.240 
losing of matches a lot of people are
just<00:03:25.510> trying<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.200> figure<00:03:26.350> out<00:03:26.590> how<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.040> play

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
just trying to figure out how to play

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.449 
just trying to figure out how to play
the<00:03:27.459> game<00:03:27.580> i<00:03:27.640> guess<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.360> not<00:03:29.280> really<00:03:30.280> paying

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
the game i guess and not really paying

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.530 
the game i guess and not really paying
attention<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:31.299> ptfo<00:03:32.049> at<00:03:32.410> all<00:03:32.590> our<00:03:33.519> ptfo<00:03:34.299> does

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
attention to ptfo at all our ptfo does

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.650 
attention to ptfo at all our ptfo does
just<00:03:35.049> doesn't<00:03:35.320> work<00:03:35.560> on<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.430> attack<00:03:36.730> it<00:03:37.090> is

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
just doesn't work on the attack it is

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.760 
just doesn't work on the attack it is
also<00:03:37.840> relevant<00:03:38.350> on<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.680> defense

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
also relevant on the defense

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.620 
also relevant on the defense
now<00:03:40.340> I<00:03:40.370> consider<00:03:40.790> myself<00:03:41.030> more<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.510> a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
now I consider myself more of a

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.660 
now I consider myself more of a
defensive<00:03:41.750> player<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.440> do<00:03:42.500> like<00:03:42.920> a<00:03:42.950> defense<00:03:43.490> and

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
defensive player I do like a defense and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.080 
defensive player I do like a defense and
I<00:03:43.970> do<00:03:44.030> quite<00:03:44.480> well<00:03:44.510> on<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.870> defense<00:03:45.910> ptfo<00:03:46.910> when

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
I do quite well on a defense ptfo when

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.090 
I do quite well on a defense ptfo when
the<00:03:47.180> defense<00:03:47.630> means<00:03:47.960> clearing<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.650> enemy

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
the defense means clearing that enemy

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.120 
the defense means clearing that enemy
present<00:03:50.090> out<00:03:50.270> of<00:03:50.330> Europe<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:51.140> guess<00:03:51.740> they<00:03:51.890> call

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
present out of Europe I guess they call

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.100 
present out of Europe I guess they call
