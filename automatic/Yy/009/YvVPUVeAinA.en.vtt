00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
other reviews but since reviewing this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.080 
other reviews but since reviewing this
I've<00:00:27.330> used<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:27.930> about<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.140> week<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:29.099> my

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
I've used it for about a week and in my

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.519 
I've used it for about a week and in my
opinion<00:00:30.210> I've<00:00:30.630> never<00:00:30.810> had<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.289> can

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
opinion I've never had one that can

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.830 
opinion I've never had one that can
compare<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> glass<00:00:33.600> screen

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
compare so this is a glass screen

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.470 
compare so this is a glass screen
protector<00:00:34.559> let<00:00:35.489> me<00:00:35.610> flip<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> over<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
protector let me flip it over here and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
protector let me flip it over here and
show<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.170> 9h<00:00:37.649> hardness<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.370> it's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
show you it's a 9h hardness so it's

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
show you it's a 9h hardness so it's
harder<00:00:38.940> than<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.270> typical<00:00:39.450> glass<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.440> it's

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
harder than your typical glass so it's

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.100 
harder than your typical glass so it's
super<00:00:40.920> strong<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.520> fact<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.180> says<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.540> 2<00:00:42.600> times

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
super strong in fact it says now 2 times

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.670 
super strong in fact it says now 2 times
stronger<00:00:43.700> it's<00:00:44.700> about<00:00:45.120> forty<00:00:45.809> dollars<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
stronger it's about forty dollars so it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
stronger it's about forty dollars so it
is<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> little<00:00:47.219> bit<00:00:47.370> pricey<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.660> i<00:00:48.809> said

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
is a little bit pricey but like i said

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.500 
is a little bit pricey but like i said
it's<00:00:49.170> by<00:00:49.350> far<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.649> favorite<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> get

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
it's by far my favorite so what you get

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
it's by far my favorite so what you get
with<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.199> glass<00:00:52.469> screen<00:00:52.829> protector

only<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.299> disadvantages<00:01:09.659> i<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> having

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
only two disadvantages i see to having

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.280 
only two disadvantages i see to having
glass<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.460> screen<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> those<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
glass on the screen and one of those is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
glass on the screen and one of those is
it's<00:01:13.799> extremely<00:01:14.460> difficult<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
it's extremely difficult to get it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.230 
it's extremely difficult to get it
perfect<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.080> once<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> best

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
perfect and once you do it's the best

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.899 
perfect and once you do it's the best
thing<00:01:18.360> you've<00:01:18.600> had<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.530> second<00:01:19.950> thing<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.580> if

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
thing you've had the second thing is if

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
thing you've had the second thing is if
you<00:01:21.840> drop<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> has<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.950> potential<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you drop it it has the potential to

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.390 
you drop it it has the potential to
break<00:01:24.229> unlike<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.439> screen<00:01:25.860> protectors

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
break unlike other screen protectors

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580 
break unlike other screen protectors
that<00:01:26.600> might<00:01:27.600> hold<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:28.200> phone<00:01:28.380> together

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that might hold your phone together

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
that might hold your phone together
better<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.280> i<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.579> haven't<00:01:29.939> had<00:01:30.060> any

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
better but i actually haven't had any

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
better but i actually haven't had any
issues<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.869> far<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.380> goes<00:01:31.520> now<00:01:32.520> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
issues as far as this goes now this

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
very difficult to scratch I've bumped it

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.830 
very difficult to scratch I've bumped it
into<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.459> sorts<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.909> things<00:02:24.120> keys<00:02:24.569> or

into all sorts of things keys or

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.869 
into all sorts of things keys or
whatever<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.310> doesn't<00:02:26.640> scratch

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
whatever and it just doesn't scratch

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.630 
whatever and it just doesn't scratch
it's<00:02:27.569> held<00:02:27.870> up<00:02:27.989> really<00:02:28.230> well<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.739> can<00:02:29.340> barely

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
it's held up really well you can barely

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.849 
it's held up really well you can barely
tell<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.299> there<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:31.290> noticed<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
tell that it's there I have noticed it's

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.500 
tell that it's there I have noticed it's
it<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.430> thicker<00:02:32.700> than<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:33.060> couple<00:02:33.299> different

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
it is thicker than a couple different

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.899 
it is thicker than a couple different
glass<00:02:34.140> screen<00:02:34.500> protectors<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.579> because<00:02:35.879> of

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
glass screen protectors but because of

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.250 
glass screen protectors but because of
this<00:02:36.090> bevel<00:02:36.359> edge<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:36.930> don't<00:02:37.109> notice

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
this bevel edge you really don't notice

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.960 
this bevel edge you really don't notice
it<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.739> let<00:02:37.920> me<00:02:38.040> bring<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.370> up<00:02:38.459> really<00:02:38.730> close

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
it but let me bring it up really close

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.009 
it but let me bring it up really close
so<00:02:39.299> maybe<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.629> can<00:02:39.750> see<00:02:40.099> how<00:02:41.099> thick<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.519> is

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
so maybe you can see how thick it is

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.300 
so maybe you can see how thick it is
there's<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.290> edge<00:02:43.439> of<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.769> glass<00:02:43.950> screen

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
there's the edge of the glass screen

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.679 
there's the edge of the glass screen
protector<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:44.849> don't<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.150> how<00:02:45.359> well<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.540> can

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
protector I don't know how well you can

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.899 
protector I don't know how well you can
see<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.049> but<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:46.920> got<00:02:47.069> kind<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.489> little

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
see that but it's got kind of a little

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.089 
see that but it's got kind of a little
different<00:02:48.780> hue<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.139> it<00:02:49.170> than<00:02:49.439> the<00:02:49.560> black<00:02:49.799> here

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
different hue to it than the black here

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.800 
different hue to it than the black here
and<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:51.269> really<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:52.049> very<00:02:52.139> nice<00:02:52.620> it's

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
and it really is very nice it's

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.119 
and it really is very nice it's
incredibly<00:02:54.810> nice<00:02:55.079> to<00:02:55.260> use<00:02:55.439> its<00:02:55.739> super

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
incredibly nice to use its super

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.020 
incredibly nice to use its super
transparent<00:02:56.909> so<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.930> like<00:02:58.079> using<00:02:58.409> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
transparent so it's just like using the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.530 
transparent so it's just like using the
the<00:03:00.030> screen<00:03:00.659> itself<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.760> super<00:03:02.760> slippery<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
the screen itself and super slippery and

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.390 
the screen itself and super slippery and
you<00:03:03.599> don't<00:03:04.349> even<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.709> it's<00:03:04.889> there<00:03:04.980> other

than this little indent so I definitely

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.280 
than this little indent so I definitely
recommend<00:03:08.159> checking<00:03:08.549> these<00:03:09.000> out<00:03:09.180> by<00:03:09.659> far<00:03:10.049> my

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
favorite just because of this bevel edge

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.770 
favorite just because of this bevel edge
and<00:03:17.069> how<00:03:17.189> clear<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.699> is<00:03:17.760> one<00:03:18.449> thing<00:03:18.629> I<00:03:18.750> forgot

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
and how clear it is one thing I forgot

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.110 
and how clear it is one thing I forgot
to<00:03:19.049> share<00:03:19.319> though<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.769> thought<00:03:20.099> maybe<00:03:20.909> it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
to share though that I thought maybe it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.640 
to share though that I thought maybe it
would<00:03:21.269> have<00:03:21.359> been<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.569> pain<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:21.989> neck<00:03:22.169> but<00:03:22.470> I

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
would have been a pain in the neck but I

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.309 
would have been a pain in the neck but I
really<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:24.329> actually<00:03:24.449> says<00:03:24.870> armors
