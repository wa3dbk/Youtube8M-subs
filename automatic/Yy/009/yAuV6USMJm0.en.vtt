00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the problems like that that I've had had

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.100 
the problems like that that I've had had
with<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> laptop<00:01:04.680> let<00:01:05.159> me<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.729> open<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.299> up

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.020

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
so the problems I had with this laptop I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.649 
so the problems I had with this laptop I
would<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.689> turn<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.210> only<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> power

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
would just turn it on and only the power

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
would just turn it on and only the power
light<00:01:16.290> would<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.680> come<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.040> nothing<00:01:17.790> else

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
light would just come on nothing else

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.010 
light would just come on nothing else
would<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.799> happen<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:20.729> even<00:01:21.090> these

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
would actually happen not even these

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.480 
would actually happen not even these
little<00:01:22.290> things<00:01:22.500> will<00:01:22.650> fly<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.369> neither

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

little things will fly it up and neither
will<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.240> light<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> motherboard<00:01:25.700> will

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700

that<00:01:36.170> last<00:01:37.170> night<00:01:37.320> while<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.150> went<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> bed<00:01:39.530> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that last night while I went to bed and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.340 
that last night while I went to bed and
I<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.619> let<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> sit<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:42.079> until<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.140> woke

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
I just let it sit like that until I woke

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.460 
I just let it sit like that until I woke
up<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.680> morning<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.320> turned<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
up this morning and I turned it off and

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
up this morning and I turned it off and
let<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> sit<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.799> about<00:01:50.070> five<00:01:50.430> seconds<00:01:50.909> turned

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
let it sit for about five seconds turned

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.179 
let it sit for about five seconds turned
it<00:01:51.439> back<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:56.280> laptop<00:01:56.520> works<00:01:56.939> again

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
it back on and this laptop works again

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.620 
it back on and this laptop works again
hmm<00:01:59.189> doesn't<00:01:59.790> make<00:02:00.030> sense

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
hmm doesn't make sense

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.380 
hmm doesn't make sense
so<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.920> got<00:02:03.220> two<00:02:03.430> working<00:02:03.610> laptops<00:02:04.240> now<00:02:06.390> so

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
so I got two working laptops now so

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.550 
so I got two working laptops now so
let's<00:02:08.200> see<00:02:08.350> if<00:02:08.470> it'll<00:02:08.619> actually<00:02:08.890> do<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:11.410> I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
let's see if it'll actually do it if I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.140 
let's see if it'll actually do it if I
turn<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.950> on

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:25.440 

yep<00:02:16.150> looky<00:02:16.540> there

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.170 

well<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.590> like<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.860> did<00:02:27.069> back<00:02:27.610> when<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.849> bought

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
well just like it did back when I bought

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:50.740 
well just like it did back when I bought
this<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.569> 2008<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:31.140> can't<00:02:32.140> believe<00:02:32.380> this

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.560 

and<00:02:51.040> surprisingly<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.160> battery<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.120> far<00:02:53.360> it's

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
and surprisingly the battery so far it's

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.320 
and surprisingly the battery so far it's
holding<00:02:53.870> up<00:02:54.020> on<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> charge<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:55.060> tried<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.150> turn

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
holding up on a charge I tried to turn

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.510 
holding up on a charge I tried to turn
it<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.600> with<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.470> battery<00:02:57.770> still<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.280> and

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
it on with the battery still in it and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.140 
it on with the battery still in it and
the<00:02:59.030> battery<00:02:59.360> was<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.810> completely<00:03:00.200> dead

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
the battery was just completely dead

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.490 
the battery was just completely dead
after<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:02.840> sitting<00:03:03.770> for<00:03:04.190> nearly<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.330> year<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:08.500> I

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
after just sitting for nearly a year I I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.980 
after just sitting for nearly a year I I
just<00:03:10.250> decided<00:03:10.880> just<00:03:11.000> for<00:03:11.270> all<00:03:11.390> giggles<00:03:11.750> just

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
just decided just for all giggles just

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.570 
just decided just for all giggles just
to<00:03:12.200> see<00:03:12.800> if<00:03:12.920> it<00:03:13.070> would<00:03:14.440> still<00:03:15.440> work<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.980> had<00:03:16.400> my

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
to see if it would still work I had my

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.900 
to see if it would still work I had my
doubts<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.210> would<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:18.520> just<00:03:19.520> can't

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
doubts that it would I just can't

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:38.000 
doubts that it would I just can't
believe<00:03:20.150> this

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:04:12.940 

I'm<00:03:38.610> just<00:03:38.909> waiting<00:03:39.209> for<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.569> do<00:03:39.689> its<00:03:39.720> thing

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.700 

yeah<00:04:13.790> kind<00:04:14.270> of<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.930> does<00:04:15.110> takes<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:15.530> little

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
yeah kind of it does takes a little

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.310 
yeah kind of it does takes a little
while<00:04:17.709> unlike<00:04:18.709> this<00:04:18.920> one<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.310> one<00:04:19.489> is<00:04:19.670> much

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
while unlike this one this one is much

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:39.200 
while unlike this one this one is much
faster

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249 
and of course you can tell much

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:10.049 
and of course you can tell much
differences<00:06:07.849> on<00:06:08.029> both<00:06:08.330> of<00:06:08.479> the<00:06:08.599> computers

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:10.059 
differences on both of the computers

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:17.249 
differences on both of the computers
this<00:06:11.059> one's<00:06:11.300> much<00:06:11.479> smaller<00:06:11.869> than<00:06:12.699> this<00:06:13.699> one

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:27.540 

this<00:06:18.259> one<00:06:18.529> here<00:06:19.129> is<00:06:22.959> fourteen<00:06:23.959> point<00:06:24.319> one<00:06:24.379> inch

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.439 

and<00:06:28.550> I<00:06:28.669> think<00:06:28.879> that<00:06:29.119> one<00:06:29.360> there<00:06:29.659> I<00:06:30.789> look<00:06:31.789> at<00:06:31.909> box

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
and I think that one there I look at box

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:40.610 
and I think that one there I look at box
it's<00:06:32.719> a<00:06:32.919> 15.6<00:06:33.919> inch<00:06:34.389> screen

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.280

and see and this one's got the the
windows<00:06:43.620> 8<00:06:43.919> and<00:06:45.260> this<00:06:46.260> has<00:06:46.500> the<00:06:46.800> older<00:06:47.450> Windows

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
windows 8 and this has the older Windows

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:57.260 
windows 8 and this has the older Windows
Vista<00:06:54.290> yeah<00:06:55.520> says<00:06:56.520> right<00:06:56.760> there<00:06:56.790> Windows

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
Vista before he got replaced by Windows

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:05.260 
Vista before he got replaced by Windows
7<00:07:01.970> and<00:07:02.970> then<00:07:03.120> Windows<00:07:03.419> 7<00:07:03.810> got<00:07:03.930> replaced<00:07:04.200> by

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
7 and then Windows 7 got replaced by

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:11.710 
7 and then Windows 7 got replaced by
Windows<00:07:06.270> 8<00:07:06.480> which<00:07:06.690> I<00:07:06.900> really<00:07:07.169> love<00:07:07.350> Windows<00:07:07.710> 8

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
so cool so I'll probably just have this

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.740 
so cool so I'll probably just have this
has<00:07:17.220> a<00:07:17.510> backup<00:07:18.680> computer<00:07:20.240> like<00:07:21.240> in<00:07:21.389> case<00:07:21.570> if

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
has a backup computer like in case if

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.770 
has a backup computer like in case if
something<00:07:22.020> would<00:07:22.260> go<00:07:22.669> wrong<00:07:23.669> with<00:07:24.120> this<00:07:24.450> one

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
something would go wrong with this one

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.550 
something would go wrong with this one
here<00:07:25.290> and<00:07:25.919> I've<00:07:26.880> never<00:07:27.030> had<00:07:27.330> any<00:07:28.110> issues<00:07:28.530> with
