00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.290
 hello how are you welcome to anyone 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.470
 pretty dotcom how did it go with the 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.210
 topic that I expressed to you in the consultation 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.450
 previous on the winter partition 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.750
 very clear truth very well now we are going to 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.640
 see what would happen if we 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.340
 we see a deviated septum 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.300
 at the moment that deviated depends on the 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.730
 where the deviation is when 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.759
 Beech comes behind the minimum partition 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.699
 that almost disturbed us the nasal function 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.739
 the disturbance will be minimal and in 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.430
 these cases where the deviation is so 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:44.600
 severe in that even the pyramid 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.670
 nasal moves or moves and it shows 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.850
 a deviation from the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.600
 partition with displacement to the pyramid 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.030
 nasal in these cases 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 many times still without displacement the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.180
 nasal pyramid are of with septum 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.489
 deflected 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.949
 the patient who is going to be 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.920
 you can submit we oppose what 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.140
 publication and I could understand well then 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.600
 a deviation of the partition here we can 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.740
 see in a special also how 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.560
 severe as this may happen look 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.990
 the facial anomalies the anomalies that 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.840
 forgiveness will happen at the level of the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.580
 nasal cavity the side turbinate 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.090
 right little one 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.570
 cornet the immense left side in the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.990
 large small lower turbinates of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.630
 another side this black space that we see 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.220
 here the air that is coming in here is 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.180
 a little more space look at you 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.160
 here the air enters and collapses that 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.940
 truncates the passage of air in this pit 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.460
 nasal how to breathe this patient 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.860
 logically that evil will breathe will 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.320
 sleep with open mouth will start in 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.240
 the nights can present without light 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.430
 indicates induce here we are already seeing 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.310
 very well the complication that presents itself 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.770
 having this this truncated step of the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.110
 air is no longer good oxygenation is 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 say no maxilla and we start to see it 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.910
 in a friction of the mucosa of the same 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.550
 that here on the other side a birth 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.260
 in the mucosa the maxillae then the 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.020
 complications that will arise in a 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.380
 patient at the salt level logically 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.480
 dysfunction of the function until nobody 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.670
 it works until you can not breathe very 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 well the patient 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.190
 low can have calista pains going to 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.400
 have sinusitis 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.720
 and asia marginalize the portal with such 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.670
 pendular 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.680
 the patient goes to sleep with an open mouth 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.590
 of snoring at night and like the mouth 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.930
 it was not made to breathe then this 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.270
 air is not going to be filtered anymore it's not going to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.930
 being moistened or heated is no longer going to 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.270
 have optimal conditions to be able 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.820
 move to the upper respiratory tract 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.980
 then this air will cause us 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.320
 can cause infections also to 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.650
 bronco pulmonary level will cook us 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.810
 pharyngitis tonsillitis some openings 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.660
 the strict one of the tonsils that when 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.880
 the patient swallows their food they go 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.880
 to deposit within transcriptase 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.620
 vitamins food remains more saliva 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.990
 more the bacteria that live in the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.480
 throat and the famous space are formed 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.950
 that gives the patient bad breath 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.710
 then look at you 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.870
 complications that may have 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.850
 including many times until pictures to 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.210
 level of the ears there is not a good 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.210
 ventilation 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.920
 this in some patients feeling of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.290
 deafness in some patients then 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.500
 there are many complications that go to 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.680
 occur at this center's level 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.740
 facial which is the nose if a septum or 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.410
 dish table does not work of beautiful tenaris 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.830
 if it does not have a good function then 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:59.130
 the cute nose must be correlated 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.610
 with a good nasal function to avoid 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.650
 the consequences of this deviation from 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.890
 partition 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.129
 I hope you serve this information as 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.280
