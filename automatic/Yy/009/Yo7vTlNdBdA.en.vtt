00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.920 

when<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.880> came<00:00:21.030> out<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.270> Saint<00:00:21.480> row<00:00:21.630> one

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
when we came out with Saint row one

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.690 
when we came out with Saint row one
there<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.830> weren't<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.100> many<00:00:23.340> open

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
there really weren't that many open

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.580 
there really weren't that many open
world<00:00:23.880> games<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.240> were<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.450> there<00:00:24.690> and<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
world games that were out there and I

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.140 
world games that were out there and I
think<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.950> at<00:00:26.100> this<00:00:26.130> point<00:00:26.520> in<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.730> industry

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
think that at this point in the industry

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.700 
think that at this point in the industry
it's<00:00:27.510> pretty<00:00:27.780> tough<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> come<00:00:28.260> up<00:00:28.290> with<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.560> game

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it's pretty tough to come up with a game

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.500 
it's pretty tough to come up with a game
that<00:00:28.890> really<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.310> unlike<00:00:29.760> anything<00:00:30.000> else<00:00:30.270> out

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
that really is unlike anything else out

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.590 
that really is unlike anything else out
there

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.209 

that's<00:00:34.199> one<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.469> things<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.859> I<00:00:35.010> think

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that's one of the things that I think

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.830 
that's one of the things that I think
the<00:00:35.460> people<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.820> always<00:00:35.969> loved<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.539> Saint

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the people have always loved about Saint

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
the people have always loved about Saint
row<00:00:37.050> there's<00:00:37.829> nothing<00:00:38.160> else<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.550> in

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
row there's nothing else like that in

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459 
row there's nothing else like that in
terms<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.300> tone<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.899> terms<00:00:40.109> of<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
terms of the tone in terms of all the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
terms of the tone in terms of all the
options<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.640> over-the-top<00:00:42.030> nature<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
options and the over-the-top nature of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.380 
options and the over-the-top nature of
everything<00:00:43.489> put<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.519> your<00:00:44.670> tampons<00:00:45.089> and<00:00:45.239> let's

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
everything put in your tampons and let's

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.640 
everything put in your tampons and let's
do<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.680 

it's<00:00:50.220> kind<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.520> improv<00:00:51.000> building<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.570> top

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's kind of like improv building on top

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's kind of like improv building on top
of<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.740> take<00:00:52.950> a<00:00:53.010> step

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of it and then you can I take a step

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.310 
of it and then you can I take a step
back<00:00:53.400> and<00:00:53.430> look<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.880> what<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.120> created

and have the game Eve all but evolve in
such<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.430> way<00:01:52.580> that<00:01:52.610> doesn't<00:01:52.820> animate<00:01:53.149> them

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
such a way that doesn't animate them

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.790 
such a way that doesn't animate them
that<00:01:53.720> makes<00:01:53.840> them<00:01:53.960> feel<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.259> they're<00:01:54.440> part

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
that makes them feel that they're part

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.200 
that makes them feel that they're part
of<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.920> journey<00:01:55.130> rather<00:01:55.640> than<00:01:55.850> being<00:01:56.149> forced

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
of the journey rather than being forced

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.969 
of the journey rather than being forced
to<00:01:56.630> come<00:01:56.750> along<00:01:56.960> for<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.200> ride<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.380> never<00:01:57.619> wanted

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
to come along for a ride I never wanted

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.950 
to come along for a ride I never wanted
is<00:01:58.670> something<00:01:58.970> that's<00:01:59.030> very<00:01:59.149> important<00:01:59.869> to<00:01:59.899> us

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.149 

it<00:02:04.960> takes<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.200> lot<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.409> work<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.799> make<00:02:05.829> something

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
it takes a lot of work to make something

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.210 
it takes a lot of work to make something
that's<00:02:06.280> beautifully<00:02:06.789> stupid
