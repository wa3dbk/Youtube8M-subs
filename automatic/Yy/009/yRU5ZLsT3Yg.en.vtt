because a few weeks ago if you do
remember<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.219> officials<00:00:41.760> would<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:41.910> be

putting Daniel Bryan into the match

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.029 
putting Daniel Bryan into the match
itself<00:00:44.270> but<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:45.450> plans<00:00:45.989> possibly<00:00:46.680> could<00:00:47.010> have

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
itself but now plans possibly could have

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.610 
itself but now plans possibly could have
changed<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.360> reason<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.379> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
changed now the reason that I this is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
changed now the reason that I this is
kind<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> big<00:00:50.160> deal<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.640> one<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.210> thought<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
kind of a big deal is one I thought it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:52.910 
kind of a big deal is one I thought it
would<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.230> been<00:00:52.289> better<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
would have been better just to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
would have been better just to
completely<00:00:53.579> keep<00:00:53.820> Roman<00:00:54.180> reigns<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.660> main

completely keep Roman reigns in the main
event<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.320> maybe<00:00:55.559> go<00:00:55.680> heal<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.120> completely

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
event and maybe go heal or completely

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.450 
event and maybe go heal or completely
take<00:00:57.420> him<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> possibly<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:59.010> cost<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
take him out and possibly be cost the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.670 
take him out and possibly be cost the
match<00:00:59.609> by<00:00:59.850> Seth<00:01:00.149> Rollins<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:01.260> way<00:01:01.440> Seth

go<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:40.320> let<00:01:40.560> Daniel<00:01:40.860> Bryan<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> main

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
go to let Daniel Bryan be in the main

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.010 
go to let Daniel Bryan be in the main
event<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> spot<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.659> maybe<00:01:42.869> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
event have the spot and then maybe you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
event have the spot and then maybe you
have<00:01:43.259> Roman<00:01:43.649> reigns<00:01:43.829> win<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.399> Brock<00:01:45.149> doesn't

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
have Roman reigns win or Brock doesn't

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
have Roman reigns win or Brock doesn't
have<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:45.990> pin<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.439> way<00:01:46.560> Brock<00:01:46.770> looks

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
have to get pin that way Brock looks

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.700 
have to get pin that way Brock looks
strong<00:01:47.340> Brock<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.850> leave<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.229> if

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
strong Brock and leave and I think if

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
strong Brock and leave and I think if
this<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.250> chain<00:01:50.640> that's<00:01:50.909> being<00:01:51.090> made<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
this is the chain that's being made it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.660 
this is the chain that's being made it
it's<00:01:51.659> possibly<00:01:52.140> because<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.860> whether

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it's possibly because they know whether

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
it's possibly because they know whether
or<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.509> he<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.840> coming<00:01:55.079> back<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> WWE

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
or not that he is coming back to the WWE

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.160 
or not that he is coming back to the WWE
or<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.549> because<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.969> Brock<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.420> leaving<00:01:57.960> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
or not because if Brock is leaving a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.590 
or not because if Brock is leaving a
triple<00:01:59.130> threat<00:01:59.159> would<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> great<00:02:00.090> way<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.329> do

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
triple threat would be a great way to do

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
triple threat would be a great way to do
it<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.380> those<00:02:01.500> guys<00:02:01.710> could<00:02:01.979> get

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it because one of those guys could get

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.200 
it because one of those guys could get
pinned<00:02:02.369> Brock<00:02:02.610> could<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.909> out<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
pinned Brock could be out of the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.749

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
thing

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.780 
thing
and<00:02:13.540> then<00:02:13.660> out<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.900> nowhere<00:02:14.640> Daniel<00:02:15.640> could

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
and then out of nowhere Daniel could

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.520 
and then out of nowhere Daniel could
like<00:02:15.940> roll<00:02:16.360> Roman<00:02:16.750> up<00:02:16.870> or<00:02:17.020> not<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.170> stupid

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
like roll Roman up or not a stupid

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.930 
like roll Roman up or not a stupid
finish<00:02:17.890> like<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:18.459> something<00:02:18.849> could

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
finish like that but something could

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.850 
finish like that but something could
happen<00:02:19.150> where<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.200> these<00:02:20.319> guys<00:02:20.530> would<00:02:20.709> get

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
happen where one of these guys would get

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.220 
happen where one of these guys would get
the<00:02:21.010> belt<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.459> would<00:02:21.580> send<00:02:21.910> Lesnar<00:02:22.720> packing

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
the belt it would send Lesnar packing

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.509 
the belt it would send Lesnar packing
and<00:02:23.379> it's<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> good<00:02:23.739> way<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:23.950> kind<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.370> protect

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
and it's a good way to kind of protect

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.670 
and it's a good way to kind of protect
either<00:02:25.300> one<00:02:25.629> of<00:02:25.660> these<00:02:25.810> guys<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.290> then<00:02:26.440> maybe

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
either one of these guys and then maybe

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.650 
either one of these guys and then maybe
that<00:02:26.920> saves<00:02:27.310> Roman<00:02:27.879> reigns<00:02:28.060> versus<00:02:28.420> Brock

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660

Lesnar or Roman reigns versus Lesnar I

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.699

think either one of them are fine it all

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.059 
match because I think Lesnar should be
made<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.450> will<00:03:10.660> be<00:03:10.810> made<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.260> look<00:03:11.410> strong<00:03:11.829> at

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
made and will be made to look strong at

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.890 
made and will be made to look strong at
WrestleMania<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.120> booking<00:03:13.450> will<00:03:13.630> really

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
WrestleMania so the booking will really

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.750 
WrestleMania so the booking will really
wouldn't<00:03:14.140> have<00:03:14.170> an<00:03:14.470> effect<00:03:14.799> on<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.220> either

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760

one<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.150> these<00:03:16.269> guys<00:03:16.510> though<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.870> think<00:03:17.730> would

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
one of these guys though I think would

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.069 
one of these guys though I think would
be<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> suitable<00:03:19.090> option<00:03:19.389> I<00:03:19.600> think<00:03:19.780> Roman

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
be a suitable option I think Roman

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.270 
be a suitable option I think Roman
reigns<00:03:20.109> being<00:03:20.889> you<00:03:21.299> using<00:03:22.299> Bryan<00:03:23.160> against<00:03:24.160> del

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280

Roman reigns here to get him ready for

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.000 
Roman reigns here to get him ready for
Brock<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.569> probably<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.170> best<00:03:26.440> option<00:03:26.650> they

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
Brock is probably the best option they

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.920 
Brock is probably the best option they
had<00:03:27.220> besides<00:03:27.609> maybe<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:27.970> Johnson<00:03:28.569> or<00:03:28.690> beating

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
had besides maybe a Johnson or beating

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.569 
had besides maybe a Johnson or beating
John<00:03:29.079> Cena<00:03:29.139> but<00:03:29.500> then<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:30.190> have<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.370> have

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
John Cena but then you have to have

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.280 
John Cena but then you have to have
Roman<00:03:30.880> reigns<00:03:31.060> beat<00:03:31.269> John<00:03:31.540> Cena<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.109> don't

Roman reigns beat John Cena and I don't

event<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:10.890> don't<00:05:11.070> necessarily<00:05:11.190> think<00:05:11.490> they
