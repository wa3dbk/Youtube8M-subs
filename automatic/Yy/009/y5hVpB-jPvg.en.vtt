00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
tutorial I'm going to be using the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.370 
tutorial I'm going to be using the
macadamia<00:02:03.689> conditioning<00:02:04.689> treatment<00:02:05.170> you

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
macadamia conditioning treatment you

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.690 
macadamia conditioning treatment you
don't<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.979> use<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.159> conditioning

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
don't have to use a conditioning

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.609 
don't have to use a conditioning
treatment<00:02:06.729> as<00:02:07.179> I<00:02:07.299> said<00:02:07.509> water<00:02:08.080> will<00:02:08.410> work<00:02:08.590> just

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
treatment as I said water will work just

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.529 
treatment as I said water will work just
fine<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.399> want<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.670> make<00:02:09.819> sure<00:02:09.849> that<00:02:10.390> your

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.979 

see<00:02:22.019> it's<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.379> an<00:02:22.590> oil<00:02:23.299> like<00:02:24.299> treatment<00:02:24.840> and

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
see it's just an oil like treatment and

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.039 
see it's just an oil like treatment and
we<00:02:25.080> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.319> fill<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.830> top<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.870> have

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
we want to fill it to the top so we have

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.280 
we want to fill it to the top so we have
like<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.440> perfect<00:02:28.709> amount<00:02:29.450> in<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:30.780> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
like the perfect amount in there and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.339 
like the perfect amount in there and
then<00:02:31.860> we're<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.849> pop<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.870> in

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
then we're just going to pop that in

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.369 
then we're just going to pop that in
just<00:02:34.709> like<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.569> make<00:02:36.569> sure<00:02:36.780> it's<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.019> right

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
just like that make sure it's on right

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.149 
just like that make sure it's on right
and<00:02:37.950> then<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.670> pop<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.799> just<00:02:40.799> like<00:02:40.829> that

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
and then just pop it in just like that

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.479 
and then just pop it in just like that
and<00:02:42.060> this<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.360> basically<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.409> vapor<00:02:43.950> button

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
and this is basically the vapor button

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.759 
and this is basically the vapor button
so<00:02:45.060> when<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.390> press<00:02:45.659> this<00:02:45.900> button<00:02:45.959> activates

so when you press this button activates
the<00:02:46.950> bake<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.370> vapor<00:02:47.579> so<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.360> vapor<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.720> not

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the bake the vapor so the vapor is not

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.569 
the bake the vapor so the vapor is not
always<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.069> have<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> press

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
always going to be on you have to press

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.130 
always going to be on you have to press
the<00:02:50.730> button<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.030> order<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.390> activate<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.049> so

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.750 
the button in order to activate it so
you<00:02:52.620> can<00:02:52.769> also<00:02:52.950> use<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> straightener

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
you can also use the straightener

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.059 
you can also use the straightener
without<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.120> vapor<00:02:54.410> portion<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:55.709> we're

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
without the vapor portion but we're

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.250 
without the vapor portion but we're
gonna<00:02:56.190> try<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.489> out<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.849> see<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.450> results<00:02:57.840> also

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
gonna try it out to see the results also
