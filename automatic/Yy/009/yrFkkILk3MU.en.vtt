 since then, when I come in with the gt3, it's supposed to be more life passing by 

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:20.079
 and she asked us 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.349
 So he's like me 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.659
 percent 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:25.600
 around the Leo and percent 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.429
 many media may not have heard yet 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.579
 what else is coming 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.239
 if he has video clips 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.239
 we are waiting now for the anticipated expectations you make with it 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.100
 Hochtief wanted to respect that you liked the videos computer more and 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.040
 that they enjoy it more 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220
 and you have to do that very much 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.210
 around 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.380
 to say a stray NSU 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.860
 the best defense 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.930
 Do not make a call you do not have to call anything but can only be 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.530
 in one is 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.140
 What is not missing Karim is the only thing she is doing 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.450
 is he serving in the meal 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.200
 but we are never on 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.780
 and percent short commentary below 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.250
 that's how Gamertag Mixa finds and penetrates 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.180
 with it here 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.010
 the series of contracts they win and no meaningful FSGs 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.510
 Race presented 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.100
 there it is perhaps some there's the premium is not allowed 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.350
 m 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.859
 I do not think they have such good teams because they are with them today 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 That's when he thought we were a complete Team PartyPoker Ultimate Team 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
 a complete bundesliga team we are giving away 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.670
 if it does then 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.979
 the winner is drawn in the extremely video a stockbroker make 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 that I take in my stomach or thus person 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020
 we can not accept that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.170
 Year among others 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.390
 Let's get started and then the winner can tell us 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.460
 determined by more information so 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.590
 they see me unloading here therefore Mueller said Vietze 4 1 2 1 1 play 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.210
 then we will check a budget 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.020
 so 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.779
 Helper 000 pounds cost 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.559
 and secretly good team from what they tell him what they do us anymore 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.829
 We buy ourselves and buy them 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.989
 then there is the winner 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.030
 So Hamm is nothing but a game 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.090
 then stands percent throttle when exchanging in the ground he has his team and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.859
 he won this team he wins 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:28.999
 and 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.279
 Iran "It's winter 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:32.620
 and 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.120
 and so for us that maybe was a bit more famous 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.849
 become with us so the Chargers 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.069
 on YouTube because the partner Brad Pitt get and 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.929
 because that pleases or not 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.179
 and in any case, if you're in the embassies or something 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.789
 we seem to be by mail 

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:53.429
 around 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.580
 that's about 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.269
 largely and Volg looked around 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.260
 or generally everyone has ever flashed second, so easy 1% one 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.459
 message 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.899
 first offender so it applies no matter what you want to sure that they are here 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.299
 what she's up to 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.509
 what I'm going 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:16.369
 Saying the tennis hall will be the one we practice with him when we do about it 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.729
 from our team or for themselves 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:23.429
 we will not play through the system and it is sensuous to record it 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:28.239
 or percent in which options or so "The good games I think so now 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.979
 brazen if they are not given as we seem to be able to implement us 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.119
 porn 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.799
 Pirates was his 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.089
 I've fallen back on Tus player coaches 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.759
 But there is more in it Â»commented something very important 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:44.969
 Raffle part 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:50.049
 subscribed to us and time runs the everyday percent as a comment 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:51.020
 among them 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.300
 and then, for a week, Sacher heard about children being known 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.319
 and then I hope that 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.989
 the cloud of smoke was 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.849
 by Kerstin Henseke 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.039
