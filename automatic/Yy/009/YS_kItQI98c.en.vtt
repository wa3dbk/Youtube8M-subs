this<00:00:21.390> kind<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> if<00:00:22.169> you<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.560> look<00:00:22.710> at<00:00:22.800> it

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
this kind of if you really look at it

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.460 
this kind of if you really look at it
it's<00:00:23.009> usually<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.369> serrated<00:00:23.759> type<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.470> finish

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it's usually a serrated type of finish

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.960 
it's usually a serrated type of finish
and<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.890> feels<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.369> cutting<00:00:26.669> real<00:00:26.820> nice

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and it feels like it's cutting real nice

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.609 
and it feels like it's cutting real nice
but<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.300> lost<00:00:27.540> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.930> material<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.470> it's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
but you lost a lot of material and it's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.350 
but you lost a lot of material and it's
you<00:00:29.369> know<00:00:29.460> I've<00:00:29.579> never<00:00:29.730> seen<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.000> sharpening

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
you know I've never seen a sharpening

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.690 
you know I've never seen a sharpening
service<00:00:30.750> less<00:00:30.930> than<00:00:31.079> thirty<00:00:31.290> dollars<00:00:31.680> so<00:00:31.950> you

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
service less than thirty dollars so you

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.520 
service less than thirty dollars so you
have<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.600> away<00:00:33.809> from<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:34.079> knife<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.410> it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
have time away from your knife and it's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.290 
have time away from your knife and it's
really<00:00:34.710> expensive<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> do

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
really expensive and I think if you do

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.820 
really expensive and I think if you do
it<00:00:36.390> yourself<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.990> not<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.410> much<00:00:37.560> of<00:00:37.620> an

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
it yourself it's not that much of an

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.020 
it yourself it's not that much of an
impact<00:00:38.130> and<00:00:38.400> you're<00:00:38.580> going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> better

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
impact and you're going to do a better

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.760 
impact and you're going to do a better
job<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.660> knifes<00:00:39.810> gonna<00:00:39.960> last<00:00:40.170> long

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
job and your knifes gonna last long

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.200 
job and your knifes gonna last long
I've<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.670> knives<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> I've<00:00:42.120> been

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
I've got knives that I've been

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.750 
I've got knives that I've been
sharpening<00:00:42.390> myself<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.260> eight<00:00:44.040> years<00:00:44.490> and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
sharpening myself for eight years and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.250 
sharpening myself for eight years and
you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.970> see<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:45.360> much<00:00:45.510> they've<00:00:45.750> worn<00:00:45.990> down

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
you can see how much they've worn down

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
you can see how much they've worn down
but<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.520> sent<00:00:47.790> that<00:00:47.940> off

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
but if you sent that off

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.970 
but if you sent that off
dude<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> too<00:00:48.600> could<00:00:48.810> be<00:00:48.930> able<00:00:48.990> to<00:00:49.170> maybe<00:00:49.650> five

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
dude you too could be able to maybe five

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.190 
dude you too could be able to maybe five
ten<00:00:50.250> times<00:00:50.400> you'd<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.760> no<00:00:50.940> knife<00:00:51.120> left<00:00:51.390> so

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
ten times you'd have no knife left so

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.410 
ten times you'd have no knife left so
it's<00:00:53.100> preserving<00:00:53.610> yeah<00:00:53.730> my<00:00:53.880> UX<00:00:54.120> times<00:00:54.240> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it's preserving yeah my UX times the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.979 
it's preserving yeah my UX times the
exact<00:00:54.660> example<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:56.480> actually<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.690> his<00:00:57.810> show

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
exact example that actually get his show

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.290 
exact example that actually get his show
I<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.530> show<00:00:58.770> ya<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.610> bought<00:00:59.850> this<00:01:00.060> knife

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I can show ya when I bought this knife

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
I can show ya when I bought this knife
it<00:01:00.540> probably<00:01:00.870> had<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:02.460> much

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it probably had about like that much

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.270 
it probably had about like that much
blade<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.199> those<00:01:04.710> grant<00:01:05.009> and<00:01:05.129> edge

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
blade on it the those grant and edge

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
blade on it the those grant and edge
does<00:01:05.549> little<00:01:05.729> scalloped<00:01:06.149> things<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:07.290> were

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
does little scalloped things they were

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.260 
does little scalloped things they were
like<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> high<00:01:07.979> from<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.310> edge<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
like that high from the edge of the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.969 
like that high from the edge of the
blade<00:01:09.479> way<00:01:10.440> up<00:01:10.740> there

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
blade way up there

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
blade way up there
so<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.940> I'm<00:01:12.120> sharpening<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.840> knife<00:01:13.020> it's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
so now as I'm sharpening the knife it's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.500 
so now as I'm sharpening the knife it's
getting<00:01:14.130> into<00:01:14.430> those<00:01:14.550> guys<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> I've<00:01:15.330> been

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
getting into those guys and I've been

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.649 
getting into those guys and I've been
this<00:01:15.900> nice<00:01:16.200> I've<00:01:16.409> had<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.890> literally<00:01:17.850> eight

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this nice I've had for literally eight

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
this nice I've had for literally eight
years<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.650> sharp<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.370> ton

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
years and I'm sharp on that thing a ton

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.100 
years and I'm sharp on that thing a ton
and<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:20.850> been<00:01:21.450> through<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> bunch<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and it's been through a bunch of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.860 
and it's been through a bunch of
restaurants<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:22.740> me<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.330> send<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.720> off

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
restaurants with me so if I send it off

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.050 
restaurants with me so if I send it off
it<00:01:25.049> would<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.229> ground<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:26.010> hell<00:01:26.760> you<00:01:26.940> know

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it would be ground down to hell you know

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.940 
it would be ground down to hell you know
there<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.299> no<00:01:27.420> nights<00:01:27.690> left<00:01:27.870> I<00:01:28.229> think<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:28.830> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
there be no nights left I think if you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.120
