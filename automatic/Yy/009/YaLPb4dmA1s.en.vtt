alright I knew my sticker wheelies for
kids<00:00:19.840> I<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:30.039> a<00:00:30.070> car<00:00:30.340> there<00:00:30.520> I<00:00:30.730> was<00:00:30.880> gonna

kids I was a car there I was gonna

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.729 
kids I was a car there I was gonna
wheelie<00:00:31.360> I<00:00:31.570> thought<00:00:31.960> I<00:00:32.050> can<00:00:32.169> weally<00:00:32.349> all<00:00:32.559> that

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
wheelie I thought I can weally all that

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.530 
wheelie I thought I can weally all that
well<00:00:32.950> certainly<00:00:33.850> probably<00:00:34.030> couldn't<00:00:34.390> solve

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
well certainly probably couldn't solve

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.000 
well certainly probably couldn't solve
it<00:00:34.720> long<00:00:34.870> enough<00:00:34.989> for<00:00:35.230> that<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.379> even<00:00:35.500> affect

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
it long enough for that to even affect

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.340 
it long enough for that to even affect
that<00:00:36.070> carpet<00:00:36.610> I<00:00:36.930> still<00:00:37.930> try<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.080> be<00:00:38.260> a<00:00:38.290> good

it<00:01:13.780> was<00:01:13.930> just<00:01:14.110> cool<00:01:14.229> no<00:01:14.530> oh<00:01:14.560> god<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.130> whole

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
it was just cool no oh god the whole

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.580 
it was just cool no oh god the whole
scenario<00:01:15.700> was<00:01:16.270> cool<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.750> talked<00:01:17.229> about<00:01:17.320> what

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
scenario was cool I talked about what

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.320 
scenario was cool I talked about what
finally<00:01:17.979> clicked<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.580> had<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.880> do<00:01:19.090> with<00:01:19.119> my

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
finally clicked and it had to do with my

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.060 
finally clicked and it had to do with my
timing<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.929> when<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.289> was<00:01:20.320> used<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.649> using<00:01:20.800> the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
timing of when I was used to using the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.429 
timing of when I was used to using the
clutch<00:01:21.509> obviously<00:01:22.509> on<00:01:22.630> this<00:01:22.780> bike<00:01:22.960> I<00:01:23.140> have<00:01:23.290> two

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
clutch up there are no power ups unless

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.060 
clutch up there are no power ups unless
I<00:01:26.439> you<00:01:26.770> know

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.290 

yeah<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.790> there's<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.350> like<00:01:31.350> okay<00:01:31.710> okay

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
yeah now there's not like okay okay

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:53.090 
yeah now there's not like okay okay
forward<00:01:33.300> oh<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:52.440> needed<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.770> camera

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
forward oh I really needed a camera

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.609 
forward oh I really needed a camera
mounted<00:01:53.220> right<00:01:53.550> here<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.690> was

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.420 

that<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.740> pretty<00:01:58.979> good<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.740> was<00:02:01.890> me<00:02:02.100> trying

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that was pretty good that was me trying

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.940 
that was pretty good that was me trying
to<00:02:02.729> power<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.869> even<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.229> almost<00:02:04.560> ronal

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to power up not even like almost ronal

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.840 
to power up not even like almost ronal
so<00:02:05.850> wheelies<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:07.229> talked<00:02:07.920> about<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.310> what<00:02:08.820> I

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
so wheelies I talked about that what I

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.130 
so wheelies I talked about that what I
realized<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.330> was<00:02:09.450> doing<00:02:09.630> wrong<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
realized I was doing wrong it's a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.290 
realized I was doing wrong it's a
mistake<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.530> still<00:02:10.739> make<00:02:10.890> sometimes<00:02:11.270> but<00:02:12.270> I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
mistake I still make sometimes but I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.120 
mistake I still make sometimes but I
know<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.810> now<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.230> know<00:02:13.290> why<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.680> doesn't

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
know it now and I know why it doesn't

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.740 
know it now and I know why it doesn't
wheelie<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.760> know<00:02:14.850> exactly<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.510> did

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
wheelie and I know exactly what I did

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.170 
wheelie and I know exactly what I did
and<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.770> understand<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> timing<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.880> when<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and I understand the timing of when to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.750 
and I understand the timing of when to
use<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> clutch<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.870> how<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.709> how<00:02:19.770> would<00:02:20.489> it

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
use the clutch and how and how would it

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.600 
use the clutch and how and how would it
exactly<00:02:21.090> roll<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.630> because<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.769> was<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.400> doing

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
exactly roll on because I was not doing

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.240 
exactly roll on because I was not doing
it<00:02:23.880> right<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.269> was<00:02:24.390> close<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.680> was<00:02:25.950> making

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
it right I was close but I was making

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.350 
it right I was close but I was making
one<00:02:26.459> fatal<00:02:27.000> error<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:28.170> sure<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.730> I've

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
one fatal error that I'm sure it I've

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.390 
one fatal error that I'm sure it I've
watched<00:02:30.660> every<00:02:30.870> wheelie<00:02:31.410> tutorial<00:02:31.920> video<00:02:32.190> out

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
watched every wheelie tutorial video out

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.820 
watched every wheelie tutorial video out
there<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.760> YouTube<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.840> wasn't<00:02:34.500> helping

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
there on YouTube it wasn't helping

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.210 
there on YouTube it wasn't helping
because<00:02:35.459> they<00:02:36.390> were<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.750> guess<00:02:37.230> they<00:02:37.440> were

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
because they were I guess they were

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.600 
because they were I guess they were
saying<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.510> they<00:02:39.660> weren't<00:02:39.840> saying<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
saying this but they weren't saying it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.190 
saying this but they weren't saying it
the<00:02:41.610> way<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> needed<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.239> hear<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:43.080> it

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the way I needed to hear it like it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.930 
the way I needed to hear it like it
wasn't<00:02:43.410> worded<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> way<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.459> collected

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
wasn't worded in a way that it collected

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.920 
wasn't worded in a way that it collected
my<00:02:45.120> brain<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.370> when<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.239> finally<00:02:48.570> clicked

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930

it's until now all of motorcycling has
been<00:03:19.380> about<00:03:19.590> maintaining<00:03:20.070> equilibrium<00:03:21.709> this

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
been about maintaining equilibrium this

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.910 
been about maintaining equilibrium this
