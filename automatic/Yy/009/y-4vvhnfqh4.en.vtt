so it's got the this is the cover for

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.930 
so it's got the this is the cover for
the<00:04:19.630> game<00:04:20.130> these<00:04:21.130> were<00:04:21.280> only<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.489> hundred<00:04:21.730> yen

the game these were only a hundred yen
because<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.330> guess<00:04:22.480> those<00:04:22.660> are<00:04:22.690> smaller<00:04:23.110> so<00:04:23.230> it

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
because I guess those are smaller so it

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.159 
because I guess those are smaller so it
was<00:04:23.620> only<00:04:23.710> only<00:04:24.190> about<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.370> dollar<00:04:24.610> each<00:04:25.169> week

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169
