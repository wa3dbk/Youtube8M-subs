00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.840
 both gets so maybe a minute the idea is already over this 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.840
 People campaign 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.619
 I still need to say how great I was 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:15.649
 It was just not always great here 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.649
 Percent and 7 40 days needed 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:24.329
 and 2 the 1250 grams of 1250 euros expected Hellmund 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.390
 Participation and bruising 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.419
 formally will deepen with 40% 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.629
 Meeting point is at 10 o'clock who today with their children 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.080
 That's 4 5 percent lower tax will be on you 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.430
 the offender was before 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.550
 Dr 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.390
 the word 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.200
 Dr. May was shot dead 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.780
 I enjoyed playing this game as it is a great game 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.200
 I find above all the third part 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.220
 the best way is the fifth one is he being a bit too lengthy what you are there for 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.220
 then it's better to have a train for ten minutes 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.460
 and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.600
 yes Bern 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.120
 I only want to recommend 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.030
 This will not be another campaign for the first time 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.660
 by percent 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.500
 that was no match for the USA 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.360
 but there are all markets user called Salvador 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.490
 45 the pronounced he currently makes the fix campaign has been quite bringing 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.180
 Germany 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.860
 If he is absurd with the Boca because it is also good that they are better players 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.430
 does not change 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.730
 Euro 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 Prior and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.150
 Deuce 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.800
 that by my side i would also say a new project will flow so well 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.850
 not over Skype over the sea 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.929
 I bet that 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.159
 By the way, what happens next is the pressure and was promptly surprised 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.090
 as much as possible 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.820
 look picture dpa in double
