ability<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:50.550> I've<00:04:50.640> been<00:04:50.760> doing<00:04:50.850> that<00:04:51.060> for<00:04:51.120> the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
ability and I've been doing that for the

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.790 
ability and I've been doing that for the
past<00:04:51.330> couple<00:04:51.720> turns<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.260> sometimes<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.710> feel

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
past couple turns and sometimes I feel

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.870 
past couple turns and sometimes I feel
like<00:04:52.920> that<00:04:53.100> can<00:04:53.280> be<00:04:53.400> counterproductive

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
like that can be counterproductive

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.120 
like that can be counterproductive
because<00:04:54.840> I<00:04:55.050> could<00:04:55.200> have<00:04:55.320> used<00:04:55.530> his<00:04:55.680> ability

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
because I could have used his ability

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.950 
because I could have used his ability
picked<00:04:56.730> up<00:04:56.850> something<00:04:57.060> scrappy<00:04:57.630> from<00:04:57.780> my

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
picked up something scrappy from my

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.270 
picked up something scrappy from my
graveyard<00:04:58.200> I<00:04:58.500> think<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.740> only<00:04:58.860> thing<00:04:58.950> in<00:04:59.190> it

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
graveyard I think the only thing in it

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.980 
graveyard I think the only thing in it
is<00:04:59.400> like<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.610> green<00:05:00.000> man<00:05:00.480> or<00:05:00.690> something

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
is like a green man or something

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.740 
is like a green man or something
mediocre<00:05:01.730> but<00:05:02.730> if<00:05:02.910> I<00:05:03.030> don't<00:05:03.210> use<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.510> ability

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
mediocre but if I don't use this ability

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.620 
mediocre but if I don't use this ability
then<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.950> could<00:05:05.550> have<00:05:05.640> got<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:05.820> free<00:05:06.060> card<00:05:06.300> out<00:05:06.450> of

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
then I could have got a free card out of

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.980

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.430 
what to do from here though
I<00:05:28.560> guess<00:05:28.800> I'll<00:05:28.950> play<00:05:29.070> this<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.490> heal<00:05:29.640> my<00:05:29.820> guy

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
I guess I'll play this to heal my guy

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.750 
I guess I'll play this to heal my guy
even<00:05:31.440> though<00:05:31.530> one<00:05:31.800> hit<00:05:32.040> in<00:05:32.190> this<00:05:32.280> pumpkin<00:05:32.490> is

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
even though one hit in this pumpkin is

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.000 
even though one hit in this pumpkin is
dead<00:05:33.000> he's<00:05:33.840> down<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.140> one<00:05:34.169> hit<00:05:34.530> point<00:05:34.740> we'll

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
dead he's down to one hit point we'll

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.000 
dead he's down to one hit point we'll
see<00:05:35.130> if<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.280> works<00:05:35.610> out<00:05:36.590> all<00:05:37.590> right<00:05:37.830> now

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
we're actually getting to the point to

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.470

balances out the heart timer because I

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.420 
balances out the heart timer because I
found<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:15.900> way<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.050> bypass<00:06:16.260> it<00:06:16.770> and<00:06:16.980> this<00:06:17.190> game

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
found a way to bypass it and this game

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.909 
found a way to bypass it and this game
is<00:06:17.610> pleasant<00:06:18.060> without<00:06:18.210> the<00:06:18.570> heart<00:06:18.750> timer<00:06:19.020> and

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
is pleasant without the heart timer and

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.950 
is pleasant without the heart timer and
I<00:06:20.640> have<00:06:20.790> a<00:06:20.820> feeling<00:06:21.030> that<00:06:21.240> this<00:06:21.390> game<00:06:21.600> might<00:06:21.810> go

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
that this game could go free down the

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.970 
that this game could go free down the

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
back from scooping it up it does take a

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.580
