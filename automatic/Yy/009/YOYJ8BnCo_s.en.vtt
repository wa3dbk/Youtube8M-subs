00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.080
 Well 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.590
 Hello everyone, I want to be with you today 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.320
 you present a big or thick knot 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.600
 or grant strength or again short 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:21.230
 node is a node that is formed here 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.470
 such a huge massive construction 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.610
 from above and rather short part from below 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.539
 it's a festive knit enough luck 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.649
 does not fit 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.019
 probably for the main sock but in 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.629
 the principle can sometimes be a sinker hanging 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:44.670
 tie and skip this node as 1s 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.829
 bright enough knots me too him 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.560
 knotting technique is identical 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 gasquet 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.620
 knotter so I highly recommend 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.100
 before watching this video before 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.010
 see more video as it seems node 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.949
 benzer to understand 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.949
 mechanic strapping and it was easier for you 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.969
 Now we will proceed to knitting this 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 short side wide side 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.290
 I turn the video 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.310
 now we are my right side of this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.920
 or power from the left side doing very 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.570
 short war 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.570
 all 10 centimeters 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.079
 a little 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.210
 farther we act as well and 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.880
 pour enzo 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.909
 there is a top jump and jump 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.290
 climb up then 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.910
 fallen like wine 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.910
 through the bottom again up 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.460
 all the parts would immediately say clearly 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.810
 are made on the wrong side of the front 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.810
 also like vinzer 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.649
 and top 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.120
 I also like a funnel and take 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.019
 except that at this stage 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.280
 we do not need to be reformed sla 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.180
 we need at what stage exactly 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.640
 seal come out and tighten 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.870
 all he should not stretch but should 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.760
 be as tight as possible 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.590
 swamp that is why we catch all 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.040
 the sides maximally condense further 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.540
 let's go 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.540
 now we climb to the top 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.480
 go down that is 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.490
 now we start to knit it already 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.490
 weather standard with worldly 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.170
 i.e. 1 h on the right 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.740
 passed from the bottom 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.740
 if he 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.250
 especially carefully look to you 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.750
 was here at this stage as much as possible 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.850
 symmetrically how can you win 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.910
 symmetrically 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.330
 Now 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.330
 walk 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.959
 through the bottom to do again which 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.959
 funnel 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.240
 on this funnel 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.350
 we lower our node the main part 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.350
 tie down 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.060
 and at this stage we form 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.390
 directly weather 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.840
 also 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.060
 i would desir 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.490
 we stretch here 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.150
 it was as symmetrical as possible 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.150
 gully 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.120
 here we will 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.860
 long is it 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.820
 wide 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.650
 powerful top took and even its principle 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.960
 You can try to wear under the iron 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.760
 if you have a high vest with high 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.340
 top that is to be happy, too 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.060
 look great impressive powerful 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.480
 strong knot principle can be applied and 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.590
 so it should enough 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:27.170
 elegant looks not aesthetically pleasing red 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:32.060
 drops no longer the rest of the families topic 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.310
 because it also looks good on it 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.760
 Thank you all for watching. I hope so. 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.650
 helped you look good bye bye 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.430
 happiness to your home and up to the next 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.430
 episodes
