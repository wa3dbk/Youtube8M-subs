of weird and the trees kind of have like
these<00:01:39.149> strange<00:01:39.780> lines<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.319> when<00:01:40.439> they

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
these strange lines in them when they

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.719 
these strange lines in them when they
were<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.069> flowing<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> wind

here it is guys Alpine mansion against
the<00:02:10.770> courts<00:02:11.039> looks<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.430> good

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the courts looks really good

the courts looks really good
a<00:02:11.970> lot<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> blocks<00:02:12.660> look<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.930> lot<00:02:13.020> better<00:02:13.140> in

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
a lot of the blocks look a lot better in

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.810 
a lot of the blocks look a lot better in
the<00:02:13.380> flows<00:02:13.560> HD<00:02:13.920> than<00:02:14.070> does<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.400> city<00:02:14.610> even

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
the flows HD than does in the city even

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.980 
the flows HD than does in the city even
though<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> city<00:02:15.240> tetrapack<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.720> actually

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
though the city tetrapack is actually

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.210 
though the city tetrapack is actually
there

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
there

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.920 
there
texturepack<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:16.970> I'll<00:02:17.450> go<00:02:17.510> ahead<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.750> change

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
texturepack but I'll go ahead and change

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.570 
texturepack but I'll go ahead and change
my<00:02:17.990> shaders<00:02:18.770> mods<00:02:18.950> right<00:02:19.160> now<00:02:19.280> let's<00:02:19.490> check

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
my shaders mods right now let's check

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.760 
my shaders mods right now let's check
out<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.790> real<00:02:20.060> play<00:02:20.240> shaders<00:02:20.630> these<00:02:20.930> are<00:02:21.140> also

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
out the real play shaders these are also

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.010 
out the real play shaders these are also
a<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.490> good<00:02:22.640> pack<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.390> shaders<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.840> guess

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
a really good pack of shaders I guess

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.660 
a really good pack of shaders I guess
and<00:02:24.320> make<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.040> house<00:02:25.190> look<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.400> lot<00:02:25.520> more

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
and make the house look a lot more

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.890 
and make the house look a lot more
colorful<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.210> let's<00:02:26.330> go<00:02:26.420> ahead<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.660> go<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.750> the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
colorful so let's go ahead and go on the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.860 
colorful so let's go ahead and go on the
inside<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.620> house<00:02:27.740> using<00:02:28.160> these<00:02:28.870> these

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
inside of the house using these these

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.360 
inside of the house using these these
are<00:02:30.020> obviously<00:02:30.650> pretty<00:02:30.830> cool<00:02:31.040> they<00:02:31.130> have<00:02:31.220> like

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
are obviously pretty cool they have like

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.100 
are obviously pretty cool they have like
this<00:02:31.520> strange<00:02:32.120> lighting<00:02:32.480> defect<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.960> don't

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
this strange lighting defect I don't

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.420 
this strange lighting defect I don't
know<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.380> installed<00:02:33.740> them<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.310> that

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
know if I installed them on like that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.550 
know if I installed them on like that
you<00:02:34.640> guys<00:02:34.850> told<00:02:35.600> me<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.900> didn't<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.380> just

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560

you guys told me that I didn't it's just
part<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> texture<00:02:37.460> pack<00:02:37.670> or<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.000> don't<00:02:38.210> even

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
part of the texture pack or I don't even

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.620 
part of the texture pack or I don't even
know<00:02:38.510> but<00:02:38.540> let's<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.380> go<00:02:39.470> inside<00:02:40.510> here's<00:02:41.510> the

foyer I guess and you know the whole

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.220 
foyer I guess and you know the whole
interior<00:02:43.760> as<00:02:43.940> well<00:02:44.090> looks<00:02:44.330> pretty<00:02:44.420> awesome<00:02:44.870> in

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
interior as well looks pretty awesome in

interior as well looks pretty awesome in
the<00:02:45.650> PC<00:02:46.280> version<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.850> flows<00:02:47.060> HD<00:02:47.420> makes<00:02:47.570> it

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the PC version the flows HD makes it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.330 
the PC version the flows HD makes it
