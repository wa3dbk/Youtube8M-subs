pressed<00:03:20.880> again<00:03:21.240> at<00:03:22.200> negative<00:03:23.160> 75<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.300> we<00:03:24.390> can

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
pressed again at negative 75 so we can

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.090 
pressed again at negative 75 so we can
control<00:03:25.490> continue<00:03:26.490> its<00:03:26.640> servo<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.950> can

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
control continue its servo and you can

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.190 
control continue its servo and you can
change<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.490> stop<00:03:29.730> style<00:03:30.390> too<00:03:30.690> if<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.990> want

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
change the stop style too if you want

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.110 
change the stop style too if you want
from<00:03:31.410> close<00:03:31.710> to<00:03:31.740> break<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:34.310> then<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:36.090> here

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
from close to break and then over here

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.590 
from close to break and then over here
let's<00:03:36.510> program<00:03:36.840> our<00:03:37.290> third<00:03:37.680> motor<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:39.150> we'll

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
let's program our third motor so we'll

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.520 
let's program our third motor so we'll
select<00:03:39.810> DC<00:03:40.350> motor<00:03:40.560> three<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:42.320> give<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.350> a

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
select DC motor three and give it a

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.870 
select DC motor three and give it a
power<00:03:43.740> of<00:03:43.980> 100<00:03:46.100> so<00:03:47.100> once<00:03:47.310> you're<00:03:47.460> happy<00:03:47.640> with

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
power of 100 so once you're happy with

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.750 
power of 100 so once you're happy with
your<00:03:48.420> robot<00:03:49.290> action<00:03:49.680> make<00:03:50.190> sure<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.550> keep

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
your robot action make sure you keep

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.070 
your robot action make sure you keep

have the FTC toolkit you can hit

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.640 
have the FTC toolkit you can hit
generate<00:04:06.450> code<00:04:07.050> up<00:04:07.290> at<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.500> top<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:09.650> it'll

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
generate code up at the top and it'll

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.199 
generate code up at the top and it'll
generate<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:12.090> code<00:04:12.930> for<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.590> upload

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.610 

and<00:04:17.209> let's<00:04:17.959> just<00:04:18.229> call<00:04:18.500> it<00:04:18.669> tele<00:04:19.669> up<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:20.620> then

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
and let's just call it tele up and then

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.040 
and let's just call it tele up and then
hit<00:04:21.979> create

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.960 

and<00:04:31.050> now<00:04:31.320> it's<00:04:31.560> starting<00:04:31.950> to<00:04:32.130> generate<00:04:32.490> our

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
and now it's starting to generate our

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:46.499 
and now it's starting to generate our
code<00:04:33.300> here

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:53.890 

and<00:04:47.770> here<00:04:48.770> we<00:04:48.830> have<00:04:48.979> the<00:04:49.580> code<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:52.900> you

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
and here we have the code and so you

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.929 
and here we have the code and so you
have<00:04:54.139> all<00:04:54.169> your<00:04:54.710> drive<00:04:55.039> controls<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.699> there
