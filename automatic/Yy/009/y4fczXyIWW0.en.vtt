00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
really about the gameplay it's more or

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.000 
really about the gameplay it's more or
less<00:00:42.120> about<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.629> top<00:00:42.870> gun<00:00:43.170> hunt<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.620> hand

which<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.610> pretty<00:00:44.760> much<00:00:44.960> remastering<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.140> call

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
which is pretty much remastering a call

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.979 
which is pretty much remastering a call
duty<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.739> remaking<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.789> call<00:00:48.239> duty<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
reason why I have mono 42 game plays

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
bit for black ops 1 I feel like if they

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.620 
bit for black ops 1 I feel like if they
just<00:03:43.329> remade<00:03:44.260> or<00:03:44.500> remastered<00:03:45.430> or<00:03:45.640> just<00:03:46.060> redone

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
just remade or remastered or just redone

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.380 
just remade or remastered or just redone
a<00:03:46.660> call<00:03:46.930> duty<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.440> will<00:03:47.920> make<00:03:48.120> everybody<00:03:49.120> happy

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
a call duty it will make everybody happy

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.380 
a call duty it will make everybody happy
so<00:03:50.079> that's<00:03:50.380> why<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.709> use<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.370> example<00:03:51.640> for<00:03:52.120> mono

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
so that's why I use the example for mono

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.750 
so that's why I use the example for mono
42<00:03:52.870> because<00:03:53.560> it's<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.769> great<00:03:53.980> game<00:03:54.190> even<00:03:54.640> though

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
42 because it's a great game even though

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.390 
42 because it's a great game even though
I<00:03:54.790> didn't<00:03:55.299> go<00:03:55.450> crazy<00:03:55.750> over<00:03:56.140> my<00:03:56.410> north<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.829> even

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.099 
I didn't go crazy over my north to even
though<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:57.609> wasn't<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.120> call<00:03:58.299> duty<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.840> it

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
though this wasn't the call duty that it

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.470 
though this wasn't the call duty that it
that<00:03:59.530> started<00:04:00.310> me<00:04:00.489> off<00:04:00.519> even<00:04:01.150> though<00:04:01.239> i<00:04:01.269> did

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
that started me off even though i did

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.020 
that started me off even though i did
play<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.079> its<00:04:02.829> lifespan<00:04:03.190> even<00:04:03.880> though<00:04:03.970> i
