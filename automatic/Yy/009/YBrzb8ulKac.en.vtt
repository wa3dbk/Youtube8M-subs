you can do it yourself or you can go to

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.289 
you can do it yourself or you can go to
a<00:02:12.159> shop<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.489> has<00:02:12.760> an<00:02:12.879> ase<00:02:13.269> certified

a shop that has an ase certified

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.490 
a shop that has an ase certified
technician

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
technician

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.960 
technician
really<00:02:15.070> will<00:02:15.220> make<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> huge<00:02:15.490> difference

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
really will make a huge difference

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.090 
really will make a huge difference
because<00:02:16.210> this<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.080> 223<00:02:17.500> miles<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.950> gallon

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
because this is 223 miles to the gallon

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.220 
because this is 223 miles to the gallon
so<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> tire<00:02:18.940> pressure<00:02:19.240> and<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.750> adds<00:02:19.960> up

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
so is the tire pressure and that adds up

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530 
so is the tire pressure and that adds up
quite<00:02:20.530> quickly<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:21.310> makes<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.760> then<00:02:22.000> right

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
quite quickly that makes it then right

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.970 
quite quickly that makes it then right
now<00:02:22.960> another<00:02:23.200> thing<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.500> want<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.710> do<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:23.890> it

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
now another thing you want to do is it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
think was one of the first that we've

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.330 
think was one of the first that we've
come<00:03:22.750> out<00:03:22.900> with<00:03:23.110> actually<00:03:23.500> an<00:03:23.650> organized

system of maintenance in other words

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.229 
system of maintenance in other words
might<00:03:26.860> be<00:03:27.040> checking<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.670> know<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.000> list

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
might be checking you know and a list

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.340 
might be checking you know and a list
and<00:03:28.390> you'd<00:03:28.510> end<00:03:28.690> up<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.930> piece<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.140> paper
