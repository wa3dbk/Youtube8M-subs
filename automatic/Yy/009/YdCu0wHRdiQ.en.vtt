thing<00:00:58.399> when<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> pull<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.449> running<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.020> next

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
thing when you pull the running in next

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.369 
thing when you pull the running in next
to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> standing<00:01:02.160> part<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:03.180> creates<00:01:03.780> an<00:01:04.170> eye

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to the standing part it creates an eye

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.780 
to the standing part it creates an eye
and<00:01:05.540> there<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:07.320> your<00:01:07.560> bowling<00:01:09.140> okay<00:01:10.790> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
difference is is you keep tie that in

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.490 
difference is is you keep tie that in
the<00:01:16.500> bite<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> road

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.650 

and<00:01:25.220> make<00:01:25.670> an<00:01:25.850> added<00:01:26.300> pass<00:01:28.120> you<00:01:29.120> have<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.360> lot

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
and make an added pass you have a lot

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.690 
and make an added pass you have a lot
more<00:01:29.870> strength<00:01:30.320> in<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.590> line<00:01:30.980> that<00:01:31.010> a<00:01:31.370> single

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
more strength in that line that a single

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.080 
more strength in that line that a single
piece<00:01:32.120> of<00:01:32.150> rope<00:01:33.490> you're<00:01:34.490> doing<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.850> same

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
piece of rope you're doing the same

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.080
