00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
but also burn out could mean that people

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.930 
but also burn out could mean that people
lose<00:02:38.170> hope<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.769> they<00:02:38.890> give<00:02:39.070> up<00:02:39.220> because<00:02:39.640> they

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
lose hope and they give up because they

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.699 
lose hope and they give up because they
think<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:40.180> what<00:02:40.390> they're<00:02:40.540> doing<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.989> not

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
think that what they're doing is not

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.740 
think that what they're doing is not
making<00:02:42.430> any<00:02:42.550> difference<00:02:42.760> or<00:02:43.209> it's<00:02:43.330> redundant

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
making any difference or it's redundant

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.559 
making any difference or it's redundant
it's<00:02:44.080> not<00:02:44.230> changing<00:02:44.590> anything<00:02:44.860> but<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:46.060> people

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
it's not changing anything but if people

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.590 
it's not changing anything but if people
did<00:02:47.080> not<00:02:47.110> run<00:02:47.769> out<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:48.310> did<00:02:48.549> not<00:02:48.670> give<00:02:49.090> up<00:02:49.239> and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
did not run out and did not give up and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.569 
did not run out and did not give up and
still<00:02:50.049> keep<00:02:50.380> fighting<00:02:50.829> for<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.190> struggle

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
still keep fighting for the struggle

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.770 
still keep fighting for the struggle
that<00:02:51.610> they<00:02:51.820> believed<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.630> first

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
that they believed and in the first

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.989 
that they believed and in the first
place
