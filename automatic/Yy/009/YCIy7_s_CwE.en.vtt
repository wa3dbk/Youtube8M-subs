so so far I'm not building pretty

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.040 
so so far I'm not building pretty
quickly<00:02:23.200> here<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:25.420> we<00:02:25.540> go<00:02:25.720> there's<00:02:25.960> a

eye<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:33.940> sky<00:02:34.180> make<00:02:34.810> sure<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:37.090> see

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
eye in the sky make sure you can see

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.980 
eye in the sky make sure you can see
what's<00:02:38.140> being<00:02:38.380> dropped<00:02:38.740> from<00:02:39.010> above<00:02:39.990> and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
what's being dropped from above and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.590 
what's being dropped from above and
doesn't<00:02:41.500> play<00:02:41.680> more<00:02:42.120> get<00:02:43.120> more<00:02:43.330> comfortable

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
doesn't play more get more comfortable

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.600 
doesn't play more get more comfortable
using<00:02:44.170> these<00:02:44.410> buttons

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.050 

time<00:02:48.000> bomb<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> eventually<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.700> going<00:02:50.850> to

my escape route this I'll try to rebuild
now<00:03:50.519> if<00:03:50.670> you're<00:03:50.849> building<00:03:51.379> your<00:03:52.379> drop<00:03:52.709> in

because<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.190> can't<00:03:59.430> be<00:03:59.640> dropping<00:04:00.239> shapes<00:04:00.720> at<00:04:01.019> a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
because it can't be dropping shapes at a

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.110 
because it can't be dropping shapes at a
time<00:04:01.319> bomb<00:04:01.530> at<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.800> same<00:04:01.980> time<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.700> it's<00:04:02.910> good
