00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.760
 more news and news about the new 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.889
 goddess that is going to be introduced in is mike 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.960
 The truth is that these developments have 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.150
 a time then since we know them from 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.100
 the last part but as it has not come out 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.980
 for now nothing more about this goddess 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.810
 Well, I decided to make a video 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.490
 with which I know that at least you have 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.080
 some information and you can go doing 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 assumptions 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.609
 good so creating jaime so as in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.349
 the whole new currency is going to be called being 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 that everything being so I do not know very well how 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
 pronounce is an Egyptian goddess I know that a 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.980
 many like the Egyptian gods like this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.469
 that many will love the fact 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 that this goddess is from there and the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.399
 It really is a goddess for quite 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.460
 curious what I have enough desire 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.820
 because she is the goddess in principle of the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.820
 scorpions and also from the healing of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.449
 poisonous things is not like that for a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 part bad thing is to say the scorpions 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.980
 the damage and on the other hand the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.260
 healing of spades and stings 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 of them in the poison with which 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.630
 I really want to see it really 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.939
 how 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.759
 in seals we do not know anything practically 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.310
 about his abilities and his passive ni 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.009
 nothing only if it seems by the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.990
 dating mania although it is not sure is that its 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.729
 passive so it's going to have two species 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.829
 of mechanics as in two instances not 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.630
 we know if it's going to be gel type if it's going to be 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.210
 blair guy we do not know exactly how 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.490
 it's going to be but it says good there will be a 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.799
 kind of jump 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
 good if at least something forward or 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.970
 towards the directions to be able 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.159
 move more quickly and then 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 we have another skill that seems to be going 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.810
 to be something similar to a given is to say 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.909
 to a kind of cargo so I do not 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.619
 We know exactly how I tell you how it goes 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.600
 to be this goddess that will include 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.159
 but I have enough desire for several 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.810
 things not the first is that I already have 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.240
 have long been eager for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.390
 take out a goddess a god in smile with 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.880
 form let's say monster we do not have 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.439
 that the enamel of many gods or things 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.810
 that they are not gods like demigods 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.420
 monsters but most have form 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.160
 human except a pair that are both of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.200
 acne and perhaps although good also a 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.630
 little because the truth is that most 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.310
 they have as I tell you human form and 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.810
 that on the one hand is fine but to me 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.720
 I would also like that 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.730
 some some gods that they had then 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.530
 it is shaped like a monster and they were 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.480
 very spectacular would you tell me and 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.100
 Lucas is facing and such but good the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.049
 truth is that I would also like no more 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.060
 more gods is for example if I had 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.799
 a form of scorpion because you know by 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.079
 example that with style and there was quite 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.480
 we hopped for a goddess like that of 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.370
 his last example and yet later 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.690
 with that little girl but then there's the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.349
 The last truth is that it transforms 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.540
 totally and I tell you that I would like 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.140
 at least personally that it was 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.640
 something like a kind of scorpion 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.709
 giant with human head or something by the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.650
 style and it's also quite interesting 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.269
 the fact that it is so 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.060
 say half scorpion half healer 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.560
 because you can good can take advantage 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.319
 of that the boys will stop doing for 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.870
 example that is a tank and that covers 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.519
 the allies at the same time that ball inflicts a 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.620
 little damage with your poison because 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.629
 I suppose he will have poison skills 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.120
 being the goddess of the scorpions of 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.650
 poison and good then also to be able 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.329
 focus obviously being mÃ¡laga 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.129
 being a guardian we do not know at the moment 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.590
 but those of seven as pretty enough 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.680
 curious to see how everything is going 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.359
 how hired is taking the news 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.890
 about this god and as well 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.620
 evidently they are implanted above and 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.420
 finally not so nothing and I tell you 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.000
 how good are they going 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.920
 updates or keep reporting by 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.989
 twitter and even here if it's any 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.310
 very fat and fruits to taste and what if 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.310
 we help mike to this other
