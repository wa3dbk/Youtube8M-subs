you to get around the track well you
know<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.469> would<00:00:10.710> say<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> bad<00:00:11.130> gated<00:00:11.519> Trotter

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
know I would say a bad gated Trotter

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.430 
know I would say a bad gated Trotter
that<00:00:12.030> through<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.330> outside<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> small

ones<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.870> got<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.230> really<00:00:16.379> patient

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
ones that you got to be really patient

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
ones that you got to be really patient
with<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.279> careful<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.119> hard<00:00:18.270> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
with and careful with and it's hard to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.490 
with and careful with and it's hard to
get<00:00:18.480> them<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.750> race<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:19.320> when

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
get them in the race you know when

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470 
get them in the race you know when
they're<00:00:19.619> bad<00:00:19.770> gated<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.400> doesn't<00:00:21.390> really

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
they're bad gated and doesn't really

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.570 
they're bad gated and doesn't really
have<00:00:21.660> any<00:00:21.869> speed<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.470> they<00:00:22.800> were<00:00:23.160> probably<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
have any speed so they were probably the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.550 
have any speed so they were probably the
most<00:00:23.699> difficult<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.330> me<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:25.439> it's

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
most difficult for me for me it's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.470 
most difficult for me for me it's
definitely<00:00:25.680> pullers<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:27.180> know<00:00:27.269> like

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
definitely pullers you know like

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.419 
definitely pullers you know like
sometimes<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.019> try<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> trip<00:00:29.010> them<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.250> as

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
sometimes you try to trip them out as

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.130 
sometimes you try to trip them out as
best<00:00:29.550> as<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.849> yeah<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.689> know<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.929> want

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
best as you can yeah you know you want

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.359 
best as you can yeah you know you want
to<00:00:31.199> give<00:00:31.289> them<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.439> best<00:00:31.590> known<00:00:31.920> best<00:00:32.189> shot

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
to give them the best known best shot

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.709 
to give them the best known best shot
and<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> race<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.660> one

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and now in a race but when you get one

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.600 
and now in a race but when you get one
that<00:00:33.960> pulls<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.530> hard<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.010> get<00:00:35.460> him<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that pulls it's hard to know get him a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280 
that pulls it's hard to know get him a
second<00:00:36.059> over<00:00:36.180> trip<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:36.660> old<00:00:36.840> trip<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
second over trip or two old trip so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
second over trip or two old trip so
those<00:00:38.070> are<00:00:38.309> definitely<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.719> find

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
those are definitely the one that I find

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.510 
those are definitely the one that I find
it<00:00:40.140> most<00:00:40.260> difficult<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.739> drive<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.340> about

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it most difficult to drive what about

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
it most difficult to drive what about
the<00:00:41.610> horses<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:42.629> always

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the horses out there that don't always

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.250 
the horses out there that don't always
give<00:00:43.649> 100%<00:00:44.070> themselves<00:00:44.910> ORS<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.170> do

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
give 100% themselves ORS what do you do

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.690 
give 100% themselves ORS what do you do
in<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> situation<00:00:46.469> well<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> definitely

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
in that situation well you definitely

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.610 
in that situation well you definitely
try<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.059> trick<00:00:48.300> him<00:00:48.420> into<00:00:48.510> making<00:00:49.230> their<00:00:49.469> work

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
try to trick him into making their work

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
try to trick him into making their work
but<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> definitely<00:00:50.190> take<00:00:50.640> an<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.270> trying<00:00:51.629> over

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
but I definitely take an on trying over

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
but I definitely take an on trying over
a<00:00:51.930> pole<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.199> any<00:00:52.379> day<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> week<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.640> know

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
a pole or any day of the week you know

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.610 
a pole or any day of the week you know
not<00:00:54.180> charge<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> usually<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.410> along

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
not charge you know I usually get along

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.420 
not charge you know I usually get along
with<00:00:55.739> those<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.129> because<00:00:56.280> I'm

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
with those a little bit because I'm

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
with those a little bit because I'm
aggressive<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.000> usually<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.809> wake<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.140> up

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
aggressive and usually I can wake one up

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619 
aggressive and usually I can wake one up
a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.440> bit<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.399> definitely<00:00:59.820> I'd<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
a little bit so I definitely I'd like to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.180 
a little bit so I definitely I'd like to
drive<00:01:00.750> those<00:01:00.930> better<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.379> would<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.039> say

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
drive those better I would have to say

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
drive those better I would have to say
the<00:01:02.370> horses<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:03.120> try<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.750> hard<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the horses that don't try so hard and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440 
the horses that don't try so hard and
the<00:01:04.290> horses<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.799> lazy<00:01:05.100> um<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.270> could

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the horses that are lazy um you could

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.270 
the horses that are lazy um you could
only<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.080> much<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> driver<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.100> them

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
only do so much as a driver to get them

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.910 
only do so much as a driver to get them
on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> bit<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.970> get<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> try<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.600> win

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
on the bit and to get them to try to win

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
on the bit and to get them to try to win
but<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> end<00:01:11.310> sometimes<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.330> feels<00:01:12.450> like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
but in the end sometimes it feels like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.090 
but in the end sometimes it feels like
you<00:01:12.900> want<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> race<00:01:13.680> bike<00:01:13.920> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you want to get off the race bike and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
you want to get off the race bike and
run<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.460> them<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:14.729> they're<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.210> not

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
run for them because they're just not

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
run for them because they're just not
going<00:01:15.900> anywhere<00:01:16.110> about<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> show<00:01:17.520> when<00:01:17.670> guys

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
a little you know what horse is good

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.610 
a little you know what horse is good
like<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.269> makes<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.720> very<00:03:01.840> hard<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.170> drive<00:03:02.440> him

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
like it makes it very hard to drive him

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.740 
like it makes it very hard to drive him
because<00:03:02.920> he's<00:03:03.070> so<00:03:03.190> tough<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.519> handle<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:04.000> would

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
because he's so tough to handle I would

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.199 
because he's so tough to handle I would
say<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.050> one<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.380> pulls<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.220> can't<00:03:06.880> steer

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
say the one that pulls in can't steer

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.350 
say the one that pulls in can't steer
that's<00:03:08.110> that's<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.620> bad<00:03:08.800> combination<00:03:09.360> you

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360

I grab on and they're tough to steer
those<00:03:22.329> are<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.590> ones<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:24.070> don't<00:03:24.130> look<00:03:24.310> forward

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
those are the ones I don't look forward

those are the ones I don't look forward
to<00:03:25.019> basically<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.140> horse<00:03:26.769> that<00:03:27.010> isn't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
to basically a horse that isn't

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.400 
to basically a horse that isn't
responsive<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.630> when<00:03:28.900> you're<00:03:28.989> trying<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.260> take

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
responsive to when you're trying to take

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.050 
responsive to when you're trying to take
one<00:03:29.620> off<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:29.890> gate<00:03:30.100> or<00:03:30.340> trying<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.730> get<00:03:30.880> him<00:03:30.970> to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
one off the gate or trying to get him to

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.270 
one off the gate or trying to get him to
relax<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.690> find<00:03:32.380> them<00:03:32.530> very<00:03:32.560> difficult<00:03:33.070> to

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
relax I find them very difficult to

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.130 
relax I find them very difficult to
drive<00:03:33.459> into<00:03:33.700> Meadowlands<00:03:34.180> because<00:03:34.450> um<00:03:34.690> you

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
drive into Meadowlands because um you

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.960 
drive into Meadowlands because um you
need<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.380> kind<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.739> be<00:03:35.950> able<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.310> rate<00:03:36.519> them<00:03:36.670> and

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
need to kind of be able to rate them and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.699 
need to kind of be able to rate them and
set<00:03:37.600> them<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.750> holes<00:03:37.989> when<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.230> need<00:03:38.380> seven

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
set them in holes when you need seven

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.590 
set them in holes when you need seven
holes<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.130> make<00:03:39.790> them<00:03:39.940> do<00:03:40.030> what<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.390> want

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600
