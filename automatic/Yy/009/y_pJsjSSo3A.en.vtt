00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
to this is that when you are banging on

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.410 
to this is that when you are banging on
it<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:06.770> final<00:01:07.159> time<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.490> do<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.850> you're<00:01:08.390> going

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
it the final time you do it you're going

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.330 
it the final time you do it you're going
to<00:01:08.540> throw<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:08.930> coin<00:01:09.200> up<00:01:09.409> just<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:10.040> little<00:01:10.070> bit

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
to throw the coin up just a little bit

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.180 
to throw the coin up just a little bit
enough<00:01:11.300> so<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:11.870> when<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.200> come<00:01:12.409> down<00:01:12.440> your

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
enough so that when you come down your

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.469 
enough so that when you come down your
hands<00:01:13.670> will<00:01:14.090> actually<00:01:15.640> let<00:01:16.640> go<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.120> pencil

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
hands will actually let go of the pencil

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.280 
hands will actually let go of the pencil
open<00:01:18.020> up<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.350> grab<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.490> coin<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:21.020> I'll<00:01:21.140> show

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
open up and grab the coin so I'll show

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.660 
open up and grab the coin so I'll show
you<00:01:21.320> what<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.590> looks<00:01:21.740> like<00:01:21.920> you're<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.640> to

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
you what it looks like you're going to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.820 
you what it looks like you're going to
hit<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.000> one<00:01:23.210> two<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.229> final<00:01:24.500> time<00:01:24.650> you're

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
hit it one two and the final time you're

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.920 
hit it one two and the final time you're
going<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.010> throw<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.370> up<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.670> catch<00:01:25.970> it<00:01:26.180> so

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
going to throw it up and catch it so

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.090 
going to throw it up and catch it so
it's<00:01:27.080> just<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.260> matter<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.500> practicing<00:01:27.950> that

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
it's just a matter of practicing that

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.860 
it's just a matter of practicing that
move<00:01:28.159> that's<00:01:28.580> throwing<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.000> up<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.240> catching

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
move that's throwing it up and catching

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.460 
move that's throwing it up and catching
it<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:31.570> big<00:01:32.570> part<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.020> trick<00:01:33.290> is

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
it a big part of this trick is

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.920 
it a big part of this trick is
disguising<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.340> catching<00:01:34.790> part<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.570> instead

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
disguising the catching part so instead

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.570 
disguising the catching part so instead
of<00:01:35.990> going<00:01:36.170> like<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:36.530> you're<00:01:36.770> going<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:36.950> say

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
of going like this you're going to say

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.480 
of going like this you're going to say
I'm<00:01:37.700> going<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.850> do<00:01:37.970> three<00:01:38.360> taps<00:01:38.540> one<00:01:38.960> two<00:01:39.460> three

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
I'm going to do three taps one two three

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.399 
I'm going to do three taps one two three
that<00:01:40.909> looks<00:01:41.090> very<00:01:41.330> obvious<00:01:41.720> you're<00:01:42.229> going<00:01:42.350> to

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
that looks very obvious you're going to

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.280 
that looks very obvious you're going to
want<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.619> try<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.060> make<00:01:44.060> each<00:01:44.299> one<00:01:44.900> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.049> taps

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
want to try to make each one of the taps

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.590 
want to try to make each one of the taps
as<00:01:45.530> close<00:01:45.830> as<00:01:46.010> possible<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.270> actual

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
as close as possible to the actual

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.780 
as close as possible to the actual
vanish<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.650> you're<00:01:49.010> not<00:01:49.100> going<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.310> go<00:01:49.430> soft

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
vanish so you're not going to go soft

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.560 
vanish so you're not going to go soft
soft<00:01:50.150> hard<00:01:50.990> you're<00:01:51.290> going<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.439> go<00:01:51.590> hard<00:01:52.570> all

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
soft hard you're going to go hard all

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.500 
soft hard you're going to go hard all
the<00:01:53.810> time<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.799> it<00:01:55.070> kind<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.340> disguises<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:55.909> the

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
the time so it kind of disguises it the
