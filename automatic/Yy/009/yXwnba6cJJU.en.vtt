they were very clear on that so the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.610 
they were very clear on that so the
first<00:02:24.250> step<00:02:24.459> we<00:02:24.820> took<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.480> with<00:02:26.200> Joseph

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
supposed to run throughout the whole

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.140 
supposed to run throughout the whole
game<00:02:36.070> yeah<00:02:38.320> we<00:02:39.320> were<00:02:39.470> so<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:40.400> think<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.850> took<00:02:41.000> an

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
