curl<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:53.100> 20<00:01:53.460> seconds<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.630> most<00:01:54.930> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
curl in like 20 seconds so like most of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.830 
curl in like 20 seconds so like most of
these<00:01:55.320> things<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:57.149> hope<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> does

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
these things I really hope that it does

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.870 
these things I really hope that it does
work<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.380> sounds<00:01:58.740> totally<00:01:58.920> phenomenal<00:01:59.729> if

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
work and it sounds totally phenomenal if

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.120 
work and it sounds totally phenomenal if
it<00:02:00.030> does<00:02:00.240> work<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:00.659> I'm<00:02:00.810> also<00:02:01.130> incredibly

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
it does work but I'm also incredibly

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.539 
it does work but I'm also incredibly
skeptical<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> already<00:02:04.259> assembled<00:02:05.100> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
skeptical so I already assembled this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.270 
skeptical so I already assembled this
little<00:02:06.299> puppy<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.899> let<00:02:07.350> me<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.500> forewarn

little puppy and let me just forewarn
you<00:02:08.399> some<00:02:09.000> assembly<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.750> required<00:02:10.310> this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
you some assembly is required this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.780 
you some assembly is required this

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.149 
took a good 45 minutes and I had to

fYI I never do but I actually had to
look<00:02:18.560> at<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.040> step<00:02:19.310> by<00:02:19.459> step<00:02:19.760> diagram<00:02:20.360> because

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
look at the step by step diagram because

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.039 
look at the step by step diagram because
it<00:02:22.010> was<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> little<00:02:22.579> scary<00:02:23.030> let's<00:02:23.450> just<00:02:23.750> give<00:02:23.930> it

I was saying before I started
horrifyingly<00:04:10.150> eating<00:04:10.599> chunks<00:04:11.019> of<00:04:11.140> my<00:04:11.290> own

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500

horrifyingly eating chunks of my own
hair<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:12.069> think<00:04:12.430> maybe<00:04:12.760> this<00:04:12.970> might<00:04:13.569> might

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
hair I think maybe this might might

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.680 
hair I think maybe this might might
potentially<00:04:15.459> work<00:04:15.730> on<00:04:16.000> somebody<00:04:16.329> with

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
potentially work on somebody with

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.779 
potentially work on somebody with
shorter<00:04:17.260> hair<00:04:17.289> or<00:04:17.799> like<00:04:17.949> shoulder<00:04:18.370> length<00:04:18.549> I

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
shorter hair or like shoulder length I

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:20.099 
shorter hair or like shoulder length I
really<00:04:19.239> thought<00:04:19.389> that<00:04:19.449> that's<00:04:19.660> what<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.930> hole

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
really thought that that's what the hole

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.080 
really thought that that's what the hole
in<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> bottom<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.859> bucket<00:04:21.039> was<00:04:21.340> for<00:04:21.609> was

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
in the bottom of the bucket was for was

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.180 
in the bottom of the bucket was for was
for<00:04:22.270> like<00:04:22.449> people<00:04:22.630> with<00:04:23.229> longer<00:04:23.680> hair<00:04:23.979> so

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
for like people with longer hair so

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.270 
for like people with longer hair so
their<00:04:24.370> hair<00:04:24.550> could<00:04:24.669> like<00:04:24.850> escape<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:25.720> twirl

through the longer bucket but no um I

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.680 
through the longer bucket but no um I
got<00:04:30.130> some<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.580> shorter<00:04:31.030> pieces<00:04:31.300> of<00:04:31.570> my

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
watching maybe I'll try another

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.899 
watching maybe I'll try another
infomercial<00:05:20.680> product<00:05:21.069> in<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.250> future<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.819> we

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:21.909 
infomercial product in the future and we

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.820 
infomercial product in the future and we
can<00:05:22.060> just<00:05:22.240> keep<00:05:22.449> going<00:05:22.779> on<00:05:22.900> through<00:05:23.259> them<00:05:23.439> keep

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
can just keep going on through them keep

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.379 
can just keep going on through them keep
going<00:05:24.069> on<00:05:24.159> down<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.550> line<00:05:24.669> till<00:05:25.029> we<00:05:25.120> find

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
going on down the line till we find

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.749 
going on down the line till we find
something<00:05:25.779> that<00:05:25.930> actually<00:05:25.960> works<00:05:26.740> like<00:05:27.159> maybe

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
something that actually works like maybe

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.040 
something that actually works like maybe
the<00:05:28.060> Aluma<00:05:28.569> wallet

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
the Aluma wallet

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.540 
the Aluma wallet
I've<00:05:29.439> always<00:05:29.710> wondered<00:05:29.919> if<00:05:30.159> I<00:05:30.219> could<00:05:30.250> actually

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
I've always wondered if I could actually

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.879 
I've always wondered if I could actually
like<00:05:30.909> run<00:05:31.509> over<00:05:31.840> that<00:05:31.990> thing<00:05:32.259> with<00:05:32.409> my<00:05:32.560> car<00:05:32.860> and

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
like run over that thing with my car and

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.100 
like run over that thing with my car and
if<00:05:33.129> it<00:05:33.279> really<00:05:33.580> would<00:05:33.849> work<00:05:34.120> I'm<00:05:34.659> just<00:05:34.960> gonna

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
if it really would work I'm just gonna

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.189 
if it really would work I'm just gonna
have<00:05:35.229> to<00:05:35.289> say<00:05:35.469> that<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.710> air<00:05:35.889> curler<00:05:36.250> is<00:05:36.699> very

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
have to say that the air curler is very

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.450 
have to say that the air curler is very
interesting<00:05:38.199> and<00:05:38.439> in<00:05:38.650> theory<00:05:39.039> it<00:05:39.250> would<00:05:39.400> be

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
interesting and in theory it would be

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.490 
interesting and in theory it would be
the<00:05:39.669> greatest<00:05:40.029> invention<00:05:40.779> ever<00:05:40.960> because<00:05:41.379> I'm

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
the greatest invention ever because I'm

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.170 
the greatest invention ever because I'm
always<00:05:41.710> wishing<00:05:42.069> that<00:05:42.339> my<00:05:42.400> hair<00:05:42.729> would<00:05:42.939> curl

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
always wishing that my hair would curl

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.950 
always wishing that my hair would curl
itself<00:05:43.750> but<00:05:44.259> I<00:05:44.589> don't<00:05:44.949> think<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.939> science<00:05:46.479> is

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
itself but I don't think that science is

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.629 
itself but I don't think that science is
ready<00:05:47.199> for<00:05:47.469> that<00:05:47.650> sort<00:05:48.069> of<00:05:48.159> thing

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
ready for that sort of thing

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.850 
ready for that sort of thing
so<00:05:48.819> I<00:05:48.849> kinda<00:05:49.479> have<00:05:49.779> to<00:05:49.810> say<00:05:50.139> that<00:05:50.319> this<00:05:50.499> thing

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
so I kinda have to say that this thing

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.839 
so I kinda have to say that this thing
doesn't<00:05:51.189> work

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
doesn't work

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.439 
doesn't work
Oh<00:05:52.199> or<00:05:53.199> I'm<00:05:53.620> stupid<00:05:54.159> either<00:05:54.669> way<00:05:54.939> no<00:05:55.240> matter
