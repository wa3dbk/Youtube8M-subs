something with the display to make it

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.930 
something with the display to make it
just<00:02:10.530> one<00:02:10.739> single<00:02:11.009> layer<00:02:11.280> instead<00:02:11.520> having<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
they've made it all into one and it

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.190 
they've made it all into one and it
saves<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.390> little<00:02:15.569> bit<00:02:15.659> of<00:02:15.719> room<00:02:15.840> as<00:02:15.930> far<00:02:16.079> as
