00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.060
 one more than a rich lemon ice cream this 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.950
 you have to put it on fire or anything 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.790
 to make lemon ice cream I'm going to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.090
 use 125 milliliters of lemon juice 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:25.560
 squeezed and strained 3 egg whites 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.410
 to remove the yolks 250 grams of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.520
 sugar 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.930
 and a half liter of whipped cream I'll 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.329
 start by whipping the cream lanata gets 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.329
 in a bowl 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:45.690
 the goal I had in the freezer 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.690
 while and the rods for how fast 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.130
 other half 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.359
 already the whipped cream is now there 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.530
 rinse the rods to mount here 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:20.409
 the whites I separated the whites from 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.960
 here of the buds we keep them in 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.920
 the refrigerator in stable for another 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.429
 recipe and then as I say it is rinsed 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 the rods and now the whites is mounted 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.520
 to point 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.130
 the whites are already about to snow and 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.020
 they form peaks that incorporate the rest 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.020
 of the sugar that remains of the cream 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:01.580
 Well, the merengue is already beaten 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.520
 we're going to move on now to the other one we're going to 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.429
 put here 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.459
 we will incorporate it or shake it with a 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.319
 ratico when incorporating sugar 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.319
 for it to dissolve comes the sugar 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.920
 we only have 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.080
 and now the cream is together 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.660
 meringue and we put the juice of 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.070
 lemon and everything is aimed and beats well of 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.070
 simple and slow 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.600
 which side has it been this is for 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.030
 spectacular what is he advised me to 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.340
 you can try it and if you need a little 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.920
 more sugar as it is sweeter or something 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.260
 then put him but I think he's 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.209
 very well so it is and now the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.340
 next step is to put it in a bowl and 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.640
 put it in the freezer and start 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.770
 put it in a bowl 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.770
 and we put it in the freezer 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.540
 the lemon ice cream 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:15.610
 that can be accommodated with the mold and look 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.620
 the cut how creamy 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.970
 it's so extraordinary that now I'm going to 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.470
 start catching balls and I'm going to put it on 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.230
 a cup here meanwhile I've put 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.280
 the julienne strips of lemon and I've 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.010
 put with a little bit of water 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.170
 sugar I made a syrup and they are 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.900
 confined what are some strips like 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.970
 in the after the cup and a cookie 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.180
 normal type you have at home 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.760
 I just cut him off for 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.480
 form some peaks and adopt a little 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.370
 cup and start by assembling catch 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.110
 some balls 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.960
 and put the cup 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.260
 so it is finished and prepared this 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.440
 As rich and economical glass as you have already 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.940
 seen and very easy to do what it is 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.780
 the lemon ice cream to taste it 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.780
 I hope you like it
