00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
dot dot dot they don't even leave the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.420 
dot dot dot they don't even leave the
part<00:00:32.989> where<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> says<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.950> too<00:00:35.040> late<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.340> get

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
part where it says is it too late to get

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.740 
part where it says is it too late to get
in<00:00:35.579> shape<00:00:35.610> they<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.120> say<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> too<00:00:36.570> late

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
in shape they just say is it too late

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
in shape they just say is it too late
from<00:00:37.079> me<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.980> always<00:00:38.100> makes<00:00:38.340> me<00:00:38.550> sad

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
from me and that always makes me sad

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
from me and that always makes me sad
because<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.540> leads<00:00:39.750> me<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.930> believe<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> they

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
because it leads me to believe that they

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
because it leads me to believe that they
don't<00:00:40.620> believe<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.340> themselves<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:42.149> there's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
don't believe in themselves that there's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.119 
don't believe in themselves that there's
actually<00:00:43.020> things<00:00:43.530> they<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.829> accomplish

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
actually things they can accomplish

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.010 
actually things they can accomplish
because<00:00:44.610> they've<00:00:44.760> let<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
because they've let them go for a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.110 
because they've let them go for a
certain<00:00:46.350> period<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.680> time<00:00:46.770> when<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> comes<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
certain period of time when it comes to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.310 
certain period of time when it comes to
bodybuilding<00:00:49.789> this<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.629> body<00:00:51.840> that

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
bodybuilding this is a your body that

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.510 
bodybuilding this is a your body that
you're<00:00:52.440> building<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:52.949> somebody<00:00:53.219> else's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you're building it's not somebody else's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
you're building it's not somebody else's
so<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> course<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.329> too<00:00:54.510> late<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> begin

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so of course it's not too late to begin

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.209 
so of course it's not too late to begin
building<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.250> body<00:00:56.550> fortifying<00:00:57.360> your<00:00:57.570> body

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
building your body fortifying your body

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
building your body fortifying your body

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
nothing to do with this now of course if

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.710 
nothing to do with this now of course if
you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.960> concept<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.650> mind<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.220> you're<00:01:11.720> 50

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you have a concept in mind and you're 50

20 year old or a 25 or a 30 year old
bodybuilder<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.509> sense<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
bodybuilder and you have that sense of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
bodybuilder and you have that sense of
that's<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.290> you'd<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that's what you'd like to look like that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.800 
that's what you'd like to look like that
is<00:01:22.189> unrealistic<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.420> might<00:01:24.630> not

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
is unrealistic because you might not

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
is unrealistic because you might not
believe<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.189> most

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
believe that right and the most

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.340 
believe that right and the most
important<00:01:26.880> part<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
important part of this is that you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.890 
important part of this is that you
actually<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:29.009> an<00:01:29.280> objective<00:01:30.119> that's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
actually have an objective that's

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.530 
actually have an objective that's
measurable<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:32.579> goal<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.240> believe

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
measurable and a goal that you believe

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
measurable and a goal that you believe
you<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.840> achieve<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.920> that's<00:01:35.250> where<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
you can achieve right so that's where a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.789 
you can achieve right so that's where a
lot<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.470> discouragement<00:01:37.470> comes<00:01:37.500> in

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
lot of the discouragement comes in

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
lot of the discouragement comes in
