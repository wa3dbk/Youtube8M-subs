00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.080 
knife in here let me compare the size of
them<00:05:43.210> this<00:05:44.210> the<00:05:45.050> standard<00:05:45.620> small<00:05:46.100> blade<00:05:46.340> is

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
them this the standard small blade is

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.240 
them this the standard small blade is
thicker<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.380> slightly<00:05:49.370> longer<00:05:49.970> than<00:05:50.210> the

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
thicker and slightly longer than the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.630 
thicker and slightly longer than the
classic<00:05:52.250> SD<00:05:52.850> it's<00:05:53.350> more<00:05:54.350> stable<00:05:54.800> than<00:05:55.280> this

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
classic SD it's more stable than this

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.900 
classic SD it's more stable than this
one<00:05:55.850> because<00:05:55.970> it<00:05:56.120> yeah<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.200> kind<00:05:57.500> of<00:05:57.650> like<00:05:57.920> this

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
one because it yeah it kind of like this

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.650 
one because it yeah it kind of like this
one<00:05:59.830> is<00:06:00.830> much<00:06:01.040> more<00:06:01.250> sturdy<00:06:01.580> so<00:06:02.150> I<00:06:02.180> like<00:06:02.510> this
