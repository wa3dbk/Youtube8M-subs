dipbrow<00:03:08.410> in<00:03:10.560> dark<00:03:11.560> brown<00:03:11.709> dark<00:03:12.220> brown<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.580> think

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
dipbrow in dark brown dark brown I think

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.640 
dipbrow in dark brown dark brown I think
I'm<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.090> between<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.200> dark<00:03:14.410> brown

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
I'm in between like the dark brown

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.850 
I'm in between like the dark brown
matches<00:03:14.890> my<00:03:15.489> kind<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.030> roots<00:03:16.269> up<00:03:16.540> here<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
matches my kind of roots up here but the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.949 
matches my kind of roots up here but the
chocolate<00:03:18.640> brown<00:03:18.819> is<00:03:19.150> more<00:03:19.330> red<00:03:19.569> so<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.870> would

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
chocolate brown is more red so it would

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.660 
chocolate brown is more red so it would
match<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.530> more<00:03:20.920> closely<00:03:21.129> so<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> think<00:03:21.519> I

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
match this more closely so I think I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.820 
match this more closely so I think I
need<00:03:21.760> to<00:03:21.879> get<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.360> chocolate<00:03:22.599> brown<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.110> mix

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
need to get the chocolate brown and mix

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.430 
need to get the chocolate brown and mix
the<00:03:24.010> two<00:03:24.190> in<00:03:24.459> order<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.790> get<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.239> lash<00:03:25.930> that<00:03:25.959> kind

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
the two in order to get a lash that kind

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.680
