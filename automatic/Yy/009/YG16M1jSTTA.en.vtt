wavelengths otherwise what happens is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.570 
wavelengths otherwise what happens is

the lens which is high protein starts

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490 
the lens which is high protein starts
breaking<00:01:21.000> down<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.600> denaturation

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
have high levels of free lutein in it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.090 
have high levels of free lutein in it
and<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:33.570> important<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.259> keep<00:01:34.409> them<00:01:34.619> supplied

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and it's important to keep them supplied

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
and it's important to keep them supplied
so<00:01:35.670> we're<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:35.970> only<00:01:36.210> talking<00:01:36.509> about<00:01:36.689> macular

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so we're not only talking about macular

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
so we're not only talking about macular
degeneration<00:01:37.409> before<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> entire<00:01:39.390> eye

skin is very important for protecting it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
skin is very important for protecting it
and<00:02:04.680> lutein<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:05.969> of<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> few<00:02:06.390> nutrients

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and lutein is one of the few nutrients

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
and lutein is one of the few nutrients
that<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.380> been<00:02:07.530> shown<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.069> scientific

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that have been shown in scientific

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.050 
that have been shown in scientific
studies<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.780> actually<00:02:10.289> reduce<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.220> chances

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
studies to actually reduce the chances

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.710 
studies to actually reduce the chances
of<00:02:12.120> having

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
of having

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.830 
of having
in<00:02:12.780> cancer<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.910> you're<00:02:15.270> talking<00:02:15.450> about<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
in cancer so you're talking about the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.020 
in cancer so you're talking about the
eye<00:02:15.870> we're<00:02:16.320> talking<00:02:16.620> about<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.950> skin<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.460> as

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
eye we're talking about the skin and as

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.940 
eye we're talking about the skin and as
research<00:02:18.660> goes<00:02:19.020> on<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.590> more<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.860> these

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
research goes on and more of these

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.100 
research goes on and more of these
long-term<00:02:20.460> studies<00:02:20.910> show<00:02:21.210> it's<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:22.050> to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
long-term studies show it's going to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.530 
long-term studies show it's going to
show<00:02:22.320> them<00:02:22.530> other<00:02:22.740> diseases<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.360> going

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
show them other diseases that it's going

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.170 
show them other diseases that it's going
to<00:02:24.630> be<00:02:24.750> helpful<00:02:25.070> so<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.190> lutein<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.640> deposited

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
to be helpful so the lutein is deposited

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.540 
to be helpful so the lutein is deposited
in<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.420> skin<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:28.290> more<00:02:28.530> than<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:28.830> meets<00:02:29.310> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
in the skin as more than just meets the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.990 
in the skin as more than just meets the
eye

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
eye

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.640 
eye
correct<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.600> more<00:02:30.900> than<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.230> meets<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.620> eye

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
correct how more than just meets the eye

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.390 
correct how more than just meets the eye
all<00:02:32.490> right<00:02:32.760> thank<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.060> doctor
