00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:10.750
 Well understand it This time is a video shooting function 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:13.090
 The movie shooting function of the digital camera is comparable to a dedicated video camera 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.290
 I have come to be able to take pictures 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:24.760
 You can see the reason 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:31.300
 Shooting function of songs of recent digital camera videos real is mounted as I said sure and is 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:36.170
 The image quality was about extra , but now it is not only possible to shoot in high-definition 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.410
 Some models do not capture images that can not be taken with conventional video cameras 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.480
 It has become possible to go west 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.880
 Still camera and still camera 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:55.480
 I often distinguish the camera that shoots a movie as a movie camera 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:59.050
 Unlike the film era, the internal mechanisms of both parties are quite 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.500
 The reason is that it is possible from the conversion 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:10.190
 8 old times the camera of glory male juice is 8 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:13.200
 Video camera was taking pictures in the film is Eipuri a video camera 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.719
 I was armed with a video a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:24.119
 In recent years, both of them use an image sensor 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:29.790
 Since've got to take the Te a also a that if this say branch of the camera 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:36.600
 We have been promoting the development that it would be more convenient if the video was taken 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.190
 You can get a better sound by attaching an external microphone like this 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 Let's jet well 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.480
 Or Although this I'm about to have lens is not linked Miya unreasonable 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.090
 a When you shoot with a movie 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.540
 Oitemoee to accessories or to enhance the wax apple which you could use more convenient 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.960
 Yeah 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.049
 We increase thing corresponding to video 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.720
 Dejikamede It is a relatively cheap product that you can take the image that the movie hangs down 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.490
 The so-called digital almost how even the SLR 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:13.640
 Although I have come to neglect the user to use it has been gradually increasing gradually 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:18.500
 It seems that various machines are getting better with people 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.440
 a Of course it 's a regular user, but especially to shoot commercials and movies 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.220
 The 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:28.030
 Professional people 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.660
 Been also quite engraftment that they make can be loose to choose Yappa choose to select the lens 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.430
 Right 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:38.439
 This fact is not to evolve further from now on 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:44.079
 So far with still camera in graduation or athletic season 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:50.250
 I think many fathers brought in both movie cameras, but for the next shooting opportunity 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.250
 How about trying the video shooting with a digital camera
