of them and that's usually what causes

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.650 
of them and that's usually what causes
them<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.470> be<00:00:58.710> painful<00:00:59.130> if<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> flat<00:01:00.360> mole

but<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.009> painful<00:01:05.670> mole<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.090> usually<00:01:06.869> not<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.410> sign

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
but a painful mole is usually not a sign

it's easy to overdo it so remember less
