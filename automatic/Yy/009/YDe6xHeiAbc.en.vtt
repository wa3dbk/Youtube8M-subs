00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.719 
a really simple game and flappy bird was
created<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.450> developed<00:01:54.689> by<00:01:55.140> dom<00:01:55.740> new<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
created and developed by dom new one I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850 
created and developed by dom new one I
don't<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.329> how<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> speak<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.710> it's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
don't know how to speak it out but it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.160 
don't know how to speak it out but it's
long<00:01:59.250> new<00:01:59.579> one<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.969> he<00:02:00.390> loves<00:02:00.570> nation<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.140> think

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
long new one and he loves nation I think

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.039 
long new one and he loves nation I think
Vietnam<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> span<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.210> two<00:02:03.509> days<00:02:03.540> or

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
Vietnam and in the span of two days or

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.230 
Vietnam and in the span of two days or
three<00:02:04.079> days<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.950> he<00:02:05.100> created<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.700> game<00:02:05.729> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
three days and he created that game so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.990 
three days and he created that game so
it's<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.680> simple<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:08.160> program<00:02:08.879> I

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it's really really simple to program I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.609 
it's really really simple to program I
think<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.539> almost<00:02:09.959> everybody<00:02:10.289> could

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
think that almost everybody could

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
think that almost everybody could
program<00:02:10.860> such<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> game<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.360> need

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
program such a game but they just need

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.340 
program such a game but they just need
to<00:02:12.569> learn<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:13.050> bit

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
to learn a bit

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.710 
to learn a bit
India<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:14.130> he<00:02:14.400> programmed<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.390> span<00:02:15.690> of

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
India so he programmed that in span of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.880 
India so he programmed that in span of
two<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.590> three<00:02:16.890> days<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:18.540> right<00:02:18.780> he<00:02:19.710> got

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
two to three days all right he got

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.660 
two to three days all right he got
millionaire<00:02:20.510> because<00:02:21.510> he<00:02:22.110> earns<00:02:22.350> around<00:02:23.010> 50k

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
millionaire because he earns around 50k

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.550 
millionaire because he earns around 50k
US<00:02:24.090> dollars<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> day<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:26.420> 1.5<00:02:27.420> million<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.260> month

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
US dollars a day and 1.5 million a month

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.340 
US dollars a day and 1.5 million a month
that's<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.850> really<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.630> huge<00:02:30.990> amount

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that's just a really really huge amount

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.340 
that's just a really really huge amount
for<00:02:31.980> yet<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.760> everybody<00:02:33.210> but<00:02:33.810> he<00:02:34.080> lets<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
for yet for everybody but he lets a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.260 
for yet for everybody but he lets a
nation<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.800> nation<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.580> probably<00:02:35.880> know<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
nation a nation you probably know the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.960 
nation a nation you probably know the
most<00:02:36.450> people<00:02:36.870> aren't<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.260> rich<00:02:37.560> they<00:02:38.520> do<00:02:38.580> not

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
most people aren't that rich they do not

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.240 
most people aren't that rich they do not
have<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.540> much<00:02:39.600> money<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.800> think<00:02:40.860> he's

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
have that much money and I think he's

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.550 
have that much money and I think he's
even<00:02:41.610> more<00:02:41.790> rich<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.360> those<00:02:42.540> countries<00:02:43.170> or

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
even more rich in those countries or

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.700 
even more rich in those countries or
these<00:02:43.800> counters<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:44.460> Vietnam<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.680> a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
these counters like Vietnam so this is a

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.950 
these counters like Vietnam so this is a
really<00:02:47.010> huge<00:02:47.280> amount<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.850> money<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.660> everybody

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
really huge amount of money to everybody

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.830 
really huge amount of money to everybody

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.469 
made like I think chuckling a game is
called<00:04:46.770> like<00:04:47.009> chocolate<00:04:47.490> ball<00:04:47.729> I<00:04:47.970> don't

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
called like chocolate ball I don't

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.659

really<00:04:48.690> know<00:04:48.900> but<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.199> heard<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.770> he<00:04:49.949> actually

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
really know but I heard that he actually

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
the third to rank or something so we are

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:01.580
