 The video below has been rated as only a bronze audience 

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:13.335
 It may contain terrible drama and AFKs may offend some people 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.360
 Audience discretion 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.094
 Hi guys, here Arkadian comes back with another episode 4 copper 

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:22.400
 This week's topic, champion selection 

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:25.535
 Tip 4 copper 

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.769
 So this week I will focus on the discussion. 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.034
 Champion choices and some things you may not really think about, but it is definitely important 

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:36.160
 And should help you climb 

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:41.788
 So let's take a step back 

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:42.654
 Before you even hit the play button 

00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:43.260
 And think 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.200
 Are you even willing to play this game? 

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:51.015
 First of all, if you are tired, hungry, upset, or stunned 

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.475
 You won't play, and 

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:57.214
 You will be more likely to feel depressed, but may just let you say or do something 

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:59.569
 May pick up and tilt you another player 

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.494
 Make sure you have time to play the game 

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:06.573
 League of Legends is not a game of 30 minutes or even 45 minutes 

00:01:06.573 --> 00:01:10.840
 You should make sure you have at least one uninterrupted hour before you line up 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.670
 Because how long does this take? 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.636
 Then, you have to think about the champion choice, queuing flash, loading the screen 

00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:20.335
 All these things take time 

00:01:22.175 --> 00:01:23.375
 Don't play on the slope 

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:29.235
 Tilting is the last game when you turn off or feel bad, or the last few games you have played. 

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:33.796
 If you enter a game with a negative attitude, you might as well take your LP far 

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:40.875
 Something to help avoid tilt is to recognize that failure is an inevitable fact of the game. 

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.275
 Even the best player lost 50% of the game 

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:48.540
 So just remember that the failure is the best thing to play every game is just a question. 

00:01:48.716 --> 00:01:49.436
 Because it involves 

00:01:49.436 --> 00:01:54.034
 But if this goes on, because it happens to all of us, just take a break 

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:54.560
 Don't play 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.580
 Feel like playing gambling 

00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:01.695
 You are literally betting system 25-30 LP, you will win the next game 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.700
 And if you win, you get the LP, but if you lose, you lose it 

00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:14.171
 Now, if you have a terrible hand, you won't bet, so don't bet your LP, if you don't put all the trumps 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.500
 Now you know that you are ready to play, you line up and choose in the championship 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.695
 Let your ally meet 

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:27.615
 The way I think about it is, I don’t know who these people are. 

00:02:27.954 --> 00:02:29.794
 What kind of days, they already have 

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:32.680
 If they are right, if they are angry or depressed 

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:39.175
 So it's just better to think they are losing their minds and the edge of AFKing 

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:44.480
 Now, whether you like it or not, the riot leader will match the other four of you. 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.140
 And these are all four people, you have your team, which will make the difference between winning and losing 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.295
 You already have 5 enemy enemies team 

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:55.696
 You no longer need to be at your 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.360
 This is to say that knowing a happy team = the dream of ELO 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.980
 It's time to hire super old man tactics 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.400
 But just as cheerful and positive 

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:10.875
 Just like you can hate it or say nothing, because it might 

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.994
 This is a strategy game that will increase your chances of winning 

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.415
 Just like a baron or take a punishment to the jungle 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.460
 This is also good for people to talk about 

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.568
 Let people know what you like to play 

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:27.180
 At the same time, let them know if you can fill in anything 

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:30.373
 But open the counter with your own preferences and you get it 

00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:36.494
 But if someone finally says: "Mid-Autumn Festival or Channel" or "ADC only" 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.260
 But really want to play this role 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.695
 Find LoLking or Op.gg they summon 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.380
 See how much of them play this role, can you just play this role? If it is, just let them have it 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.356
 This will make them happy, it will help you win the game 

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.874
 Even if you are a better character than they are 

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:59.974
 Also respect the order, but other ecpect your allies do the same 

00:04:00.503 --> 00:04:06.743
 If someone 2 is arrogant below you say "top or AFK", you think you can pick Tryndamere because 

00:04:06.743 --> 00:04:08.354
 It's all good because you are the second overall 

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:11.274
 If his Insta don't be surprised to lock Timo 

00:04:11.274 --> 00:04:16.154
 If you want to climb, you need to adapt, accept, some people will be stubborn 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.340
 This is your job and got the best results 

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:24.975
 Now you have sorted out your team and want to know where you are going to play. 

00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:29.535
 It’s time to pick a champion, and now many people believe that they have a better chance to win. 

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:33.826
 If they choose their LCS see a month of OP champions 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.360
 Or top picks 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.940
 This is not true at all. To be honest, LCS rarely or even applies to SoloQ elements forever. 

00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:44.894
 Not to mention the lower ELOS 

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:50.114
 Yes, this is the fact that some champions are really strong, lovers and nerfs 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.540
 But it almost always plays what you like 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.896
 What are you comfortable with? 

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.854
 If you have a 150 game Darius and know his inside out 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.000
 But Maokai is the current OP champion 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.995
 Play Darius because your skills are always greater than a slightly overtuned champion 

00:05:12.418 --> 00:05:16.658
 That being said, you should never criticize others’ picks. 

00:05:16.658 --> 00:05:17.240
 If someone tries to win a champion who is out of yuan or weak 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.180
 They play with them, they are comfortable 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.774
 Who picks random champions who usually make you surprised and most of the enemy 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.540
 No one knows how to play Malzahar against AD 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.500
 Finally, I can't stress how important it is, you can have at least one champion to play every role 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.414
 People say that you should never just play a championship climb, but I disagree 

00:05:39.414 --> 00:05:43.740
 Because the best way to get the best game in this game is to play better against the enemy. 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.480
 And the quickest way to get there is to be the best you can 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.720
 Playing just a champion can increase your chances of climbing a lot 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.715
 But you must also realize that you won't get your role in every game, so you have to be able to fill 

00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:04.354
 The general rule of thumb is to be able to play at least one champion in each role as well 

00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:07.755
 When you get more comfort, you can expand your pool 

00:06:09.615 --> 00:06:13.695
 Do you know that you can use search terms in the championship selection? 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.480
 You can type something in the like "AHRI | VI | Fiora" 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.275
 Show only those champions 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.580
 Or “^ SH” shows all champions starting with these letters 

00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:29.115
 Or all with "I" by using the end champion "I $" 

00:06:29.115 --> 00:06:35.695
 I will leave the description in the full list of commands, but this may be very convenient for all the champions to be ready to pick 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.520
 Just in case someone is taking a moment to choose 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.014
 When you enter the lobby, throw a funny YouTube video or joke to ease the mood 

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:47.654
 In the championship talk about the choices that can easily cheer up, maybe turn them off 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.760
 People associate with positivity and win speech 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.754
 Track your allies, 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.820
 If someody says they can only play Hecarim and have 1000 Hecarim games 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.520
 Then the queue flashes, is he in your team? 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.020
 Maybe it's a ban on Hecarim, so it's a good idea to make their enemy team unable to play him. 

00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:08.073
 So all this is for this week 

00:07:08.073 --> 00:07:10.060
 I hope that you have learned something, I hope you like it. 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.140
 I am looking forward to reading all your suggestions for next week, what do you think of this one? 

00:07:15.297 --> 00:07:17.377
 So until next time, scurbs! 

00:07:17.377 --> 00:07:22.455
