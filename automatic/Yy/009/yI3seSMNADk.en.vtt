does<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.829> reinforcement<00:00:38.579> rings<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.059> can

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
does have reinforcement rings as you can

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.630 
does have reinforcement rings as you can
see<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.770> looks<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.280> we've<00:00:41.399> got

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
see here so it looks like what we've got

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
see here so it looks like what we've got
here<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> three<00:00:42.329> ply<00:00:42.570> shell<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> then

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
here is a three ply shell and then

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.709 
here is a three ply shell and then
you've<00:00:44.250> got<00:00:44.460> reinforcement<00:00:45.210> rings<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
you've got reinforcement rings on it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.049 
you've got reinforcement rings on it
that's<00:00:46.410> not<00:00:46.649> unusual<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:47.460> seen<00:00:47.670> many<00:00:47.969> many

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that's not unusual I've seen many many

Gretch Gladstone's with reinforcement

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.170 
Gretch Gladstone's with reinforcement
rings<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.340> unusual<00:00:53.489> trait

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
rings so that is not an unusual trait

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
rings so that is not an unusual trait
and<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.870> fact<00:00:54.899> an<00:00:55.260> original<00:00:55.680> gret

see right there a lever on and off and
generally<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.299> was<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> pad<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:11.040> here

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
generally there was a pad that was here

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.179 
generally there was a pad that was here
if<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.080> can<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> pad<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:13.979> right

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
if we can get that the pad was right

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.149 
if we can get that the pad was right
here<00:01:14.340> inside<00:01:16.369> coming<00:01:17.369> off<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.830> little

particular one has a very strange
cable<00:01:28.259> system<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.890> piece<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
cable system here there is this piece of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
cable system here there is this piece of
metal<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.119> attached<00:01:33.990> all<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
metal that you see here attached all the

metal that you see here attached all the
way<00:01:34.470> across<00:01:34.710> there's<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> strange-looking

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
way across there's a strange-looking

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.350 
way across there's a strange-looking
cable<00:01:36.720> right<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:38.310> runs<00:01:38.579> over<00:01:39.030> here

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
cable right there that runs over here

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.910 
cable right there that runs over here
and<00:01:42.360> that's<00:01:42.930> tipped<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> drum<00:01:43.649> up<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.890> little

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
and that's tipped the drum up a little

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.859 
and that's tipped the drum up a little
bit<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:45.020> get<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> angle<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.659> this<00:01:48.659> is

bit here get the angle on this this is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.719 
bit here get the angle on this this is
attached<00:01:49.259> I'm<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> move<00:01:50.490> back<00:01:50.700> over

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
attached I'm going to move back over

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.039 
attached I'm going to move back over
here<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> shell

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.219 

right<00:01:56.680> there<00:01:56.979> then<00:01:57.909> there's<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.270> pad<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
right there then there's a pad that

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.120 
right there then there's a pad that
creates<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.770> muffler<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.350> lever

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
creates the muffler and with this lever

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.389 
creates the muffler and with this lever
that<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.939> would<00:02:07.090> turn<00:02:07.390> here<00:02:07.689> theoretically

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that you would turn here theoretically

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.580 
that you would turn here theoretically
this<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.610> going<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:10.030> move<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.080> cable<00:02:11.440> does

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
this is going to move and the cable does

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.470 
this is going to move and the cable does
move<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.099> but<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.760> moves<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.299> rather

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
move it but it moves it in a rather

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.020 
move it but it moves it in a rather
awkward<00:02:13.810> way<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.440> not<00:02:14.560> very<00:02:14.799> well<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:15.879> I<00:02:15.910> think

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
awkward way and not very well so I think

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.830

out<00:02:44.410> of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.560> shell<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:46.989> a<00:02:47.019> little<00:02:47.380> bit

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
out of the shell so this is a little bit

there are three holes here that were

there are three holes here that were

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
drilled for a tone control and it looks

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.400 
drilled for a tone control and it looks
to<00:02:54.970> me<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.629> slingerland<00:02:56.230> tone

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
to me like it was a slingerland tone

to me like it was a slingerland tone
control<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.360> of<00:02:58.540> course<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:58.900> present<00:02:59.459> so

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
control that is of course not present so

control that is of course not present so
this<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> very<00:03:01.569> very<00:03:01.810> nice<00:03:01.989> example<00:03:02.560> I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
this is a very very nice example I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.140 
this is a very very nice example I
suspect<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.130> will<00:03:03.190> be<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.340> very<00:03:03.489> good<00:03:03.760> sounding

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
suspect it will be a very good sounding

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.729 
suspect it will be a very good sounding
drum<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:05.739> will<00:03:05.920> get<00:03:06.069> this<00:03:06.389> cleaned<00:03:07.389> up

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
drum but we will get this cleaned up

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.890 
drum but we will get this cleaned up
assembled<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.160> ready<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.459> go<00:03:09.760> shortly<00:03:10.690> and

assembled and ready to go shortly and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.349 
assembled and ready to go shortly and
then<00:03:11.019> we'll<00:03:11.079> do<00:03:11.350> another<00:03:11.380> video<00:03:11.739> on<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.359> so

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
then we'll do another video on it so

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.430 
then we'll do another video on it so
meanwhile<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.690> just<00:03:13.930> wanted<00:03:14.109> to<00:03:14.200> give<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.350> a

interior of the drum and again the shell

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.610 
interior of the drum and again the shell
is<00:03:22.359> very<00:03:22.420> nice<00:03:22.810> nothing<00:03:23.139> wrong<00:03:23.380> with<00:03:23.560> the

is very nice nothing wrong with the

and it is in fact the correct Gretsch

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.760 
and it is in fact the correct Gretsch
