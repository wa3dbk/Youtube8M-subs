00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.919
 why I saw an interesting first half in terms of play 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.959
 unless little percussion before logical sir 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.119
 then in the second period when you can touch the breasts and then amiens at the 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.150
 prohibited 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.340
 the idea of ​​showing who she was and who were present at the meal held 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.980
 the second largest balloon in the world 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.439
 first round 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.849
 the new at least that's what we did a good first half in 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.199
 opening the score 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.119
 he is at this moment 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.100
 in the second half 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100
 shame on them on the end it was a little harder physically 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.780
 we are ready for the rest there was the opportunity to play 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.690
 some players who were playing rather than 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.970
 the setbacks and the same criteria 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.160
 you will see that it could exceed the blues 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 from these analyzed elements will be impossible 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.850
 to do the best 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.940
 on their side the participants won 1 06 g but on a kick 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.400
 stopped what 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.970
 what does not it is unhurt victory is the hour of play 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.310
 the results of the study 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.820
 other advanced a friendly match 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.450
 that's what he says 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.960
 the new troubles 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.470
 however the national team 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
 sincerely I thought because it's a nice opposition 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.860
 during his interview on the site 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.870
 for the representative of the prosecution of paris is right now said all of 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.320
 after 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 more than his daughter was more a few days than we 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.620
 this press release 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.440
 imitating sales that I said about ten fifteen years later right away 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.170
 - we will work on his future 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.420
 very soon they will continue 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.830
 more the opposite 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.640
 these communities or just 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.350
 two days after the flight 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.540
 according to his services 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660
 this closure 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.360
 our nation 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.590
 most obvious consequence like that and it's a whole city that has to 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 host the final which made at least 610 people missing 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.370
 how to stay in the mindset of what I want I ask 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.840
 he produces some game is a lot of movement 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.790
 we do not have enough lucid for tonight
