00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello and welcome to a new 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.589
 tutorial one devoted this time to a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.620
 free quality host that I have 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.179
 found but I wanted to share with you 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.019
 for you to create at first 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.960
 website 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.570
 so here it is a host that I 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 judge of very good quality 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 indeed so you can have a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.099
 space of 2 gigas which is not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.460
 negligible if you want to create a site 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:36.239
 showcase or even a good site 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 here is 100 giga traffic and php mysql which 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 are understood here it's gone 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 so the first thing you go 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.879
 to do it is to register me I am 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:52.860
 already registered you connect passes 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.140
 and that's it, so here you come 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.300
 on some lands face what you 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.879
 will do at first these 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.410
 new account accommodation 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.040
 there you have three choices be there the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.119
 free on the single business premium 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.560
 I will show you the free 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.560
 which you order 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.000
 and you come on this interface there 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.090
 what you will be able to do here 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.110
 it's creating a new domain or rather 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.530
 a domain and free offered by hocine 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:39.880
 station so you see here under domain 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:41.440
 you put for example and there you have 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.080
 the choice between several extensions 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.460
 So know that this is a subdomain it 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.610
 this is not an area the bread at 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.540
 world it's small point are you have the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:57.040
 choice here url ponte h beautiful for them the 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.240
 crimes at this point as it's very 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.570
 important because in terms of 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.700
 referencing the subdomains in very 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.670
 little chance of going back into 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.550
 first results of the engines of 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.230
 search such as google yahoo or bing 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.890
 so me what I advise you is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.660
 to buy your own domain name and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.360
 to put it on the stinger but that's it 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.100
 so for example we're just going to create a 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.610
 subdomain so that I can you 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:30.760
 show 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:33.710
 how does it all work continue 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.910
 so that's free domain motion 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.090
 designer points of disagreement points 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:49.370
 as taken 0 euros and you come back on 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:52.130
 coach and I agree ac was so 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.260
 here we are here so here is your 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.030

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.540

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.940
