00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.309
 make a birthday card 3 of 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.309
 scrapbooking with boat shape 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.050
 this is the template that you can 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.150
 find in the video description 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.849
 is ready to print in two 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.599
 a4 leaves cut and pasted together by the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.599
 dotted line 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.610
 I'm using scrapbooking paper 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.500
 double face choose the face you want that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.090
 stay in the part of the frame and draw the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.200
 template on the opposite side so that 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.200
 no remain of the scope 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.989
 use a punch to mark the lines 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.989
 before folding that they are perfect 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.150
 and also marks the sides with a 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.780
 pencil using the template to fold in 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 the exact site 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.539
 now it folded following the marks that 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.130
 we have done with the punch and it hits with 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.090
 glue stick in the most part 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.090
 inside of each side 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.360
 it was a little bit of glue in the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.360
 edges and that were slanted 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.010
 Now you can decorate the card with 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.500
 cut out washi stickers as more you 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 like I'm using the party series 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.250

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.370
 of the video I leave you also the link to your 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.370
 page 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.930
 I used the garland cut-out 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.690
 to decorate the top of the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.550
 card I have also cut out balloons and 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.450
 paste them on a cardboard base for 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.450
 that have reliefs 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.360
 Now stick those on the card with a little 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.360
 of tape 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.470
 remember a label and hold it with a 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.310
 little cord to write your message 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.310
 birthday 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.080
 you can put a little more cord in the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.130
 back to hang and use 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.130
 as if it were a painting 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.360
 You can also use the idea as a picture 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.360
