moving so like you can kind of limit

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.530 
moving so like you can kind of limit
your<00:02:30.099> part<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.430> map<00:02:30.640> really<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.390> if

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
your part of the map really like if

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.050 
your part of the map really like if
their<00:02:31.750> barn<00:02:32.019> or<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.620> bomber<00:02:32.980> if<00:02:33.549> they're<00:02:33.879> over

their barn or a bomber if they're over

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.430 
their barn or a bomber if they're over
there<00:02:34.120> by<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.330> crates<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.019> don't<00:02:35.200> see

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
there by the crates and you don't see

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.720 
there by the crates and you don't see
them<00:02:35.560> cross<00:02:35.890> like<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:36.610> they're

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
them cross like this then they're

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.580 
them cross like this then they're
probably<00:02:36.760> mostly<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.629> side<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.500> can

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
probably mostly a side and you can

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.900 
probably mostly a side and you can
actually<00:02:38.769> i'm<00:02:38.980> going<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.160> knife<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.579> gate<00:02:39.760> you

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
actually i'm going to knife the gate you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.550 
actually i'm going to knife the gate you
can<00:02:39.940> actually<00:02:40.360> hear<00:02:40.569> me<00:02:40.840> knife<00:02:41.079> the<00:02:41.260> gate<00:02:41.410> from

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
can actually hear me knife the gate from

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.930 
can actually hear me knife the gate from
there<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:42.700> if<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.879> listen<00:02:43.180> really<00:02:43.209> close<00:02:44.940> if

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.390 
there so if you listen really close if
you<00:02:46.569> hear<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.989> then<00:02:47.470> there<00:02:47.650> then<00:02:47.680> there<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.160> b

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
you hear that then there then there on b

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389 
generator spot if you jump up here you

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:32.199 
generator spot if you jump up here you
can<00:07:29.419> see<00:07:29.659> middle<00:07:29.930> and<00:07:30.499> top<00:07:31.339> top<00:07:31.849> ball<00:07:32.059> in<00:07:32.149> the
