00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:13.509
 the growth of bayóvar is one of the most important riches of Peru 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.609
 is located in the province of sechura 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.729
 department of Piura about a thousand kilometers north of Lima 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.550
 the main objective of the bayóvar project 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.349
 is the concentration extraction of the largest phosphate deposit in 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.470
 South America 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.550
 the project contemplates the construction of nine components 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.700
 industrial highway concentrator plant we are truck unloading 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 conveyor belt on torrent 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.230
 drying and storage area 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 sea ​​water drive line 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.930
 lines of transmission 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.050
 before traveling 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.770
 currently failing 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.820
 it is important to know what will be the source of energy supply 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.160
 electrical during operation 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.400
 the necessary electrical energy 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.850
 will be supplied from the network of the national interconnected system 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.159
 through a corridor of keys called 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.759
 substation derivation that will provide the 18 'goal required for the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:15.670
 draft 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.860
 a little more than twice the energy required by your driver 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 let's see now the other components of the project 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.500
 the bayóvar phosphate deposit 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.370
 is of organic origin 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.420
 the project contemplates the exploitation of the first five layers 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.330
 with exploitable reserves amounting to 238 million tons 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.110
 the deposit is covered by an overload consisting of sand and 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.830
 sedimentary material 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.450
 which must be previously removed in the text stage e to leave the mineral 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.720
 exposed 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.640
 the physical characteristics of the deposit 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.280
 allow exploitation without the requirement of drilling and blasting 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.569
 so I have finished 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.830
 It will be done with conventional mining equipment 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.110
 Overload and sterile material 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.859
 constitute the clearing of the exploitation 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:14.959
 This material will be transported in trucks and deposited in the dump of 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:15.840
 clearance 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.049
 located in the north of the country 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.239
 the ore extracted from the pact will be transported in trucks 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.799
 and deposited in a mineral piling zone 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.799
 feeding the ore to the concentrator plant 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.510
 It will be carried out by means of a system of loading pumps feeders and belts 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.159
 transporters 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.159
 concentrator plant 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.779
 the concentrator plant 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.549
 It has been designed to produce phosphate concentrate 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.999
 the ore will be received on Monday and what will allow a feeding 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.579
 constant 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.809
 The concentration consists of washing steps and gravimetric separations 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:56.760
 successive 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.199
 with sea water 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.419
 for the final stage of the process the concentrate will be washed with water 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.159
 desalinated 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.189
 in order to remove the largest amount of salts present in the 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.499
 conservative 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.199
 a desalination plant will be installed 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.189
 the method of 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.029
 cosmos instincts 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:20.600
 In the concentrator plant, two types of waste will be generated. 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.799
 tailings tailings and fine tailings 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.169
 the imprisoned rebels will be accumulated in a pile adjacent to the plant 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.499
 concentrator 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:31.010
 and the pine tailings 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.519
 will be sent through a high density plastic pipe 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:39.769
 so to the tailings wives located inside the mine where they will be 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.089
 deposited while the clarified water will be pumped to the zone of 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.999
 evaporation 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:49.629
 It is important to note that during all stages of the concentration process 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.820
 until the tailings disposal 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820
 chemical reagents will not be used 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.639
 industrial highway 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.959
 it has been decided that the concentrate 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.919
 will be transported in trucks from the concentrator plant to the 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.459
 truck unloading 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.629
 For this end 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.189
 an industrial highway will be built 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.310
 that will travel an approximate distance of 31 point 20 kilometers 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.359
 along this road the trucks will travel the train 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.210
 capacity 70 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.800
 the industrial highway 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.779
 It will have a width of 12 meters 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.490
 truck unloading area 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.550
 the trucks will be unloaded physically at two points of 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.759
 reception 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.099
 Additionally 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.270
 an alternative discharge area called the emergency bird has been planned 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.270
 located days in which to the truck unloading area 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.129
 conveyor belt on the ground 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.309
 The concentrate of the truck unloading area will be transported to the 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:05:01.139
 drying and storage or by means of a system of conveyor belts on 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:01.919
 domineering 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.599

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.999
 In its whole 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.239
 covers an approximate distance of five kilometers 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.300
 drying and storage area 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.409
 this zone includes the drying system 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.099
 storage silo 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.580
 and auxiliary facilities 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.069

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.350
 chair for its later boarding through a tubular strip by the 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.710
 body 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.750
 the port will be located in the southern sector of the sechura bay between the zones 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.970
 called Punta lagoons and needle point 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.639
 body facilities 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.809
 allow to load at a rate of 3 thousand 500 tons per hour 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:53.199
 and in equipment must allow to load all the ship's holds 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.619
 no need to move 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:00.009
 the design characteristics of the facilities considered in the 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.110
 ships of up to 100 thousand tons of displacement 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.539
 with a maximum draft of 14 to five meters 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.909
 sea ​​water drive line 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.650
 The concentrator plant requires seawater as a necessary input for the 

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:20.550
 concentration process 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.699
 For this end 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.020
 will be installed a system of uptake the momentum of sea water 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.699
 designed to supply a pumping flow rate greater than three thousand meters 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.729
 cubic per hour 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.779
 the discharge line will discharge into a sedimentation pond 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.009
 and the bosé water will be stored in a storage pond located in the 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.999
