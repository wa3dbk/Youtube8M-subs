your rock racer or rock crawler there's
only<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.590> few<00:00:25.769> points<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.609> keep

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
only a few points that you need to keep

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
only a few points that you need to keep
in<00:00:26.910> mind<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.439> course<00:00:28.470> your

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
in mind the first one is of course your

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.189 
in mind the first one is of course your
budget<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:30.210> only<00:00:30.330> spend<00:00:30.539> however<00:00:30.990> much

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
budget you can only spend however much

you<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.619> spend<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> more<00:00:32.520> money

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
you want to spend but the more money

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.190 
you want to spend but the more money
that<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.940> pay<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.360> higher<00:00:33.540> quality<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that you pay the higher quality of a

proline now in equivalent cavies this is
about<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.300> 2500<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.930> brushed

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
about like a 2500 and with brushed

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
about like a 2500 and with brushed
motors<00:01:04.650> they're<00:01:04.949> slightly<00:01:05.460> slower<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.630> an

equivalent brushless motor that is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
equivalent brushless motor that is
popular<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> mostly<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.409> brushed

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
popular and mostly it's because brushed

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.820 
popular and mostly it's because brushed
motors<00:01:11.070> wear<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.400> faster<00:01:11.960> but<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> also

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
motors wear out faster but you can also

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.940 
motors wear out faster but you can also
see<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:15.420> brushless<00:01:16.020> motors<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.770> rated

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
see that brushless motors can be rated

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.219 
see that brushless motors can be rated

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
an 8 turn it's actually an eight and a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.350 
an 8 turn it's actually an eight and a
half<00:01:23.700> turn

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
motor is 3100 and so it's just a little

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100

easier<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.579> compare<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.090> way<00:01:30.299> when<00:01:30.990> you're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
easier to compare that way when you're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.960 
easier to compare that way when you're

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
in many cases will end up being a better

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.910 
in many cases will end up being a better
choice<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.570> difference<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.050> Pohl<00:02:42.290> count<00:02:42.590> can

choice the difference of Pohl count can

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.760 
choice the difference of Pohl count can
change<00:02:43.220> how<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.670> motor<00:02:44.210> starts<00:02:44.660> up<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> high

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
change how the motor starts up so a high

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.830 
change how the motor starts up so a high
pole<00:02:46.070> motor<00:02:46.370> will<00:02:46.610> start<00:02:46.850> up<00:02:47.000> smoother<00:02:47.540> than<00:02:47.780> a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
pole motor will start up smoother than a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.170 
pole motor will start up smoother than a
low<00:02:48.080> pole<00:02:48.320> motor<00:02:48.590> however<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.400> do<00:02:49.580> sacrifice

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
low pole motor however you do sacrifice

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.480 
low pole motor however you do sacrifice
top-end<00:02:50.690> speed<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.190> if<00:02:52.310> you're<00:02:52.459> looking

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
top-end speed and so if you're looking

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.640 
top-end speed and so if you're looking
for<00:02:52.730> better<00:02:53.030> low-speed<00:02:53.480> control<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:54.080> high<00:02:54.380> pole

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
for better low-speed control a high pole

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.920 
for better low-speed control a high pole
motor<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.190> usually<00:02:55.820> better<00:02:56.180> than<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.540> low<00:02:56.690> pole

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
motor is usually better than a low pole

lower<00:04:16.760> slot<00:04:17.060> count<00:04:17.390> motors<00:04:17.750> however<00:04:18.560> lower

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
lower slot count motors however lower

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.460 
lower slot count motors however lower
slot<00:04:19.190> count<00:04:19.519> motors<00:04:19.940> can<00:04:20.450> have<00:04:20.660> more<00:04:20.870> snap<00:04:21.230> off

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
slot count motors can have more snap off

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.860 
slot count motors can have more snap off
the<00:04:21.500> line<00:04:21.890> and<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:22.340> they<00:04:22.670> feel<00:04:22.910> like<00:04:22.970> they<00:04:23.270> can

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
the line and so they feel like they can

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.370 
the line and so they feel like they can
have<00:04:24.050> more<00:04:24.320> torque<00:04:25.390> generally<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:27.080> will<00:04:27.200> buy

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
have more torque generally you will buy

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.230 
have more torque generally you will buy

another<00:04:43.010> thing<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.400> consider<00:04:43.490> with<00:04:43.970> brushed

another thing to consider with brushed
motors<00:04:44.630> at<00:04:44.780> least<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.260> whether<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:45.980> have<00:04:46.190> a

hand wound three slot armature as you

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.780 
hand wound three slot armature as you
can<00:04:56.990> see<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:58.040> copper<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.790> much<00:04:59.120> neater<00:04:59.600> inside

the hand wound armature and this gives

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.800 
the hand wound armature and this gives
you<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.010> lot<00:05:04.220> more<00:05:04.430> torque<00:05:04.790> power<00:05:05.450> and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
you a lot more torque power and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.680 
you a lot more torque power and
efficiency

between<00:05:59.900> 35<00:06:00.560> turn<00:06:00.890> and<00:06:01.070> 27<00:06:01.700> turn<00:06:01.910> has<00:06:02.300> proven

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
between 35 turn and 27 turn has proven

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.630 
between 35 turn and 27 turn has proven
to<00:06:02.780> be<00:06:02.840> the<00:06:03.020> most<00:06:03.169> popular<00:06:03.470> and<00:06:03.950> as<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.490> name

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
to be the most popular and as the name

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.850 
to be the most popular and as the name
suggests<00:06:04.850> it<00:06:05.210> has<00:06:05.240> more<00:06:05.720> torque<00:06:05.990> on<00:06:06.200> startup

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
suggests it has more torque on startup

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.590 
suggests it has more torque on startup
and<00:06:07.010> will<00:06:07.490> produce<00:06:07.669> just<00:06:07.940> a<00:06:08.090> little<00:06:08.300> bit<00:06:08.419> more

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
and will produce just a little bit more

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.240 
and will produce just a little bit more
power<00:06:08.870> than<00:06:09.230> a<00:06:09.290> crawl<00:06:09.500> Master<00:06:09.860> version

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
power than a crawl Master version

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.610 
power than a crawl Master version
however<00:06:10.760> both<00:06:11.360> will<00:06:11.600> be<00:06:11.720> well<00:06:11.930> suited<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.320> most

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
however both will be well suited to most

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.640 
however both will be well suited to most
