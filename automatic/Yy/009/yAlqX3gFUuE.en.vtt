all<00:00:00.780> right<00:00:00.960> so<00:00:01.110> what<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.530> do

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
all right so what we're going to do

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.290 
all right so what we're going to do
today<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:02.129> go<00:00:02.310> through<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.550> steps<00:00:02.669> involved

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
today is go through the steps involved

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.990 
today is go through the steps involved
in<00:00:03.389> making<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.750> 90<00:00:04.140> degree<00:00:04.500> bend<00:00:04.830> in<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.160> piece<00:00:05.430> or

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
in making a 90 degree bend in a piece or

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.540 
in making a 90 degree bend in a piece or
by<00:00:06.210> two<00:00:06.270> inch<00:00:06.750> from<00:00:06.960> balloon<00:00:07.259> which<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.340> this

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
by two inch from balloon which is this

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.669 
by two inch from balloon which is this
right<00:00:08.790> here<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> quite<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.809> simple<00:00:10.139> two<00:00:10.530> by

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
right here is a quite a simple two by

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.539 
right here is a quite a simple two by
four<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.280> pretty<00:00:12.120> much<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.500> field<00:00:13.769> bin

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
four and pretty much in the field bin

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.430 
four and pretty much in the field bin
like<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.759> could<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.420> used<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:16.020> such<00:00:16.230> thing

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
like this could be used for such thing

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.820 
like this could be used for such thing
as<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.830> pact<00:00:17.100> between<00:00:17.340> an<00:00:18.119> empanada

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
as like a pact between an empanada

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400 
as like a pact between an empanada
so<00:00:20.490> pretty<00:00:20.820> much

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.040 

the<00:00:24.220> 90-degree<00:00:24.759> bend<00:00:25.000> right<00:00:25.150> here<00:00:25.449> and<00:00:25.779> it's

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
the 90-degree bend right here and it's

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.599 
the 90-degree bend right here and it's
actually<00:00:26.439> building<00:00:26.919> up<00:00:27.009> the<00:00:27.250> little<00:00:27.460> patch

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
actually building up the little patch

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.509 
actually building up the little patch
right<00:00:27.880> there<00:00:28.230> between<00:00:29.230> like<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.800> tail<00:00:29.980> the

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
right there between like the tail the

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.979 
right there between like the tail the
tail<00:00:30.550> of<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.910> plane<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.269> a<00:00:31.359> few<00:00:31.539> slots<00:00:31.689> right

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
tail of the plane and a few slots right

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.840 
tail of the plane and a few slots right
here<00:00:32.230> so<00:00:33.100> we're<00:00:33.280> going<00:00:33.399> to<00:00:33.460> do<00:00:33.610> this<00:00:33.760> Bend<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
here so we're going to do this Bend and

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
here so we're going to do this Bend and
so<00:00:38.010> after<00:00:39.010> we<00:00:39.040> get<00:00:39.309> your<00:00:39.460> 2x4<00:00:39.970> piece<00:00:40.269> you<00:00:40.750> also

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
so after we get your 2x4 piece you also

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.890 
so after we get your 2x4 piece you also
have<00:00:41.019> to<00:00:41.110> make<00:00:41.260> sure<00:00:41.470> that<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.890> grain<00:00:42.190> of<00:00:42.550> the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
have to make sure that the grain of the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.390 
have to make sure that the grain of the
aluminum<00:00:43.900> is<00:00:44.110> going<00:00:44.170> lengthwise<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.220> that

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
aluminum is going lengthwise and that

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.680 
aluminum is going lengthwise and that
your<00:00:45.579> Bend<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.120> flying<00:00:46.360> up<00:00:46.750> against<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.829> grain

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
your Bend is flying up against the grain

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.520 
your Bend is flying up against the grain
next<00:00:49.690> we're<00:00:49.780> going<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.930> have<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.140> mark<00:00:50.350> out<00:00:50.500> our

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
next we're going to have to mark out our

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.689 
next we're going to have to mark out our
measurement<00:00:51.040> so<00:00:51.159> I<00:00:51.220> have<00:00:51.339> a<00:00:51.370> couple

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
measurement so I have a couple

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.710 
measurement so I have a couple
measurements<00:00:51.850> here<00:00:53.339> there's<00:00:54.339> a<00:00:54.510> few<00:00:55.510> certain

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
measurements here there's a few certain

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.869 
measurements here there's a few certain
reference<00:00:56.110> points<00:00:56.559> that<00:00:56.710> we<00:00:56.860> need<00:00:57.189> to<00:00:57.610> put<00:00:57.729> on

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
reference points that we need to put on

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
reference points that we need to put on
important<00:00:58.629> for<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.379> band

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
important for the band

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
important for the band
so<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.019> start<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.469> their

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so we're going to start out with their

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
so we're going to start out with their
Bend<00:01:01.829> tangent<00:01:02.340> lines<00:01:02.519> these<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.789> these<00:01:03.539> lines

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
Bend tangent lines these are these lines

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.380 
Bend tangent lines these are these lines
here<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.950> these<00:01:07.950> lines<00:01:08.400> are<00:01:08.670> where

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
here and here and these lines are where

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.600 
here and here and these lines are where
your<00:01:09.540> Bend<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:09.990> start<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.280> order<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
your Bend will start and in order to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.980 
your Bend will start and in order to
find<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.030> Bend<00:01:12.210> tangent<00:01:12.659> lines<00:01:12.780> you're

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
find your Bend tangent lines you're

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.930 
find your Bend tangent lines you're
going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> need<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.440> find<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> step<00:01:13.979> back<00:01:14.190> and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
going to need to find a step back and

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.270 
going to need to find a step back and
your<00:01:15.659> step<00:01:15.990> back<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.409> promotes<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> distance

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
your step back this promotes a distance

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
your step back this promotes a distance
from<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> been<00:01:18.000> tangent<00:01:18.420> line<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.720> Imola

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
from the been tangent line and Imola

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.350 
from the been tangent line and Imola
line<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.409> pretty<00:01:19.920> much<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.909> formula

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
line so pretty much there's a formula

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.230 
line so pretty much there's a formula
where<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.630> add<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:21.810> material<00:01:22.710> thickness

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
where you add your material thickness

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.800 
where you add your material thickness
0.040<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.710> add<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.759> radius<00:01:27.539> of<00:01:27.690> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
0.040 and add it to your radius of the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.320 
0.040 and add it to your radius of the
bends<00:01:28.289> times<00:01:28.649> your<00:01:29.039> angle<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.850> I'll<00:01:30.119> actually

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
bends times your angle and I'll actually

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.380 
bends times your angle and I'll actually
give<00:01:30.630> us<00:01:30.750> our<00:01:30.869> measurement<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.440> here<00:01:32.390> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
give us our measurement right here and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.200 
give us our measurement right here and
also<00:01:34.050> using<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.979> handy<00:01:35.340> dandy<00:01:35.460> six-inch

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
also using your handy dandy six-inch

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.630 
also using your handy dandy six-inch
ruler<00:01:36.360> actually<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> back<00:01:37.530> shows<00:01:37.830> simple

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
ruler actually all the back shows simple

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.600 
ruler actually all the back shows simple
measurements<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.210> help<00:01:39.390> calculate<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:40.610> on

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
measurements and help calculate it on

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
measurements and help calculate it on
your<00:01:42.229> earpiece<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> once<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.960> done<00:01:46.229> and

your earpiece so once that is done and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
your earpiece so once that is done and
the<00:01:46.800> setback<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.429> done<00:01:47.700> you're<00:01:48.270> going<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> now

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the setback is done you're going to now

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
the setback is done you're going to now
calculate<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.229> Bend<00:01:49.470> allowance<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.280> is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
calculate your Bend allowance which is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.510 
calculate your Bend allowance which is
like<00:01:51.200> measurement<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.350> between<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> tangent

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
like measurement in between the tangent

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.430 
like measurement in between the tangent
lines<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.630> bend<00:01:54.810> allowance<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
lines and the bend allowance is the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.249 
lines and the bend allowance is the
material<00:01:55.830> used<00:01:56.009> for<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> bend<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.960> lastly

material used for the bend and lastly

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.230 
material used for the bend and lastly
there<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.860> sight<00:01:59.220> line<00:01:59.429> which<00:01:59.970> is<00:02:00.090> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
there is a sight line which is this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.289 
there is a sight line which is this
dotted<00:02:00.539> line<00:02:00.840> right<00:02:01.049> here

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
dotted line right here

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.660 
dotted line right here
and<00:02:02.570> you're<00:02:02.990> set<00:02:03.170> line<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.859> been<00:02:04.310> radius

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
and you're set line is the been radius

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.279 
and you're set line is the been radius
measured<00:02:04.850> from<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.329> bend<00:02:05.509> tanjit<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.140> is

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
measured from the bend tanjit that is

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.570 
measured from the bend tanjit that is
going<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.520> break<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:10.190> shows<00:02:10.369> you

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
going in the break so just shows you

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.699 
going in the break so just shows you
example<00:02:11.390> right<00:02:11.540> here

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709

all right so then after its marked out
we're<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.799> go<00:02:16.950> over<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> break<00:02:17.640> can

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
we're going to go over to the break can

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.570 
we're going to go over to the break can
bend<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> snuff
