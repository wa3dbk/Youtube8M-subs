great if you guys would leave a like and
another<00:00:22.380> thing<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.220> reason<00:00:23.580> why<00:00:23.730> I'm

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
another thing is the reason why I'm

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.220 
another thing is the reason why I'm
bringing<00:00:23.939> up<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.359> theory<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.779> because

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
bringing up this theory is because

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.759 
bringing up this theory is because
people<00:00:25.470> are<00:00:26.160> saying<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.150> a

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
people are saying that there is a

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.470 
people are saying that there is a
different<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.849> pack<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> punch

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
different not going to be a pack a punch

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.680 
different not going to be a pack a punch
in<00:00:30.689> origins<00:00:31.470> well<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.460> honestly<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.450> there

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
in origins well I honestly think there

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.030 
in origins well I honestly think there
is<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.079> be<00:00:34.110> some<00:00:34.380> kind<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> upgrading

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
is going to be some kind of upgrading

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.160 
is going to be some kind of upgrading
machine<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.820> pack<00:00:36.059> lunch<00:00:36.390> now<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
machine but not the pack lunch now the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.229 
machine but not the pack lunch now the
reason<00:00:37.410> why<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> think<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.520> der

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
reason why I think that is because der

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
reason why I think that is because der
riese<00:00:39.480> was<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.110> first<00:00:40.379> zombie<00:00:40.590> map<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.219> have

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
riese was the first zombie map to have

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.250 
riese was the first zombie map to have
the<00:00:41.670> pack<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> punch<00:00:42.210> why<00:00:42.750> didn't<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.050> bring

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the pack a punch why didn't they bring

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
the pack a punch why didn't they bring
it<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.559> Oscar<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.010> toten<00:00:44.510> rocked<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.719> shi

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it in an Oscar and toten rocked and shi

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.720 
it in an Oscar and toten rocked and shi
no<00:00:46.079> numa<00:00:46.110> well<00:00:46.559> some<00:00:46.829> are<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.190> saying<00:00:47.489> that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
no numa well some are you saying that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
no numa well some are you saying that
they<00:00:47.910> didn't<00:00:48.149> think<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> idea<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.410> i<00:00:49.440> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
they didn't think of the idea but i have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
they didn't think of the idea but i have
a<00:00:49.800> whole<00:00:50.039> different<00:00:50.370> theory<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.879> let's<00:00:51.510> get

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a whole different theory so let's get

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
a whole different theory so let's get
started<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.320> video<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:53.190> i<00:00:53.219> know<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
started with this video now i know a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
started with this video now i know a
pack<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> punch<00:00:54.270> like<00:00:54.539> machine<00:00:54.989> will<00:00:55.230> be

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
pack a punch like machine will be

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.110 
pack a punch like machine will be
returning<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.280> would<00:00:56.399> disappoint<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> lot

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
returning or they would disappoint a lot

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.650 
returning or they would disappoint a lot
of<00:00:57.270> fans<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.350> i'm<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:58.949> saying<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.789> der<00:01:00.420> rise

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
of fans so i'm just saying that der rise

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
of fans so i'm just saying that der rise
or<00:01:01.020> jury<00:01:01.230> sore<00:01:01.770> yeah<00:01:02.100> der<00:01:02.340> riese<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
or jury sore yeah der riese was the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.719 
or jury sore yeah der riese was the
first<00:01:03.270> zombie<00:01:03.780> map<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.430> pack<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
first zombie map to have the pack a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.820 
first zombie map to have the pack a
punch<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.200> guys<00:01:07.320> know<00:01:07.560> already

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
punch and if you guys know already

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.850 
punch and if you guys know already
origins<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.850> before<00:01:09.090> der<00:01:09.689> riese<00:01:09.930> some

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
origins is way before der riese some

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.410 
origins is way before der riese some
could<00:01:11.040> argue<00:01:11.070> saying<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:11.790> didn't<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
could argue saying they didn't think of

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.940 
could argue saying they didn't think of
the<00:01:12.479> pack<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> punch<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.200> Trek<00:01:13.680> didn't

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the pack a punch on your Trek didn't

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
the pack a punch on your Trek didn't
think<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> pack<00:01:14.490> punching<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.090> upgrading

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
think of the pack punching or upgrading

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
think of the pack punching or upgrading
abilities<00:01:16.049> before<00:01:16.460> darice<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.729> thought<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
abilities before darice they thought of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.929 
abilities before darice they thought of
it<00:01:18.330> way<00:01:18.509> after<00:01:18.930> darice<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.610> during<00:01:20.610> darice

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it way after darice or during darice

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.480 
it way after darice or during darice
when<00:01:21.090> they're<00:01:21.240> making<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.350> my<00:01:22.950> theory<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
when they're making it but my theory is

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.560 
when they're making it but my theory is
that<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:24.360> did<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.229> reason<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.570> this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that they did this for a reason and this

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.050 
that they did this for a reason and this
new<00:01:27.810> machine<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.470> doesn't<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:28.909> upgrade<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
new machine it doesn't just upgrade it

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240 
new machine it doesn't just upgrade it
doesn't<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> gun<00:01:30.900> better<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.500> changes

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
doesn't make the gun better it changes

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
doesn't make the gun better it changes
the<00:01:32.460> weapon<00:01:32.850> altogether<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.259> only<00:01:34.590> reason

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the weapon altogether the only reason

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
the weapon altogether the only reason
why<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.220> theory<00:01:35.880> fits<00:01:36.060> in<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.600> whole

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
why this theory fits in with the whole

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.679 
why this theory fits in with the whole
zombies<00:01:37.320> storyline<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.920> because<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
zombies storyline is because if if this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
zombies storyline is because if if this
is<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.530> make<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> new<00:01:41.009> machine<00:01:41.159> why

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
is so if they make a new machine why

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940 
is so if they make a new machine why
wasn't<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.509> any<00:01:42.960> other<00:01:43.259> zombie<00:01:43.710> maps

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
wasn't in a the any other zombie maps

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.179 
wasn't in a the any other zombie maps
well<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.659> took<00:01:46.049> too<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.470> element<00:01:46.890> 115

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
well they it took too much element 115

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
well they it took too much element 115
they<00:01:47.579> couldn't<00:01:47.850> fund<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.420> they<00:01:48.570> couldn't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
they couldn't fund it and they couldn't

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.469 
they couldn't fund it and they couldn't
make<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.979> they<00:01:50.340> only<00:01:50.490> had<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.000> machine

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
make more so they only had one machine

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.889 
make more so they only had one machine
and<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> map<00:01:52.500> origins<00:01:53.720> now<00:01:54.720> our

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
and this was in the map origins now our

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
and this was in the map origins now our
I<00:01:55.140> said<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.710> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.070> put<00:01:56.460> pack<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> punch<00:01:57.119> this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
I said that if you put pack a punch this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.450 
I said that if you put pack a punch this
weapon<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.170> makes<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> gun<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.070> whole

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
weapon and it makes the gun a whole

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.100 
weapon and it makes the gun a whole
different<00:01:59.820> other<00:01:59.939> weapon<00:02:00.360> what<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> mean<00:02:01.049> by

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
different other weapon what I mean by

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
different other weapon what I mean by
that<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.740> doesn't<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.219> make<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> bolts

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
that is it doesn't just make the bolts

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330 
that is it doesn't just make the bolts
stronger<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.439> kills<00:02:04.710> higher

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
stronger and get more kills higher

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.869 
stronger and get more kills higher
rounds<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.600> my<00:02:06.930> my<00:02:07.380> theory<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.310> does<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
rounds and my my theory is it does a

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119 
rounds and my my theory is it does a
whole<00:02:09.660> lot<00:02:09.899> more<00:02:10.080> than<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.530> changes<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
whole lot more than that it changes the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.340 
whole lot more than that it changes the
effect<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.819> game<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.360> chain

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
effect of the game it just chain

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.650 
effect of the game it just chain
is<00:02:13.410> elements<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> game<00:02:14.460> maybe<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:15.090> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
is elements of the game maybe if you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.300 
is elements of the game maybe if you
were<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.050> use<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.380> Wonder<00:02:16.740> weapon<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.190> this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
were to use the Wonder weapon in this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.880 
were to use the Wonder weapon in this
map<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.090> upgrade<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.230> sort<00:02:19.800> of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
map and you upgrade it with this sort of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890 
map and you upgrade it with this sort of
machine<00:02:20.040> kind<00:02:20.520> of<00:02:20.610> thing<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.720> could

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
machine kind of thing and you could

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.300 
machine kind of thing and you could
change<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.380> weather<00:02:22.530> maybe<00:02:22.860> because<00:02:23.160> you

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
change the weather maybe because you

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.740 
change the weather maybe because you
know<00:02:23.430> how<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.760> trailer<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.360> says<00:02:24.570> it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
know how in the trailer it says it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.060 
know how in the trailer it says it
shifts<00:02:25.230> whether<00:02:25.530> from<00:02:26.280> fog<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:27.180> snow<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.900> rain

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
shifts whether from fog to snow to rain

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.520 
shifts whether from fog to snow to rain
maybe<00:02:29.070> there<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.930> wonder<00:02:30.930> weapon<00:02:31.080> kind<00:02:31.470> of

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
maybe there is a wonder weapon kind of

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.290 
maybe there is a wonder weapon kind of
thing<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.640> put<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.120> machine

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
thing and if you put in this machine

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.870 
thing and if you put in this machine
you're<00:02:33.870> able<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.320> change<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.010> style<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.640> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
you're able to change the style of the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.120 
you're able to change the style of the
gameplay<00:02:36.590> now<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.740> was<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.010> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
gameplay now that was just a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.920 
gameplay now that was just a
demonstration<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> were<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.600> put<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
demonstration if you were to put the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.280 
demonstration if you were to put the
Wonder<00:02:40.530> weapon<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.370> machine<00:02:41.670> and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
Wonder weapon in this machine and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.780 
Wonder weapon in this machine and
remember<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.710> theories<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.580> is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
remember this is all theories this is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.020 
remember this is all theories this is
just<00:02:45.180> my<00:02:45.630> opinion<00:02:45.660> or<00:02:46.350> just<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.770> thoughts<00:02:47.130> so

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
just my opinion or just my thoughts so

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.050 
just my opinion or just my thoughts so
it's<00:02:48.480> nothing<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.290> even<00:02:50.010> worry<00:02:50.490> about<00:02:50.580> if<00:02:50.940> you

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
it's nothing to even worry about if you

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.760 
it's nothing to even worry about if you
guys<00:02:51.240> really<00:02:51.570> want<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.960> pack<00:02:52.140> lunch<00:02:52.440> this

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
guys really want the pack lunch this

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.230 
guys really want the pack lunch this
isn't<00:02:53.040> even<00:02:53.130> confirmed<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.970> want<00:02:54.150> to

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
isn't even confirmed I just want to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.150 
isn't even confirmed I just want to
bring<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.540> out<00:02:54.720> there<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.140> am<00:02:55.710> saying<00:02:56.040> that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
bring this out there I am saying that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.310 
bring this out there I am saying that
der<00:02:56.640> riese<00:02:56.850> was<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.330> first<00:02:57.630> map<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.080> have<00:02:58.200> the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
der riese was the first map to have the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.070 
der riese was the first map to have the
pack<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> punch<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.190> some<00:03:00.030> say<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.810> was

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
pack a punch and some say that it was

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.450 
pack a punch and some say that it was
because<00:03:01.530> they<00:03:01.710> didn't<00:03:01.920> think<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.280> idea

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
because they didn't think of the idea

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.910 
because they didn't think of the idea
but<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:03.690> think<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.290> there's<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:04.890> be

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
but I do think that there's going to be

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.920 
but I do think that there's going to be
a<00:03:04.980> different<00:03:05.340> kind<00:03:05.460> of<00:03:05.490> machine<00:03:05.910> to<00:03:06.630> make<00:03:06.780> it

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
a different kind of machine to make it

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.720 
a different kind of machine to make it
all<00:03:07.020> fit<00:03:07.260> with<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.620> storyline<00:03:08.130> or<00:03:08.160> something

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
all fit with the storyline or something

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.180 
all fit with the storyline or something
like<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.530> let<00:03:10.530> me<00:03:10.620> hear<00:03:10.740> what<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.950> guys<00:03:11.130> have
