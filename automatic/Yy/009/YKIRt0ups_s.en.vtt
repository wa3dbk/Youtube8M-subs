00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.180
 breading shrimp 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.290

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.210
 Well, I'm going to show you how 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.420
 approach in your oven at 350 degrees in 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.920
 my criminal twain is always going 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.460
 preheating the criminal I learned it 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.170

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.569
 So my chicken was more or less than Alava 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:01.050
 is already very rich and I approved the ones that 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.460
 falls is 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.500
 really good we're going to put the 650 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.470
 fingers 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.730
 never again with its aluminum foil because 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.730
 I do not want to be whipped 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.480
 but you can put it on a 22 of 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.530
 if they have 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.530
 I'm going to put here 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.990
 a few minutes 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.180

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.100

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.230
 Well finally my chicken was like that 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.060
 see more or less lasted 30 minutes and the 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.980
 it's really delicious I introduced a 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.570
 little knife and I'm going to leave it there 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.910
 because my husband still does not arrive from 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.650

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.250
