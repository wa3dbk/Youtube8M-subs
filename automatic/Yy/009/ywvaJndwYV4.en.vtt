i did in my video yesterday if you're
growing<00:01:26.369> them<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.670> bedrock<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.689> replaces<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
growing them on bedrock it replaces the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.310 
growing them on bedrock it replaces the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
bedrock with a block of earth which
