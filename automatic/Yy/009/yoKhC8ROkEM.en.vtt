00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.070 

the<00:00:28.029> reason<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:28.450> that<00:00:28.480> normally<00:00:28.990> the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
the reason is that normally the

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.350 
the reason is that normally the
conventional<00:00:29.680> style<00:00:29.950> is<00:00:30.759> where<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.000> pull<00:00:31.240> the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
conventional style is where you pull the

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.229 
conventional style is where you pull the
bar<00:00:31.570> right<00:00:32.050> up<00:00:32.349> to<00:00:33.280> here<00:00:33.550> yeah<00:00:33.880> and<00:00:33.910> then<00:00:34.120> go

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
bar right up to here yeah and then go

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.930 
bar right up to here yeah and then go
down<00:00:34.420> right<00:00:34.840> okay<00:00:35.140> well<00:00:35.739> I'd<00:00:35.829> find<00:00:36.130> we're

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
down right okay well I'd find we're

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.310 
down right okay well I'd find we're
actually<00:00:37.030> pulling<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.540> bar<00:00:37.720> like<00:00:37.870> this<00:00:38.110> where

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
actually pulling the bar like this where

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.900 
actually pulling the bar like this where
you<00:00:38.380> go<00:00:38.500> up<00:00:38.590> out<00:00:38.739> of<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.920> chin<00:00:39.160> it's<00:00:39.790> like

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
you go up out of the chin it's like

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.639 
you go up out of the chin it's like
you're<00:00:40.090> doing<00:00:40.239> a<00:00:40.300> clean<00:00:40.600> enough<00:00:41.290> now<00:00:41.440> what<00:00:41.560> I'm

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
you're doing a clean enough now what I'm

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.560 
you're doing a clean enough now what I'm
saying<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.460> seems<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.760> put<00:00:42.940> more<00:00:43.390> emphasis

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
saying and it seems to put more emphasis

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.810 
saying and it seems to put more emphasis
on<00:00:43.989> my<00:00:44.140> traps<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:45.130> that's<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.399> reason<00:00:45.550> why<00:00:45.699> I

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
on my traps so that's the reason why I

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.069 
on my traps so that's the reason why I
do<00:00:45.940> it<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.269> always<00:00:46.420> my<00:00:46.600> particular<00:00:46.930> style

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
do it that always my particular style

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.500 
do it that always my particular style
but<00:00:47.769> I<00:00:47.829> finally<00:00:48.190> gives<00:00:48.370> me<00:00:48.489> a<00:00:48.519> good<00:00:48.730> feeling

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
but I finally gives me a good feeling

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.209 
but I finally gives me a good feeling
under<00:00:49.899> traps<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.289> I<00:00:50.350> think<00:00:50.590> it<00:00:50.710> works<00:00:50.980> them<00:00:51.190> a

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
under traps and I think it works them a

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.189 
under traps and I think it works them a
little<00:00:51.460> better<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:52.420> know<00:00:52.449> they<00:00:52.780> said<00:00:52.960> is<00:00:53.079> no

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
little better you know they said is no

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.349 
little better you know they said is no
set<00:00:53.410> rules<00:00:53.649> that's<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.070> way<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.190> feel<00:00:54.969> them<00:00:55.210> so

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
set rules that's the way I feel them so

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.599 
set rules that's the way I feel them so
that's<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.690> way<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:55.840> do<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.109> like<00:00:56.260> that

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
that's the way I do it like that

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.340 
that's the way I do it like that
it's<00:00:57.609> the<00:00:57.730> my<00:00:57.820> reason<00:00:58.210> seems<00:00:58.750> to<00:00:58.929> be<00:00:59.050> working

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
it's the my reason seems to be working

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.880 
it's the my reason seems to be working
for<00:00:59.559> you<00:01:00.480> yeah<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:02.140> think<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.469> was<00:01:02.559> pretty<00:01:02.710> good

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
for you yeah I think it was pretty good

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:34.770 
for you yeah I think it was pretty good
