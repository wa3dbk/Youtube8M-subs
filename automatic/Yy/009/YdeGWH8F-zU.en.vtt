38 comes first

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.550 
38 comes first
when<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.260> count<00:01:22.620> on<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> number<00:01:23.580> line<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
when we count on a number line so it is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.960 
when we count on a number line so it is
the<00:01:25.800> smaller<00:01:26.160> number<00:01:27.500> 42<00:01:28.500> comes<00:01:28.890> second<00:01:29.520> when

the smaller number 42 comes second when

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.720 
the smaller number 42 comes second when
we<00:01:30.150> count<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.340> bigger<00:01:32.670> number<00:01:34.730> that

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
we count so it is the bigger number that

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.040 
we count so it is the bigger number that
means<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:37.080> are<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.590> winner<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.220> game
