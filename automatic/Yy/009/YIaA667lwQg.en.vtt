don't<00:02:20.490> know<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.330> biggest<00:02:21.720> flower

show about it would they be actually but
i<00:02:23.880> think<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.210> probably<00:02:24.510> one<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.930> best
