00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so in turn what people are doing instead

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920 
so in turn what people are doing instead
is<00:01:55.590> they're<00:01:56.219> simply<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.479> into<00:01:57.659> their<00:01:57.810> own

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930

instead which to be honest salient I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.740 
instead which to be honest salient I
don't<00:02:02.460> really<00:02:02.579> care<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.180> problem<00:02:03.600> with

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
don't really care about my problem with

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.600 
don't really care about my problem with
people<00:02:03.899> who<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.229> boost<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.860> mw2

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

free-for-alls<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> fact<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.899> they

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
free-for-alls is the fact that they

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.589 
free-for-alls is the fact that they
would<00:02:07.290> ruin<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.729> game<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.179> people<00:02:09.420> who<00:02:09.509> are

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
would ruin the game for people who are

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.600 
would ruin the game for people who are

what people are doing that's a lot of
search<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.160> destroys<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.730> Nuketown<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.390> just

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
search and destroys on Nuketown I just

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.880 
search and destroys on Nuketown I just
thought<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.810> would<00:02:36.960> go<00:02:37.140> up<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.470> top<00:02:37.650> guy<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
thought I would go up to the top guy and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.590 
thought I would go up to the top guy and
search-and-destroy<00:02:38.700> leaderboard<00:02:39.420> because

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
search-and-destroy leaderboard because

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.410 
search-and-destroy leaderboard because
8000<00:02:40.200> score<00:02:40.410> per<00:02:40.560> minute<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> bit<00:02:41.190> high<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
8000 score per minute is a bit high so I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.130 
8000 score per minute is a bit high so I
don't<00:02:42.750> know<00:02:42.810> let's<00:02:43.080> watch<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:44.990> see<00:02:45.990> what

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
don't know let's watch it see what

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.340 
don't know let's watch it see what

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
shenanigans are taking place in here so

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.110 
shenanigans are taking place in here so
unfortunately<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.370> mean<00:02:50.640> there's<00:02:50.820> not<00:02:50.940> really

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
unfortunately I mean there's not really

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.480 
unfortunately I mean there's not really
much<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.720> can't<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.440> into<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> game<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.010> this

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
much I can't get into a game like this

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.420

uh<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.150> if<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.959> did<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:55.830> end<00:02:56.280> up

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
uh and if I did they would end up

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.890 
uh and if I did they would end up
leaving<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:56.880> they<00:02:57.180> don't<00:02:57.390> want<00:02:57.540> anyone

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.300 
answer once again probably not but at
the<00:03:54.120> same<00:03:54.330> time<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.959> don't<00:03:55.620> know<00:03:55.800> maybe<00:03:56.130> I'll

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the same time I don't know maybe I'll

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.949

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
run into people in team deathmatch but

run into people in team deathmatch but
odds<00:03:58.500> are<00:03:58.709> they'll<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.070> end<00:03:59.250> up<00:03:59.340> backing<00:03:59.730> out

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
odds are they'll just end up backing out

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.560 
odds are they'll just end up backing out
