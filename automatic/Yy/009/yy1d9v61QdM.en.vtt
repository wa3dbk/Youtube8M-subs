00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
anybody to sit in front of a computer

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.270

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
they gain two problems they go into a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.890 
they gain two problems they go into a
kind<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.070> hiding<00:02:57.280> place<00:02:57.730> here<00:02:58.030> they're<00:02:58.780> going

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
kind of hiding place here they're going

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.870 
kind of hiding place here they're going
to<00:02:58.959> hiding<00:02:59.350> themselves<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.400> seems<00:03:00.760> as

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
to hiding themselves and that seems as

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.460 
to hiding themselves and that seems as
if<00:03:00.970> that's<00:03:01.180> what's<00:03:01.510> happening<00:03:01.840> right<00:03:01.900> at<00:03:02.320> this

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
if that's what's happening right at this

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.160 
if that's what's happening right at this
moment<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.850> like<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:04.030> reflex<00:03:04.360> reaction<00:03:04.989> go

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170
