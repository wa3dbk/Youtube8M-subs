00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
one-on-one coverage bad mistake there as

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.470 
one-on-one coverage bad mistake there as
it's<00:05:42.980> pretty<00:05:43.220> hard<00:05:43.460> to<00:05:43.550> guard<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.970> dream<00:05:44.210> down

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
it's pretty hard to guard the dream down

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.810 
it's pretty hard to guard the dream down
in<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.690> block<00:05:44.930> one-on-one<00:05:45.590> but<00:05:46.310> if<00:05:46.430> they<00:05:46.580> send

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
in the block one-on-one but if they send

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.330 
in the block one-on-one but if they send
the<00:05:46.910> double<00:05:47.470> he's<00:05:48.470> surrounded<00:05:48.710> by<00:05:48.860> shooters

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
the double he's surrounded by shooters

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.570 
the double he's surrounded by shooters
so<00:05:49.580> it's<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.450> great<00:05:50.570> tactic<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:51.140> go<00:05:51.290> with

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
so it's a great tactic to go with

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.130
