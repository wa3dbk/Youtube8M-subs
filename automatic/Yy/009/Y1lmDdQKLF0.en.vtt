00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.370
 Well, now I want to show it means 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.310
 an operational way to create yourself a point 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.590
 insurance for what we use 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.200
 here let's say we came to hospital 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.290
 secured the rope here we work when 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.280
 quickly we need to look for some 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.800
 ledges look down but here but when 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.930
 this we must have free hands but 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.059
 is it to hold a weapon or 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.050
 tools like who uses what 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.510
 called means showing and where 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.610
 us further goes bay not free end 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.399
 whole bay we do not reset it we 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.239
 we work in parts then we watch it 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.380
 the rope is thrown up here 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.200
 comes in here she starts 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.379
 pull this loop here see up 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.220
 tighten the knot and pull the loop 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.979
 loop passes on us we take this one 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.500
 the end can it well I don't even take it away 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.979
 now look this end goes here 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.979
 here 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.020
 doubly because there is a bay and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.890
 returns to this loop and what we do 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.569
 we load 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:26.810
 this rope with us we are in peak lion showing 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.140
 before the hands are free what does it give us 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.920
 we can look in one direction in another 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.240
 doing some here I show things 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.420
 weapon content views up 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.270
 view and down to the side some things 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.569
 we load the loop hands free 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.369
 operational work that is understandable for 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.539
 what do we need do not use anything 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.509
 no gear 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.849
 only here are similar loops now 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.869
 next option when to do 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:02.630
 fastening loop 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.810
 carbine or shorter for other purposes 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 there you are already inventing yourself 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.780
 overlapping goes as i showed the income once 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.410
 2 that is, we begin to pull the loop 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.849
 it goes around here and we pull out 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.270
 second loop on a par with this here we see 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.549
 for a drag but it has already dragged on 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.160
 as if the loop is a crossroads 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.300
 this 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:37.720
 and it still swam with a rope and we 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:41.590
 we do exactly the same second pass through here 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.990
 all we got two loops here they are 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.330
 two loops this if the bay is left if 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.240
 no bay we just pro yanked yes 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.380
 all these loops crawl nowhere and not 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.380
 tightened you can use the main 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.820
 first loop for a screed 2 for some 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.820
 extra stretching everything
