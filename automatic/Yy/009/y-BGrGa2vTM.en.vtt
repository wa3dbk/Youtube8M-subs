00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that are going to be like kind of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.889 
that are going to be like kind of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
new features in zero point 13 it'll be a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
new features in zero point 13 it'll be a
bunch<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.230> mind-blowing<00:00:41.100> features<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
bunch of other mind-blowing features so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.569 
bunch of other mind-blowing features so
stay<00:00:42.390> tuned<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.469> basically<00:00:43.860> he<00:00:44.160> kind<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
stay tuned so basically he kind of

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.799 
stay tuned so basically he kind of
alluded<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> fact<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.510> they're<00:00:45.719> not

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
alluded to the fact that they're not

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.389 
alluded to the fact that they're not
going<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.559> point<00:00:46.829> 0<00:00:46.920> update<00:00:47.250> already

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
going to the one point 0 update already

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.420 
going to the one point 0 update already
they're<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.420> zero<00:00:48.629> point<00:00:48.840> 13<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
they're going to zero point 13 so in the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.119 
they're going to zero point 13 so in the
zero<00:00:50.640> point<00:00:50.820> 13<00:00:51.270> update<00:00:51.840> he<00:00:52.770> said<00:00:52.949> there's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
zero point 13 update he said there's

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.630 
zero point 13 update he said there's
going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.340> mind-blowing<00:00:53.820> features<00:00:54.480> well<00:00:55.640> 0

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
going to be mind-blowing features well 0

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
going to be mind-blowing features well 0
point<00:00:56.879> 0<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> was<00:00:57.449> mind-blowing<00:00:58.020> enough

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
point 0 but it was mind-blowing enough

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
point 0 but it was mind-blowing enough
so<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.010> else<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.550> really<00:00:59.760> add<00:01:00.320> well

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
so what else can they really add well

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
so what else can they really add well
they<00:01:01.770> could<00:01:02.100> add<00:01:02.960> bosses<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:05.729> wither

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
they could add bosses like the wither

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
they could add bosses like the wither
because<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.570> already<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.990> wither<00:01:07.290> skeleton

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
because we already have wither skeleton

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.330 
because we already have wither skeleton
skulls<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.820> already<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.240> whether<00:01:09.479> skulls<00:01:09.960> uh

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
skulls we already have whether skulls uh

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
skulls we already have whether skulls uh
we<00:01:11.340> already<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> wither<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.960> know

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
we already have the wither you know

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.020 
we already have the wither you know
slope<00:01:13.680> once<00:01:13.860> only<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> soul<00:01:14.490> sand<00:01:14.729> nether

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
slope once only the soul sand nether

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.789 
slope once only the soul sand nether
everything<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:16.080> everything<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.530> need<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
everything if everything we need to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.730 
everything if everything we need to
create<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.549> wither<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.479> why<00:01:19.140> not<00:01:19.259> make<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
create the wither so why not make the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490 
create the wither so why not make the
weather<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:21.479> could<00:01:21.720> make<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> weather<00:01:22.229> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
weather so we could make the weather in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.100 
weather so we could make the weather in
the<00:01:22.560> zero<00:01:23.159> point<00:01:23.280> 13<00:01:23.670> update<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.540> plausible

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the zero point 13 update very plausible

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
the zero point 13 update very plausible
also<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.280> they<00:01:26.759> added<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> nether<00:01:27.479> why<00:01:27.900> can't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
also if they added the nether why can't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
also if they added the nether why can't
they<00:01:28.290> add<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> end<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.820> might<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.119> seeing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
they add the end so we might be seeing

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.200 
they add the end so we might be seeing
the<00:01:30.509> end<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.960> 0<00:01:30.990> point<00:01:31.380> 13<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.890> well<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.820> there

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the end in 0 point 13 as well so there

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.380 
the end in 0 point 13 as well so there
might<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.420> end<00:01:34.130> bosses<00:01:35.130> ah<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:36.210> could<00:01:36.360> be

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
might be end bosses ah there could be

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.179 
might be end bosses ah there could be
new<00:01:36.630> generated<00:01:37.170> structures<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.950> we

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
new generated structures because we

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.740 
new generated structures because we
haven't<00:01:38.430> seen<00:01:38.579> any<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.850> those<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.270> while<00:01:39.299> for

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
haven't seen any of those in a while for

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.569 
haven't seen any of those in a while for
example<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.540> ocean<00:01:42.990> temples

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
example I like the the ocean temples

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.149 
example I like the the ocean temples
from<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> pc<00:01:45.060> 1.8<00:01:45.659> Update<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.100> be

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
from the pc 1.8 Update that would be

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
from the pc 1.8 Update that would be
pretty<00:01:47.250> cool<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> Guardians<00:01:48.540> we

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
pretty cool we can have the Guardians we

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.859 
pretty cool we can have the Guardians we
could<00:01:48.990> have<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:50.159> many<00:01:50.399> new<00:01:50.670> mobs<00:01:50.970> there's<00:01:51.630> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
could have so many new mobs there's so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.920 
could have so many new mobs there's so
many<00:01:51.930> possibilities<00:01:52.460> but<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:54.420> thing<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.840> we

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
many possibilities but one thing that we

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.459 
many possibilities but one thing that we
can<00:01:55.170> confirm<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> redstone<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:57.469> once

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
can confirm is a redstone because once

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.719 
can confirm is a redstone because once
one<00:01:59.369> Twitter<00:01:59.729> follower<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:01.280> named<00:02:02.280> agra

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.080 
are mind-blowing features that really
could<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.660> added<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.260> could<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.220> horses

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
could be added I could think of horses

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.960 
could be added I could think of horses
the<00:02:51.510> nether<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.350> now<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.680> end<00:02:52.970> bosses

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the nether on up now that the end bosses

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.350 
the nether on up now that the end bosses
and<00:02:54.180> redstone<00:02:55.190> then<00:02:56.190> maybe<00:02:56.430> like<00:02:56.940> command

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and redstone then maybe like command

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.170 
and redstone then maybe like command
blocks<00:02:57.690> beacons<00:02:58.319> or<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.830> kind<00:02:59.069> of<00:02:59.130> stuff<00:02:59.430> but

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
blocks beacons or that kind of stuff but

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.809 
blocks beacons or that kind of stuff but
really<00:03:00.600> there<00:03:00.989> isn't<00:03:01.230> much<00:03:01.620> else<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.280> added

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
really there isn't much else to be added

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.500 
really there isn't much else to be added
so<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:04.489> really<00:03:05.489> don't<00:03:05.700> know<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:06.120> else<00:03:06.299> they

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
so I really don't know what else they

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.240 
so I really don't know what else they
can<00:03:06.569> add<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.049> way<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.290> mind-blowing<00:03:07.830> new

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
can add in the way of mind-blowing new
