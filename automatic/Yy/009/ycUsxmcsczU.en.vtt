water underneath that valve so the first
step<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:28.580> we're<00:00:28.760> going<00:00:28.850> to<00:00:28.939> want<00:00:29.090> to<00:00:29.150> take<00:00:29.330> is

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
step that we're going to want to take is

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.240 
step that we're going to want to take is
make<00:00:29.779> sure<00:00:29.810> that<00:00:30.289> we<00:00:30.380> turn<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.619> water<00:00:30.890> off<00:00:31.099> to

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
make sure that we turn the water off to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.830 
make sure that we turn the water off to
the<00:00:31.430> house<00:00:31.670> at<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.119> main<00:00:32.300> water<00:00:32.599> supply

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
the house at the main water supply

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.590 
the house at the main water supply
usually<00:00:33.769> that<00:00:34.010> will<00:00:34.100> be<00:00:34.190> located<00:00:34.519> outside<00:00:34.730> if

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
usually that will be located outside if

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.990 
usually that will be located outside if
you<00:00:35.840> do<00:00:36.020> need<00:00:36.260> help<00:00:36.290> locating<00:00:37.010> it<00:00:37.250> or<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.880> need

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
you do need help locating it or you need

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.520 
you do need help locating it or you need
help<00:00:38.059> turning<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.570> off<00:00:38.660> check<00:00:39.200> some<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.380> our

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
help turning it off check some of our

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.049 
help turning it off check some of our
how-to<00:00:39.710> videos<00:00:40.130> because<00:00:40.399> we<00:00:40.430> do<00:00:40.640> have<00:00:40.790> some

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
how-to videos because we do have some

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.060 
how-to videos because we do have some
that<00:00:41.210> cover<00:00:41.480> that<00:00:41.629> as<00:00:41.780> well<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.860> let's<00:00:42.980> go

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
that cover that as well so let's go

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.410 
that cover that as well so let's go
ahead<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:43.219> get<00:00:43.370> started<00:00:43.460> now<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.239> the

go ahead and remove the supply water

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.209 
go ahead and remove the supply water
line<00:00:48.680> from<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:49.730> actual<00:00:50.210> valve<00:00:51.100> we're<00:00:52.100> going

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
line from this actual valve we're going

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.160 
line from this actual valve we're going
to<00:00:52.309> go<00:00:52.370> ahead<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.610> take<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:52.760> off<00:00:53.030> some<00:00:53.989> water

to go ahead and take that off some water

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.900 
to go ahead and take that off some water
that<00:00:54.350> comes<00:00:54.530> out<00:00:54.739> is<00:00:54.890> okay<00:00:57.039> now<00:00:58.039> one<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.789> the

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
that comes out is okay now one of the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.400 
that comes out is okay now one of the
most<00:00:59.090> important<00:00:59.719> things<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.140> we're<00:01:00.320> going

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
most important things that we're going

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.470 
most important things that we're going
to<00:01:00.500> want<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.739> remember<00:01:01.160> here<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:01.670> when<00:01:02.270> we're

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
to want to remember here is when we're

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.999 
to want to remember here is when we're
going<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:02.870> go<00:01:02.960> ahead<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:03.230> remove<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:03.739> valve

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
going to go ahead and remove this valve

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.190 
going to go ahead and remove this valve
here<00:01:04.160> we're<00:01:04.640> going<00:01:04.729> to<00:01:04.820> see<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:05.840> valve

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
here we're going to see that this valve

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.770 
here we're going to see that this valve
is<00:01:06.470> connected<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.039> nut<00:01:07.310> onto<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.850> pipe<00:01:08.030> this

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
is connected to a nut onto the pipe this

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.179 
is connected to a nut onto the pipe this
is<00:01:08.960> called<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.260> compression<00:01:09.590> fitting<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.159> it

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
is called a compression fitting and it

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.130 
is called a compression fitting and it
looks<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:10.610> like<00:01:10.729> this<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.720> means<00:01:11.960> that

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
looks just like this that means that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.649 
looks just like this that means that
this<00:01:12.409> nut<00:01:12.740> needs<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.700> come<00:01:13.850> off<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.360> this

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
this nut needs to come off of this

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.170 
this nut needs to come off of this
shutoff<00:01:15.049> valve<00:01:15.290> that's<00:01:15.650> how<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.070> works<00:01:16.280> okay

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
shutoff valve that's how it works okay

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.600 
shutoff valve that's how it works okay
now<00:01:18.110> there's<00:01:18.439> also<00:01:18.619> another<00:01:18.979> type<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.280> valve

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
now there's also another type of valve

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.789 
now there's also another type of valve
that<00:01:20.509> just<00:01:20.750> has<00:01:20.900> threads<00:01:21.229> on<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:21.439> that<00:01:21.680> will

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
that just has threads on it that will

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.530 
that just has threads on it that will
thread<00:01:22.040> right<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.820> copper<00:01:23.119> pipe<00:01:23.330> in

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
thread right on to the copper pipe in

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.570 
thread right on to the copper pipe in
this<00:01:24.170> case<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:25.009> want<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.220> make<00:01:25.340> sure<00:01:25.490> you

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
this case you want to make sure you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.429 
this case you want to make sure you
verify<00:01:25.790> which<00:01:26.180> pipe<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:27.200> case

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
verify which pipe it is and in this case

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.910 
verify which pipe it is and in this case
it's<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.770> call<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:27.979> compression<00:01:28.430> fitting<00:01:29.920> go

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
it's a call to compression fitting go

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.580 
it's a call to compression fitting go
ahead<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.220> grab<00:01:31.369> your<00:01:31.640> pliers<00:01:31.850> here<00:01:32.590> we're

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
ahead and grab your pliers here we're

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.960 
ahead and grab your pliers here we're
going<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.770> take<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.100> crescent<00:01:34.549> wrench<00:01:34.670> and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
going to take the crescent wrench and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.539 
going to take the crescent wrench and
put<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:35.600> on<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.049> shutoff<00:01:36.409> valve<00:01:36.650> now<00:01:37.430> we're

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549
