00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.390 
Cronus anti-mage tutorials and today I
want<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.270> show<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.450> guys<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:06.750> you<00:00:07.109> can<00:00:07.400> create

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
want to show you guys how you can create

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100 
want to show you guys how you can create
an<00:00:08.519> object<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.210> have<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.599> float

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
an object and have that float

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.249 
an object and have that float
realistically<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.160> water<00:00:11.719> so<00:00:12.719> we're<00:00:13.170> gonna

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
realistically in water so we're gonna

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.099 
realistically in water so we're gonna
get<00:00:13.440> started<00:00:14.030> okay<00:00:15.030> start<00:00:15.599> off<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.990> new

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
get started okay start off with a new

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.830 
get started okay start off with a new
scene<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.619> then<00:00:17.580> make<00:00:18.150> sure<00:00:18.359> you're<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.690> your

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
scene and then make sure you're in your

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.400 
scene and then make sure you're in your
dynamics<00:00:19.439> drop<00:00:20.070> down<00:00:20.250> menu<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.539> then

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
dynamics drop down menu like so and then

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.560 
dynamics drop down menu like so and then
we're<00:00:22.500> gonna<00:00:22.619> go<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.859> fluid<00:00:23.609> effects<00:00:23.939> we're

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
we're gonna go to fluid effects we're

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
we're gonna go to fluid effects we're
gonna<00:00:24.689> go<00:00:24.869> down<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.260> ocean<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.340> we're<00:00:26.460> gonna

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
gonna go down to ocean and we're gonna

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.870 
gonna go down to ocean and we're gonna
select<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.029> create<00:00:27.300> ocean<00:00:28.250> now<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.699> will

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
select the create ocean now this will

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.389 
select the create ocean now this will
give<00:00:30.000> us<00:00:30.179> our<00:00:30.300> starting<00:00:30.660> point<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.470> I'm<00:00:32.369> just

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
give us our starting point and I'm just

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.310 
give us our starting point and I'm just
gonna<00:00:33.090> click<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.200> hit<00:00:34.829> our<00:00:35.100> skill<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.000> out

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
gonna click that hit our skill that out

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.549 
gonna click that hit our skill that out
something<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.300> hit<00:00:39.450> 5<00:00:39.750> free

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
something like that and we hit 5 free

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.430 
something like that and we hit 5 free
shaded<00:00:40.920> mode<00:00:41.270> okay<00:00:42.300> we're<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.750> set<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.410> some

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
shaded mode okay we're gonna set up some

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.400 
shaded mode okay we're gonna set up some
frames<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.550> our<00:00:44.640> animation<00:00:45.030> field<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
frames here in our animation field so

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
frames here in our animation field so
let's<00:00:46.950> say<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.399> don't<00:00:47.460> know<00:00:47.640> 200<00:00:48.480> frames<00:00:50.180> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
let's say I don't know 200 frames and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.830 
let's say I don't know 200 frames and
we'll<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.719> play<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.640> okay<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.750> see

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
we'll just play that okay as you can see

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
we'll just play that okay as you can see
the<00:00:55.289> ocean<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.739> responding<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:56.969> nice

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the ocean is responding so that's nice

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170 
the ocean is responding so that's nice
and<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> stop<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and I'm just going to stop that and do a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.070 
and I'm just going to stop that and do a
quick<00:01:00.449> render<00:01:00.920> I'll<00:01:01.920> zoom<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.399> bit

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.780 

and<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.470> looks<00:01:08.130> pretty<00:01:08.460> much<00:01:08.580> like

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and there we go looks pretty much like

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.960 
and there we go looks pretty much like
an<00:01:08.909> ocean<00:01:09.030> which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.510> cool<00:01:09.860> all<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.010> now

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
an ocean which is cool all right now

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.630 
an ocean which is cool all right now
we're<00:01:12.270> gonna<00:01:12.330> create<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.110> quick<00:01:13.530> object<00:01:14.040> let's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
we're gonna create a quick object let's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.170 
we're gonna create a quick object let's
just<00:01:15.330> grab<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> polygon<00:01:16.380> cube<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.250> I'm

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
just grab a polygon cube here and I'm

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.690 
just grab a polygon cube here and I'm
just<00:01:18.330> gonna<00:01:18.450> drag<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> grid<00:01:19.860> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
just gonna drag that out on the grid and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.380 
just gonna drag that out on the grid and
pull<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.530> now<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.610> back<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.880> frame

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
pull that up now if we go back to frame

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.160 
pull that up now if we go back to frame
1<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.259> play<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:26.479> as<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.689> see<00:01:27.780> your

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
1 and we play this as you can see your

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350 
1 and we play this as you can see your
ocean<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> acting<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.460> before<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.210> your

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
ocean is acting like before but your

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
ocean is acting like before but your
object<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.110> interacting<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> water

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
object is not interacting with the water

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.670 
object is not interacting with the water
so<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.360> realistic<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.439> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so that's not realistic at all and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.560 
so that's not realistic at all and
that's<00:01:35.549> where<00:01:35.759> we're<00:01:35.850> gonna<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.420> now

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
that's where we're gonna just right now

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.260 
that's where we're gonna just right now
so<00:01:37.170> we're<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.380> stop<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.790> go<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so we're gonna stop that and go back to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.649 
so we're gonna stop that and go back to
frame<00:01:39.450> 1<00:01:40.130> make<00:01:41.130> sure<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.549> got<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:41.790> object

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
frame 1 make sure you got your object

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
frame 1 make sure you got your object
selected<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:44.009> be<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.399> know<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> buoy

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
selected and this can be you know a buoy

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.780 
selected and this can be you know a buoy
or<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> boat<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.810> something<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
or a boat or something like that and

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.160 
or a boat or something like that and
while<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.090> selected<00:01:48.450> we're<00:01:49.020> going

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
while we have that selected we're going

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.010 
while we have that selected we're going
to<00:01:49.259> go<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.740> our<00:01:49.829> dynamics<00:01:50.369> menu<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.329> fluid

we're<00:01:53.009> gonna<00:01:53.130> go<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> ocean<00:01:54.149> we're<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.200> go

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
we're gonna go to ocean we're gonna go

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
we're gonna go to ocean we're gonna go
down<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.040> make<00:01:56.490> boats<00:01:57.740> okay<00:01:58.740> now<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
down to make boats okay now what that

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
down to make boats okay now what that
does<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.960> gonna<00:02:01.110> add<00:02:01.350> some<00:02:01.619> properties

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
does is it's gonna add some properties

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.609 
does is it's gonna add some properties
to<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.460> object<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.390> create<00:02:04.020> blue<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.469> sea

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
to your object to create blue and sea

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.819 
to your object to create blue and sea
and<00:02:04.740> stuff<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.560> we're<00:02:07.560> back<00:02:07.710> at

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
and stuff like that and we're back at

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.589 
and stuff like that and we're back at
frame<00:02:08.039> 1<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.429> let's<00:02:08.759> see<00:02:08.879> what<00:02:09.030> happens<00:02:09.420> I'm

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
frame 1 and let's see what happens I'm

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.160 
frame 1 and let's see what happens I'm
gonna<00:02:09.720> zoom<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.379> little<00:02:10.440> bit<00:02:11.030> okay

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
gonna zoom in just a little bit okay

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.980 
gonna zoom in just a little bit okay
all<00:02:14.170> right<00:02:14.350> now<00:02:14.770> as<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.220> see<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.640> object

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
all right now as you can see the object

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.840 
all right now as you can see the object
drops<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.410> certain<00:02:17.740> level<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.460> it's

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
drops to a certain level and it's

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.480 
drops to a certain level and it's
interacting<00:02:19.750> with<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.020> waves<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.590> that's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
interacting with the waves and that's

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.880 
interacting with the waves and that's
how<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:22.000> realistically<00:02:22.860> create<00:02:23.860> a

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
how you can realistically create a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.510 
how you can realistically create a
floating<00:02:24.280> object<00:02:25.050> now<00:02:26.050> in<00:02:26.350> addition<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.430> I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
floating object now in addition and I

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.960 
floating object now in addition and I
just<00:02:27.790> want<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.360> show<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.670> go

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
just want to show you that if you go

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.090 
just want to show you that if you go
into<00:02:31.150> your<00:02:31.330> ocean<00:02:31.720> shader<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.350> in<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
into your ocean shader and in the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.520 
into your ocean shader and in the
attribute<00:02:33.460> editor<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:34.000> lot<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.050> properties

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
attribute editor a lot of properties

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.370 
attribute editor a lot of properties
that<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:35.950> play<00:02:36.160> with<00:02:36.390> right<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:38.170> can

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
that you can play with right you can

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.640 
that you can play with right you can
have<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.670> foam<00:02:40.210> on<00:02:40.540> your<00:02:40.600> water<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.320> can<00:02:41.440> play

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
have a foam on your water you can play

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.030 
have a foam on your water you can play
with<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:41.860> setting<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.210> know<00:02:43.330> there<00:02:43.720> are

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
with that setting you know there are

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.390 
with that setting you know there are
let's<00:02:45.040> see<00:02:45.190> what<00:02:45.340> else<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:45.640> got<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.810> can

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
let's see what else we got you can

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.880 
let's see what else we got you can
change<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.760> wave<00:02:49.000> height<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.870> wave<00:02:50.140> speed

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
change the wave height the wave speed

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.310 
change the wave height the wave speed
you<00:02:51.610> can<00:02:51.790> change<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.330> wind<00:02:52.570> direction<00:02:52.690> and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
you can change the wind direction and

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.230 
you can change the wind direction and
all<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.040> will<00:02:54.400> interact<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:54.940> your

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
all of that will interact with your

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.470 
all of that will interact with your
object<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.080> play<00:02:56.920> with<00:02:56.950> these<00:02:57.250> settings<00:02:57.550> have

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
object so play with these settings have

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.720 
object so play with these settings have
fun<00:02:58.720> with<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.050> and<00:02:59.230> if<00:03:00.190> you've<00:03:00.370> got<00:03:00.490> any

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
fun with it and if you've got any

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.930 
fun with it and if you've got any
