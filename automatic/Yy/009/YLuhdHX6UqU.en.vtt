00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 this is the first time that the planter 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.500
 coffee will use in the bush 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.120
 in the rural area of ​​são sebastião do 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.389
 paradise with 25,000 feet of coffee 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.930
 with mechanized machine planting 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.910
 can plant up to 10,000 seedlings of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 coffee per day in 15 minutes she plants 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.900
 400 seedlings 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.080
 the land was prepared only on the lines 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.690
 where they received the coffee seedlings where 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.660
 limestone was applied for the correction 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 and fertilizers 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.570
 no-till facilitates the life of the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.219
 producer and requires less time in the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 soil preparation 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.530
 we decided to deploy with virtual machine 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.219
 lots of manpower land my people I 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.410
 I preferred protagonist and I am satisfied 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.469
 the result for you to have a security 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.600
 of a good mechanized planting begins 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.879
 which is where the producer 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 he has along with his agronomist already 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.900
 work is much earlier doing the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.119
 preparation of the soil in 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.820
 then prepare the question of 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.210
 drying in the house of the murderers 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 then he will do a good job 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 of its juice where it will pass the hubs 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.450
 the side he will pass the pain suck do 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.240
 the homogeneous mixtures of the fertilizer 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.840
 It will happen on the corvette in the pit I promise 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.259
 that's where the key is. 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.270
 I prepare it and then it goes 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.780
 together with the producer 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.680
 it will already scale your fertilizer and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.409
 then it is the question of the planting season 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.540
 because in mechanized planting it has to 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.909
 observe the question of humidity 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.619
 of the soil can not be very human 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.320
 and not too dry 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.430
 thinking about the matter of the change the hour that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.880
 arriving is for her to have to try 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.640
 accommodation as much as possible 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.160
 the preparation of seedlings and the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.600
 transport through a screen contracture 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.540
 I'll turn who does 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.750
 the son of her hence hahn márcio with 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.270
 help of other helpers at that time. 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.360
 that counts is the speed to achieve 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.500
 monitor the work of the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.890
 work is to get the bottom is 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.610
 in the box again the name of the cell quite 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.730
 to take to facilitate the hand of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.740
 work of those who put it into the machine to 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.260
 be able to beat the monkey if 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.520
 I did not win shit on the bottom then only 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.710
 take the side 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.140
 there he wins machine according to the 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.080
 engineer agronomist of cooparaíso joão 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.930
 The producer must observe the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.290
 main differences between planting 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.480
 manual and mechanized planting 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:07.470
 mechanization is it requires a preparation of the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.680
 solo but let's get more specific 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.860
 more intense for you and then a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.340
 planting and consequently better then 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.130
 where you have a planting that was not well 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.590
 prepared beforehand maybe people 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.560
 even advises the manual itself because 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.510
 otherwise there will not be a service that stays 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.890
 with good characteristics, that's it 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.650
 some ct may happen in the future 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.650
 some damage in other regions 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.050
 of the state producers have been using 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.360
 long the coffee planter but 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.420
 here in paradise now that the producers 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.650
 are getting used to the idea in 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.790
 our region 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.310
 they will say that it is this year these 23 years 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.760
 is now becoming a reality that 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.970
 the producer has materialized and is putting 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.130
 head or that may have been this myth 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.040
 but today you can say that he is 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.880
 gradually being withdrawn because the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.070
 producer has been seeing that crops that 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.150
 planted long ago with these 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.790
 machines today brings equal productivity 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.370
 or even higher than are planted 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.070
 manually as the engineer 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.520
 agronomist in the mechanized planting is 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.370
 in 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.419
 the ideal spacing for the carriers 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.970
 the uniform alignment of the plant items 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.389
 indispensable for the success of a future 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.210
 mechanized harvesting the quality of 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.250
 planting since remembering 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.990
 previously made a preparation and since 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.840
 that gives the condition to plant to make the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.220
 mechanized planting is the agility that 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.060
 people work with the volume of people 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.860
 smaller and the planting also becomes more 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:02.130
 from accommodation of the moult to 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.470
 Crop your alignment of the would 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.409
 March are satisfied with the new 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.310
 planting alternative for being more 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:12.960
 practice and demand less labor 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.900
 working with less people is the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.110
 more so even being the first year 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.169
 what I'm doing right but it's all worth it 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.169
 feather
