which is going to help keep it from

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.479 
which is going to help keep it from
shrinking<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:06.069> it's<00:02:07.069> gonna<00:02:07.189> be<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.399> great

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
minutes or so I can see it starting to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.180 
minutes or so I can see it starting to
cook<00:02:28.609> kind<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.600> up<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.930> side<00:02:30.170> time<00:02:30.859> for<00:02:31.130> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
cook kind of up on the side time for the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.729 
cook kind of up on the side time for the
flip<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.329> you<00:02:32.870> should<00:02:33.079> see<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.319> nice

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
flip and you should see that nice

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.370 
flip and you should see that nice
caramelized<00:02:34.489> crust<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.690> outside<00:02:35.750> and
