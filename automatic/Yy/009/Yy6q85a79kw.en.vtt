00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.710
 100 years ago that seawater is used 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.839
 like medicine drink or injected fifth 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 got that social security in 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:17.640
 France the recipe is until 1980 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.740
 the laws of hummer serve us to use 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.810
 better sea ​​water and understand 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 correctly the possible reactions 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.000
 that can produce us 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.849
 the discoveries of doctor hammer 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.640
 they are already very widespread with very diverse 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.530
 names and are even taught in the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.530
 major medical faculties of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.410
 Nicaragua 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.180
 the laws of doctor hammer are a great 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.839
 diagnostic tool for 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.660
 any psychologist or medical therapist 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.910
 then allow to know exactly 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.670
 what caused the disease and how to help 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.430
 better the patient later 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.770
 we will concretely 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.040
 the book explains both the daily use 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.470
 as for when we are sick for 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.640
 this takes into account the discoveries 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.950
 of the eminent doctor hammer 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.290
 there are a couple of health issues that do not 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.950
 they try in the book but they are very 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.080
 important how damaging the sugar and 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.080
 the detrimental effect of some treatments 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 what we do in the teeth have 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 all information on the web 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.350
 quintón discovered that sea water 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.420
 isotonic is to say the mixture of a glass 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.930
 of sea water with three glasses of water 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.350
 normal is practically identical to 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.710
 liquid that surrounds our cells is 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.110
 say that all our cells are 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.090
 surrounded by this liquid so similar 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.509
 to the isotonic sea water 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.210
 the cells receive their food for their 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.390
 surface that is bathed by this 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.149
 liquid that this liquid is clean is 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.819
 something very important is not like when 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.619
 we have the car very dirty on the outside but 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.180
 that does not affect us to take us and 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.640
 bring us where we want 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.120
 if the liquid surrounding the cells is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.950
 dirty can not receive the food and 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.620
 they can not get rid of their 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 excrements that accumulate to your 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.740
 around if the liquid is dirty by 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.820
 much that we eat all our cells 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.240
 they are undernourished and surrounded by garbage 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.880
 it's normal that we do not meet well 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.130
 taking sea water what we do is 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.890
 change this dirty liquid for another 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.970
 clean with what the whole body starts 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.910
 to work 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.770
 we can drink isotonic drinks made 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.580
 with sea water or inject us 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.860
 directly isotonic sea water 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.520
 the soil of the blood is practically 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.920
 identical to isotonic sea water 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.080
 we can also inject us sea water 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.860
 Isotonic when we have a hernia 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.240
 All of them heal perfectly if 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.260
 they have not been operated 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.750
 summarizing 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.379
 The main effect of sea water this 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.170
 is intoxicate more and we notice more 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.810
 more intoxicated we are for example 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.810
 when we have taken strong medicines 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.400
 for example the book tells the story 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.150
 of a bitch who had had several 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.130
 cancers had given him chemo and the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.050
 night that he was dying that already 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.530
 he could drink the water that was given him with the 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.830
 hand was saved with water injections of 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.400
 sea 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.560
 here you can see it a month later 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840
 because these results are so simple and 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.420
 spectacular only occur when 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.340
 we are intoxicated 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.220
 in the rest of diseases like 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.800
 cancers or paralysis is imperative 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.230
 start by correctly understanding the 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.990
 situation of the patient what is it that we 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.720
 teaches hummer 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.150
 in the book there are some chapters that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.160
 explain the basics of doctor hammer that 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.410
 we must all know 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.960
 for doctors or therapists who need 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.870
 more information can consult the web 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.810
 from the book 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.169
 Hammel explains that after the 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.780
 overexertion there is a repair for 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.330
 example if we go to a party with a few 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.850
 shoes that we like a lot but that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.310
 they squeeze us the next day we'll have 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.370
 the injured foot a little inflamed red 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.290
 hot but we know that the foot is not 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.320
 sick because we remember what we did 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.410
 yesterday when this happens to us inside 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.240
 of the body we say that we are sick 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.110
 because we do not know how to relate it to 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.040
 no overexertion hummer tells us 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.920
 which was 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.560
 for example if we are with cancer 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.110
 pancreas hummer tells us that we're 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.050
 fighting over an inheritance or some 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.740
 litigation and while we are with this 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.010
 tension the cancer will grow and in 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.849
 when we relax , cancer will begin 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.209
 to get rid of and disappear 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:15.709
 the sea water helps us to relax and 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:15.709
 to move to the recovery phase 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.160
 there are diseases like breast cancer 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.620
 of the ductal type that are just a symptom 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.480
 of the recovery phase in these 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.300
 cases do not even need to take 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.230
 seawater because the body is already 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.930
 healing 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.720
 seawater and therapists can 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.680
 help us finish as soon as possible with the 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.590
 Tension phase 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.560
 doctors are especially necessary 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.130
 in the recovery phase where in 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.539
 some case it is necessary to prescribe some 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.539
 anti-inflammatory to make the 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:54.449
 recovery is slower and does not exhaust the 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.639
 energy of the sick let 's see it with a 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.969
 example 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:03.889
 If we are old we can walk a 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:07.139
 long distance at our pace slowly 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.110
 If we want to run, we'll stay for the 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.379
 path with diseases happens what 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.360
 same if we are old we can 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.779
 pass a bronchitis removing the mucus 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.270
 little by little if we take sea ​​water we 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:25.110
 many snot will come that we will not have 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.659
 force to eject and we will move in 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.389
 these cases we do not have to drink water from 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:33.270
 sea and maybe we have to take some 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:35.789
 exciting as tea or coffee or some 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.550
 anti-inflammatory to not get the mucus 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.760
 so fast 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.370
 In Nicaragua, they have been using the 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.530
 sea ​​water that they collect from the beach and 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.380
 for several years they take as a base 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.200
 before reciting the sea water the 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.420
 discoveries of doctor javier with 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.600
 she heals serious diseases or 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.600
 Chronicles 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.180
 in Europe there are more and more companies that 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.160
 they bottle and sell seawater for 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.249
 they can enjoy it too 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.719
 inside people ending 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:10.419
 when we go to buy the 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:14.199
 supercar which is the first thing that 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:18.039
 he asks us the seller asks us if 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:20.019
 It is the first to buy why then 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:22.719
 because if it's the first one they pay us a 

00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:25.350
 course to learn how to drive a 

00:07:22.719 --> 00:07:28.620
 so special car 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:31.770
 with the sea water the same thing happens with water 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.110
 of sea is like a supercar is a 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.400
 very powerful remedy but that does not work 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.880
 for everything 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:41.340
 the same thing happens with the supercar 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.860
 that we can not go through the field with him and 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.780
 that can even be dangerous in the hands 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:49.389
 from someone who does not know how to drive 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:52.510
 hummer is the one who teaches us with his 

00:07:49.389 --> 00:07:55.080
 discoveries to drive this fabulous 

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:58.129
 super sports 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.129
 that you enjoy it
