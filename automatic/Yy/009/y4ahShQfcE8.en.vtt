00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
questions about a process probably the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.650 
questions about a process probably the
most<00:00:19.070> common<00:00:19.520> problem<00:00:19.940> and<00:00:20.060> question<00:00:20.390> people

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
most common problem and question people

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.420 
most common problem and question people
have<00:00:20.690> is<00:00:21.080> with<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.680> emulsion<00:00:21.980> coating

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
have is with the emulsion coating

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.460 
have is with the emulsion coating
process<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.449> emulsion<00:00:23.690> can<00:00:23.930> be<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.050> pain<00:00:24.350> in

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
process the emulsion can be a pain in

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.960 
process the emulsion can be a pain in
the<00:00:24.529> butt<00:00:24.770> if<00:00:24.980> you're<00:00:25.340> not<00:00:25.460> doing<00:00:25.760> things

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
the butt if you're not doing things

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.189 
the butt if you're not doing things
right<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:26.330> this<00:00:26.600> section<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.050> going<00:00:27.080> to

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
right so this section is going to

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.140 
right so this section is going to
troubleshoot<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:28.340> can<00:00:28.550> go<00:00:28.670> wrong<00:00:28.910> with

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
troubleshoot what can go wrong with

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.679 
troubleshoot what can go wrong with
emulsion

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
emulsion

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.150 
emulsion
so<00:00:29.900> maybe<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:30.320> can<00:00:30.439> weed<00:00:30.650> out<00:00:30.800> some<00:00:30.830> of<00:00:31.070> those

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
so maybe you can weed out some of those

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.910 
so maybe you can weed out some of those
variables<00:00:31.989> the<00:00:32.989> first<00:00:33.350> thing<00:00:33.590> we're<00:00:33.770> going<00:00:33.860> to

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
variables the first thing we're going to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.250 
variables the first thing we're going to
talk<00:00:34.100> about<00:00:34.160> is<00:00:34.489> coating<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:34.970> screen<00:00:35.270> now<00:00:35.899> a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
talk about is coating the screen now a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.200 
talk about is coating the screen now a
typical<00:00:36.890> quart<00:00:37.309> of<00:00:37.370> emulsion<00:00:37.730> can<00:00:38.000> coat

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
typical quart of emulsion can coat

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.380 
typical quart of emulsion can coat
between<00:00:38.600> maybe<00:00:38.870> 20<00:00:39.380> 25<00:00:39.710> maybe<00:00:40.610> 30<00:00:40.730> screens

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
between maybe 20 25 maybe 30 screens

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.720 
between maybe 20 25 maybe 30 screens
we've<00:00:42.200> had<00:00:42.320> people<00:00:42.500> call<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.100> have<00:00:43.489> coated

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
we've had people call that have coated

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.250 
we've had people call that have coated
three<00:00:44.149> screens<00:00:44.480> with<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.690> quarter<00:00:44.930> of<00:00:45.020> emulsion

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
three screens with a quarter of emulsion

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.740 
three screens with a quarter of emulsion
now<00:00:46.000> three<00:00:47.000> screens<00:00:47.300> with<00:00:47.450> this<00:00:47.570> much

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
now three screens with this much

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.569 
now three screens with this much
emulsion<00:00:48.050> that's<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.770> lot<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:48.950> emulsion<00:00:49.430> per

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
emulsion that's a lot of emulsion per

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.610 
emulsion that's a lot of emulsion per
screen<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.420> problem<00:00:50.809> is<00:00:50.930> if<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:51.200> get<00:00:51.379> too

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
screen the problem is if you get too

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.830 
screen the problem is if you get too
much<00:00:51.770> emulsion<00:00:52.309> on<00:00:52.430> your<00:00:52.550> screen<00:00:52.879> it's<00:00:53.510> very

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
much emulsion on your screen it's very

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.720 
much emulsion on your screen it's very
hard<00:00:54.110> to<00:00:54.170> expose<00:00:54.590> it<00:00:54.829> drips<00:00:55.129> all<00:00:55.280> over<00:00:55.640> the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
hard to expose it drips all over the

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.130 
hard to expose it drips all over the
place<00:00:55.940> you're<00:00:56.270> wasting<00:00:56.629> money<00:00:56.780> in<00:00:56.989> your

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
place you're wasting money in your

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.540 
place you're wasting money in your
emulsion<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.710> you're<00:00:57.860> having<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.219> lot<00:00:58.489> of

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
emulsion and you're having a lot of

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.939 
emulsion and you're having a lot of
problems<00:00:59.030> during<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.329> exposure<00:00:59.629> process<00:01:00.020> so

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
problems during the exposure process so

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.529 
problems during the exposure process so
here's<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.309> first<00:01:01.520> troubleshooting<00:01:02.300> point

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
here's the first troubleshooting point

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.629 
here's the first troubleshooting point
when<00:01:03.140> you're<00:01:03.260> coding<00:01:03.500> your<00:01:03.739> screen<00:01:04.039> you<00:01:04.430> want

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:04.639 
when you're coding your screen you want

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:06.219 
when you're coding your screen you want
to<00:01:04.729> put<00:01:04.939> pressure<00:01:05.239> on<00:01:05.569> your<00:01:05.689> scooped<00:01:05.959> coder

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
to put pressure on your scooped coder

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.109 
to put pressure on your scooped coder
don't<00:01:06.829> be<00:01:06.979> afraid<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.459> press<00:01:07.609> against<00:01:07.999> this

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
don't be afraid to press against this

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.949 
don't be afraid to press against this
screen<00:01:08.509> here<00:01:09.229> let<00:01:09.469> me<00:01:09.499> demonstrate<00:01:10.659> if<00:01:11.659> I'm

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
screen here let me demonstrate if I'm

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.539 
screen here let me demonstrate if I'm
doing<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.289> emulsion<00:01:12.529> coding<00:01:12.920> process<00:01:13.279> wrong

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
doing the emulsion coding process wrong

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.489 
doing the emulsion coding process wrong
I'm<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.329> be<00:01:14.479> afraid<00:01:14.779> to<00:01:14.899> put<00:01:15.200> pressure

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
I'm going to be afraid to put pressure

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.980 
I'm going to be afraid to put pressure
on<00:01:15.889> this<00:01:16.429> screen<00:01:16.789> so<00:01:17.329> what<00:01:17.509> I've<00:01:17.599> seen<00:01:17.749> a<00:01:17.810> lot

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
on this screen so what I've seen a lot

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.449 
on this screen so what I've seen a lot
of<00:01:18.049> people<00:01:18.200> doing<00:01:18.439> is<00:01:18.649> not<00:01:18.799> allowing<00:01:19.340> the

00:01:19.449 --> 00:01:19.459 
of people doing is not allowing the

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.459 
of people doing is not allowing the
emulsion<00:01:19.789> to<00:01:20.359> slip<00:01:20.659> all<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.990> way<00:01:21.079> onto<00:01:21.259> the

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
emulsion to slip all the way onto the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.529 
emulsion to slip all the way onto the
mesh<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:21.799> build<00:01:21.979> up<00:01:22.069> a<00:01:22.159> dam<00:01:22.429> so<00:01:22.670> when<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.359> try

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
mesh and build up a dam so when you try

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.809 
mesh and build up a dam so when you try
to<00:01:23.599> to<00:01:24.229> pull<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.950> scooped<00:01:25.189> coder<00:01:25.399> up<00:01:25.609> you're

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
to to pull the scooped coder up you're

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.190 
to to pull the scooped coder up you're
actually<00:01:26.090> not<00:01:26.270> getting<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.630> coat<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.840> emulsion

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually not getting a coat of emulsion

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.859 
actually not getting a coat of emulsion
on<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.590> screen<00:01:27.999> also<00:01:28.999> let's<00:01:29.389> show<00:01:29.749> what

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
on the screen also let's show what

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.029 
on the screen also let's show what
happens<00:01:30.169> if<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:30.319> don't<00:01:30.499> put<00:01:30.679> enough<00:01:30.889> pressure

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
happens if you don't put enough pressure

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.849 
happens if you don't put enough pressure
on<00:01:31.429> the<00:01:31.579> mesh<00:01:31.779> remember<00:01:32.779> as<00:01:32.990> in<00:01:33.349> the<00:01:33.590> earlier

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
on the mesh remember as in the earlier

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.010 
on the mesh remember as in the earlier
section<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.520> want<00:01:34.639> to<00:01:34.759> hear<00:01:34.880> that<00:01:35.029> little<00:01:35.569> zip

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
section you want to hear that little zip

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.449 
section you want to hear that little zip
if<00:01:36.079> you<00:01:36.380> don't<00:01:36.560> hear<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:36.799> this<00:01:37.159> is<00:01:37.279> what

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
if you don't hear that this is what

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.769 
if you don't hear that this is what
happens<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.409> see<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:39.829> lot<00:01:40.099> of<00:01:40.130> screens<00:01:40.969> coded

00:01:41.769 --> 00:01:41.779 
happens so I see a lot of screens coded

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:45.729 
happens so I see a lot of screens coded
like<00:01:41.899> this<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.740> first<00:01:42.950> time<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.439> look<00:01:45.439> at<00:01:45.560> that

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:45.739 
like this the first time so look at that

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.559 
like this the first time so look at that
you<00:01:46.069> have<00:01:46.249> emulsion<00:01:46.819> dripping<00:01:47.270> all<00:01:47.389> the<00:01:47.479> way

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
you have emulsion dripping all the way

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:48.969 
you have emulsion dripping all the way
onto<00:01:47.719> the<00:01:47.840> frame<00:01:48.079> you<00:01:48.289> didn't<00:01:48.499> even<00:01:48.560> get<00:01:48.799> some

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
onto the frame you didn't even get some

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.279 
onto the frame you didn't even get some
emulsion<00:01:49.249> on<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.639> frame<00:01:49.880> when<00:01:50.539> really<00:01:50.810> you

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
emulsion on the frame when really you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.889 
emulsion on the frame when really you
should<00:01:51.469> coat<00:01:51.739> like<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:52.599> you<00:01:53.599> see<00:01:53.719> how<00:01:53.779> much

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
should coat like this you see how much

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.539 
should coat like this you see how much
pressure<00:01:54.139> I'm<00:01:54.380> putting<00:01:54.409> on<00:01:54.709> that<00:01:54.859> you<00:01:55.399> can

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
pressure I'm putting on that you can

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.489 
pressure I'm putting on that you can
really<00:01:55.880> feel<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.119> pressure<00:01:56.389> coming<00:01:57.289> on<00:01:57.380> to

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
really feel the pressure coming on to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.489 
really feel the pressure coming on to
the<00:01:57.590> frame<00:01:57.880> but<00:01:58.880> going<00:01:59.329> like<00:01:59.809> this<00:02:00.139> not

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
the frame but going like this not

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:01.959 
the frame but going like this not
putting<00:02:00.770> enough<00:02:00.859> pressure<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:01.489> have<00:02:01.520> all

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
putting enough pressure you have all

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:03.909 
putting enough pressure you have all
sorts<00:02:02.209> of<00:02:02.389> problems<00:02:02.539> you're<00:02:03.409> going<00:02:03.529> to<00:02:03.619> see

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:03.919 
sorts of problems you're going to see

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:06.370 
sorts of problems you're going to see
inconsistencies<00:02:04.819> in<00:02:04.999> your<00:02:05.149> emulsion<00:02:05.539> your

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
inconsistencies in your emulsion your

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.290 
inconsistencies in your emulsion your
most<00:02:06.559> is<00:02:06.739> going<00:02:06.859> to<00:02:06.919> be<00:02:07.039> way<00:02:07.309> too<00:02:07.340> thick<00:02:08.030> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
most is going to be way too thick and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.389 
most is going to be way too thick and
then<00:02:08.989> you're<00:02:09.110> going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.289> get<00:02:09.409> a<00:02:09.649> mess<00:02:10.159> all<00:02:10.369> over

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
then you're going to get a mess all over

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.640 
then you're going to get a mess all over
the<00:02:10.579> place<00:02:10.849> not<00:02:11.569> to<00:02:11.810> mention<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.319> fact<00:02:12.500> that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the place not to mention the fact that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.990 
the place not to mention the fact that
you're<00:02:12.799> wasting<00:02:13.010> money<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.549> mold

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
you're wasting money in a mold

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.420 
you're wasting money in a mold
so<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.020> put<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.680> screen<00:02:15.950> upside

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
so if we then put this screen upside

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.430 
so if we then put this screen upside
down<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.880> dry<00:02:17.210> we'd<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.050> emulsion

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
down to dry we'd have this emulsion

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.440 
down to dry we'd have this emulsion
dripping<00:02:19.040> all<00:02:19.190> over<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.610> place<00:02:19.850> on<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.300> other

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
dripping all over the place on to other

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.930 
dripping all over the place on to other
screens<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.230> becoming<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.280> real<00:02:22.520> pain<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.820> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
screens and becoming a real pain in the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.690 
screens and becoming a real pain in the
butt<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.270> work<00:02:23.300> with<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.770> other<00:02:24.950> thing<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.460> if

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
butt to work with the other thing is if

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.790 
butt to work with the other thing is if
you<00:02:26.090> have<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> thick<00:02:26.750> coat<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.050> emulsion<00:02:27.500> on

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
you have a thick coat of emulsion on

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.740 
you have a thick coat of emulsion on
your<00:02:27.950> screen<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.940> see<00:02:29.150> how<00:02:29.270> much<00:02:29.390> emulsion

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
your screen you see how much emulsion

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.300 
your screen you see how much emulsion
under<00:02:29.990> there<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.260> that's<00:02:30.410> only<00:02:30.530> one<00:02:30.830> side<00:02:31.100> so

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
under there and that's only one side so

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.520 
under there and that's only one side so
we<00:02:31.400> put<00:02:31.550> more<00:02:31.730> moles<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.210> backside<00:02:32.690> think

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
we put more moles on the backside think

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.290 
we put more moles on the backside think
of<00:02:33.620> how<00:02:33.740> much<00:02:33.890> longer<00:02:34.250> this<00:02:34.520> has<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.880> expose

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
of how much longer this has to expose

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.960 
of how much longer this has to expose
versus<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.930> molding<00:02:36.440> coat<00:02:36.650> that's<00:02:36.890> thin<00:02:37.220> now

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
versus a molding coat that's thin now

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.430 
versus a molding coat that's thin now

screen printing white video that talks

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.500 
screen printing white video that talks
about<00:02:42.800> using<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.490> thick<00:02:43.670> coat<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:43.970> emulsion<00:02:44.270> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
about using a thick coat of emulsion and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.050 
about using a thick coat of emulsion and
how<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.960> properly<00:02:45.530> do<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.250> order<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.850> a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
how to properly do that in order for a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.660 
how to properly do that in order for a
good<00:02:47.600> ink<00:02:47.870> deposit<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.470> your<00:02:48.590> shirt<00:02:48.860> but<00:02:49.459> this

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
good ink deposit on your shirt but this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.460 
good ink deposit on your shirt but this
is<00:02:49.880> not<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.330> right<00:02:50.420> way<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.660> do<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.350> this

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
is not the right way to do this and this

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.050 
is not the right way to do this and this
is<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.680> lot<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.220> problems<00:02:52.580> people<00:02:52.850> have

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
is a lot of the problems people have

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.550 
is a lot of the problems people have
when<00:02:53.540> they<00:02:53.660> get<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.990> coating<00:02:54.470> their

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
when they get going coating their

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.780 
when they get going coating their
screens<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.040> they<00:02:55.160> put<00:02:55.310> way<00:02:55.520> too<00:02:55.550> much

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
screens is they put way too much

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.720 
screens is they put way too much
emulsion<00:02:56.270> on<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:57.860> point<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.640> this

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
emulsion on it so the the point of this

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.390 
emulsion on it so the the point of this
lesson<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.240> make<00:02:59.540> sure<00:02:59.570> to<00:03:00.200> push<00:03:00.590> tight<00:03:01.130> on

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
lesson is to make sure to push tight on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.660 
lesson is to make sure to push tight on
your<00:03:01.520> scooped<00:03:01.790> coder<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.920> here<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.100> zip<00:03:04.490> as

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
your scooped coder and here that zip as

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.699 
your scooped coder and here that zip as
it<00:03:04.880> comes<00:03:05.060> up<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.360> frame<00:03:05.630> that's<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.500> most

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
it comes up the frame that's the most

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.650 
it comes up the frame that's the most
important<00:03:07.160> part<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.550> coating<00:03:07.850> process<00:03:07.880> if

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
important part in the coating process if

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.120 
important part in the coating process if
you<00:03:09.290> don't<00:03:09.560> do<00:03:09.740> that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
you don't do that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.740 
you don't do that
you<00:03:10.430> can<00:03:10.580> have<00:03:10.730> too<00:03:10.910> much<00:03:11.030> emulsion<00:03:11.360> on<00:03:11.570> your

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
you can have too much emulsion on your

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.940 
you can have too much emulsion on your
screen<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.430> run<00:03:13.430> into<00:03:13.580> problems<00:03:14.650> let's<00:03:15.650> go<00:03:15.860> to

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
screen and run into problems let's go to

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.710 
screen and run into problems let's go to
the<00:03:16.070> next<00:03:16.310> part<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.760> next<00:03:17.240> thing<00:03:17.600> we'll

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
the next part the next thing we'll

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.150 
the next part the next thing we'll
discuss<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.260> troubleshooting<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:18.860> actually

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
discuss and troubleshooting is actually

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.740 
discuss and troubleshooting is actually
the<00:03:19.280> emulsion<00:03:19.550> itself<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.510> when<00:03:20.630> you're

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
the emulsion itself and when you're

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.330 
the emulsion itself and when you're
using<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.110> dual<00:03:21.350> cured<00:03:21.680> item<00:03:22.010> emulsion

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
using a dual cured item emulsion

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.490 
using a dual cured item emulsion
remember<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> emulsion<00:03:23.300> has<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> shelf<00:03:24.230> life

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
remember the emulsion has a shelf life

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.470 
remember the emulsion has a shelf life
of<00:03:24.650> about<00:03:24.769> three<00:03:25.220> months<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.239> if<00:03:26.360> your

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
of about three months so if your

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.180 
of about three months so if your
emulsion<00:03:26.720> expires<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.769> can<00:03:27.890> have<00:03:27.980> problems

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
emulsion expires you can have problems

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.310 
emulsion expires you can have problems
during<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.670> exposure<00:03:29.060> process<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:30.170> other

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
during the exposure process the other

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.960 
during the exposure process the other
thing<00:03:30.530> you<00:03:30.650> cannot<00:03:30.980> let<00:03:31.190> your<00:03:31.280> motion<00:03:31.670> do<00:03:31.760> is

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
thing you cannot let your motion do is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.030 
thing you cannot let your motion do is
freeze<00:03:32.420> if<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.870> emulsion<00:03:33.170> freezes<00:03:33.769> at<00:03:33.890> any

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
freeze if the emulsion freezes at any

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.030 
freeze if the emulsion freezes at any
point<00:03:34.340> in<00:03:34.550> time<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:35.090> will<00:03:35.810> deactivate<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.950> be

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
point in time it will deactivate and be

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.410 
point in time it will deactivate and be
very<00:03:37.280> very<00:03:37.580> hard<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.880> use<00:03:37.910> if<00:03:38.150> not<00:03:38.300> impossible

cold if it freezes remember it's
completely<00:04:33.410> bad<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.860> then<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.340> don't<00:04:34.580> want

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
completely bad and then you don't want

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.340 
completely bad and then you don't want

to get it too hot if it's in a hot room
it<00:04:36.590> will<00:04:36.740> expire<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.190> lot<00:04:37.490> sooner<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:38.480> want

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
it will expire a lot sooner so you want

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.380 
it will expire a lot sooner so you want
