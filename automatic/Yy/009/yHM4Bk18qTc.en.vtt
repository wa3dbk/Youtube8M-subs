is in it or something not sure how that
works<00:01:47.430> exactly<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:48.810> auto

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990

that my friend David made a video about
this<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> was<00:02:01.469> much<00:02:01.710> more<00:02:01.979> articulate

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
this and it was much more articulate

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.120 
this and it was much more articulate
than<00:02:02.579> what<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.030> talking<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.229> um<00:02:04.409> I'll<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

really<00:02:15.870> dumb<00:02:16.109> I<00:02:16.379> have<00:02:16.709> not<00:02:16.920> been<00:02:17.189> affected<00:02:17.640> by

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
really dumb I have not been affected by

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.380 
really dumb I have not been affected by
it<00:02:17.819> yet<00:02:18.090> but<00:02:18.329> I'm<00:02:18.540> expecting<00:02:19.079> it<00:02:19.560> um<00:02:19.859> I<00:02:20.400> guess<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
it yet but I'm expecting it um I guess I

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.259 
it yet but I'm expecting it um I guess I
think<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.319> if<00:02:22.620> Nintendo<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.489> watching<00:02:24.000> you

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
think that if Nintendo is watching you

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.630 
think that if Nintendo is watching you
should<00:02:24.480> reconsider<00:02:24.859> I<00:02:25.859> don't<00:02:26.040> know<00:02:26.159> it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
should reconsider I don't know it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.780 
should reconsider I don't know it's
really<00:02:26.939> annoying<00:02:27.329> as<00:02:27.659> someone<00:02:28.349> who

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
really annoying as someone who

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.399 
really annoying as someone who
commentates<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:30.030> video<00:02:30.299> games<00:02:30.599> is<00:02:31.079> guess<00:02:31.260> I

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
commentates on video games is guess I

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.559 
commentates on video games is guess I
guess<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.799> what<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:32.099> would<00:02:32.219> call<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.700> um<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
guess is what you would call it um I

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.690
