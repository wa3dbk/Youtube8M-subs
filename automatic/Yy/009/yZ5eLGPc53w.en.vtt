00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
resolution but I think you don't like to

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.130 
resolution but I think you don't like to
change<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.690> resolution<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.720> can<00:02:52.930> also

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
change the resolution and you can also

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.350 
change the resolution and you can also
adjust<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.830> screen<00:02:54.400> brightness<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
adjust the screen brightness and the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.840 
adjust the screen brightness and the
contrast<00:02:55.690> as<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.520> like<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:59.130> all<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:00.340> all<00:03:00.459> it's

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
contrast as you like so all in all it's

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.800 
contrast as you like so all in all it's
very<00:03:01.720> nice<00:03:02.080> software<00:03:02.709> some<00:03:03.459> nice<00:03:03.730> worked<00:03:04.180> over

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810
