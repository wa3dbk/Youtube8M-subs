cupid<00:02:10.709> back<00:02:10.860> looks<00:02:11.099> like

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.839 

this<00:02:13.469> one<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.799> probably<00:02:13.920> my<00:02:14.219> least<00:02:14.370> favorite

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
this one is probably my least favorite

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.369 
this one is probably my least favorite
because<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.450> don't<00:02:15.629> really<00:02:15.719> like<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.140> side

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
because I don't really like the side

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.929 
because I don't really like the side
details<00:02:16.829> and<00:02:17.189> I<00:02:17.310> don't<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:17.639> that<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
details and I don't think that the

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.509 
details and I don't think that the
corners<00:02:18.299> are<00:02:18.329> very<00:02:18.659> good<00:02:18.900> either<00:02:22.129> but<00:02:23.129> it

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
corners are very good either but it

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.580 
corners are very good either but it
still<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:23.909> pretty<00:02:24.030> good<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.480> lastly<00:02:25.290> my

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
still it's pretty good and lastly my

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.470 
still it's pretty good and lastly my
second<00:02:25.980> favorite<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.639> model<00:02:27.060> number<00:02:27.090> one

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
second favorite the model number one

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.050 
second favorite the model number one
back<00:02:27.689> I<00:02:28.159> think<00:02:29.159> that<00:02:29.219> the<00:02:29.400> sides<00:02:29.639> with<00:02:29.819> very

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
back I think that the sides with very

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.550 
back I think that the sides with very
good<00:02:30.269> on<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.569> deck<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.139> think<00:02:31.319> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
good on this deck and I think the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.000 
good on this deck and I think the
coroner's<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.159> as<00:02:32.340> well<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:33.290> overall<00:02:34.290> all<00:02:34.739> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
coroner's do as well and overall all of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.789 
coroner's do as well and overall all of
them<00:02:35.129> look<00:02:35.310> pretty<00:02:35.760> good<00:02:36.329> but<00:02:37.200> if<00:02:37.469> I<00:02:37.560> had<00:02:37.709> to

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
them look pretty good but if I had to

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:38.990 
them look pretty good but if I had to
choose<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.040> word<00:02:38.159> savor<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.639> would<00:02:38.819> be<00:02:38.879> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
choose the word savor it would be the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.300 
choose the word savor it would be the
Cuba<00:02:39.299> vac<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.689> my<00:02:40.349> favorite<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.919> the<00:02:41.099> safety

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
