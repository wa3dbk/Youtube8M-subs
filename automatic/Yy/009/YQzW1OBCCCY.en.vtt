00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
just one way if you don't feel like

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460 
just one way if you don't feel like
clicking<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:54.000> your<00:01:54.030> musical<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:55.200> quite

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
clicking on your musical which quite

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.950 
clicking on your musical which quite
frankly<00:01:55.530> i<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.399> easier<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.180> but

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
frankly i think is easier to do but

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.490 
frankly i think is easier to do but
that's<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.619> trick<00:01:58.920> um<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.939> then<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.229> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that's just the trick um and then we can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's just the trick um and then we can
just<00:02:01.979> click<00:02:02.729> close<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:04.070> say<00:02:05.070> you're

around there and it should have a hole
and<00:03:38.680> that's<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.069> auto-brightness<00:03:39.370> thing<00:03:40.060> and

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
and that's the auto-brightness thing and

hallways that's what it's for the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.569 
hallways that's what it's for the
auto-brightness<00:03:46.930> so<00:03:47.859> don't<00:03:48.160> worry<00:03:48.400> about

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579
