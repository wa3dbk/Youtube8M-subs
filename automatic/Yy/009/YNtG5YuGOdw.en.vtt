just never know but I do want to talk a
little<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.360> about<00:00:45.510> classic<00:00:46.050> crafting<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
little bit about classic crafting and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.410 
little bit about classic crafting and
also<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.460> manual<00:00:47.850> crafting<00:00:48.239> that's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
also like manual crafting that's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.350 
also like manual crafting that's
basically<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.280> pc<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.030> manual

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
basically what this is on pc so manual

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
basically what this is on pc so manual
crafting<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.280> recipes

don't<00:01:05.790> know<00:01:05.939> how<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> make<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.260> all

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
don't know how to make this you you all

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.870 
don't know how to make this you you all
you<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> ingredients<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.729> a

crafting table and you can make it like
there's<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.880> knowing<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.450> recipe

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
there's not you know knowing the recipe

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.260 
there's not you know knowing the recipe
now<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.650> know<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> recipes<00:01:14.970> on

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
now I don't even know all the recipes on

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.990 
now I don't even know all the recipes on
pc<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.380> again<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.790> something

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
pc but again it can be something

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
pc but again it can be something
difficult<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.680> they're

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
difficult so how do I think they're

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.289 
difficult so how do I think they're
going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> implement<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:21.119> could

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
going to implement this they could

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
going to implement this they could
possibly<00:01:21.689> end<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> implement<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.979> by

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
possibly end to implement it not by

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.640 
possibly end to implement it not by
adding<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.720> crafting<00:01:25.200> tables

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
adding you know to crafting tables

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.740 
adding you know to crafting tables
because<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.159> would<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.970> don't<00:01:27.570> think

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
because that would just be I don't think

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.899 
because that would just be I don't think
that<00:01:27.810> will<00:01:28.020> work<00:01:28.049> out<00:01:28.380> having<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> two<00:01:29.610> things

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
that will work out having to two things

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.060 
that will work out having to two things
that<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> same<00:01:31.049> thing<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.740> who<00:01:31.950> would

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that do the same thing so who would

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
that do the same thing so who would
choose<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:33.000> anyway<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:33.960> they're

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
choose that one anyway I think they're

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.719 
choose that one anyway I think they're
going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> implement<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.490> maybe

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
going to implement it like maybe

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.999 
going to implement it like maybe
difficult<00:01:36.150> wise<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:37.079> either<00:01:37.470> give<00:01:37.770> us<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
difficult wise or either give us the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.350 
difficult wise or either give us the
option<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.549> let's<00:01:38.759> say<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.030> put<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
option so let's say if you put the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.170 
option so let's say if you put the
difficulty<00:01:39.930> on<00:01:40.140> heart<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:41.310> kind<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> unlocks

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
difficulty on heart that kind of unlocks

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.899 
difficulty on heart that kind of unlocks
classic<00:01:43.079> crafting<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
classic crafting like you it's going to

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.850 
classic crafting like you it's going to
make<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.329> little<00:01:45.540> bit<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:45.930> difficult<00:01:46.229> for

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
make it a little bit more difficult for

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
make it a little bit more difficult for
you<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.729> might<00:01:48.149> add<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you so they might add it that way I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.780 
you so they might add it that way I
think<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.770> could<00:01:49.890> possibly<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.610> best

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
think that could possibly be the best

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.249 
think that could possibly be the best
way<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:51.180> again<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.689> could<00:01:51.720> add<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
way or again they could add like a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
way or again they could add like a
classic<00:01:52.680> mode<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.579> don't<00:01:54.180> quite<00:01:54.450> know

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
classic mode or I don't quite know

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.850 
classic mode or I don't quite know
because<00:01:54.899> there's<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.439> much<00:01:55.619> that's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
because there's not so much that's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 
because there's not so much that's
change<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.610> where<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.090> put<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
change to where we can put it to like a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.170 
change to where we can put it to like a
classic<00:01:58.350> mode<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.100> we'll<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.670> have<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.149> see

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
classic mode so we'll just have to see

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.999 
classic mode so we'll just have to see
or<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.869> maybe<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.320> they'll<00:02:01.530> add<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
or or maybe like they'll add it to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.679 
or or maybe like they'll add it to
adventure<00:02:02.490> mode<00:02:02.700> or<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:03.090> something<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
adventure mode or or something like that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.929 
adventure mode or or something like that
who<00:02:04.049> knows<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.189> think<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> great

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
who knows but I do think this is a great

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.999 
who knows but I do think this is a great
feature<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.020> add<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.860> could

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
feature if they do add it and it could

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
feature if they do add it and it could
possibly<00:02:08.129> open<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> door<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.090> them<00:02:09.360> way

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
possibly open up the door for them way

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.740 
possibly open up the door for them way

it it's just as easy as you know it can
it<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:23.980> be<00:02:24.250> right<00:02:24.490> now<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.330> just<00:02:25.360> let<00:02:25.600> me<00:02:25.630> know
