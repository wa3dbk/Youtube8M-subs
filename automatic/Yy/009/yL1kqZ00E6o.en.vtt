00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
didn't make the highlights there it is

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.729 
didn't make the highlights there it is
what<00:04:14.459> I<00:04:14.490> was<00:04:14.670> talking<00:04:14.850> about<00:04:15.140> Newcastle<00:04:16.140> opens

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
what I was talking about Newcastle opens

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.590 
what I was talking about Newcastle opens
up<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.980> scoreboards<00:04:17.520> right<00:04:17.730> here<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.420> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
up the scoreboards right here with the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.409 
up the scoreboards right here with the
header<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.170> I<00:04:19.590> thought<00:04:19.739> my<00:04:19.920> my<00:04:20.760> defender<00:04:21.239> was

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
header and I thought my my defender was

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:21.729 
header and I thought my my defender was
in

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
in

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.040 
in
proper<00:04:22.280> somewhat<00:04:22.789> proper<00:04:23.270> position<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.900> know

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
proper somewhat proper position you know

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.870 
proper somewhat proper position you know
maybe<00:04:24.289> he<00:04:24.530> could<00:04:24.710> have<00:04:24.800> been<00:04:25.009> I<00:04:25.280> don't<00:04:25.819> know

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
maybe he could have been I don't know

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.430 
maybe he could have been I don't know
but<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.180> mean<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:26.569> just<00:04:26.720> seems<00:04:26.990> like<00:04:27.169> the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
but I mean it just seems like the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.129 
but I mean it just seems like the
attacker<00:04:27.770> just<00:04:28.360> overpowers<00:04:29.360> him<00:04:29.569> he<00:04:29.720> towers

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
attacker just overpowers him he towers

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.290 
attacker just overpowers him he towers
over<00:04:30.289> him<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:31.069> don't<00:04:31.250> know<00:04:31.310> what<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.580> is<00:04:31.699> it<00:04:32.150> was

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
over him I don't know what it is it was

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.779 
over him I don't know what it is it was
bad<00:04:32.539> timing<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:33.110> guess<00:04:33.169> he<00:04:33.500> didn't<00:04:33.800> jump<00:04:34.009> a<00:04:34.250> fast

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
bad timing I guess he didn't jump a fast

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.820 
bad timing I guess he didn't jump a fast
enough<00:04:35.210> I<00:04:35.330> don't<00:04:35.479> know<00:04:35.539> what<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:35.750> was<00:04:35.960> but<00:04:36.020> yeah

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
enough I don't know what it was but yeah

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.409 
enough I don't know what it was but yeah
that's<00:04:37.039> been<00:04:37.370> happening<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:37.880> my<00:04:38.000> centre-backs

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.029 
that's been happening to my centre-backs
