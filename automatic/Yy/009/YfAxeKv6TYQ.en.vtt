that they reside in we usually find a
darker<00:02:40.150> block

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
darker block

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.620 
darker block
lionfish<00:02:41.260> much<00:02:41.620> closer<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.970> mainland<00:02:43.420> and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
lionfish much closer to the mainland and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.000 
lionfish much closer to the mainland and
these<00:02:44.200> red<00:02:44.740> ones<00:02:45.459> farther<00:02:46.060> away<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:47.440> nearer

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
these red ones farther away like nearer

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.460 
these red ones farther away like nearer
to<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> reefs<00:02:48.490> but<00:02:49.330> these<00:02:49.540> usually<00:02:49.810> find<00:02:50.230> near

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
to the reefs but these usually find near

to the reefs but these usually find near
mangroves<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.910> that's<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.209> difference<00:02:52.540> just

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
mangroves so that's a difference just

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.110 
mangroves so that's a difference just
the<00:02:53.080> difference<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> arm<00:02:53.830> with<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.760> soil

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
the difference in the arm with the soil

the difference in the arm with the soil
type<00:02:55.319> undersea<00:02:56.319> then<00:02:56.950> we<00:02:57.069> got<00:02:57.310> difference<00:02:57.850> in

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
type undersea then we got difference in

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.040 
type undersea then we got difference in
color<00:02:58.180> okay<00:02:58.860> there<00:02:59.860> are<00:02:59.920> two<00:03:00.040> methods<00:03:00.580> in

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
color okay there are two methods in

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
might see a custom to these fish I'm

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.009 
might see a custom to these fish I'm
going<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.180> show<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.450> easiest<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:13.959> safest

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
going to show the easiest and the safest

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.430 
going to show the easiest and the safest
way<00:03:14.500> first<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:16.060> usually<00:03:16.209> take<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.050> whole<00:03:17.320> of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
way first you usually take a whole of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.710 
way first you usually take a whole of
the<00:03:17.530> fish<00:03:17.709> bites<00:03:17.920> head<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:19.540> get<00:03:19.690> a

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the fish bites head and you get a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.900 
the fish bites head and you get a
cutlass<00:03:20.470> here<00:03:20.680> are<00:03:20.920> cutting<00:03:21.250> shears<00:03:21.519> or
