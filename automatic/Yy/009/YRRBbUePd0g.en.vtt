to<00:00:10.860> make<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.160> metallic<00:00:11.759> looking<00:00:12.090> text<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.719> Sony

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
to make a metallic looking text in Sony

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.310 
to make a metallic looking text in Sony
Vegas<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:15.059> should<00:00:15.540> look<00:00:15.690> pretty<00:00:15.750> good<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
Vegas this should look pretty good I

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.900 
Vegas this should look pretty good I
think<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.650> pretty<00:00:16.770> much<00:00:16.949> doable<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
think it's pretty much doable in all the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.109 
think it's pretty much doable in all the
versions<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.690> long<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.949> bump<00:00:20.640> map<00:00:20.850> in

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
versions as long as you have bump map in

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.279 
versions as long as you have bump map in
your<00:00:21.660> video<00:00:22.170> effects<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.720> just<00:00:24.720> basic<00:00:25.260> text

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
your video effects and just basic text

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.620

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
first I go to legacy text and I take a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.419 
first I go to legacy text and I take a
default<00:00:28.080> text<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.529> put<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> text

first step then I like to take a well

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.149 
first step then I like to take a well
there's<00:01:15.180> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.770> second<00:01:16.770> part<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
there's kind of a second part to this

there's kind of a second part to this
sort<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> advance<00:01:18.180> step<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
sort of a advance step that I'm going to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
sort of a advance step that I'm going to
take<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:20.520> means<00:01:20.759> I'm<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> put<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
take which means I'm going to put a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
take which means I'm going to put a
background<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.799> I'll<00:01:22.950> show<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.159> why

background on it and I'll show you why

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.170 
background on it and I'll show you why
in<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.610> sec<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:25.280> what<00:01:26.280> kind<00:01:26.549> should<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.880> maybe<00:01:27.030> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in a sec so what kind should do maybe a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.429 
in a sec so what kind should do maybe a
color<00:01:27.450> gradient<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.140> it'll<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:30.439> this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
color gradient and it'll just be this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.080 
color gradient and it'll just be this

black then we're going to turn on the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.289 
black then we're going to turn on the
turn<00:02:05.280> down<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.579> feathering<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
turn down the feathering all the way and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.479 
turn down the feathering all the way and
go<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> about<00:02:07.500> size<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:09.739> 27<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.009> guess<00:02:11.250> I'll

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
go to about size like 27 I guess I'll

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.790 
go to about size like 27 I guess I'll
double<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.120> 25<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.080> make<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.319> all

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
double it 25 just to make it all

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.070 
double it 25 just to make it all
round<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.310> off<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.460> nice<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.870> we're<00:02:15.960> going

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
round it off and nice then we're going

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.180 
round it off and nice then we're going
to<00:02:16.110> put<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> shadow<00:02:16.710> on<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:18.470> then<00:02:19.470> we're<00:02:19.860> going

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
to put a shadow on it then we're going

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.520 
to put a shadow on it then we're going
to<00:02:20.220> go<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.550> video<00:02:21.480> effects<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.020> we're<00:02:22.410> going

to go to video effects and we're going

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
to go to video effects and we're going

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
to go to button app and in button app

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.510 
to go to button app and in button app
we're<00:02:24.840> going<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.020> go<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.170> spotlight<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.830> we're

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
we're going to go to spotlight and we're

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.910 
we're going to go to spotlight and we're

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
going to put it on the text and as you

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.440 
going to put it on the text and as you
can<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.430> gives<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.240> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
can see that gives it kind of like a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.910 
can see that gives it kind of like a
shiny<00:02:31.730> look<00:02:32.840> kind<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.020> silvery

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
shiny look kind of like this silvery

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.580 
shiny look kind of like this silvery
look<00:02:35.580> then<00:02:36.270> I'm<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.540> actually<00:02:36.750> well<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
look then I'm going to actually well you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.900 
look then I'm going to actually well you
can<00:02:37.710> do<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> dead-center<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.430> want<00:02:38.670> just

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
can do a dead-center if you want just

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880 
can do a dead-center if you want just
for<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.690> tutorial<00:02:39.870> say<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.590> do<00:02:40.650> her<00:02:40.800> if

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
for this tutorial say you can do her if

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.820 
for this tutorial say you can do her if
you<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.790> I'm<00:02:42.330> going<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:42.870> slant<00:02:43.620> it

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
you like but I'm going to just slant it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.510 
you like but I'm going to just slant it
and<00:02:45.560> make<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.710> focus<00:02:46.950> not<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:48.890> small<00:02:49.890> then<00:02:50.400> I'm

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
and make the focus not so small then I'm

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.160 
and make the focus not so small then I'm
going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.670> maybe<00:02:51.000> actually<00:02:51.540> up<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.870> intensity

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
going to maybe actually up the intensity

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.350 
going to maybe actually up the intensity
turn<00:02:53.100> down<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:54.210> focus<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.660> little<00:02:54.900> bit<00:02:56.360> and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
turn down the focus a little bit and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.270 
turn down the focus a little bit and
we've<00:02:57.930> kind<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.170> added<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.440> virtual<00:02:58.890> light<00:02:59.070> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
we've kind of added a virtual light to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.040 
we've kind of added a virtual light to
it<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.820> also<00:03:00.470> gives<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.680> kind<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.040> cool

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
it but it also gives it kind of a cool

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.610 
it but it also gives it kind of a cool
metallic<00:03:04.050> kind<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.980> shiny<00:03:05.400> silver<00:03:05.820> look<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
metallic kind of shiny silver look and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.950 
metallic kind of shiny silver look and
that<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:08.010> sort<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.570> way<00:03:09.720> you<00:03:09.780> can<00:03:09.900> do

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
that is sort of the one way you can do

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.180 
that is sort of the one way you can do
it<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.080> reason<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.320> put<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.590> background<00:03:10.800> on

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
it the reason I put this background on

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.530 
it the reason I put this background on
here<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.820> see<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.060> get<00:03:12.210> rid<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.420> it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
here that you can see if I get rid of it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.450 
here that you can see if I get rid of it
it<00:03:12.810> kind<00:03:12.990> of<00:03:13.110> gets<00:03:13.290> rid<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.710> outline<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
it kind of gets rid of the outline and

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.760 
it kind of gets rid of the outline and
the<00:03:14.610> shadow<00:03:15.210> and<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.840> kind<00:03:16.050> of<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.290> think<00:03:16.560> adds

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
the shadow and that kind of I think adds

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.699 
the shadow and that kind of I think adds
to<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.360> another<00:03:18.360> thing<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:19.050> as<00:03:19.350> this

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
to it another thing you can do as this

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.140 
to it another thing you can do as this
won't<00:03:19.950> look<00:03:20.070> good<00:03:20.220> all<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.550> time<00:03:20.580> kind<00:03:21.120> of

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
won't look good all the time kind of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.490 
won't look good all the time kind of
depends<00:03:21.390> on<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:21.540> text<00:03:21.900> you're<00:03:21.990> using<00:03:22.170> but

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
depends on what text you're using but

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.110 
depends on what text you're using but
you<00:03:22.590> can<00:03:22.709> actually<00:03:22.920> up<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.580> bump<00:03:23.850> height<00:03:24.090> a

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
you can actually up the bump height a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.210 
you can actually up the bump height a
little<00:03:24.270> bit<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.200> actually<00:03:25.590> give<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:26.040> some

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
little bit and actually give it some

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.590 
little bit and actually give it some
texture<00:03:26.580> as<00:03:27.080> you<00:03:28.080> can<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:29.390> this<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.570> like

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
texture as you can see this is like

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.680 
texture as you can see this is like
without<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.620> then<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.570> like

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
without and then with and you can like

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.280 
without and then with and you can like
move<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.709> light<00:03:34.890> around<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.550> makes<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
move the light around so it makes the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.949 
move the light around so it makes the
shadow<00:03:37.560> effect<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.640> differently<00:03:39.000> then<00:03:39.870> I'm

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
shadow effect it differently then I'm

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.380 
shadow effect it differently then I'm
going<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.380> put<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.590> light<00:03:40.740> on<00:03:40.770> top<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:42.000> I'm

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
going to put the light on top and I'm

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.010 
going to put the light on top and I'm
going<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:44.450> move<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.570> kind<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.900> this<00:03:48.020> and

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020
