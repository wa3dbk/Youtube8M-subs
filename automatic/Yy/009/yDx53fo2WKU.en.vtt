00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.259
 Hello everyone and today in this video I'm going 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.960
 to teach how to make delicious chicken 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.230
 with mushrooms to start we're going to 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:17.120
 need chicken breast fillets 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.120
 a tray of mushrooms 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.370
 white wine olive oil garlic onion 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:28.340
 and a chicken broth pill 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.100
 to start we'll put a pan with the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.380
 bottom covered with oil at maximum fire 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.380
 and we are going to brown the fillets of 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.840
 breast being careful to cover the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 because it jumps quite 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.870
 when the chicken is done we remove 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.329
 a dish 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.510
 now we will put the oil to make the 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.120
 chicken over medium-low heat and let's 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.510
 pose for him onion and garlic 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.809
 we will have chopped very finely too 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.879
 we can help with a pressing or with 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.430
 a grater to make it finite 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.430
 we will also look for a little bit the background 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.009
 of the pan to lift the remains 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.490
 let there be chicken so that our sauce 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.490
 stay with the most taken taste of chicken 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.290
 when the vegetable begins to take color 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.260
 we must add the mushrooms 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.840
 we will raise the fire to the maximum and we will 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.480
 go stirring continuously with a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.630
 wooden spatula to let them go 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.000
 doing all equally 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.030
 when we see that the mushrooms already 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.450
 We are going to cover them with wine 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.920
 white and leave on high heat until 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.920
 it begins to boil 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 when the mushrooms start to 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.260
 baking would be the time to add the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.560
 chicken 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.780
 and we distribute by the pan we leave 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.900
 boil about five or ten minutes all 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.260
 together 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.260
 after 5 to 10 minutes we will notice 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.520
 as the sauce starts to shrink a 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.520
 little and thicken 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.020
 now we are going to cover it with water 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.180
 hot we put back to maximum heat 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.540
 and when it starts to boil like now 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.520
 we will throw out the unmade broth pill 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.790
 we remove everything together so that it falls apart 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.100
 well and we're going to let it cook until 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.760
 let's see that the sauce is reduced and 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.400
 thick to our liking 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.620
 Well, as we can see the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.439
 hikes already reduced already thickened 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.810
 quite at least to my taste now 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:44.290
 remove from heat and let stand 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.110
 about 10 or 15 minutes 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.870
 and so we have our exquisite 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.459
 Chicken with mushrooms I hope you have 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.459
 liked goodbye
