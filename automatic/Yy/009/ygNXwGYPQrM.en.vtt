 today we gather the 16 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.680
 finalists as part of our challenge 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.449
 renault trucks optifuel 16 finalists 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.640
 with two competitions in parallel a 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.310
 first competition which is based on a 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.840
 new vehicles a first optifuel and 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.930
 the second parallel competition that 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.150
 provides a premium vo Optifuel him 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.190
 drivers on the basis of the new vehicle 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.870
 and eight drivers on the base 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.760
 used vehicles to know this 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.270
 challenge otitis or was actually addressed 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.010
 to more than 350 companies in France that 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.309
 are companies that have followed our 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.210
 optifuel training or optifuel training 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.739
 program among these 350 companies 5 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.930
 years who have been selected to play 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.890
 in this contest is therefore the 16 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.260
 best candidates 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.469
 today are grouped here in new 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.469
 york 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.440
 he 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 1 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.930
 the event takes place very 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.780
 simple finally since we have in 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.180
 makes a first practical part 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.580
 theoretical since the candidates are 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.860
 income for a test a quiz 10 minutes 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.680
 then a driving step with 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.539
 an identified path that today 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.399
 is a course of about 30 minutes 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.890
 on a circuit on national road of the 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.020
 region a jury of course follows his 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.170
 results and deliberates and that the test 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.020
 writing weighs for 15% and that the course 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.750
 in real situation ps for 85% 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.979
 the course was very technical 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.049
 technical since a lot of small 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.130
 roads and so we have speeds 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.940
 low averages I was lucky 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.950
 I had tractor goats but that 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.509
 was a bit too tight especially but 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.090
 when you meet three tractors 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.920
 truck top of vans it's true that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.390
 small pitfalls to avoid 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.299
 we are used to us in the gers a 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.149
 technical circuit of alcoa it was very 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.200
 fine 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.149
 trainer and that super so it takes 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.350
 be focused on the vehicles we 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.180
 will cross see if we will be able to 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.280
 trim a little on the shoulders 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.830
 and then at the same time you have to stay 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.220
 still focus on diets 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.440
 engines 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.760
 so you have to be able to handle both 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.350
 they wanted the technique 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.640
 we gave them it's a competition 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.590
 so 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.610
 must also that technique happily 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.870
 we are having trouble with the co2 highway 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.610
 first of all it's a pleasure 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.610
 but that's just 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.510
 an infomax optifuel software allows in 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.190
 real time analyzed at any time the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.170
 driving style of each of 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.409
 drivers so with an approach 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.430
 pedagogical to get them to improve this 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.230
 famous driving style 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.840
 when exactly to gain in consumption 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.760
 in fact the little long cabbage put it in 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.159
 place with us for two years this 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.239
 allows for a posteriori analysis 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.870
 and in fact it's done in a climate 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.950
 much more serene and that should we 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.640
 save a lot of money at the 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.860
 of the company 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.120
 it's a good way to look at this 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.400
 subject in a fun way 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.810
 paul sent a good atmosphere we 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.680
 have fun and at the same time we win 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.900
 money so it's nice 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.970
 so here we are doing a 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.349
 gold extraction around the candidate on 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.090
 uses the whole base in fact that is 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.030
 which is given by a small path forms 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.590
 access in this case we will remove the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.319
 different uses depending on the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.090
 diet zones the name of presses on 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.560
 the brake pedal the use of 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.720
 speed bumps in what way your 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.220
 competitor will use the mode 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.930
 Automatic robotic box or 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.310
 well mode the manual mode so that's it 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.730
 everything is taken into account to give the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.730
 final note 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:01.430
 drivers are rewarded to your 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.319
 two alps in this case and then the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.360
 companies are rewarded with packages 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.780
 which are also provided by our 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.120
 partners that are renault trucks hoy 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.300
 voight also michelin beyond 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.940
 the retarder's abilities to be an actor 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.310
 comfort and security 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.889
 and well today by this test in 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.720
 partnering with renault we are also in 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.880
 measure of bringing energy saving 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.110
 of fuel economy through 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.760
 active use of this 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.100
 slowdown in 2014 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.350
 renault trucks will host a challenge 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.130
 optifuel challenge of a challenge 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.840
 European 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.840
 and of course on the new range
