00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.840
 hi all viewers deals in games 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.210
 today i will tell you about emi rose and lived from 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.610
 games about sonika what is she a girl 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.939
 you may ask, but who will say that she 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.340
 the guy let the first throw me a stone 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.770
 most recently in June 22 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.079
 years of the first game a blue below sonika a 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.450
 the name was the first female character 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.730
 appeared in the games series as well 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.579
 the only girl is a hedgehog then she 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.980
 More than 30 Sonic games appeared 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.620
 and clearly deserves a mention in my 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.350
 the transfer of course I will not disclose the whole 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.600
 I will tell you the list of games with their participation 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.010
 about the most interesting her appearance in 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.829
 she often becomes their victim and 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.620
 partly falls under the archetype of a girl of years 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.079
 why partly yes because hitting paws 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.449
 employee or his servants she's all 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.969
 she can still stand up for herself 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.629
 a huge hammer peak-to-peak which she does not 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.850
 hesitates to clobber his enemies while 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.590
 this they girl with the nature of the child 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.930
 it's cute on the one hand 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.360
 but on the other hand a lot of annoying all the same 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.520
 sonica as she imagines herself 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.110
 friend and decided to marry with 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.820
 him such habits they began 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.219
 demonstrate the very first 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.140
 appearances in Sonic games even 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.570
 it would be more correct to say what appeared 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.670
 us in the games in the comics and then in 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.409
 ninety-third year this character was 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.090
 moved sonic to them in the sonic game itself 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.009
 the image they painted was a bit 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.649
 redesigned for the game but still 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.420
 vaguely reminiscent of them modern 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.579
 was keen on divinations and other 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.189
 mystical practices and owned 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.380
 a deck of tarot cards using them she 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.539
 understood what was intended for her 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.189
 meeting with sonik on a small planet and 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.469
 and happiness was short 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.939
 since meeting there a blue hedgehog she 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.359
 was abducted by the last creation 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.070
 doctor employee natal sonic in total 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.020
 Sonic of course save from his 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.730
 metal twin and kept 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.290
 little planet from eggman 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.180
 here and did not answer girls reciprocity 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.220
 becoming and such a girl and trouble she rarely 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.920
 mentioned the world of Sonic after his 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.140
 first appearance in sonic sits exactly until 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.120
 as long as the sonic team connected him 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.490
 and did not start work on the three-dimensional game 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.530
 about Sonic where it was decided to revive 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.420
 pink live and give one of the main 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.800
 roles 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.260
 sleigh like less came out in ninety 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.450
 ninth year and the image has undergone 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.670
 the most radical changes at the time 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.280
 as a sonic teylz on the course almost 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.570
 changed clothes and hair they were 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.850
 completely recycled 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.100
 and she herself began to look a bit 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.880
 older is possible to match 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.640
 other characters sonic adventure amy 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.700
 rose 12 years she lives station square but 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.320
 her true origin is unknown 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.990
 she spends most of her life 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.360
 pursuing a sonica who is in love with 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.670
 previous game and sometimes they 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.160
 remember the glorious days when sonic 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.560
 rescued and despite such difficult 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.990
 the relationship with you is still 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.780
 friends and even help each other in 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.540
 case of need in general brandon by 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.070
 full program 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.750
 unchanged weapon with a pick-pick hammer 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.720
 which is a magical way 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.670
 materialize from nowhere they may not 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.330
 just beat them to the enemy or 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.900
 barriers 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.019
 but spin it around 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.060
 in 2004 another three-dimensional game came out with 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.579
 involving them sonic heroes 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.129
 there she had her own team order rose and 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.560
 how I helped the leader to my friends 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.549
 save their pets well and did not miss 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.829
 extra chance to beat sonic at all 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.200
 sonic heroes this is such an orgy 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.489
 epileptic sleep on the screen 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.609
 something constantly happens 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.950
 unimaginable and terribly sweet game 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.290
 too childish so let's 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.329
 This will focus on three copper dream books 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.489
 all the more so in the future such 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.459
 Only minor games are reserved for the games. 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.670
 Roles better move a little back to 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.889
 time in 2002, it was then released 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.500
 The first game about Sonic on geymboe 2 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.780
 she was called very originally Sonic 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.739
 2 and it was possible to pass four 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.720
 characters including our name this 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.910
 The platformer was made in classic 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.639
 2d style therefore only causes 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.860
 pleasant emotions unlike previous 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.699
 games each character has their own 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.520
 abilities 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.570
 name again wielded his hammer can 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.690
 take a long jump 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.669
 but can not accelerate like a sonic to my 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.240
 look the most unusual interesting game 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.849
 about sonic with 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.349
 exactly pulse in 2008 on the portable 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.539
 nintendo ds console 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.060
 sonic chronicles hits phrase entry 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.229
 developed white and this is the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.780
 real rpb 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.240
 with step-by-step fighting pumping heroes and 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.740
 side quests 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.380
 the outset of the game begins with the fact that 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.000
 the course is gone sonic is sent to help out 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.800
 friend and first character who 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.680
 Called to help him in this matter 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.789
 of course they break with their hammer 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.880
 some obstacles 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:14.800
 Gift for tearing them reported that sonic 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.800
 she has a guy named dexter 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.150
 but actually dexter turned out to be her 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.890
 fictional friend whose name 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.380
 Invented to make Sonic 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.690
 jealous and depending on decisions 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.120
 player and could admit sonic this 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.010
 helped and not be recognized I will not say that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.320
 it worried a blue hedgehog 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.910
 but they have their tactical limits 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.330
 called 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.000
 they are alien hearts unlike the river 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.070
 more than once a hero has a name for heroes 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.620
 personal video game dedicated 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.540
 only her one but her own 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.180
 mobile game called them 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.230
 American closet it is created based 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.210
 japanese card game and it looks like 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.430
 All the games I have listed combine 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.980
 heroes are virtually unchanged from 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.720
 time for so many years the name has changed 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.420
 your appearance only at the very beginning 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.580
 looked a little more careless and that 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.010
 concerns age then she and company 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.900
 stuck in growth like peter pan yes 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.960
 and what must be confused many others 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.790
 fictional characters 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.160
 eternal girl them of course yet again 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.200
 will appear in games about Sonic the more 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.090
 that recently just announced a new 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.760
 part of the adventures of the blue hedgehog 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.120
 maybe even there Sonic's heart will soften and 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.720
 he will look at and 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.720
 already with different eyes 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.560
 this
