00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.620
 flight orders 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 trajectory of the plane the ruler of 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.120
 depth 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.090
 around the kz2 pitching she is 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.640
 operated by the handle where the steering wheel 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.349
 back and forth pulling the handle 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.270
 towards you the elevator is 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.700
 lifts what causes a variation of 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.810
 the pitch-up attitude inversely in all 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.119
 are the handle the elevator 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.879
 lowering so bringing the plane has 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.370
 nose down the rudder 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.470
 allows to control the plane around the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.510
 kz2 boring it is controlled by the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.800
 rudder pressing the rudder 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.660
 with the left foot the ruler of 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.400
 direction will be only left and the plane 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.260
 per year the left acea inversely to 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.489
 right 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.590
 finally the fins allows to tilt 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.059
 the plane around the kz2 roll in 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.899
 pointing the left stick the wing 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.489
 left gets up 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.829
 while the right flap go down 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.969
 the lift difference so created 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.910
 on both they cause 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.200
 the tilt of the plane you'll notice 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.879
 that governs them are located at 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.399
 ends of the plane farthest 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.380
 possible from the center of gravity the goal is 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.610
 to create an important leverage what 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.259
 which allows to have control surfaces 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.240
 modest dimensions while remaining 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.130
 effective 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.570
 when they were 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.430
 streams of air flowing around the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.500
 profile created a force what is 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.229
 Moreover, the goal sought to act 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.790
 around the concerned focus this force has 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.560
 consequence that the pilot must 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.329
 maintain a constant effort on 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.090
 controls to keep the rudder 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.770
 in this position the pilot is a gold 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.689
 fervent supporter of minimal effort 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.670
 that is why systems of 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.439
 compensation have been invented for 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.880
 cancel or minimize efforts to 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.680
 orders 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.780
 the diet compensator is the most 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.120
 current it is actually a small 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.580
 govern for the guidance 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.930
 the principle is simple we use the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.850
 lever arm 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.530
 the moment that is the aptitude of the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.690
 governs how to turn the plane around 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.360
 of the act concerned is the product of the 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.430
 force multiplied by the distance the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.020
 moment of governing representative of 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.790
 the effort to produce to maintain the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.040
 govern in this position is so 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.040
 equal to 1 x f1 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.070
 to counteract this force the compensator 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.560
 being further from the axis of 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.950
 rotation distance of 2 the force 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.990
 needed will be less force f2 that's 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.520
 why the surface of the compensator will be 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.800
 much lower than that of the governor 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.990
 so the compensator acting as a 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.150
 mini rudder will maintain the rudder 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.650
 depth in this position the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.420
 steering being pointed in the direction 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.900
 wanted the action on the plane is still 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.370
 effective 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.140
 but the pilot should no longer do 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.970
 of efforts at the sleeves 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.760
 the compensator and controlled by a 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.140
 steering wheel located in the cockpit 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.220
 note that the compensation must not have 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.590
 place that in the phases of flight 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.959
 stabilize like the landing the climb or 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.910
 the descent we do not compensate for a phase 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.350
 temporary as the turns where the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.410
 trajectory changes in the plane 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.410
 vertical
