00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 everyone has their limits and to find out 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.950
 they need to go beyond 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 the essence of the race is to experience on 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.220
 strength of your character 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.830
 skills 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.490
 your fear is to connect with 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.380
 by car 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.640
 another task which recycles 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.780
 gasoline to adrenaline and having made it you already 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.780
 you can not refuse 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.640
 over the past few years of racing 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.530
 need for speed series a couple of times 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.390
 radically changed its direction 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 development different development teams 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.410
 have seen the perfect race in their own way 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.300
 because from year to year on the counter 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.400
 there were no similar games 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.869
 that series was pretending to be a difficult sport 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.410
 simulator the authors tried 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.360
 turn 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.760
 street racing road adventure 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.380
 once the nfs is completely gone completely 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.390
 online however none of these attempts 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.650
 plainly failed to form a new 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.570
 Nid FoSid ideology 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.280
 the games sold well the brand became 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.440
 so recognizable that in a couple 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 months come out the film adaptation but clear 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.630
 understanding what a series is 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.880
 there was so much with the release of rails 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.130
 principle back in 2010 when there was 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.420
 the course will sew a new generation it became clear 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.670
 what nid fo spid in the near future 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.190
 will be only about the chase in the American 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.940
 entourage police barriers and expensive 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.009
 sports cars 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.990
 they are pro street racing and nitrous oxide and 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.770
 royals this should be on all 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.869
 100 percent 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 developers from gold games did not 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.009
 wise and just brought to mind the concept 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.869
 three years old criteria at the very 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.910
 At the beginning we are offered to choose who we are for. 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.130
 want to play for cops or racers a 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.869
 then let into a huge open world with 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.819
 a bunch of competitions and hundreds of kilometers 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.619
 roads and a variety of 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.910
 locations of cases and poisoned in almost 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.530
 the best race of our day 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.979
 Then there are forests with old trees 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.380
 and snow covered slopes and wilderness powerful 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.390
 the frostbite 3 engine is still disgusting 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.730
 draws landscapes but objects 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.709
 who are at close range 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.810
 look almost like real regret 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.489
 this is valid only for pisi and new 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.090
 consoles on consoles current 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.250
 generations 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.470
 the game is heavily trimmed graphically 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.840
 textures lower resolution and many details 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.310
 like dust and splinters are completely absent but 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.440
 not only the schedule and is able to attract 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.510
 rivals it is clear that chop alone 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.250
 circles around american firms even on 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.170
 expensive aston martin bored already 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.880
 after an hour of play, you can of course perform 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.860
 special tasks like to get 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.870
 ten thousand points or pairs ram five 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.849
 police cars to open access to 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.680
 new car but chase with bots 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.090
 all the same boring especially as 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.920
 unlock machines can and in 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.690
 multiplayer mode therefore 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.800
 the essence of the new part of nid fo spid is still 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.629
 in multiplayer 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.000
 which here improved and supplemented 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.120
 few interesting 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.120
 they 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.760
 for example, there was an oldric system 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.800
 thanks to which you have the opportunity 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.720
 join race for a second 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.270
 your friends and start competing with them 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.740
 let's say driving a patrol car can 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.990
 start pursuing a friend 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.700
 catching him this way throws or 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.650
 join up to the active race as 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.600
 one more opponent such moments 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.640
 completely unimportant becomes the fact 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.320
 that improving machines do not greatly affect 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.880
 their running characteristics and the general 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.740
 the number of cars is not that bad 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.480
 great although honestly during the game 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.640
 you are guaranteed on all cars 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.830
 don't exactly ride so lack 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.810
 sports cars do not feel the same 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.610
 finally cars of different classes 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.740
 really differ in terms of 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.450
 control some powerful shower on 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.890
 cornering does not behave like 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.900
 let's say supple bmw 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.030
 despite the fact that physics is quite arcade from 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.280
 control you get a lot of fun 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.260
 cars fit neatly into corners 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.060
 both of us steep turns need to be active 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.010
 use the hand brake and the high 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.850
 speeds any sudden movement can 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.850
 cause an accident 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.510
 the only thing that really grieves 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.550
 so this is totally oak collision 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.500
 when you ram an opponent of this 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.660
 do you feel any contact is like 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.760
 the collision of two bricks however this 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.560
 due to gameplay if 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.300
 car stalled after one crash to play 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.790
 it would not be so interesting and all the excitement 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.410
 would almost disappear at the very start rivals 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.210
 can not be blamed for marking time 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.730
 using proven gameplay elements 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.770
 The authors were able to make a very beautiful and 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.960
 an exciting race that will bother you 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.210
 in a week but it will be a week full 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.280
 vivid emotions and impressions then sam and 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.940
 adrenaline sensation from the original 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.530
 bridge 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.330
 when you have a helicopter on your tail and 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.280
 several patrol cars still 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.960
 arises during a game of Eden was conducted 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.340
 one hundred and only difference we lead you 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.900
 hunting is not faceless bots 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.900
 well lively rivals
