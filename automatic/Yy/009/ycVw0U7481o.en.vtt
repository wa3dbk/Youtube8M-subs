welcome to silk point Academy in this
lecture<00:00:06.109> we<00:00:06.529> will<00:00:07.000> talk<00:00:08.000> about<00:00:08.620> the<00:00:09.790> process

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
lecture we will talk about the process

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.610 
lecture we will talk about the process
involved<00:00:11.660> in<00:00:12.100> in<00:00:13.100> figuring<00:00:14.000> out<00:00:14.270> what<00:00:14.630> really

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
involved in in figuring out what really

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.080 
involved in in figuring out what really
happens<00:00:16.250> when<00:00:16.700> we<00:00:16.760> press<00:00:17.300> a<00:00:17.570> key<00:00:18.520> so<00:00:19.520> that<00:00:19.550> is

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
happens when we press a key so that is

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.890 
happens when we press a key so that is
the<00:00:20.330> problem<00:00:20.870> we<00:00:21.200> have<00:00:21.470> a<00:00:21.830> user<00:00:22.580> is<00:00:23.000> pressing<00:00:23.660> a

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
the problem we have a user is pressing a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.820 
the problem we have a user is pressing a
letter<00:00:24.289> or<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.770> key<00:00:25.190> book<00:00:25.430> on<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.940> keyboard<00:00:26.420> and

letter or a key book on the keyboard and

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.300 
letter or a key book on the keyboard and
somehow<00:00:27.830> it<00:00:28.340> appears<00:00:28.789> on<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.360> window<00:00:30.310> let's

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
somehow it appears on the window let's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.280 
somehow it appears on the window let's
go<00:00:31.670> ahead<00:00:31.730> and<00:00:32.150> take<00:00:32.599> this<00:00:33.220> we<00:00:34.220> have<00:00:35.290> our

V<00:01:10.280> on<00:01:10.609> the<00:01:10.850> keyboard<00:01:12.189> this<00:01:13.189> is<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.520> keyboard

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.730 

the<00:01:17.329> letter<00:01:17.539> of<00:01:17.749> these<00:01:17.899> should<00:01:18.109> appear<00:01:18.560> on

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
the letter of these should appear on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.539 
the letter of these should appear on
email<00:01:19.670> not<00:01:20.509> on<00:01:20.810> YouTube<00:01:21.380> or<00:01:21.770> Angry<00:01:22.279> Birds

Windows<00:01:24.189> it<00:01:25.189> shouldn't<00:01:25.609> appear<00:01:25.850> there<00:01:26.119> should

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
Windows it shouldn't appear there should

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.519 
Windows it shouldn't appear there should
appear<00:01:26.600> right<00:01:26.899> here<00:01:27.369> so<00:01:28.369> how<00:01:28.579> does<00:01:28.639> it<00:01:28.880> happen

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:29.529 
appear right here so how does it happen

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:37.839 
appear right here so how does it happen
so<00:01:30.529> let's<00:01:31.299> go<00:01:32.299> ahead<00:01:32.389> and<00:01:35.380> take<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.859> CPU<00:01:37.490> first

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
so let's go ahead and take the CPU first

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:44.499 
so let's go ahead and take the CPU first
let's<00:01:38.329> take<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:40.369> CPU<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:42.259> CPU<00:01:42.950> has<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.939> lot<00:01:44.329> of

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
let's take the CPU the CPU has a lot of

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.139 
let's take the CPU the CPU has a lot of
wires<00:01:44.810> coming<00:01:45.439> in<00:01:45.619> right<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:46.539> coming<00:01:47.539> out<00:01:49.149> try

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
wires coming in right and coming out try

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:58.209 
wires coming in right and coming out try
to<00:01:50.179> open<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:50.749> up<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.139> see<00:01:54.369> lot<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.399> wires<00:01:57.219> for

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
to open it up and see lot of wires for

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.019 
to open it up and see lot of wires for
it<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.789> do<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.179> computation<00:02:00.549> let's<00:02:01.549> pretend

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:02.029 
it to do the computation let's pretend

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:06.630 
it to do the computation let's pretend
through<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.659> motherboard

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.360 

the<00:02:07.060> keyboard<00:02:07.510> is<00:02:07.600> connected<00:02:07.780> right<00:02:11.370> keyboard

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
the keyboard is connected right keyboard

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.830 
the keyboard is connected right keyboard
is<00:02:12.730> connected<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.650> press<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.100> letter<00:02:15.280> V<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
is connected so we press the letter V it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.930 
is connected so we press the letter V it
goes<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> motherboard<00:02:17.880> somehow<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
goes to the motherboard somehow the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.010 
goes to the motherboard somehow the
motherboard<00:02:20.550> informs<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:22.120> CPU<00:02:22.630> through<00:02:22.960> this

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
motherboard informs the CPU through this

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.670 
motherboard informs the CPU through this
line<00:02:25.110> right<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:28.230> triggers<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.440> line

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
line right it just triggers this line

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.530 
line right it just triggers this line
through<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.130> means<00:02:30.990> there<00:02:31.990> will<00:02:32.110> be<00:02:32.170> a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
through this means there will be a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.060 
through this means there will be a
instead<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.800> zero<00:02:35.800> there<00:02:36.160> will<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.340> one<00:02:38.070> vice

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
instead of zero there will be a one vice

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.390 
instead of zero there will be a one vice
versa<00:02:39.520> whatever<00:02:39.820> that<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.950> when<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.100> trigger

to<00:03:35.470> fix<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.610> letter<00:03:36.850> V<00:03:37.410> insert<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.590> when<00:03:39.070> such

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
to fix the letter V insert it when such

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.949 
to fix the letter V insert it when such
a<00:03:39.340> thing<00:03:39.489> happens<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.650> inter<00:03:42.010> handler

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
a thing happens so this inter handler

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.479 
a thing happens so this inter handler
somehow<00:03:44.340> manages<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:46.170> run<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.500> get<00:03:48.459> the

somehow manages to run and get the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.710 
somehow manages to run and get the
letter<00:03:48.820> V<00:03:50.040> but<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.310> doesn't<00:03:51.790> know<00:03:52.000> what<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.600> do

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
letter V but it doesn't know what to do

letter V but it doesn't know what to do
with<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.110> right<00:03:54.720> rope<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:57.280> we<00:03:57.760> need<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.840> figure

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
with it right rope so we need to figure

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.160 
with it right rope so we need to figure
that<00:03:59.290> out

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
that out

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.009 
that out
the<00:04:02.170> CPU<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.250> interrupt<00:04:03.910> handler<00:04:04.330> once<00:04:04.840> is

the CPU the interrupt handler once is

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.180 
the CPU the interrupt handler once is
done<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.970> operating<00:04:07.600> system<00:04:08.049> comes<00:04:08.380> in<00:04:08.680> the

done the operating system comes in the
operating<00:04:09.820> system<00:04:10.269> like<00:04:10.570> we<00:04:10.750> talked<00:04:11.400> remember

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
operating system like we talked remember

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.820 
operating system like we talked remember
the<00:04:12.700> operating<00:04:13.060> system<00:04:13.450> is<00:04:13.600> also<00:04:14.019> getting

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
the operating system is also getting

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.630 
the operating system is also getting
executed<00:04:15.280> by<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.910> CPU<00:04:16.209> right<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.919> CPU<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.489> the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
executed by the CPU right the CPU is the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.849 
executed by the CPU right the CPU is the
one<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:19.000> does<00:04:19.180> everything

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
one that does everything

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.890 
one that does everything
so<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:20.980> operating<00:04:21.459> system<00:04:21.910> which<00:04:22.300> is<00:04:22.330> running

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
so the operating system which is running

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.450 
so the operating system which is running
the<00:04:23.110> CPU<00:04:24.420> has<00:04:25.650> some<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.980> letter<00:04:27.190> V<00:04:28.470> but<00:04:29.470> it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
the CPU has some of the letter V but it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.400 
the CPU has some of the letter V but it
doesn't<00:04:30.910> know<00:04:30.970> what<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.330> do<00:04:31.450> with<00:04:31.600> it<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.230> it's

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
doesn't know what to do with it so it's

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.010 
doesn't know what to do with it so it's
going<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.770> give<00:04:33.520> it<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> module<00:04:35.200> called

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
going to give it to a module called

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:45.600 
going to give it to a module called

to<00:07:03.530> move<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:04.010> car<00:07:04.280> based<00:07:04.670> on<00:07:04.850> these

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
to move the car based on these

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.740 
to move the car based on these
keystrokes<00:07:06.040> so<00:07:07.040> that's<00:07:07.370> how<00:07:07.730> the<00:07:08.180> games<00:07:08.480> are

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
keystrokes so that's how the games are

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.810 
keystrokes so that's how the games are
done<00:07:09.190> so<00:07:10.190> all<00:07:10.520> the<00:07:10.880> way<00:07:11.060> from<00:07:11.930> the<00:07:12.050> keyboard

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
done so all the way from the keyboard

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:24.880 
done so all the way from the keyboard
from<00:07:13.820> the<00:07:14.030> keyboard<00:07:17.260> to<00:07:18.260> the<00:07:18.290> CPU<00:07:22.720> CPU<00:07:23.860> to<00:07:24.860> the

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
from the keyboard to the CPU CPU to the

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:30.750 
from the keyboard to the CPU CPU to the
operating<00:07:25.700> system<00:07:26.890> to<00:07:27.890> the<00:07:28.040> windows<00:07:28.460> manager

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:30.760 
operating system to the windows manager

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.140 
operating system to the windows manager
here<00:07:32.980> we<00:07:33.980> are<00:07:34.010> making<00:07:34.670> it<00:07:34.790> very<00:07:34.820> simple

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
here we are making it very simple

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.230 
here we are making it very simple
they're<00:07:35.870> actually<00:07:36.470> more<00:07:36.800> process<00:07:37.580> involved

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
they're actually more process involved

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.090 
they're actually more process involved
but<00:07:39.670> for<00:07:40.670> the<00:07:40.790> sake<00:07:41.180> of<00:07:41.860> explanation

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.100 
but for the sake of explanation

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.620 
but for the sake of explanation
I<00:07:44.080> made<00:07:45.080> it<00:07:45.230> simple<00:07:45.770> to<00:07:46.070> understand<00:07:46.730> this

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.630 
I made it simple to understand this

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.510 
I made it simple to understand this
process<00:07:48.910> ok<00:07:49.910> but<00:07:50.780> this<00:07:50.960> is<00:07:51.140> how<00:07:51.290> it<00:07:51.440> works<00:07:51.740> when

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 
process ok but this is how it works when

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.420 
process ok but this is how it works when
you<00:07:52.700> press<00:07:52.910> a<00:07:52.940> key<00:07:53.320> how<00:07:54.320> the<00:07:55.070> programs<00:07:55.580> get<00:07:57.430> and

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:58.430 
you press a key how the programs get and

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.860 
you press a key how the programs get and
get<00:07:58.610> the<00:07:58.730> data<00:07:59.500> okay<00:08:00.500> thank<00:08:00.770> you
