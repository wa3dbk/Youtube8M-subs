00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
game that's loaded is is what you have

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.120 
game that's loaded is is what you have
this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:30.199> you<00:00:31.199> know<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.460> one-trick<00:00:32.460> pony<00:00:32.730> here

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130

this is you know a one-trick pony here
so<00:00:35.130> let's<00:00:35.309> start<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.700> baseball<00:00:36.210> because<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
so let's start with baseball because I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
so let's start with baseball because I
think<00:00:36.630> baseball<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> oldest<00:00:38.300> probably

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
think baseball is the oldest probably

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.799 
think baseball is the oldest probably
the<00:00:39.390> most<00:00:39.660> primitive<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> lot<00:00:41.600> that's<00:00:42.600> not

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
the most primitive of the lot that's not

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
the most primitive of the lot that's not
too<00:00:42.989> bad<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.460> about<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.760> good<00:00:44.910> as

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
too bad I think it's about as good as

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.740 
too bad I think it's about as good as
we're<00:00:45.149> gonna<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> way<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.530> works<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
we're gonna get so the way this works is

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.119 
we're gonna get so the way this works is
each<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.170> games<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> few

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
each one of these games have a few

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
each one of these games have a few
buttons<00:00:50.309> across<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> bottom<00:00:51.469> which<00:00:52.469> are

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
buttons across the bottom which are

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
buttons across the bottom which are
basically<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.129> complete<00:00:53.520> controls<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
basically your complete controls and you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.490 
basically your complete controls and you
can<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:55.010> here<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:58.350> basically

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
can see here we have the it's basically

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
can see here we have the it's basically
on<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> left<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
on on the right and off on the left and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.070 
on on the right and off on the left and
in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.899> middle<00:01:01.039> these<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.370> notes<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.960> was

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
in the middle these little notes it was

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.179 
in the middle these little notes it was
very<00:01:04.320> important<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> would

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
very important to have this it would

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.940 
very important to have this it would
turn<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.850> sound<00:01:06.260> because<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> sound<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
turn off the sound because the sound and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.310 
turn off the sound because the sound and
these<00:01:08.040> things<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> equivalent<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.330> an

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
these things was the equivalent of an

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
these things was the equivalent of an
early<00:01:10.650> PC<00:01:11.070> speaker<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> lot<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.750> parents

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
early PC speaker and a lot of parents

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.590 
early PC speaker and a lot of parents
couldn't<00:01:13.650> put<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.299> so<00:01:15.299> let's<00:01:15.479> see

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
couldn't put up with it so let's see

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.539 
couldn't put up with it so let's see
what<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.810> looks<00:01:15.990> like

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
what it looks like

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
what it looks like
lower<00:01:17.549> left<00:01:17.820> player<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.570> level<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.110> could

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
lower left player and level you could

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.170 
lower left player and level you could
make<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> some<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.670> these<00:01:20.729> games<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.090> could

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
make it some of these games you could

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.280 
make it some of these games you could
make<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.689> harder<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.960> didn't<00:01:22.170> have

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
these up I mean as you probably guess

we have this little search grid shows us

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.300 
we have this little search grid shows us
basically<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.450> mini<00:05:24.720> map<00:05:25.160> of<00:05:26.160> where<00:05:26.490> we<00:05:26.669> can

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
basically a mini map of where we can

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:38.770 
basically a mini map of where we can
find<00:05:30.110> enemy<00:05:31.110> subs<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:32.190> away<00:05:32.490> we<00:05:32.639> go<00:05:36.620> all<00:05:37.620> right

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
find enemy subs and away we go all right

find enemy subs and away we go all right
we<00:05:39.780> see<00:05:39.930> dots<00:05:40.169> on<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.410> mini-map<00:05:41.030> there<00:05:42.030> we<00:05:42.479> go

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
we see dots on the mini-map there we go

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:53.000 
we see dots on the mini-map there we go
shoot<00:05:44.280> those<00:05:44.520> subs<00:05:49.610> no<00:05:50.610> we<00:05:50.789> got<00:05:50.940> away<00:05:51.860> you<00:05:52.860> can

there's a drawing of a Sud which

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.430 
there's a drawing of a Sud which
represents<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.330> damaged<00:05:57.780> monitor<00:05:58.200> certain

represents the damaged monitor certain

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.409 
represents the damaged monitor certain
parts<00:05:58.770> of<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:58.919> will<00:05:59.070> flash<00:06:01.550> as<00:06:02.550> my<00:06:02.910> sub<00:06:03.180> takes

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
parts of that will flash as my sub takes

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.680 
parts of that will flash as my sub takes
damage<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:05.639> I'm<00:06:05.729> not<00:06:05.849> sure<00:06:06.000> what<00:06:06.180> actually

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
damage and I'm not sure what actually

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.839 
damage and I'm not sure what actually
causes<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.229> damage<00:06:07.440> see<00:06:08.190> there<00:06:08.340> you<00:06:08.430> go<00:06:08.520> we

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
causes the damage see there you go we

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.060 
causes the damage see there you go we
have<00:06:08.970> some<00:06:09.090> front-end<00:06:09.450> damage<00:06:09.539> now<00:06:09.840> gonna<00:06:10.740> hit

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
have some front-end damage now gonna hit

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.640 
have some front-end damage now gonna hit
the<00:06:11.220> repair<00:06:11.520> key<00:06:11.760> energy<00:06:12.720> went<00:06:13.200> down<00:06:13.289> a<00:06:13.410> little

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
the repair key energy went down a little

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.940 
the repair key energy went down a little
bit<00:06:13.830> and<00:06:14.340> now<00:06:14.880> that<00:06:15.000> she<00:06:15.120> was<00:06:15.240> fine<00:06:15.770> so<00:06:16.770> I'm<00:06:16.830> not

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
bit and now that she was fine so I'm not

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.980 
bit and now that she was fine so I'm not
sure<00:06:17.010> what<00:06:17.610> assigns<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.210> damage<00:06:18.510> per<00:06:18.539> se<00:06:18.960> I

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
sure what assigns the damage per se I

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.960 
sure what assigns the damage per se I
think<00:06:21.990> it<00:06:22.080> might<00:06:22.229> be<00:06:22.260> random<00:06:22.860> but<00:06:25.610> yeah<00:06:26.610> I

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
think it might be random but yeah I

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.080 
think it might be random but yeah I
think<00:06:27.960> this<00:06:28.229> is<00:06:28.410> the<00:06:28.590> most<00:06:29.039> functional<00:06:29.820> of<00:06:29.940> the

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
think this is the most functional of the

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.600 
think this is the most functional of the
three<00:06:30.330> games

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.950 

and<00:06:34.610> that's<00:06:35.030> it<00:06:35.210> I<00:06:35.240> think<00:06:35.389> that's<00:06:35.659> about<00:06:35.810> all<00:06:35.900> I

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
and that's it I think that's about all I

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.929 
and that's it I think that's about all I
can<00:06:36.050> take

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
can take

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.520 
can take
so<00:06:37.939> those<00:06:38.090> are<00:06:38.300> Tiger<00:06:38.659> electronic<00:06:39.229> handheld

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
so those are Tiger electronic handheld

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.010 
so those are Tiger electronic handheld
games<00:06:40.009> there<00:06:40.430> are<00:06:40.460> a<00:06:40.520> few<00:06:40.729> of<00:06:40.849> them<00:06:41.000> and<00:06:41.960> they

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
games there are a few of them and they

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.200 
games there are a few of them and they
they<00:06:42.560> changed<00:06:43.159> over<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.580> years<00:06:43.819> how<00:06:44.060> they

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
they changed over the years how they

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.730 
they changed over the years how they
were<00:06:44.270> doing<00:06:44.479> them<00:06:44.719> the<00:06:45.319> ones<00:06:45.500> I<00:06:45.650> remember

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
were doing them the ones I remember

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.429 
were doing them the ones I remember
their<00:06:46.069> most<00:06:46.449> this<00:06:47.449> shape<00:06:47.780> here<00:06:48.139> there<00:06:48.319> was<00:06:48.409> a

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:48.439 
their most this shape here there was a

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.860 
their most this shape here there was a
blue<00:06:48.800> one<00:06:49.009> like<00:06:49.189> this<00:06:49.460> that<00:06:50.120> was<00:06:50.240> pinball<00:06:50.689> and

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
blue one like this that was pinball and

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.230 
blue one like this that was pinball and
that<00:06:51.469> was<00:06:51.590> the<00:06:51.710> first<00:06:52.039> ever<00:06:52.310> instance<00:06:53.120> of

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
that was the first ever instance of

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.839 
that was the first ever instance of
pinball<00:06:53.449> I<00:06:53.629> ever<00:06:53.900> played<00:06:54.169> in<00:06:54.949> my<00:06:55.039> life<00:06:55.159> that
