because<00:00:14.309> that's<00:00:14.580> how<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> roll<00:00:15.770> all<00:00:16.770> right<00:00:16.949> so

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
because that's how I roll all right so

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.160 
because that's how I roll all right so
basically<00:00:17.430> we're<00:00:18.180> not<00:00:18.300> do<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> range<00:00:18.750> fight<00:00:19.050> on

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
basically we're not do a range fight on

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.550 
basically we're not do a range fight on
this<00:00:19.289> game<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.210> always<00:00:21.210> search<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.350> match

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
and it's always against someone with a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.750 
and it's always against someone with a
higher<00:00:25.080> rank<00:00:25.529> than<00:00:25.619> me<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.340> try<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> fight

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
