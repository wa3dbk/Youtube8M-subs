00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.620 
hey guys this is orbit here and yes I'm
using<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.890> brand<00:00:23.160> new<00:00:23.369> quantum<00:00:23.939> powers<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
using the brand new quantum powers and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.220 
using the brand new quantum powers and
this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> my<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.519> DPS<00:00:26.519> PvE<00:00:27.330> loadout<00:00:27.990> it's

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.060 

shame<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.020> power<00:00:54.230> doesn't<00:00:54.590> come<00:00:54.740> in<00:00:54.860> a<00:00:54.950> bit

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
shame the power doesn't come in a bit

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.870 
shame the power doesn't come in a bit
faster<00:00:55.550> okay<00:00:56.330> right<00:00:57.130> let's<00:00:58.130> stop<00:00:58.730> messing

over time this is the big blue that's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.020 
over time this is the big blue that's
the<00:01:17.960> gravity<00:01:18.350> well<00:01:18.530> gravity<00:01:19.370> palm

the gravity well gravity palm
I<00:01:20.060> love<00:01:20.750> gravity<00:01:21.140> long<00:01:21.290> trick<00:01:21.500> with<00:01:21.650> gravity

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
I love gravity long trick with gravity

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.969 
I love gravity long trick with gravity

group a gravity bomb at them but like
what<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.670> like<00:01:34.790> about<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.300> is<00:01:35.360> if<00:01:35.509> you're<00:01:35.690> a

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
melee dps it kind of just smashes a

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.450 
melee dps it kind of just smashes a
minute<00:01:38.090> interface<00:01:38.540> if<00:01:39.410> you<00:01:39.560> arrange<00:01:39.860> DPS<00:01:40.430> you

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
minute interface if you arrange DPS you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.670 
minute interface if you arrange DPS you
like<00:01:40.820> flings<00:01:41.180> it<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.540> high<00:01:41.720> in<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.320> air<00:01:42.440> like

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
like flings it so high in the air like

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.469 
like flings it so high in the air like
nearly<00:01:42.890> hits<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.190> ceiling<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:44.030> lands<00:01:44.360> on

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
nearly hits the ceiling and it lands on

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.710 
nearly hits the ceiling and it lands on
top<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.930> head<00:01:45.110> I<00:01:45.940> love<00:01:46.940> that<00:01:47.119> because<00:01:47.330> when

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
top of the head I love that because when

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.300 
top of the head I love that because when
you<00:01:47.840> fight<00:01:48.080> when<00:01:48.350> you're<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.530> ranged<00:01:48.890> DPS<00:01:48.950> you

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
you fight when you're a ranged DPS you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.550 
you fight when you're a ranged DPS you
can<00:01:49.670> like<00:01:49.820> get<00:01:50.090> your<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.990> can<00:01:51.110> get<00:01:51.259> burst

can like get your you can get burst
damage<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.040> time<00:01:53.000> it<00:01:53.240> together<00:01:53.900> which<00:01:54.680> is

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
damage and time it together which is

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.130 
damage and time it together which is
really<00:01:54.890> nice<00:01:56.350> okay<00:01:57.350> let's<00:01:57.979> continue<00:01:59.140> then

really nice okay let's continue then
we've<00:02:00.289> got<00:02:00.410> singularity<00:02:01.130> what<00:02:01.789> I<00:02:01.819> like<00:02:02.030> about

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
we've got singularity what I like about

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.630 
we've got singularity what I like about
this<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.869> opens<00:02:03.649> up<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.950> black<00:02:04.160> hole<00:02:04.369> which

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
this is it opens up a black hole which

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.090 
this is it opens up a black hole which
sucks<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.149> nearby<00:02:05.479> enemies<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.770> draws

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
sucks in nearby enemies so it draws

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.730 
sucks in nearby enemies so it draws
everyone<00:02:07.580> in<00:02:07.819> together<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.420> if<00:02:09.020> you're<00:02:09.229> a<00:02:09.259> DPS

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
everyone in together and if you're a DPS

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.500 
everyone in together and if you're a DPS
oh<00:02:09.890> you've<00:02:10.130> been<00:02:10.160> dps<00:02:10.789> in<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> long<00:02:11.240> time

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
oh you've been dps in for a long time

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.950 
oh you've been dps in for a long time
you'll<00:02:12.410> know<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.650> when<00:02:13.069> enemies<00:02:13.490> are

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
you'll know that when enemies are

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.890 
you'll know that when enemies are
clumped<00:02:14.960> up<00:02:15.020> together<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:15.710> good<00:02:15.920> times<00:02:16.130> okay

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
clumped up together it's good times okay

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.390 
clumped up together it's good times okay
very<00:02:17.900> good<00:02:17.960> types<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:18.710> you've<00:02:18.830> got<00:02:18.920> oblivion

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
very good types then you've got oblivion

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.699 
very good types then you've got oblivion
which<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.760> your<00:02:19.940> supercharge<00:02:20.440> there's<00:02:21.440> I

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
which is your supercharge there's I

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.100 
which is your supercharge there's I
think<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.520> three<00:02:22.819> maybe<00:02:23.209> four<00:02:23.569> ticks<00:02:23.900> of

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
think it's three maybe four ticks of

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.880 
think it's three maybe four ticks of
heavy<00:02:24.860> damage<00:02:25.310> okay<00:02:26.209> might<00:02:27.200> damage<00:02:27.470> and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
heavy damage okay might damage and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.380 
heavy damage okay might damage and
that's<00:02:28.130> really<00:02:28.310> really<00:02:28.520> good<00:02:28.730> it<00:02:29.000> will<00:02:29.120> leave

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
that's really really good it will leave

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.199 
that's really really good it will leave
your<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:30.080> target

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
your your target

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.809 
your your target
gravitation<00:02:32.209> charged<00:02:32.600> which<00:02:33.440> if<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.340> didn't

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
gravitation charged which if you didn't

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.180 
gravitation charged which if you didn't
know<00:02:34.910> already<00:02:34.940> all<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.690> these<00:02:35.990> attacks<00:02:36.350> will

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
know already all of these attacks will

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.949 
know already all of these attacks will
be<00:02:37.340> getting<00:02:37.550> more<00:02:38.209> damage<00:02:38.630> when<00:02:38.780> they

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
be getting more damage when they

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.570 
be getting more damage when they
gravitation<00:02:39.620> charged<00:02:40.900> okay<00:02:41.950> which<00:02:42.950> brings<00:02:43.430> me

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
gravitation charged okay which brings me

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.970 
gravitation charged okay which brings me
on<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.700> what<00:02:43.910> reality<00:02:44.420> nicely<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.530> move

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
on to what reality nicely this move

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.699 
on to what reality nicely this move
gives<00:02:46.370> them<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.970> gravitation<00:02:47.600> charged<00:02:47.990> okay

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
gives them the gravitation charged okay

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.600 
gives them the gravitation charged okay
so<00:02:49.580> if<00:02:49.819> I<00:02:50.000> use<00:02:50.240> what<00:02:50.690> reality<00:02:51.310> then<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> use<00:02:52.580> my

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
so if I use what reality then I use my

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.110 
so if I use what reality then I use my
kind<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.060> attacks<00:02:53.590> they'll<00:02:54.590> get<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.099> ball<00:02:55.790> in

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
kind of attacks they'll get that ball in

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.880 
kind of attacks they'll get that ball in
the<00:02:56.240> middle<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.510> their<00:02:56.660> chest<00:02:56.690> look<00:02:57.200> that

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
the middle of their chest look that

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.770 
the middle of their chest look that
means<00:02:58.130> their<00:02:58.280> gravitation<00:02:58.880> charge<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.420> all<00:02:59.599> of

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
means their gravitation charge so all of

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.040 
means their gravitation charge so all of
my<00:02:59.930> moves<00:03:00.319> now<00:03:01.090> we'll<00:03:02.090> be<00:03:02.240> doing<00:03:02.270> extra<00:03:02.840> damage

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
my moves now we'll be doing extra damage

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.650 
my moves now we'll be doing extra damage
and<00:03:03.350> that

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
and that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.310 
and that
stuff<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:06.000> my<00:03:06.150> last<00:03:06.360> one<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.570> tachyon<00:03:07.080> blast

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
stuff and my last one is tachyon blast

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.220 
stuff and my last one is tachyon blast
this<00:03:07.980> big<00:03:08.250> old<00:03:08.430> fire<00:03:09.270> burst<00:03:09.540> type<00:03:09.840> thing<00:03:10.080> but

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
this big old fire burst type thing but

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.580 
this big old fire burst type thing but
it<00:03:10.350> won't<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.950> will<00:03:11.070> just<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:11.580> massive

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
it won't it will just do one massive

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.170 
it won't it will just do one massive
massive<00:03:13.590> tick<00:03:15.890> bang<00:03:16.890> okay<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.820> can<00:03:18.030> get

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
massive tick bang okay and you can get

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.960 
massive tick bang okay and you can get
some<00:03:18.420> huge<00:03:19.050> damage<00:03:19.710> on<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:19.950> like<00:03:20.760> some

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
some huge damage on that like some

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.380 
some huge damage on that like some
really<00:03:21.480> nice<00:03:21.660> damage<00:03:21.990> on<00:03:22.350> them<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:24.150> like

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
really nice damage on them on that like

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.970 
really nice damage on them on that like
I<00:03:24.600> was<00:03:24.690> doing<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.080> radio<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.680> was<00:03:25.770> getting

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
I was doing a radio and I was getting

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.280 
I was doing a radio and I was getting
like<00:03:26.070> four<00:03:26.310> KS<00:03:26.580> plus<00:03:27.240> with<00:03:27.990> tachyon<00:03:28.260> blast

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
like four KS plus with tachyon blast

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.280 
like four KS plus with tachyon blast
very<00:03:31.290> very<00:03:31.560> nice<00:03:31.740> move<00:03:32.210> okay<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.870> apart

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
very very nice move okay and so apart

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.950 
very very nice move okay and so apart
from<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.560> that's<00:03:34.860> pretty<00:03:35.250> much<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:36.690> that's

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
from that that's pretty much it that's

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.860 
from that that's pretty much it that's
that's<00:03:37.470> my<00:03:37.710> loadout<00:03:38.000> but<00:03:39.000> let<00:03:39.420> me<00:03:39.510> show<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.750> my

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
that's my loadout but let me show you my

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.350 
that's my loadout but let me show you my
rotation<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.680> I'm<00:03:40.770> using<00:03:41.010> my<00:03:44.030> what<00:03:45.030> does<00:03:45.180> that

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
rotation so I'm using my what does that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.470 
rotation so I'm using my what does that
move<00:03:45.540> cooled<00:03:45.900> again<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.940> just<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:48.240> used<00:03:48.360> to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
move cooled again and just get used to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.070 
move cooled again and just get used to
the<00:03:48.570> powers

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
the powers

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.320 
the powers
okay<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.590> using<00:03:49.740> walked<00:03:49.980> reality<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:51.180> give

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
okay I'm using walked reality to give

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.290 
okay I'm using walked reality to give
them<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:53.330> gravitation<00:03:54.330> charged<00:03:54.780> okay<00:03:56.210> let<00:03:57.210> me

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
them the gravitation charged okay let me

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.640 
them the gravitation charged okay let me
show<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.570> that<00:04:00.230> BAM

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
show you that BAM

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.500 
show you that BAM
then<00:04:02.010> I'll<00:04:02.160> use<00:04:02.370> singularity<00:04:03.150> which<00:04:03.360> would

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
then I'll use singularity which would

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.960 
then I'll use singularity which would
drag<00:04:03.690> in<00:04:03.840> enemies<00:04:04.230> then<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.400> damage<00:04:05.730> over

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
drag in enemies then the damage over

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.640 
drag in enemies then the damage over
time<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.510> then<00:04:06.840> I'll<00:04:06.960> nuke<00:04:07.170> them<00:04:07.350> with<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
time and then I'll nuke them with the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.140 
time and then I'll nuke them with the
gravity<00:04:08.070> bomb<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:10.550> then<00:04:11.550> I'll<00:04:11.700> use<00:04:11.730> my

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
gravity bomb and then I'll use my

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.900 
gravity bomb and then I'll use my
tachyon<00:04:12.690> blast<00:04:13.110> if<00:04:13.380> anyone's<00:04:13.740> still<00:04:13.860> alive<00:04:14.010> to

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
tachyon blast if anyone's still alive to

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.370 
tachyon blast if anyone's still alive to
finish<00:04:15.180> them<00:04:15.360> off<00:04:16.760> okay<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.750> let<00:04:18.930> me<00:04:19.020> just<00:04:19.200> show

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
finish them off okay so let me just show

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.930 
finish them off okay so let me just show
you<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.919> then<00:04:20.070> I'm<00:04:20.190> obviously<00:04:20.820> I'm

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
you that and then I'm obviously I'm

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.150 
you that and then I'm obviously I'm
using<00:04:20.970> out<00:04:21.570> my<00:04:21.930> weapon<00:04:22.169> in<00:04:22.530> between<00:04:22.950> that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
using out my weapon in between that

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.220 
using out my weapon in between that
clipping<00:04:23.520> with<00:04:23.760> my<00:04:23.880> weapon<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.419> do<00:04:24.600> more

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
clipping with my weapon to do more

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.350 
clipping with my weapon to do more
damage<00:04:25.410> okay<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.340> never<00:04:26.730> want<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.030> be<00:04:27.120> just

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
damage okay you never want to be just

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.850 
damage okay you never want to be just
using<00:04:27.660> your<00:04:27.750> powers<00:04:28.080> or<00:04:28.230> just<00:04:28.470> using<00:04:28.770> your

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
using your powers or just using your

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.760 
using your powers or just using your
weapon<00:04:29.190> always<00:04:29.850> use<00:04:30.090> both<00:04:30.240> for<00:04:30.419> them<00:04:30.740> okay<00:04:31.740> so

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
weapon always use both for them okay so

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.129 
weapon always use both for them okay so
here<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:32.160> go<00:04:32.810> well

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.930 

now<00:04:38.740> it's<00:04:38.949> time<00:04:39.129> to<00:04:39.159> nuke<00:04:39.460> all<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.789> ads

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
now it's time to nuke all the ads

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:49.830 
now it's time to nuke all the ads
because<00:04:40.180> they're<00:04:40.360> all<00:04:40.509> going<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.080> be<00:04:41.199> in<00:04:41.229> there
