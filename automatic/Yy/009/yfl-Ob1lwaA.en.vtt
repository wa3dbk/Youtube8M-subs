00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.010
 your device is presented to your attention 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.970
 automatic charge control 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.080
 battery and conversion 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.219
 voltage of 12 volts at 220 charge time 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.420
 fully discharged battery 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.109
 is 120 hours that is, we have 5 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.920
 days 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.789
 for five days we are charging here 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:39.620
 such a 60 amp battery 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:44.399
 hour load we have connected 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.930
 100 watt light bulb as 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.200
 test load 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.260
 here we can see our others 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.620
 loads this total load should 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.109
 exceed the power of 300 watts though most 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.550
 key lyrics 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:06.030
 declared power shows us that 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.030
 500 volt ampere i.e. 500 watts so what 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.540
 now we see the mains power cord 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:17.479
 us disconnected produces enable ps without 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.640
 voltage that is 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:27.049
 inverter us battery press mode 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.939
 here we see the run ups 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.850
 notice here shot 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.700
 holes there is an extra cooler 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.560
 what is the cooler worth for 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.780
 We did not overheat the output stages 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.220
 transistors if this happens 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:52.140
 we have vps just fail now 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:56.750
 we have it in work but we turn it off now 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.750
 I want to show what happens in practice 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.260
 now we have ps 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.509
 powered by mains meaning it charges 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.840
 battery case we introduce ourselves 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.670
 let's assume we imagine 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.230
 situation that we have is stress and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.570
 network everything is working light 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.500
 practically 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.990
 battery it rests only 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:34.110
 charging now imagine 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.150
 the situation is de-energized power immediately see 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:43.459
 what do we have 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:45.750
 ps switched voltage 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.510
 converted to 12 volts DC 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.680
 220 volts current 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.200
 reverse and 17 expanded upon renewal 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.370
 supply voltage occurs reverse 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 the process ie the load is also with us 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.850
 continues to work without failures and 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.200
 battery switches to charge mode 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.890
 also fall control is provided 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:20.630
 battery discharge charge current 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.630
 is 700 milliamps on this all
