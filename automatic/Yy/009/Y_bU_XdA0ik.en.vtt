to go around someone else's house and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
to go around someone else's house and

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
play the game on their account or you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280

they<00:01:25.500> couldn't<00:01:25.830> play<00:01:26.040> online<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.090> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
they couldn't play online so that's I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.030 
they couldn't play online so that's I
think<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.780> good<00:01:27.900> thing<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.320> codemasters

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
think it's a good thing from codemasters

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.859 
think it's a good thing from codemasters
I<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.670> they're<00:01:29.820> recognizing<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.570> quite<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I think they're recognizing that quite a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.270 
I think they're recognizing that quite a
few<00:01:30.930> people<00:01:31.320> probably<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> take<00:01:32.040> their

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
few people probably want to take their

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
few people probably want to take their
the<00:01:32.549> games<00:01:32.790> renting<00:01:33.329> at<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> friend's<00:01:33.960> house

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the games renting at a friend's house

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.840 
the games renting at a friend's house
and<00:01:34.320> play<00:01:34.829> some<00:01:34.890> f<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.430> their<00:01:35.549> friend's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and play some f one at their friend's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
and play some f one at their friend's
house<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.530> think

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
house if they don't have it and I think

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.080 
house if they don't have it and I think
it's<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.950> good<00:01:38.070> thing<00:01:38.369> because<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.939> their

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's a good thing because then if their

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.609 
it's a good thing because then if their
friends<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> they<00:01:39.930> might<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> game

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
friends like it they might get the game

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.050 
friends like it they might get the game
so<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> end<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> day<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so at the end of the day I think it's a

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
so at the end of the day I think it's a
good<00:01:42.240> move<00:01:42.299> from<00:01:42.689> codemasters<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.770> have

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
good move from codemasters to not have

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
good move from codemasters to not have
the<00:01:44.130> online<00:01:44.399> pass<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.090> year<00:01:45.299> mean

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the online pass for this year mean

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.940 
the online pass for this year mean
there's<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.110> lots<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.500> games<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.799> are

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
there's gonna be lots of games that are

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.620 
there's gonna be lots of games that are
kind<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.130> online<00:01:47.310> passes<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.329> yeah<00:01:48.570> I'm

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
kind of online passes but yeah I'm

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.700 
kind of online passes but yeah I'm
looking<00:01:48.930> forward<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> seeing<00:01:49.259> how<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.649> works

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
looking forward to seeing how it works

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.289 
looking forward to seeing how it works
obviously<00:01:50.159> means<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> lot<00:01:50.880> more<00:01:51.000> people

obviously means a lot more people
probably<00:01:51.509> into<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> game<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> hopefully

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
probably into the game and hopefully

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.969 
probably into the game and hopefully
more<00:01:54.090> people<00:01:54.149> online<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.960> hopefully<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> lot

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
more people online and hopefully a lot

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.709 
more people online and hopefully a lot

more people will be enjoying f1

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.420

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
obviously this year with all the new

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.620 
obviously this year with all the new
content<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> bring<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.479> lot<00:02:00.600> more

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.749 
content it's going to bring a lot more
people<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.530> game<00:02:01.740> anyway<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.700> think

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
people to the game anyway but I think

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.950 
people to the game anyway but I think
the<00:02:02.939> fact<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.329> they're<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> allow

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the fact that they're going to allow

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.389 
the fact that they're going to allow
people<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.409> go<00:02:04.500> around<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.920> share<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> games

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
people to go around and share the games

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.800 
people to go around and share the games
with<00:02:05.579> their<00:02:05.729> friends<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.469 
with their friends it's going to be a
great<00:02:07.020> addition<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> game<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.670> but

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.340 
five years as always personally I think
that's<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.670> good<00:02:30.820> thing<00:02:30.880> nobody<00:02:31.390> really<00:02:31.870> you

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
that's a good thing nobody really you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.900 
that's a good thing nobody really you
know<00:02:32.440> not<00:02:32.710> huge<00:02:32.950> rap<00:02:33.160> people<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:33.610> played

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
know not huge rap people really played

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.120 
know not huge rap people really played
over<00:02:34.270> five<00:02:34.510> seasons<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.320> mean<00:02:35.680> people<00:02:35.920> on

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
over five seasons I mean people on

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.770 
over five seasons I mean people on
YouTube<00:02:36.520> probably<00:02:37.060> play<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.360> game<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> lot

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
YouTube probably play the game a lot

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.420 
YouTube probably play the game a lot
more<00:02:37.960> often<00:02:38.230> than<00:02:38.320> most<00:02:38.500> people<00:02:38.980> around<00:02:39.190> and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
more often than most people around and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.150 
more often than most people around and
most<00:02:40.420> people<00:02:40.510> on<00:02:40.840> YouTube<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.680> know<00:02:41.800> really

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
most people on YouTube you know really

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.910 
most people on YouTube you know really
get<00:02:42.430> over<00:02:42.490> three<00:02:42.940> or<00:02:43.030> four<00:02:43.240> seasons<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.860> I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
get over three or four seasons and so I

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.260 
get over three or four seasons and so I
think<00:02:44.980> that's<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.340> probably<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.670> good<00:02:45.790> length<00:02:46.030> in

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
think that's a probably a good length in

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.700 
think that's a probably a good length in
considering<00:02:46.810> we're<00:02:46.960> getting<00:02:47.170> all<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.350> extra

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
considering we're getting all this extra

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.560 
considering we're getting all this extra
content<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.370> year<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.790> think<00:02:49.270> it's<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
content for this year I think it's a

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.510 
content for this year I think it's a
good<00:02:49.840> thing<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.200> keep<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.590> seasons<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.280> 5

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
good thing to keep the seasons of 5

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.300 
good thing to keep the seasons of 5
because<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.240> can't<00:02:52.420> go<00:02:52.840> into<00:02:52.960> custom<00:02:53.650> GP<00:02:54.040> mode

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
because you can't go into custom GP mode

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.580 
because you can't go into custom GP mode
and<00:02:54.580> create<00:02:54.970> your<00:02:55.000> own<00:02:55.120> season<00:02:55.720> in<00:02:55.870> classic

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
and create your own season in classic

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.170 
and create your own season in classic
cars<00:02:56.800> or<00:02:56.980> whatever<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.520> want<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.940> that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
cars or whatever if you want to that

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.820 
cars or whatever if you want to that
will<00:02:58.600> connect<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.170> know<00:02:59.320> an<00:02:59.470> extra

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
will connect and you know an extra

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.770 
will connect and you know an extra
amount<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.100> time<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.610> game<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.030> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
amount of time to the game and the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.960 
amount of time to the game and the
ability<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.470> pause<00:03:02.770> in<00:03:03.070> game<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.640> come<00:03:03.850> back

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
ability to pause in game and come back

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.610 
ability to pause in game and come back
to<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.150> later<00:03:04.270> we'll<00:03:04.690> obviously<00:03:04.930> mean<00:03:05.410> that

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
to it later we'll obviously mean that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.200 
to it later we'll obviously mean that
you<00:03:06.010> know<00:03:06.130> people<00:03:06.460> can<00:03:06.580> do<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> hundred<00:03:07.120> percent

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
you know people can do a hundred percent

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.480 
you know people can do a hundred percent
races<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:08.050> people<00:03:08.710> are<00:03:08.800> going<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:09.010> be<00:03:09.130> sort<00:03:09.430> of

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
races so people are going to be sort of

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.040 
races so people are going to be sort of
maybe<00:03:09.940> there's<00:03:10.210> going<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.480> be<00:03:10.510> less<00:03:10.660> attention

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
maybe there's going to be less attention

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.960 
maybe there's going to be less attention
i<00:03:11.260> think<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.620> career<00:03:11.920> mode<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.340> year<00:03:12.580> it's

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
i think on career mode this year it's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.340 
i think on career mode this year it's
still<00:03:13.090> going<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.300> be<00:03:13.360> obviously<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.780> big<00:03:14.020> part

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
still going to be obviously a big part

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.530 
still going to be obviously a big part
of<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> game<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:15.100> i<00:03:15.310> don't<00:03:15.730> think<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.120> as

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
of the game but i don't think that as

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.240 
of the game but i don't think that as
many<00:03:16.780> people<00:03:16.900> will<00:03:17.230> be<00:03:17.260> playing<00:03:17.770> career<00:03:18.070> mode

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
many people will be playing career mode

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.720 
many people will be playing career mode
for<00:03:18.430> as<00:03:18.550> long<00:03:18.820> as<00:03:18.880> they<00:03:19.540> had<00:03:19.630> done<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:20.160> 2012<00:03:21.160> but

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
for as long as they had done in 2012 but

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.400 
for as long as they had done in 2012 but
it<00:03:21.850> will<00:03:22.000> see<00:03:22.180> maybe<00:03:22.450> i'm<00:03:22.750> completely<00:03:23.230> wrong

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
it will see maybe i'm completely wrong

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.820 
it will see maybe i'm completely wrong
who<00:03:23.590> knows<00:03:23.860> but<00:03:24.270> it's<00:03:25.270> looking<00:03:25.540> awesome<00:03:25.830> five

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
who knows but it's looking awesome five

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.960 
who knows but it's looking awesome five
season<00:03:27.220> i<00:03:27.280> think<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.520> will<00:03:27.610> be<00:03:27.730> more<00:03:27.940> than

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
season i think it will be more than

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.310 
season i think it will be more than
enough<00:03:28.209> i<00:03:28.450> don't<00:03:28.600> know<00:03:28.660> how<00:03:28.780> many<00:03:28.840> season<00:03:29.230> i'll

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
actually really like them but almost

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.740 
actually really like them but almost
least<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.370> more<00:04:18.549> time<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.000> more<00:04:19.419> money<00:04:19.660> that

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
least it's more time and more money that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.900 
least it's more time and more money that
they<00:04:19.989> could<00:04:20.169> be<00:04:20.290> spending<00:04:20.560> or<00:04:20.890> maybe<00:04:21.160> extra

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
they could be spending or maybe extra

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.640 
they could be spending or maybe extra
stuff<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.360> game<00:04:22.539> so<00:04:22.810> i<00:04:23.020> think<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
stuff of the game so i think that the

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.560 
stuff of the game so i think that the
other<00:04:23.770> day<00:04:23.860> taller<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.970> know<00:04:25.090> some<00:04:25.360> good

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
other day taller you know some good

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
other day taller you know some good

think they will be replacing those

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.510 
think they will be replacing those
developer<00:04:46.870> Diaries<00:04:47.260> with<00:04:47.440> live<00:04:47.680> streams<00:04:48.190> of

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
the game just like grid 2 but that

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.409 
the game just like grid 2 but that
should<00:04:50.889> be<00:04:50.979> exciting<00:04:51.070> when<00:04:51.639> that<00:04:52.060> comes<00:04:52.270> about
