00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.170
 hi all my name is amy and i go 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.860
 do an experiment with the old garden 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.689
 vegetable gardens 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.090
 i have absolutely no green fingers my 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.590
 cacti said recently died anyway 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.070
 but I'm still going to try I have 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.699
 is already being scored below and 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.699
 booklet 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.070
 and also the calendar and I have a brother 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.449
 jars 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.210
 maybe you even have all complete 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.050
 so I am very curious and 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.790
 seems nice if you want me 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:48.559
 follow the store detached and in it 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.180
 is a tablet you throw a piece of paper 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.770
 this was not it nevertheless it is something 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.950
 was that you could put it away but there 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.329
 so the seeds are in a plate 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.500
 on which you can write when you do it 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.539
 have planted 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.420
 with the back also when the germinates 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.859
 and when you can repot it 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.660
 nor throw the store away 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.770
 gently tear loose to that's it 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.280
 roadmap 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.259
 and we will now do steps 1 through 5 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.530
 step 1 is simple that is namely was 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.530
 your hands 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:46.780
 I think this is just for hygiene 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.780
 is so 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.610
 for step 2 you need around 50 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.909
 Add milliliters of clean tap water 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.570
 Well I've measured with me 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.570
 pepper 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.890
 when i have to do you till that the earth 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.890
 no longer absorbs water 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.900
 so I think we should wait now 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.900
 then 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.100
 we continue now because he is now 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.190
 to hear 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.180
 your name grows from a small tablet 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.930
 this 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.930
 look how high that is 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.130
 Well now need to replenish the pot of 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.600
 to about a centimeter too me 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.600
 of half an inch below the edge 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.440
 son would you succeed looks bottom falls 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.440
 off was easy 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.440
 and singing 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:50.170
 this is about an inch below the 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:54.190
 edge and now the seed you put in it 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.190
 this one seems to resolve by itself 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.250
 steps not specified or those to 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.420
 tired of marjo up or down 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:07.340
 here earth must not tackle 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.799
 so I put in loosely and after that may 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.510
 you have to do this 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.510
 cover with the remaining earth 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.949
 hall 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.680
 and then we are now on the date 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.680
 endive 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.449
 today is a 5 March 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.300
 insert the card 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.500
 and then I have the first box 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.500
 filled one life 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.099
 I think this is a really great promotion. I 'm going now 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.300
 the rest I approach for the rest too 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.800
 all do it 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.800
 I think I'm going to continue with carrot 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.439
 I am very curious this is really super 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.819
 simple as i can do you can do it 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:23.459
 also 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:24.629
 that I am going to take them all nicely there for a while 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.549
 sit in and then I'll be back in no time 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.499
 you back 

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:30.089
 I open with a jar of radish 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.499
 and that's kind of funny sitting there 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:36.389
 two papers 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:39.779
 it is in it and it says on radish 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:43.319
 red do not follow this paper in the 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:46.139
 stop earth and there is this seed march 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.909
 there and that is not like the rest of 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.469
 paper but it's a bit it feels 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:53.039
 a little dust in you can also the 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:57.859
 see seeds in there is one here 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:06:01.489
 from there is one that has dots here 

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:01.489
 that is very special 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.959
 now i have planted them all i 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.239
 unfortunately have a few double I have them 

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:12.889
 not all of them yet 

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:12.889
 I have wild strawberries 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:18.199
 the eggplant chives 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:25.339
 this empty spot you have advantages that I have 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.339
 unfortunately not 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.169
 endive leek 

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:40.889
 radish painting spinach I miss unfortunately 

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:43.229
 Still the cherry tomato when we're happy 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:45.479
 can be online through someone else 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:54.329
 so I 'll get that animal tomorrow too 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:07:00.769
 lettuce against roots I have the carrot 

00:06:54.329 --> 00:07:00.769
 I still miss lamb's lettuce basil and arugula 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:08.159
 spinach is in the heart just like radish 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:10.709
 rhoon juice in such a soft cushion 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:12.539
 instead of real paper then I have 

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:14.999
 I still have curled parsley 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:18.419
 heard if we just had some parsley 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:20.980
 wondering if that is even bell pepper 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:23.580
 spring onion 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.580
 and broccoli 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.170
 this was one of my vegetable gardens 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.610
 project I hope you see me next 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.260
 keep track of time 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.490
 I would continue to post updates how 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.080
 everything grows in this vegetable garden 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.000
 and I hope never to keep everything alive 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.680
 a blank space eventually just as well 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.390
 to fill 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.870
 if anyone has any tips then I hear 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.250
 please 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.250
 okay bye
