muscles now I got an email recently
someone<00:00:10.469> asked<00:00:10.650> me<00:00:10.740> Vince<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.099> notice<00:00:11.309> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
someone asked me Vince I notice you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.070 
someone asked me Vince I notice you
don't<00:00:11.460> do<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> lot<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.030> track<00:00:12.389> training<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
don't do a lot of track training and

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.020 
don't do a lot of track training and
then<00:00:13.170> your<00:00:13.469> workouts<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.009> that's<00:00:14.190> true<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
then your workouts and that's true the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.189 
then your workouts and that's true the
reason<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.360> don't<00:00:15.540> do<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> lot<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> track

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
reason I don't do a lot of track

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.290 
reason I don't do a lot of track
training<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:17.100> your<00:00:17.250> traps<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.730> work

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
training is because your traps get work

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.689 
training is because your traps get work
indirectly<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.130> other<00:00:20.310> exercises

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
indirectly from a lot of other exercises

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.400 
indirectly from a lot of other exercises
when<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.270> train<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.600> shoulders<00:00:21.990> when<00:00:22.140> train

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
when you train your shoulders when train

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
when you train your shoulders when train
your<00:00:22.560> back<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.369> take<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> look<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.300> an

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
your back if you take a look at an

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
your back if you take a look at an
Anatomy<00:00:24.990> chart<00:00:25.289> you'll<00:00:25.529> notice<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.039> it's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
Anatomy chart you'll notice that it's

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
Anatomy chart you'll notice that it's
one<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> largest<00:00:26.789> muscle<00:00:27.330> groups<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.779> your

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
one of the largest muscle groups on your

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.769 
one of the largest muscle groups on your
body<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> really<00:00:29.310> doesn't<00:00:29.699> require<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.689> lot

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
body so it really doesn't require a lot

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.540 
body so it really doesn't require a lot
of<00:00:31.140> direct<00:00:31.650> work<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.410> my<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.920> you're

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
of direct work and my thing is if you're

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580 
of direct work and my thing is if you're
planning<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.120> jumping<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.600> stage<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.260> want<00:00:37.530> to

look like a huge freaky bodybuilder then

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.110 
look like a huge freaky bodybuilder then
absolutely<00:00:40.290> direct<00:00:41.129> trap<00:00:41.370> work<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> time

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
shoulders this is the movement we're

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
shoulders this is the movement we're
simulating<00:01:11.760> while<00:01:12.180> we're<00:01:12.330> training<00:01:12.600> we're
