00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.380
 beauty is kind of complicated here because it has 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.000
 What are you careful about? 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.020

 It was going well well at a very complicated time. 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.700
 long time since I do a race 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.750
 this type of challenge but it is not there 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.549

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.340
 damn, everybody misses those 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.170
 which, in addition to the challenge, 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.180

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.390

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.820

 I took four militants was one 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.000
 which gave little money but is 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.800
 Because there are few people playing there. 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.110

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.820
