something like this before I'm going to
run<00:00:12.480> through<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.750> next<00:00:12.900> couple<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.139> bits<00:00:13.290> very

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
run through the next couple of bits very

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.820 
run through the next couple of bits very
quickly<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:17.960> okay<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.289> how<00:00:19.680> does

it work all is going to their turn the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.080 
it work all is going to their turn the
torch<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:24.050> turn<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> torch<00:00:25.289> off<00:00:25.519> or<00:00:26.519> turn<00:00:26.970> the

torch on and change the strobe effect so

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.209 
torch on and change the strobe effect so
that<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.119> flash<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.420> different<00:00:30.840> speeds

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
that it can flash it different speeds

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.590 
that it can flash it different speeds
right<00:00:32.219> now<00:00:32.460> that's<00:00:32.669> been<00:00:32.820> covered<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.360> comes

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
bit well it's not science why do I need

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.389 
bit well it's not science why do I need
that<00:00:39.500> now<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.530> course<00:00:40.800> there<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.160> plenty<00:00:41.280> of

that I think this torch app I've said
torch<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.320> lot<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.250> perfect<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.060> three
