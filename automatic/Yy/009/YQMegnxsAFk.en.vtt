00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
that there is a straight current and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.360 
that there is a straight current and

no I guess I can't okay it's gonna add
these<00:03:30.099> last<00:03:30.370> two<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.360> we<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:31.569> get<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:34.330> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
these last two and we can get on to the

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.900 
these last two and we can get on to the
actual<00:03:35.670> waterfall<00:03:37.739> portion<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.980> this<00:03:39.160> trap

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
actual waterfall portion of this trap

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.809 
actual waterfall portion of this trap
okay<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:41.670> said<00:03:42.670> there<00:03:43.440> step<00:03:44.440> there<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.250> now<00:03:45.760> you

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
have a straight flowing waterfall and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.070 
have a straight flowing waterfall and
now<00:03:48.519> you're<00:03:49.120> going<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.390> want<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.599> close<00:03:49.780> this

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
now you're going to want to close this

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.089 
now you're going to want to close this
up<00:03:50.319> because<00:03:52.500> chickens<00:03:53.500> are<00:03:53.620> going<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.860> dice

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
up because chickens are going to dice

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:03.870 
up because chickens are going to dice
this<00:03:54.519> video<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.150> over<00:03:55.330> by<00:03:55.569> the<00:03:55.630> way<00:03:56.700> all<00:03:57.700> right

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.229 

close<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:04.870> up<00:04:04.930> so<00:04:05.349> does<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.560> animals<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.849> so

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
close that up so does the animals and so

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.390 
close that up so does the animals and so
the<00:04:07.390> mobs<00:04:07.630> cannot<00:04:08.350> do<00:04:08.709> that<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:08.950> there<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.130> cow

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
the mobs cannot do that is there a cow

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240 
the mobs cannot do that is there a cow
in<00:04:09.609> here<00:04:09.820> there's<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.780> cow<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.260> here<00:04:11.500> that's

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
in here there's a cow in here that's

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.800 
in here there's a cow in here that's
also<00:04:12.640> why<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.790> want<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.090> close<00:04:13.239> up<00:04:13.269> this<00:04:13.510> top

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
also why you want to close up this top

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.150 
also why you want to close up this top
part<00:04:14.109> so<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.530> doesn't<00:04:14.920> happen<00:04:15.419> next<00:04:17.160> you

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
part so that doesn't happen next you

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.930 
part so that doesn't happen next you
build<00:04:21.360> you<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.539> simply<00:04:22.870> build<00:04:23.110> like<00:04:23.410> this

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
build you just simply build like this

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.540 
build you just simply build like this
and<00:04:25.140> this<00:04:26.140> is<00:04:26.470> for<00:04:26.680> housing<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.460> actual

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
and this is for housing the actual

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:40.650 
and this is for housing the actual
waterfall<00:04:30.550> section

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.880

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
you're going to want to build it one

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.200 
you're going to want to build it one
square<00:04:43.310> past<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.760> edge<00:04:46.060> something<00:04:47.060> else

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
square past the edge something else

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.580 
square past the edge something else
you're<00:04:47.360> all<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.660> what<00:04:48.020> else<00:04:48.140> you<00:04:48.230> also<00:04:48.470> going

to want to build is you're going to want
to<00:04:49.970> build<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:52.160> that<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.520> water<00:04:52.820> is

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
to build that so that the water is

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.080 
to build that so that the water is
directed<00:04:53.540> in<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.170> direction<00:04:54.880> that<00:04:55.880> you

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
directed in the direction that you

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.120 
directed in the direction that you
wouldn't<00:04:56.360> like<00:04:56.450> it<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.660> go<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:59.740> next<00:05:00.740> I'll<00:05:01.010> you

wouldn't like it to go so next I'll you
very<00:05:01.310> simply<00:05:01.670> do<00:05:01.850> is<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.090> just<00:05:02.120> place<00:05:02.450> the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
very simply do is you just place the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:10.150 
very simply do is you just place the
water<00:05:03.790> like<00:05:04.790> this<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:09.620> want<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.860> make<00:05:09.950> sure<00:05:09.980> to

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
water like this you want to make sure to

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.630 
water like this you want to make sure to
leave<00:05:10.280> a<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.610> space<00:05:10.940> gap<00:05:11.300> there<00:05:11.630> otherwise<00:05:12.640> the

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
leave a to space gap there otherwise the

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.080 
leave a to space gap there otherwise the
waterfall<00:05:14.450> will<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:17.440> fall<00:05:18.440> out<00:05:18.470> onto<00:05:19.100> this

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
waterfall will just fall out onto this

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
waterfall will just fall out onto this
and<00:05:20.530> creatures<00:05:21.530> have<00:05:21.830> a<00:05:21.950> very<00:05:22.190> good<00:05:22.370> chance<00:05:22.700> of

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
and creatures have a very good chance of

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.730 
and creatures have a very good chance of
not<00:05:24.110> getting<00:05:24.290> swept<00:05:24.710> into<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.460> actual

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
not getting swept into the actual

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:42.390 
not getting swept into the actual
drowning<00:05:27.740> portion<00:05:28.280> just<00:05:32.590> take<00:05:33.590> one<00:05:33.770> more

there you go and into the trap into the
trap<00:06:20.180> there<00:06:20.570> we<00:06:20.630> go<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:21.170> now<00:06:22.240> is<00:06:23.290> that<00:06:24.290> just
