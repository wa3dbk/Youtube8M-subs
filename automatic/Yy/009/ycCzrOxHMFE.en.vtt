mean<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.710> know<00:02:34.800> he's<00:02:34.950> played<00:02:35.160> 90<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:35.880> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
mean you know he's played 90 I think it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.300 
mean you know he's played 90 I think it
is<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.180> he<00:02:36.240> scored<00:02:36.510> 47<00:02:36.960> maybe<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:37.890> even<00:02:37.920> quite

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
is and he scored 47 maybe not even quite

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.470 
is and he scored 47 maybe not even quite
that<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.640> could<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> think<00:02:39.180> I've<00:02:39.270> got<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
that I could I think I've got that

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.910 
that I could I think I've got that
completely<00:02:39.780> wrong<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.290> guys<00:02:40.440> see<00:02:40.709> what<00:02:40.860> I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
completely wrong but you guys see what I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.860 
completely wrong but you guys see what I
mean<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.490> goals<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.060> gain<00:02:42.240> ratio<00:02:42.630> aren't

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
mean the goals to gain ratio aren't

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.180 
mean the goals to gain ratio aren't
there<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.020> was<00:02:43.200> expecting<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.650> score<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> goal

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
there I was expecting to score a goal

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.430 
there I was expecting to score a goal
every<00:02:44.580> game<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:44.970> not<00:02:45.180> more<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:45.840> at<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.290> moment

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
every game if not more but at the moment

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.290 
every game if not more but at the moment
is<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:46.860> not<00:02:47.010> achieving<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.459> at<00:02:47.580> all<00:02:47.730> anyway

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
is just not achieving that at all anyway

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.490 
is just not achieving that at all anyway

to<00:03:04.410> get<00:03:04.560> us<00:03:04.680> started<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.000> know<00:03:06.090> as<00:03:06.120> soon

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
to get us started and you know as soon

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.640 
to get us started and you know as soon
as<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.510> talk<00:03:06.570> about<00:03:06.690> someone<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:07.290> always<00:03:07.500> seem

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
as I talk about someone they always seem

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.320 
as I talk about someone they always seem
to<00:03:07.800> start<00:03:07.830> scoring<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.670> lot<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.880> goals<00:03:09.090> when<00:03:09.300> I

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
to start scoring a lot of goals when I

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.430 
to start scoring a lot of goals when I
look<00:03:09.480> at<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.660> stats<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.110> then<00:03:10.200> say<00:03:10.380> something

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
look at the stats and then say something

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.140 
look at the stats and then say something
you<00:03:11.010> know<00:03:11.040> they<00:03:11.280> always<00:03:11.310> start<00:03:11.700> performing

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
you know they always start performing

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.250 
you know they always start performing
and<00:03:12.270> as<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.420> can<00:03:12.570> see<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.870> actually<00:03:13.140> even

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
and as you can see it's actually even

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.600 
and as you can see it's actually even
toski<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.950> difference<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.520> game

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
toski that's the difference in this game

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.340 
toski that's the difference in this game
because<00:03:15.150> he<00:03:15.360> actually<00:03:15.480> gets<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.900> two<00:03:16.080> goals

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
because he actually gets the two goals

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.289 
because he actually gets the two goals
that<00:03:16.860> gives<00:03:17.130> us<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> victory<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.910> keeps<00:03:18.209> us

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
that gives us the victory and keeps us

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.539 
that gives us the victory and keeps us
on<00:03:18.480> track<00:03:18.660> for<00:03:18.959> potentially<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:20.519> know

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
on track for potentially you know

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.400 
on track for potentially you know
winning<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.150> title<00:03:21.360> as<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:21.989> we've

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
winning the title as you can see we've

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.840 
winning the title as you can see we've
now<00:03:22.560> got<00:03:22.709> three<00:03:22.980> games<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.459> we<00:03:23.519> only<00:03:23.640> need

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
now got three games and we only need

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.120 
now got three games and we only need
four<00:03:24.150> points<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.780> actually<00:03:25.140> well<00:03:25.560> not<00:03:25.860> win<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
four points to actually well not win the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.830 
four points to actually well not win the
title<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:26.580> maybe<00:03:26.850> get<00:03:27.090> promotion<00:03:27.570> we<00:03:27.660> don't

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
title but maybe get promotion we don't

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
title but maybe get promotion we don't
know<00:03:27.930> we'll<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.290> wait<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.440> see<00:03:28.590> but

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
know we'll have to wait and see but

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.130 
know we'll have to wait and see but
obviously<00:03:29.150> we're<00:03:30.150> actually<00:03:30.299> quite<00:03:30.600> close<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
obviously we're actually quite close to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.780 
obviously we're actually quite close to
being<00:03:31.650> able<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:32.040> get<00:03:32.190> promoted<00:03:32.430> which<00:03:32.670> would

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
being able to get promoted which would

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.160 
being able to get promoted which would
be<00:03:32.850> amazing<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.299> be<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.630> first<00:03:33.840> time<00:03:34.049> this

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
be amazing to be the first time this

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.539 
be amazing to be the first time this
year<00:03:34.230> I've<00:03:34.830> actually<00:03:34.950> managed<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.310> get<00:03:35.400> into

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
year I've actually managed to get into

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.550 
year I've actually managed to get into
Division<00:03:35.910> one<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.299> that's<00:03:37.049> mainly<00:03:37.260> because<00:03:37.350> I

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
Division one and that's mainly because I

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.780 
Division one and that's mainly because I
don't<00:03:37.709> play<00:03:37.860> divisions<00:03:38.280> except<00:03:38.519> for<00:03:38.700> this

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
don't play divisions except for this

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.060 
don't play divisions except for this
series<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.299> yeah<00:03:40.200> don't<00:03:40.470> judge<00:03:40.650> me<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:40.830> that

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
series so yeah don't judge me on that

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
series so yeah don't judge me on that
but<00:03:41.190> anyway<00:03:41.280> we're<00:03:41.549> going<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> dive<00:03:41.880> into

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
but anyway we're going to dive into

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.370 
but anyway we're going to dive into
another<00:03:42.360> game<00:03:42.510> with<00:03:42.630> coming<00:03:42.810> up<00:03:42.840> against<00:03:43.049> FIFA

grand theft porter which i thought was

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.180

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
actually quite clever and quite original
