00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:16.749 
digital optical network equipment which

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.210 
digital optical network equipment which
really<00:00:16.960> forms<00:00:17.409> the<00:00:17.650> foundation<00:00:17.679> of<00:00:18.159> the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
really forms the foundation of the

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.460 
really forms the foundation of the
internet<00:00:18.640> it's<00:00:18.849> it<00:00:19.150> delivers<00:00:19.630> very<00:00:20.259> high

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
internet it's it delivers very high

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.829 
internet it's it delivers very high
capacity<00:00:20.980> over<00:00:21.189> very<00:00:21.369> long<00:00:21.489> distances<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:22.239> I

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:22.839 
capacity over very long distances and I

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.329 
capacity over very long distances and I
think<00:00:23.019> the<00:00:23.109> real<00:00:23.259> difference<00:00:23.619> within<00:00:23.949> Funaro

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
think the real difference within Funaro

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.309 
think the real difference within Funaro
is<00:00:24.550> that<00:00:24.999> our<00:00:25.329> customers<00:00:25.569> can<00:00:25.960> turn<00:00:26.169> up

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:26.319 
is that our customers can turn up

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.689 
is that our customers can turn up
capacity<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.800> lot<00:00:26.949> more<00:00:27.069> quickly<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.609> easily

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
capacity a lot more quickly and easily

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.410 
capacity a lot more quickly and easily
than<00:00:28.359> using<00:00:28.720> any<00:00:28.929> other<00:00:29.109> technology<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:34.239> most

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
than using any other technology the most

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.000 
than using any other technology the most
unique<00:00:34.690> thing<00:00:34.930> really<00:00:35.109> about<00:00:35.379> infinite<00:00:35.769> is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
unique thing really about infinite is

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.090 
unique thing really about infinite is
our<00:00:36.219> use<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.760> photonic<00:00:37.449> integrated<00:00:37.570> circuits

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
our use of photonic integrated circuits

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.910 
our use of photonic integrated circuits
so<00:00:39.100> these<00:00:39.219> are<00:00:39.429> the<00:00:39.460> optical<00:00:40.000> equivalent<00:00:40.539> of

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
so these are the optical equivalent of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.009 
so these are the optical equivalent of
electronic<00:00:41.920> integrated<00:00:42.399> circuits<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.090> what

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
electronic integrated circuits and what

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:45.990 
electronic integrated circuits and what
they<00:00:44.140> do<00:00:44.199> is<00:00:44.440> combine<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:45.190> large<00:00:45.670> number<00:00:45.969> of

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
they do is combine a large number of

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000 
they do is combine a large number of
optical<00:00:46.420> components<00:00:46.899> on<00:00:47.109> a<00:00:47.410> tiny<00:00:47.679> chicken

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
optical components on a tiny chicken

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.889 
optical components on a tiny chicken
it's<00:00:48.489> half<00:00:49.149> the<00:00:49.239> size<00:00:49.329> of<00:00:49.629> my<00:00:49.690> little

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
it's half the size of my little

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.240 
it's half the size of my little
fingernail<00:00:50.260> it<00:00:50.620> means<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.010> we've<00:00:51.219> got

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
fingernail it means that we've got

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.700 
fingernail it means that we've got
complete<00:00:52.089> control<00:00:52.239> of<00:00:52.510> our<00:00:52.690> supply<00:00:53.019> chain<00:00:53.050> so

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
complete control of our supply chain so

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.919 
complete control of our supply chain so
we<00:00:53.829> build<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.190> chip<00:00:54.399> we<00:00:55.149> build<00:00:55.359> a<00:00:55.449> system<00:00:55.660> that

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
we build the chip we build a system that

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.930 
we build the chip we build a system that
goes<00:00:56.050> around<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.530> chip<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.640> means<00:00:57.820> that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
goes around the chip and it means that

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.660 
goes around the chip and it means that
we<00:00:58.420> can<00:00:58.659> offer<00:00:58.870> our<00:00:59.320> customers<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.100> shortest
