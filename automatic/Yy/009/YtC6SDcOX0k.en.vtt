asked to signify what this point is you

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.170 
asked to signify what this point is you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of those points what you can but if you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
of those points what you can but if you
work<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> pattern<00:01:02.550> develop<00:01:03.140> every

let's<00:02:31.540> do<00:02:31.660> this<00:02:31.750> example<00:02:31.960> I'm<00:02:32.350> gonna<00:02:32.590> do

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
let's do this example I'm gonna do

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.520 
let's do this example I'm gonna do
another<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.160> just<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.000> make<00:02:34.060> sure<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.660> we're

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
another one just to make sure that we're

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.040 
another one just to make sure that we're
all<00:02:35.560> couple<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.160> what<00:02:36.310> we're<00:02:36.459> doing<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:40.050> for

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
all couple of what we're doing so for

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
all couple of what we're doing so for
the<00:02:41.170> x-intercepts<00:02:43.140> since<00:02:44.140> we<00:02:44.290> know<00:02:44.440> we<00:02:44.830> want

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
the x-intercepts since we know we want

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.310 
the x-intercepts since we know we want
to<00:02:45.160> know<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.700> x<00:02:46.000> value<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.540> we're<00:02:47.140> going

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
to know what the x value is we're going

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.610 
to know what the x value is we're going
to<00:02:47.380> let<00:02:47.530> y<00:02:47.830> equal<00:02:48.250> 0<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.840> everywhere<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.470> we

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
to let y equal 0 so everywhere is we

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.430 
to let y equal 0 so everywhere is we
have<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:51.100> y<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:52.090> our<00:02:52.270> equation<00:02:52.840> or<00:02:53.080> not<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
have a y in our equation or not the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.500 
have a y in our equation or not the
question<00:02:53.530> down<00:02:53.860> again<00:02:54.300> we're<00:02:55.300> going<00:02:55.450> to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
question down again we're going to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.550 
question down again we're going to
substitute<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:56.140> with<00:02:56.850> 0<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:59.050> then<00:02:59.170> from<00:02:59.320> there

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
substitute it with 0 and then from there

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.870 
substitute it with 0 and then from there
we're<00:02:59.739> going<00:02:59.860> to<00:02:59.950> solve<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.489> if<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.760> were

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
we're going to solve it as if it were

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.080 
we're going to solve it as if it were
any<00:03:01.180> linear<00:03:01.690> equation<00:03:02.820> we're<00:03:03.820> going<00:03:04.030> to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
any linear equation we're going to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.490 
any linear equation we're going to
multiply<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:07.000> then<00:03:07.300> we're<00:03:07.540> going<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.870> add

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
multiply and then we're going to add

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.250 
multiply and then we're going to add
just<00:03:08.830> resort<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.459> terms<00:03:09.730> go<00:03:10.030> 6<00:03:10.300> plus<00:03:10.480> 0<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.840> 2x

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
just resort like terms go 6 plus 0 is 2x

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.280 
just resort like terms go 6 plus 0 is 2x
and<00:03:12.010> then<00:03:12.130> we're<00:03:12.250> going<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.430> divide<00:03:12.549> by<00:03:12.640> 2<00:03:12.820> and

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
and then we're going to divide by 2 and

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.900 
and then we're going to divide by 2 and
we're<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.500> end<00:03:14.650> up<00:03:14.739> with<00:03:14.950> x<00:03:15.459> equals

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
we're going to end up with x equals

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.789 
we're going to end up with x equals
negative<00:03:16.120> 6<00:03:16.480> now<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.200> not<00:03:17.470> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
negative 6 now that is not the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.430 
negative 6 now that is not the
x-intercept<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.880> x-intercept<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.019> point

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
x-intercept the x-intercept is a point

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.259 
x-intercept the x-intercept is a point
that<00:03:21.130> point<00:03:21.489> was<00:03:21.930> when<00:03:22.930> X<00:03:23.140> was<00:03:23.410> negative<00:03:23.620> 6<00:03:24.269> we

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
that point was when X was negative 6 we

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.590 
that point was when X was negative 6 we
let<00:03:25.480> y<00:03:25.630> be<00:03:25.660> 0<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.670> your<00:03:27.880> x<00:03:27.970> intercept<00:03:28.450> is

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
let y be 0 so your x intercept is

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.190 
let y be 0 so your x intercept is
negative<00:03:28.870> 6<00:03:29.440> comma<00:03:29.530> 0<00:03:30.510> now<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.019> y

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
negative 6 comma 0 now for the y

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.780 
negative 6 comma 0 now for the y
intercept<00:03:34.080> we<00:03:35.080> want<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.350> know<00:03:35.410> what<00:03:35.620> Y<00:03:35.890> is<00:03:35.950> so

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
intercept we want to know what Y is so

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.460 
intercept we want to know what Y is so
we're<00:03:37.000> going<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.269> let<00:03:37.480> X<00:03:38.280> equal<00:03:39.390> 0<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:41.320> let's

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
we're going to let X equal 0 so let's

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.990 
we're going to let X equal 0 so let's
take<00:03:41.769> care<00:03:43.140> original<00:03:44.140> equation

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
take care original equation

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.190 
take care original equation
Everywhere's<00:03:46.000> we<00:03:46.150> have<00:03:46.299> an<00:03:46.420> X<00:03:46.630> we're<00:03:46.989> gonna

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
Everywhere's we have an X we're gonna

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.479 
Everywhere's we have an X we're gonna
replace<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.500> with<00:03:47.769> a<00:03:48.000> 0<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:50.049> for<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.350> while<00:03:50.489> now

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
replace it with a 0 so for a while now

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.580 
replace it with a 0 so for a while now
hopefully<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.720> can<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.080> point<00:03:53.320> where<00:03:53.440> you'll

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
hopefully you can the point where you'll

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.830 
hopefully you can the point where you'll
see<00:03:53.769> what's<00:03:53.950> going<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:55.150> can<00:03:55.299> bypass<00:03:55.510> some

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
see what's going on you can bypass some

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.560 
see what's going on you can bypass some
steps<00:03:56.170> 2<00:03:56.530> times<00:03:56.769> 0<00:03:56.980> 0<00:03:57.070> 0<00:03:57.610> plus<00:03:57.910> anything<00:03:58.239> is

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
steps 2 times 0 0 0 plus anything is

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.009 
steps 2 times 0 0 0 plus anything is
that<00:03:58.600> anything<00:03:59.049> so<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.739> just<00:03:59.950> leaves<00:04:00.130> 3y

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
that anything so it just leaves 3y

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.880 
that anything so it just leaves 3y
especially<00:04:02.019> what<00:04:02.140> you're<00:04:02.290> doing<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.680> is

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
especially what you're doing is is

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.370 
especially what you're doing is is
replacing<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.400> 0<00:04:03.760> for<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.600> x<00:04:04.750> in<00:04:04.959> for<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.230> way

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
replacing the 0 for the x in for the way

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.530 
replacing the 0 for the x in for the way
to<00:04:06.130> get<00:04:06.250> rid<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.430> all<00:04:06.549> those<00:04:06.640> xterm<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.390> get<00:04:07.510> a

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
to get rid of all those xterm and get a

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.479 
to get rid of all those xterm and get a
little<00:04:07.780> olive<00:04:07.930> Lightroom's<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:09.190> we<00:04:09.280> have<00:04:09.400> an

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
little olive Lightroom's so we have an

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.250 
little olive Lightroom's so we have an
equation<00:04:09.640> something<00:04:10.120> for<00:04:10.269> one<00:04:10.720> variable<00:04:11.019> in

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
equation something for one variable in

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.170 
equation something for one variable in
this<00:04:11.410> case<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:12.790> Y<00:04:12.970> which<00:04:13.269> equals<00:04:13.920> negative<00:04:14.920> 4

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
this case it's Y which equals negative 4

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.390 
this case it's Y which equals negative 4
so<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:16.959> point<00:04:17.259> is<00:04:17.440> zero<00:04:17.769> come<00:04:18.009> with<00:04:18.130> negative

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
so that point is zero come with negative

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.159 
so that point is zero come with negative
4<00:04:18.579> because<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:19.030> y-value<00:04:19.509> was<00:04:19.630> linking<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.930> 4

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
4 because the y-value was linking a 4

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.719 
4 because the y-value was linking a 4
when<00:04:20.530> we<00:04:20.590> let<00:04:20.799> X<00:04:20.979> be<00:04:21.070> 0<00:04:22.889> now<00:04:23.889> we're<00:04:24.430> going<00:04:24.669> to

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
when we let X be 0 now we're going to

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:31.590 
when we let X be 0 now we're going to
graph<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.780> now<00:04:29.320> we're<00:04:29.590> going<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.860> do<00:04:30.600> let's

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600
