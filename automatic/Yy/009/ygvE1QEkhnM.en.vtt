00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
 how about friends how are i am ryder 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 here I am again with another video and 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.860
 this time with a map that I think that they 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.830
 will like all of you I think that 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.810
 It is also well known to all the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.640
 map is called handrail or better 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.520
 known as the world in a chela not 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.330
 I know if you remember that map or the series that 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.910
 capon made with tuna and Preserve playing 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.239
 on this map obviously in the version of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.879
 minecraft of pc then there is the version 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.500
 updated in version 1.8 point two 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.170
 of our console teachers 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.989
 a few days ago I brought him one of was in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.380
 version 1.7 that was with four 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.320
 bottles but this one with more that has 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.589
 six bottles and then it's pretty good 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.540
 Each bottle has something other than 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.869
 beginning of the video I do not know if they saw that 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.520
 I was showing the little signs with the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.130
 creator's name and also the ones 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.619
 shawls that must be met are no no 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.180
 they are so difficult but I think what 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.100
 difficult is to join the bottles and everything 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.480
 but well you guys think they saw the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.400
 series of al capone is pretty much what 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.530
 what they have to do 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.140
 and well I hope you like the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.720
 map I leave you with the video so that 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.730
 keep watching it and you know how to leave your 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.260
 comment is always good to comment 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.190
 because I like to see who are 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.620
 active those who do not also is something 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.970
 It serves to motivate me a little more if I 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.860
 liked the video you can in your hand 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.860
 up and until next time
