00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.300
 I said when you installed it the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.710
 open 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.710
 this one that I have here 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.230
 when you open it you will leave these 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.970
 two options in the first option is 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 to change the color of here 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.290
 above 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
 where is it the time and all that 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.510
 you can put it I do not know a color 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.210
 let's put this purple we select 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.460
 purple you with this bar here 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 they will be putting the transparency that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.040
 like for example here transparency 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.229
 well and as you can see, it has that 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.520
 Transparency tone if they want it 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.690
 black so they put it that way and all black if 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.670
 I want it with a little transparency 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.590
 Well, as I mentioned, you run it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 and adjust it as you like it 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.840
 they can choose the color that suits them 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.149
 I what interests them most this other 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
 option that is here is to change what 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.410
 that is coming from the bar of the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.960
 curtain sorry that this part of here 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.340
 below we can put for example color 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.820
 blue and then it will be blue you 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.540
 accommodate the color you like 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.540
 for example this is like blue but 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.540
 transparent 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.130
 so then I like this color 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.740
 black 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.989
 something transparent and then we leave it like this 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.880
 as you can see it is black with 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.050
 transparency if I do not want completely 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.970
 in groups they can also put it 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.819
 completely black is your decision to 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.769
 each one and therefore we have only 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.420
 tried on this course with this curtain 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.180
 and then this came towards not everything 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.340
 if you liked the likes video they have 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.810
 Some doubt comment below and if 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.330

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.930
