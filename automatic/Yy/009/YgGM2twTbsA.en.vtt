single<00:00:43.910> player<00:00:43.940> one<00:00:45.160> at<00:00:46.160> least<00:00:46.370> we<00:00:46.460> have<00:00:46.550> it

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
single player one at least we have it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.540 
single player one at least we have it
and<00:00:46.790> multiplayer<00:00:47.150> now<00:00:47.420> looks<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.200> lot<00:00:48.320> better

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550

and<00:00:49.550> if<00:00:49.940> we're<00:00:50.120> lucky<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:54.550> think<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:55.670> got<00:00:55.700> left

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
and if we're lucky I think we got left

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.820 
and if we're lucky I think we got left
to<00:00:56.060> right<00:00:56.360> now<00:00:56.480> just<00:00:56.930> do<00:00:57.110> go<00:00:57.230> through<00:00:57.260> one<00:00:57.620> more

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
to right now just do go through one more

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.600 
to right now just do go through one more
I<00:00:58.070> think<00:00:58.940> there's<00:00:59.840> actually<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> few<00:01:00.950> fish<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.550> a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
I think there's actually a few fish in a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.660 
I think there's actually a few fish in a
certain<00:01:01.790> place<00:01:02.030> too<00:01:02.480> long<00:01:02.650> you<00:01:03.650> actually<00:01:03.860> run

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
certain place too long you actually run

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.150 
certain place too long you actually run
out<00:01:04.820> of<00:01:04.850> wish<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.590> being<00:01:06.799> quite

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
out of wish so that being quite

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.050 
out of wish so that being quite
unfortunate<00:01:07.760> I<00:01:07.910> have<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.240> do<00:01:08.360> that<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:10.060> let's

I'll<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.730> an<00:02:24.820> annotation<00:02:24.940> up<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> screen

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
I'll have an annotation up on the screen

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.150 
I'll have an annotation up on the screen
right<00:02:26.170> now<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:28.110> yeah<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.350> let's<00:02:29.920> just<00:02:29.950> get

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
right now and yeah so let's just get

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.480 
right now and yeah so let's just get
started<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.850> farm<00:02:31.060> right<00:02:31.150> now<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:32.490> I

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
started on the farm right now and I

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.300 
started on the farm right now and I

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
think we'll have it to see back there

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.690 
think we'll have it to see back there
and<00:02:36.790> have<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.270> round<00:02:37.600> down<00:02:37.930> there<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:39.520> just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
and have it round down there and I just

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.370 
and have it round down there and I just
did<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.850> video<00:02:40.030> cut<00:02:40.450> right<00:02:40.660> now<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.230> because

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
pink actually knows the word with drop

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:22.719 
pink actually knows the word with drop
you<00:04:00.440> drop<00:04:00.680> those<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:22.070> know<00:04:22.160> without<00:04:22.460> like

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
you drop those you know without like

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.779 
you drop those you know without like
taking<00:04:23.030> 20<00:04:23.300> hits<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:24.530> would<00:04:24.710> need<00:04:24.889> Goulding

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
taking 20 hits you would need Goulding

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:34.240 
taking 20 hits you would need Goulding
story<00:04:26.740> but<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:27.770> don't<00:04:28.400> gold<00:04:28.880> anywhere<00:04:29.150> so<00:04:33.250> yeah

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
story but I don't gold anywhere so yeah

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:56.620 
story but I don't gold anywhere so yeah
probably

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.000 

five<00:04:57.630> minutes<00:04:58.230> from<00:04:59.240> the<00:05:00.240> kid<00:05:00.480> to<00:05:00.690> adult<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:01.980> I

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
five minutes from the kid to adult so I

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.530 
five minutes from the kid to adult so I
guess<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.490> better<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.730> have<00:05:02.790> chickens<00:05:03.240> and

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
guess it's better to have chickens and

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.900 
guess it's better to have chickens and
then<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.530> 1.4<00:05:05.040> update<00:05:05.100> they're<00:05:05.670> going<00:05:05.850> to

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
then the 1.4 update they're going to

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.790 
then the 1.4 update they're going to
make<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.960> have<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.140> use<00:05:07.260> seeds<00:05:07.560> to

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
make it so that you have to use seeds to

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.880 
make it so that you have to use seeds to
breed<00:05:08.010> chickens<00:05:09.080> that's<00:05:10.080> kind<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.710> makes

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
breed chickens that's kind of makes

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.800 
breed chickens that's kind of makes
sense<00:05:11.100> in<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.970> way<00:05:12.150> for<00:05:12.480> me<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:15.300> breed<00:05:15.540> pigs

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
sense in a way for me and to breed pigs

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.780 
sense in a way for me and to breed pigs
