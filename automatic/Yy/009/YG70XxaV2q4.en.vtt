important that he does get it like it's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.290 
important that he does get it like it's
not<00:03:59.810> just<00:03:59.870> an<00:04:00.410> act<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.370> he's<00:04:01.520> doing<00:04:01.850> writing

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
not just an act that he's doing writing

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.020

down<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.660> notes<00:04:02.870> in<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.260> class<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.830> he<00:04:04.220> needs

down the notes in a class like he needs

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.240

think<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.489> ties<00:04:07.790> back<00:04:07.819> to<00:04:08.180> just<00:04:08.330> like<00:04:08.360> grit

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
think that ties back to just like grit

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.770 
think that ties back to just like grit
and<00:04:09.319> getting<00:04:09.620> through<00:04:09.800> things<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.310> like

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780
