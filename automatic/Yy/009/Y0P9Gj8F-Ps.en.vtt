old<00:00:19.410> days

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
old days

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.580 
old days
going<00:00:20.699> back<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.390> around<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> 18th<00:00:22.080> century

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
going back to around the 18th century

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.920 
going back to around the 18th century
but<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.400> amazing<00:00:23.880> because<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.630> say<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
but it's amazing because it's a I say a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.080

hidden<00:00:25.320> part<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.250> love<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.670> because<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
hidden part and I love it because it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
connects London to its history in a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.950 
connects London to its history in a
sense<00:00:31.940> well<00:00:32.940> these<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> stairs<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.930> can

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
sense well these are the stairs you can

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
sense well these are the stairs you can
see<00:00:34.320> well-worn<00:00:34.920> simply<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.790> they're<00:00:36.450> an

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
see well-worn simply because they're an

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
see well-worn simply because they're an
indeterminate<00:00:37.530> age<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.309> roughly

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
indeterminate age really but roughly

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.639 
indeterminate age really but roughly
around<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.030> 18th<00:00:39.329> century<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.350> was<00:00:40.500> its

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
around the 18th century and that was its

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
around the 18th century and that was its
golden<00:00:41.129> era<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> when<00:00:42.390> these<00:00:42.570> stairs

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
golden era this is when these stairs

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.840 
golden era this is when these stairs
actually<00:00:43.590> led<00:00:43.770> down<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> river<00:00:44.430> itself

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
actually led down to the river itself

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
actually led down to the river itself
and<00:00:45.210> people<00:00:45.629> basically<00:00:45.809> used<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> use<00:00:46.530> them<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and people basically used to use them to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
and people basically used to use them to
catch<00:00:47.309> boats<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> across
