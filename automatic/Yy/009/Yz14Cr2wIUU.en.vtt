00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
of that fit the world and was taking

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.559 
of that fit the world and was taking
advantage<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> stuff<00:01:32.819> they<00:01:32.970> thought<00:01:33.179> up<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
advantage of stuff they thought up and

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.529 
advantage of stuff they thought up and
it<00:01:33.690> made<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.899> easier<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.140> us<00:01:34.319> to<00:01:34.350> make<00:01:34.530> okay

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539
