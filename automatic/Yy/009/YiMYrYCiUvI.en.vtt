so we don't have any sharp edges or
anything<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.390> wrote<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
anything like that we just wrote it to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
anything like that we just wrote it to
be<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.200> smooth<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.060> remember<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.210> this

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
doesn't have to be absolutely perfect it

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.980

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.089 
and I'm going to do the same shape but
this<00:02:15.220> time<00:02:15.400> go<00:02:15.730> right<00:02:16.030> over<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.629> white<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:18.040> I'm

this time go right over the white so I'm

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.770 
this time go right over the white so I'm
just<00:02:18.250> tracing<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> way<00:02:19.090> around<00:02:19.480> my

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
just tracing this all the way around my

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.900 
just tracing this all the way around my
eye<00:02:19.810> again<00:02:20.349> this<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.680> obviously<00:02:20.890> above<00:02:21.700> your

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
eye again this is obviously above your

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.119 
eye again this is obviously above your
crease<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:23.260> once<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.890> end<00:02:24.010> you

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
crease then once you get to the end you

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.040 
crease then once you get to the end you
can<00:02:24.250> kind<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.519> win<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.879> end<00:02:25.030> add<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> little<00:02:25.780> bit

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
can kind of win the end add a little bit

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.960 
can kind of win the end add a little bit
and<00:02:26.260> this<00:02:26.650> will<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:26.920> kind<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.190> frame<00:02:27.519> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
and this will just kind of frame the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.370 
and this will just kind of frame the
black<00:02:28.360> eyeliner<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.870> we're<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> put

black eyeliner that we're going to put
on<00:02:29.530> really<00:02:29.860> nicely<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.900> see<00:02:32.200> how<00:02:32.319> you<00:02:32.380> have

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
on really nicely so you see how you have

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.290 
on really nicely so you see how you have
that<00:02:32.739> little<00:02:32.950> wing<00:02:33.370> at<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:33.550> end<00:02:33.760> nothing<00:02:34.000> too

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300

Forever setting powder and I think this

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.330
