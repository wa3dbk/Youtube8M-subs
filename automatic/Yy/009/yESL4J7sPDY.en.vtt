00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.550
 hello to all of you and arsenic 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.660
 I hope you are well 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.730
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.680
 new video clash of clan and we're going 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.480
 speak as you could see him whose 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.400
 the thumbnail and on the title of a 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.830
 epidemic that has appeared on 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.900
 auckland clash a huge bug that touches 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.699
 mainly our heroes since the 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.500
 last update with the thruster 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.629
 of air so the symptoms are very 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.370
 problematic since our charming 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.650
 queen of the archers and our dear king of 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.830
 barbarians suffers somehow from a 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.480
 flush and are frozen static and 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.879
 obviously no longer have the time morale 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.350
 nor even envied to defend properly 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.059
 our villages 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.830
 which is very critical in our 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.210
 defenses of war so I first 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.710
 select a first gameplay like 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.650
 you can see it on the screen of a 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.600
 colleague of a colleague youtuber 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.090
 aliens so it's not yet a 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.260
 bug that is very widespread which any 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.430
 the world is talking huh because I 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.369
 to be sworn by the French I have not 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.900
 still had a lot of selling this bug 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.580
 but more and more on the forums I 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.130
 see that there are a lot of people who 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.590
 start talking about it it can touch 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.960
 the queen or the king where the two are going 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 actually see what is at 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.870
 the actual origin of this bug me I 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.020
 think there is really a close 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.460
 correlation with with the tesla camouflage 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.080
 we're going to try to deduce that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.210
 do not hesitate to tell me exactly what 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.660
 that you think in the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.070
 comments 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.480
 but in fact you can see that the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 queen normally to a field of action 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.200
 around its base to one knows very well 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.880
 that she can normally walk all 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 around in the circumference we'll say 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.860
 of 200 soles and there actually go 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.300
 completely invisible so even for 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.790
 enemy troops 1 you know when 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.890
 we put a free spell on a hero 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.510
 enemy troops do not next hero 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.700
 we were going to attack him precisely at 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.080
 to remove all his 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.610
 points of life and and put her out of play 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.400
 there in fact she is as if she 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.590
 was completely invisible so that's it 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.659
 we can see that the tesla has pop and on 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.220
 exactly where was the queen 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.390
 you will see that in all the others 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.580
 gameplay that you finally present in 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.080
 the other two that happened in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.220
 my own clan that's why I 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.750
 started trying to educate me on 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.450
 the subject because I find it really 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.860
 problematic of having one's tooth in two 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.180
 defenses especially that this is it 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.410
 not unroll to our advantage in 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.790
 it was true marrow 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.830
 another defect precisely because 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 these were our own defenses in our 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.830
 villages and that made us lose 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.230
 stars we will see that right away 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.480
 so we will really see if there is a 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.370
 link between the presence of this test the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.990
 hide elected heroes but it's going to be 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.850
 something that will come back anyway 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.800
 quite often there you can see some 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.150
 blow that's a huge benefit you 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.520
 you realize to bench 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.000
 a queen 40 is still fair 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.520
 huge 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.960
 now we're going on a gameplay 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.660
 so that happened in my clan 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.700
 whose clan thing master so that was 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.290
 a usual 5 golem strategy so there 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.660
 he takes the time to empty the castle of 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.580
 clan attacked on several fronts 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.770
 different with with so three golem and 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.010
 after they put all his compo in 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.720
 water 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.950
 so I accelerated a little bit since 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.060
 we are interested 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.260
 really what's happening in the center of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.940
 village you see it's already happening 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.710
 hard it was not nice and a 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.570
 huge percentage and it happens 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.310
 hard on the city hall his 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.710
 king still lost half of his 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.930
 life and there we see that the king and the queen 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.180
 of the member of my clan does not even deign 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.820
 shake remains completely frozen like 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.680
 if they were in total dormancy then 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.150
 here are even the own troops 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.940
 normally who adversary who should 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.260
 to be attracted to these heroes by the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.810
 are not at all it's as if still 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.340
 once they were volatilized from 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.780
 village to you see there firecrackers do not 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.420
 do not go at all on the king of the barbarians 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.640
 and again the heroes are 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.220
 exactly on the location of the tesla 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.390
 to hide so that's us it's 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.209
 not possible what he really has 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.320
 to win a star I think thanks to that 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.550
 can in any case me I am 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.860
 practically sure he would not have done 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.840
 this star the opponent in front there one 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.700
 is going to have a defense of I was so 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.140
 again from below in a war 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.190
 of clans with us a very recent 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.360
 so we see that ben similar of the same 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.970
 way there it is an attack 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.010
 classic gogui so there he uses a 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.420
 fate of sault so at the beginning the king 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.970
 and the queen was moving well and there of a 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.620
 blow the queen started to block we're going 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.910
 see again that the common point 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.400
 to all these attacks it's going to be the 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.780
 tesla camouflage who adjusts pop and at this 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.690
 level there so it seems odd to me 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.419
 to say that it is it's fault for 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.490
 chance or that it is that there is 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.400
 not a link between all this every time 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.139
 it really is 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.550
 just at the location of the tesla so 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.380
 no in any case do not hesitate to use 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.240
 the comments space to tell me your 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.430
 own felt about this bug 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.870
 tell me if you meet the same 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.370
 kind of bug right now but we it's 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.750
 still arrived very regularly and 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.280
 even recently I thought it was 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.650
 was going to be corrected but but not the 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.180
 everything so here is in any case it's a 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.039
 huge advantage if we can play on 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.810
 where are the heroes 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.539
 adversaries as we launch the attacked 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.470
 that just causes bad and 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.970
 freezing hero 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.380
 it will take a little work 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.650
 on the subject see what can be done there 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.870
 above 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.550
 do not hesitate to tell me in all the bugs 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.900
 who may concern you etc 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.039
 we can make a listing like that and 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.479
 eventually I could do a 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.310
 another episode about the bugs but already we 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.550
 will focus a little bit on that 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.229
 this 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.840
 so that's what I had to tell you 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.880
 do not hesitate to like commented share 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.740
 to subscribe it is not already done 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.120
 really a big thank you because we have 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.380
 now exceeded the bar of 80 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.300
 thousand goals it's going to be the 100 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.830
 miles with a big contest a faq 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.930
 we will try to do it well so 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.120
 thanks again to you are awesome 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.530
 motivates me to continue I find myself very 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.699
 quickly for new content that the 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.300
 plan heaters by then wear well 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.300
 Hi everybody
