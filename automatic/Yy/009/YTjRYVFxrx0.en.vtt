can't<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> any<00:01:36.420> easier<00:01:36.780> than<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.930> now

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
can't be any easier than that now

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.340 
can't be any easier than that now
basically<00:01:37.740> what<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:39.570> essentially

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
basically what this is it's essentially

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.880 
basically what this is it's essentially
like<00:01:40.380> windows<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.729> PSP<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
like windows for your PSP and when you

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.120 
like windows for your PSP and when you
open<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.490> you'll<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.720> mouse<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.009> you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
open it up you'll see a mouse and you

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120 
open it up you'll see a mouse and you
can<00:01:47.310> either<00:01:47.460> use<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.850> directional<00:01:48.420> pad<00:01:49.130> or

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
can either use the directional pad or

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.870 
can either use the directional pad or
your<00:01:50.670> analog<00:01:51.149> stick<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.979> move<00:01:53.220> around<00:01:53.369> with

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
your analog stick to move around with

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.980 
your analog stick to move around with
the<00:01:53.909> mouse<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.520> directional<00:01:57.390> pads<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.719> little

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the mouse the directional pads a little

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.889 
the mouse the directional pads a little
bit<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.290> accurate<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.670> use<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.420> if

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
bit more accurate so I use that and if

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.780 
bit more accurate so I use that and if
you<00:02:01.049> hold<00:02:01.290> Square<00:02:02.450> while<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
you hold Square while you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.100 
you hold Square while you
while<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.970> scroll<00:02:07.270> it'll<00:02:07.540> scroll<00:02:07.840> down

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
while you scroll it'll scroll down

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.340 
while you scroll it'll scroll down
further<00:02:09.120> just<00:02:10.120> like<00:02:10.300> in<00:02:10.870> the<00:02:10.990> internet

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350
