00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
digging the smell of it does really

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:07.550 
digging the smell of it does really
lengthen<00:02:58.129> your<00:02:58.250> lashes

the only complaint I have so far is that

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.740 
the only complaint I have so far is that
the<00:03:09.870> brush<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.410> really<00:03:11.280> really<00:03:11.520> bendy<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.569> like

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the brush is really really bendy so like

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.650 
the brush is really really bendy so like
when<00:03:12.870> I'm<00:03:13.020> trying<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.319> apply<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:14.660> isn't

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
when I'm trying to apply it like isn't

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.470 
when I'm trying to apply it like isn't
stiff<00:03:16.230> enough<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.940> get<00:03:17.940> under<00:03:18.360> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
stiff enough to like get under the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.300 
stiff enough to like get under the
lashes<00:03:18.900> if<00:03:19.050> that<00:03:19.200> makes<00:03:19.380> any<00:03:19.500> sense<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.980> just

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
lashes if that makes any sense it's just

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.330 
lashes if that makes any sense it's just
kind<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.580> like<00:03:20.640> ND<00:03:21.620> but<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:22.770> like<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.099> way

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
kind of like ND but I do like the way

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.600 
kind of like ND but I do like the way
it's<00:03:23.520> separating<00:03:24.060> my<00:03:24.239> lashes<00:03:25.430> okay<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:26.489> I

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
it's separating my lashes okay so I

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.460 
it's separating my lashes okay so I
finished<00:03:26.700> applying<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> mascara<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.200> did

finished applying the mascara and it did

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.500 
finished applying the mascara and it did
turn<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.130> little<00:03:29.160> bit<00:03:29.489> clumpy<00:03:29.700> however<00:03:30.300> I

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510

thing that I didn't really like about
this<00:03:41.250> mascara<00:03:41.640> was<00:03:41.940> definitely<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.569> brush

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
this mascara was definitely the brush

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.789 
this mascara was definitely the brush
the<00:03:43.650> bristle<00:03:44.280> section<00:03:44.970> like<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:46.560> wand

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
the bristle section like this the wand

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.250 
the bristle section like this the wand
yes<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.730> what<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.030> called<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:49.080> really

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
yes is what it's called is really really

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.020 
yes is what it's called is really really
flimsy<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.040> found<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.310> really<00:03:50.370> kind<00:03:50.880> of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
flimsy and I found that really kind of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.850 
flimsy and I found that really kind of
difficult<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.720> work<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:52.049> felt<00:03:52.349> like<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.680> was

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
difficult to work with I felt like I was

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.650 
difficult to work with I felt like I was
being<00:03:53.010> really<00:03:53.519> gentle<00:03:54.030> with<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.209> whereas

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
being really gentle with it whereas

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.479 
being really gentle with it whereas
other<00:03:55.019> mascaras<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:55.830> just<00:03:56.010> kind<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.250> whip

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
other mascaras I can just kind of whip

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.330 
other mascaras I can just kind of whip
on<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.910> stuff<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:57.860> other<00:03:58.860> than<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.099> I<00:03:59.220> think

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
on and stuff so other than that I think

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.490 
on and stuff so other than that I think
I<00:03:59.670> really<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.360> it's<00:04:00.480> very<00:04:00.720> wet<00:04:00.989> formula

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
I really like it it's very wet formula

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.350 
I really like it it's very wet formula
which<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.799> do<00:04:01.860> really<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:02.430> in<00:04:02.670> mascaras<00:04:03.180> and

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
which I do really like in mascaras and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.589 
which I do really like in mascaras and
it<00:04:04.349> made<00:04:05.310> my<00:04:05.459> lashes<00:04:05.670> look<00:04:05.910> really<00:04:06.180> good<00:04:06.360> it

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
it made my lashes look really good it

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.420 
it made my lashes look really good it
kind<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.870> made<00:04:07.049> them<00:04:07.260> go<00:04:07.440> more<00:04:07.769> straight<00:04:08.250> out

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
kind of made them go more straight out

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.920 
kind of made them go more straight out
rather<00:04:08.670> than<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:08.970> curl<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.540> if<00:04:09.630> you're<00:04:09.780> looking

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
rather than a curl so if you're looking

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.740 
rather than a curl so if you're looking
for<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.319> curl<00:04:10.560> maybe<00:04:10.799> are<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:12.000> looking<00:04:12.510> for<00:04:12.690> it

for a curl maybe are like looking for it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.479 
for a curl maybe are like looking for it
to<00:04:12.840> hold<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.260> curl<00:04:13.500> butter<00:04:13.709> maybe<00:04:14.130> don't<00:04:14.370> go

to hold a curl butter maybe don't go

with<00:04:14.609> us<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:15.239> mascara<00:04:15.660> but<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.530> think<00:04:16.890> I<00:04:16.979> did<00:04:17.130> a

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
with us this mascara but I think I did a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.250 
with us this mascara but I think I did a
good<00:04:17.340> job<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:17.789> will<00:04:18.090> zoom<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:19.109> can

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
good job I will zoom you in so you can

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.490 
good job I will zoom you in so you can
kind<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.620> see<00:04:21.710> but<00:04:23.360> yeah<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.660> don't<00:04:25.080> know<00:04:25.200> i

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
kind of see but yeah I don't know i

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.740 
kind of see but yeah I don't know i
think<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.890> lashes<00:04:26.100> look<00:04:26.340> okay<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.880> kind<00:04:27.660> of

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
think my lashes look okay I kind of

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.779 
think my lashes look okay I kind of
flare<00:04:28.110> out<00:04:28.350> which<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.070> guess<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.400> can<00:04:29.580> probably

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
flare out which I guess I can probably

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:38.360 
flare out which I guess I can probably
fix<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.300> down<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.720> little<00:04:31.080> bit

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.460 

so<00:04:38.970> overall<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.389> didn't<00:04:39.840> really<00:04:40.050> like<00:04:40.260> this

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
so overall I didn't really like this

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.010 
so overall I didn't really like this
mascara<00:04:40.919> at<00:04:41.370> first<00:04:41.790> glance<00:04:42.030> I'd<00:04:42.810> probably

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
mascara at first glance I'd probably

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.840 
mascara at first glance I'd probably
save<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.440> more<00:04:43.680> for<00:04:43.919> going<00:04:44.190> out<00:04:44.340> looks<00:04:44.580> when

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
save it more for going out looks when

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.730 
save it more for going out looks when
you<00:04:44.940> want<00:04:45.150> more<00:04:45.540> clumpy<00:04:45.990> dramatic<00:04:46.560> lashes

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
you want more clumpy dramatic lashes

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.120 
you want more clumpy dramatic lashes
rather<00:04:47.610> than<00:04:47.820> an<00:04:48.060> everyday<00:04:48.600> wear<00:04:48.990> but<00:04:49.650> yeah

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
rather than an everyday wear but yeah

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.550 
rather than an everyday wear but yeah
other<00:04:50.370> than<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.090> did<00:04:51.900> really<00:04:52.139> like<00:04:52.229> it<00:04:52.470> I

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
other than that I did really like it I

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.159 
other than that I did really like it I
just<00:04:52.590> was<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:53.370> impressed<00:04:53.970> with<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.330> bristle

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
just was not impressed with the bristle

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.350 
just was not impressed with the bristle
part<00:04:55.919> of<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.100> wand<00:04:56.310> because<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:56.940> was<00:04:57.060> really

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
part of the wand because it was really

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.600 
part of the wand because it was really
flimsy<00:04:57.570> but<00:04:58.500> other<00:04:58.830> than<00:04:58.949> that<00:04:59.010> there's<00:04:59.400> no

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
flimsy but other than that there's no

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.480 
flimsy but other than that there's no
downside<00:04:59.900> it<00:05:00.900> doesn't<00:05:01.440> sting<00:05:01.680> my<00:05:01.830> eyes<00:05:01.860> which

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
downside it doesn't sting my eyes which

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.000 
downside it doesn't sting my eyes which
sometimes<00:05:03.060> happens<00:05:03.419> so<00:05:03.900> yeah<00:05:04.500> looks<00:05:04.889> pretty

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
sometimes happens so yeah looks pretty
