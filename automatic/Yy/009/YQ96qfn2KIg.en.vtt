turned to hair extensions at that time I
only<00:01:50.390> used<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:50.990> extensions<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.619> are

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
only used the extensions that are

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.680 
only used the extensions that are
available<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.430> I<00:01:52.550> was<00:01:52.670> using<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.090> microbeads

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
available and I was using the microbeads

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.130 
available and I was using the microbeads
in<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.080> keratin<00:01:54.580> bondings<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:55.940> use<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:56.900> for

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
in the keratin bondings and use that for

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.410 
in the keratin bondings and use that for
probably<00:01:57.290> about<00:01:57.530> two<00:01:57.710> years<00:01:58.190> so<00:01:58.940> it<00:01:59.119> kind<00:01:59.360> of

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
probably about two years so it kind of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.469 
probably about two years so it kind of
helped<00:01:59.630> me<00:01:59.810> color<00:02:00.140> my<00:02:00.890> ear<00:02:01.310> problems<00:02:01.759> however

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
helped me color my ear problems however

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.450 
helped me color my ear problems however
they<00:02:02.840> would<00:02:03.110> still<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.040> connective

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
they would still that so the connective

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.670 
they would still that so the connective
point<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:04.970> my<00:02:05.270> better<00:02:05.600> assess<00:02:05.990> they<00:02:06.170> take

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
point that my better assess they take

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.199 
point that my better assess they take
these<00:02:06.860> extensions<00:02:07.490> out<00:02:07.640> they're<00:02:07.970> really

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
these extensions out they're really

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:08.800 
these extensions out they're really
damaging

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810

helps and guess what could you give it

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.759 
helps and guess what could you give it
for<00:03:06.790> me<00:03:06.909> again<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.599> my<00:03:07.900> head<00:03:08.079> still<00:03:08.379> had<00:03:08.620> not

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
for me again so my head still had not

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.330 
for me again so my head still had not
recovered<00:03:09.159> from<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.090> original<00:03:11.190> story<00:03:12.190> now

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
recovered from the original story now

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.399 
recovered from the original story now
five<00:03:12.609> years<00:03:12.909> earlier<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.599> I<00:03:13.870> had<00:03:13.900> another

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
five years earlier and I had another

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.960 
five years earlier and I had another
back<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.099> was<00:03:15.250> really<00:03:15.819> really

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
back so that was really really

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.199 
back so that was really really
devastating<00:03:16.720> as<00:03:16.840> well<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.579> mine<00:03:18.579> deficiency

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
devastating as well as mine deficiency

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.619 
devastating as well as mine deficiency
we<00:03:19.510> have<00:03:19.720> energy<00:03:20.379> not<00:03:21.069> feeling<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:22.180> general

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
we have energy not feeling in general

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.179 
we have energy not feeling in general
very<00:03:22.750> very<00:03:23.079> good<00:03:23.290> about<00:03:23.500> myself
