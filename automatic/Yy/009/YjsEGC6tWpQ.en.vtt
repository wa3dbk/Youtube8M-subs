00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 and friends bullfighters welcome to a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.469
 new recipe this is a spicy tuna bowl 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 that is, a dish that carries rice that 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 it has fresh tuna and it has certain 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.810
 ingredients that will give you a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.869
 delight to that palate first rice of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.400
 sushi is very easy to do read the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.920
 instructions of what I give them 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 I usually recommend some ask 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.520
 be the same amount of water as the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.950
 same amount of rice now yes that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.260
 depends on the brand that you for 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.530
 dentists if they notice is a little 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.899
 sticky that's good for me to give you the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.899
 consistency to the saucer what 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.640
 we need is nori or alga is the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.329
 We will drench way I like it 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.440
 have that browsing flavor abundant tuna 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.570
 fresh fin blue pine and for 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.180
 decorate the rubber bureau that I love 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.290
 which is in the computer line first 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.430
 use love and let's start with 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 this and then they are painting with 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.770
 brush strokes of the different colors that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.470
 are going to use rice the only thing 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 should carry is rice vinegar for 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.810
 give that Japanese flavor to the cucumber there 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.940
 that removing the seeds is very 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 important once you have it that way 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.320
 They can improve it with sure effect gums 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:37.050
 and finally this prestissimo and we are going to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.030
 cutting pipes for the dressing alfonso 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.759
 what we are going to do is we are going to add 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.729
 a little bit of traveling to my wife's way 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.220
 recommends sesame oil in touch 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.390
 final to this preparation we remove it 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.810
