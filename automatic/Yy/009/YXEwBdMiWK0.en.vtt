of<00:02:32.599> over<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.550> yeah<00:02:34.550> that's<00:02:34.790> pretty<00:02:34.970> much

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
of over it and yeah that's pretty much

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.790 
of over it and yeah that's pretty much
about<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.690> now<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:37.599> think<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.050> reason<00:02:39.080> why

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
about it now I think that the reason why

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.490 
about it now I think that the reason why
the<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.970> connections<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.629> bad<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.200> because<00:02:42.680> um

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the the connections so bad is because um

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.470 
the the connections so bad is because um
here's<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> reason<00:02:45.800> why<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> think<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.910> lot

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
here's the reason why I think that a lot

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.210 
here's the reason why I think that a lot
of<00:02:47.540> times<00:02:47.870> there's<00:02:48.230> young<00:02:48.470> people<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:48.950> play

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
of times there's young people that play

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.580 
of times there's young people that play
these<00:02:49.370> games<00:02:49.580> obviously<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.290> they're<00:02:51.470> not

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.590 
with new clothes are playing are playing
mom<00:03:54.250> work<00:03:54.400> for<00:03:54.520> two<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.030> he's<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.360> poorer

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
mom work for two and he's the poorer

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.520 
mom work for two and he's the poorer
smelly<00:03:55.930> kid<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.470> plays<00:03:56.830> cod<00:03:57.250> 4<00:03:57.520> and<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:59.200> I

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
smelly kid that plays cod 4 and so I

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.520 
smelly kid that plays cod 4 and so I
think<00:03:59.620> that's<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.640> reason<00:04:00.790> why<00:04:00.940> that<00:04:01.720> there's

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
think that's the reason why that there's

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.140 
think that's the reason why that there's
actually<00:04:02.860> still<00:04:03.040> people<00:04:03.310> playing<00:04:03.580> this<00:04:03.790> um

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
actually still people playing this um

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.650 
actually still people playing this um
because<00:04:04.690> they're<00:04:05.080> smelly<00:04:05.440> poor<00:04:05.980> kids<00:04:06.220> and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
because they're smelly poor kids and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.190 
because they're smelly poor kids and
also<00:04:07.660> their<00:04:08.440> internet<00:04:09.540> isn't<00:04:10.540> probably<00:04:11.050> that

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
also their internet isn't probably that

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.480 
also their internet isn't probably that
well<00:04:11.410> so<00:04:11.650> we<00:04:11.770> have<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.890> lot<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.100> hosts<00:04:12.340> with

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
well so we have a lot of hosts with

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.530 
well so we have a lot of hosts with
shitty<00:04:12.700> internet<00:04:12.850> because<00:04:13.270> they're<00:04:13.420> not

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
shitty internet because they're not

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.730 
shitty internet because they're not
going<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.720> pay<00:04:13.780> extra<00:04:14.080> for<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.500> upgrade

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
going to pay extra for the upgrade

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.479 
going to pay extra for the upgrade
internet<00:04:15.310> because<00:04:15.459> they're<00:04:15.610> poor<00:04:15.850> right<00:04:17.459> ok<00:04:18.459> I

and<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.640> should<00:04:25.300> probably<00:04:25.420> didn't<00:04:25.840> actually

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
and I I should probably didn't actually

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.480 
and I I should probably didn't actually
know<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.350> shouldn't<00:04:26.770> redo<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.040> commentary
