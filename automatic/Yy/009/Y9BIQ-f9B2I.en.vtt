stitches and we're going to learn this
c4l<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.420> say<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:16.020> not<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
c4l and I have to say it's not going to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.980 
c4l and I have to say it's not going to
be<00:00:16.830> very<00:00:16.920> hard<00:00:17.190> compared<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.119> have

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
be very hard compared to what you have

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.510 
be very hard compared to what you have
already<00:00:19.320> learned<00:00:19.650> hopefully<00:00:20.279> you're<00:00:20.400> not

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
already learned hopefully you're not

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.810 
already learned hopefully you're not
disappointed<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:23.189> opposite<00:00:23.670> of

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
disappointed it's just a the opposite of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.800 
disappointed it's just a the opposite of
the<00:00:24.060> c-4<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.710> let's<00:00:26.010> get<00:00:26.250> over<00:00:26.400> there<00:00:29.810> for

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the c-4 are so let's get over there for

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.380 
the c-4 are so let's get over there for
pearls<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.529> come<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.099> 4<00:00:32.910> knit<00:00:33.120> stitches

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
pearls and we come to 4 knit stitches

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.270 
pearls and we come to 4 knit stitches
all<00:00:33.989> together<00:00:34.410> hopefully<00:00:34.890> that's<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.219> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
all together hopefully that's what you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.810 
all together hopefully that's what you
should<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.980> time<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
should have and this time the one in the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
should have and this time the one in the
foreground<00:00:39.180> needs<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> cross<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.110> left

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
foreground needs to cross to the left

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380 
foreground needs to cross to the left
meaning<00:00:40.680> these<00:00:41.190> two<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> right<00:00:41.640> need<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
meaning these two on the right need to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.959 
meaning these two on the right need to
come<00:00:42.570> over<00:00:42.780> here<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> cable<00:00:44.700> needle

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
come over here so with a cable needle

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.709 
come over here so with a cable needle
the<00:00:45.570> way<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:47.120> slip<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.300> first<00:00:48.539> two

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the way we do that is slip the first two

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.500 
the way we do that is slip the first two
stitches<00:00:48.899> under<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> cable<00:00:49.649> needle<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.510> hold

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
stitches under the cable needle and hold

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
stitches under the cable needle and hold
them<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> front<00:00:52.489> they<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.850> over

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
them to the front they need to go over

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.040 
them to the front they need to go over
there<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.390> we're<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> keep<00:00:54.899> them

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
there so we're just going to keep them

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.920 
there so we're just going to keep them
to<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> front<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.600> while<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.690> knit<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
to the front like that while we knit the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.600 
to the front like that while we knit the
two<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.730> left<00:00:59.879> needle<00:01:04.430> sorry<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.580> a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
two on the left needle sorry it's a

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.429 
two on the left needle sorry it's a
little<00:01:05.640> hard<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.330> guys<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.380> in

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
little hard to see these guys are in

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.840 
little hard to see these guys are in
front<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.450> there's<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.600> inning<00:01:09.810> one

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
front there we go there's an inning one

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
front there we go there's an inning one
knitting<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.140> now<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:14.100> knit<00:01:14.250> these<00:01:14.400> two

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
knitting two now we just knit these two

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
knitting two now we just knit these two
from<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> left-hand<00:01:15.810> needle<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.170> actually

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
from the left-hand needle I actually

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.260 
from the left-hand needle I actually
think<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.250> probably<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> easiest<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
think this is probably the easiest of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
think this is probably the easiest of
all<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> cables<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> cable<00:01:19.619> needle

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
all the cables to do with a cable needle

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.490 
all the cables to do with a cable needle
didn't<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> way<00:01:22.890> too<00:01:22.950> much

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.010 

there<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.189> they<00:01:29.430> twist<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.880> left<00:01:30.020> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
there we go so they twist to the left so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.390 
there we go so they twist to the left so
let's<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.650> time<00:01:31.799> I'll<00:01:32.220> show

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
let's do that one more time I'll show

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.480 
let's do that one more time I'll show
