got that is this is a this is a
low-powered<00:05:00.240> laser<00:05:00.300> all<00:05:00.839> things<00:05:01.080> considered

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
low-powered laser all things considered

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.269 
low-powered laser all things considered
you're<00:05:02.639> not<00:05:02.879> going<00:05:03.059> to<00:05:03.120> have<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.629> be

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:04.279 
you're not going to have to be

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.369 
you're not going to have to be

ridiculously cautious about where you

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.739 
ridiculously cautious about where you
point<00:05:07.680> this<00:05:10.370> compared<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.520> lot<00:05:11.759> of<00:05:11.819> lasers

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:12.749 
point this compared to a lot of lasers

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.529 
point this compared to a lot of lasers
out<00:05:12.870> there<00:05:13.139> like<00:05:14.039> same<00:05:14.309> firm<00:05:14.699> low-powered

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
out there like same firm low-powered

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.360 
out there like same firm low-powered
it's<00:05:15.899> not<00:05:16.050> going<00:05:16.169> to<00:05:16.259> interestin<00:05:16.710> burn<00:05:16.979> anyone

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
it's not going to interestin burn anyone

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.959 
it's not going to interestin burn anyone
goes<00:05:17.550> out<00:05:20.539> and<00:05:21.539> yeah<00:05:21.749> you've<00:05:21.990> got<00:05:22.279> I'll<00:05:23.279> strong

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
goes out and yeah you've got I'll strong

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.879 
goes out and yeah you've got I'll strong
being<00:05:24.930> there<00:05:25.289> all<00:05:25.559> the<00:05:25.770> way<00:05:25.800> out<00:05:25.919> to<00:05:27.319> about<00:05:28.319> 20

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
being there all the way out to about 20

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.619 
being there all the way out to about 20
meters<00:05:29.249> with<00:05:29.430> one<00:05:29.699> of<00:05:29.819> this<00:05:29.939> particular<00:05:30.300> gun

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:30.629 
meters with one of this particular gun

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.529 
meters with one of this particular gun
and<00:05:30.899> then<00:05:31.800> you've<00:05:31.919> got<00:05:31.949> a<00:05:32.099> nice<00:05:32.399> visible<00:05:33.300> dot

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
and then you've got a nice visible dot

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.170 
and then you've got a nice visible dot
or<00:05:34.469> you<00:05:34.620> can<00:05:34.860> you<00:05:35.309> can<00:05:35.550> be<00:05:35.669> pointing<00:05:36.029> out

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
or you can you can be pointing out

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:45.339 
or you can you can be pointing out
enemies<00:05:37.370> windows<00:05:38.370> points<00:05:38.879> of<00:05:38.969> interest<00:05:43.490> so

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
enemies windows points of interest so

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.290 
enemies windows points of interest so
that's<00:05:46.349> pretty<00:05:46.649> good<00:05:47.089> better<00:05:48.089> in<00:05:48.240> the

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
that's pretty good better in the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.760 
that's pretty good better in the
daylight<00:05:48.449> where<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.110> wouldn't<00:05:49.289> even<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:49.680> able

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
daylight where you wouldn't even be able

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.889 
daylight where you wouldn't even be able
to<00:05:49.949> see<00:05:50.479> well<00:05:51.479> anything<00:05:52.169> basically<00:05:53.419> so<00:05:54.419> far<00:05:54.749> we

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:54.899 
to see well anything basically so far we

00:05:54.899 --> 00:06:03.480 
to see well anything basically so far we
can<00:05:55.020> get<00:05:55.139> try<00:05:55.830> playing<00:05:56.099> it<00:05:56.249> way<00:05:56.520> down
