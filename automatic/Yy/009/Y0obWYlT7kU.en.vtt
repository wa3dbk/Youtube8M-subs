00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.860

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.690 
and thinner so I mean I would suggest
using<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.869> two<00:01:55.170> full<00:01:55.649> packs<00:01:56.009> when<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> do

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
using like two full packs when you do

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.819 
using like two full packs when you do
the<00:01:56.850> hair<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> sheds<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.590> still

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
the hair so that when it sheds it still

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.830 
the hair so that when it sheds it still
looks<00:01:59.070> full<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.700> only<00:02:00.090> use<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> pack<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
looks full I only use the pack and a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.300 
looks full I only use the pack and a
half<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.469> now<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:01.740> starting<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
half and now it's starting to look a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.039 
half and now it's starting to look a
little<00:02:02.460> thin<00:02:02.820> because<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.540> hair<00:02:03.750> keeps

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
little thin because the hair keeps

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.529 
little thin because the hair keeps
coming<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> um<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> little<00:02:08.539> Soudan

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
coming out so um I'm a little Soudan

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.960 
coming out so um I'm a little Soudan
invisible<00:02:10.259> part<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.679> still<00:02:10.770> holding<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.520> but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
invisible part it's still holding up but

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.520 
invisible part it's still holding up but
every<00:02:12.209> couple<00:02:12.540> days<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> go<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.290> there

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
every couple days I have to go in there

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.860 
every couple days I have to go in there
and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.270 
and
now<00:02:15.360> some<00:02:16.360> tracks<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.230> mean<00:02:17.530> overall<00:02:17.560> I

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
now some tracks but I mean overall I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.820 
now some tracks but I mean overall I
really<00:02:18.400> like<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.910> hair<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.200> are<00:02:20.230> thinking

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
really like the hair if you are thinking

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.860 
really like the hair if you are thinking
about<00:02:20.950> giving<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:21.610> hair<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.849> try<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.569> would

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
about giving this hair a try I would

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.720 
about giving this hair a try I would
definitely<00:02:23.560> consider<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.280> I<00:02:24.370> think<00:02:24.610> it's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
definitely consider it I think it's

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.619 
definitely consider it I think it's
really<00:02:25.030> pretty

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
really pretty

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.960 
really pretty
it<00:02:26.260> dries<00:02:26.590> really<00:02:26.950> well<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.700> curl

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
it dries really well and the curl

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.509 
it dries really well and the curl
pattern<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.569> really<00:02:28.930> cute<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.250> if<00:02:30.370> you're

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
pattern is really cute so if you're

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.100 
pattern is really cute so if you're
thinking<00:02:30.849> about<00:02:30.940> trying<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.569> I<00:02:31.870> would

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
thinking about trying it I would

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.420 
thinking about trying it I would
definitely<00:02:32.260> suggest<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:34.299> tried<00:02:34.780> not<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:34.989> put

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
definitely suggest it I tried not to put

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.400 
definitely suggest it I tried not to put
very<00:02:36.430> much<00:02:36.540> product<00:02:37.540> on<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.840> hair<00:02:38.140> just

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
very much product on this hair just

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.750 
very much product on this hair just
because<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.739> don't<00:02:38.860> want<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.099> waste<00:02:39.220> product<00:02:39.640> on

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
because I don't want to waste product on

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.119 
because I don't want to waste product on
some<00:02:39.940> weave<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.200> only<00:02:41.319> thing<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.560> put<00:02:41.830> on<00:02:41.860> it

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
some weave so the only thing I put on it

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.369 
some weave so the only thing I put on it
is<00:02:42.340> mousse<00:02:42.700> every<00:02:43.299> morning<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:43.959> it'll

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
is mousse every morning so that it'll

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.610 
is mousse every morning so that it'll
maintain<00:02:44.980> its<00:02:45.190> curl<00:02:45.459> pattern<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:46.470> don't<00:02:47.470> think

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
maintain its curl pattern I don't think

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.990 
maintain its curl pattern I don't think
it<00:02:47.739> matters<00:02:48.040> what<00:02:48.190> moves<00:02:48.459> because<00:02:48.610> I<00:02:48.790> bought

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
it matters what moves because I bought

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.520 
it matters what moves because I bought
like<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.329> cheapest<00:02:49.720> one<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.110> store<00:02:50.349> and

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
like the cheapest one in the store and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.710 
like the cheapest one in the store and
it<00:02:50.620> works<00:02:50.799> just<00:02:51.099> fine<00:02:51.280> for<00:02:51.340> me<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.630> I'll

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
it works just fine for me so I'll

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.140 
it works just fine for me so I'll
probably<00:02:52.900> try<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.950> keep<00:02:54.160> this<00:02:54.400> hair<00:02:54.670> in<00:02:54.910> for

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150
