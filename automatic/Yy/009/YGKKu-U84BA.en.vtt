blocks continuously getting faster as
the<00:01:39.050> song<00:01:39.229> does<00:01:40.479> and<00:01:41.479> then<00:01:41.690> when<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.899> gets<00:01:41.960> to

miners<00:01:45.500> video<00:01:45.800> there<00:01:46.729> are<00:01:46.759> repeaters<00:01:47.630> which

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
miners video there are repeaters which

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.210 
miners video there are repeaters which
continue<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.320> song<00:01:48.470> on<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.860> next<00:01:49.009> part

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
continue the song on to the next part

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.029 
continue the song on to the next part
but<00:01:50.000> what<00:01:50.149> I've<00:01:50.270> done<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.509> I've<00:01:51.259> made<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.830> so

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
but what I've done is I've made it so

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.680 
but what I've done is I've made it so
that<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.340> song<00:01:52.550> doesn't<00:01:53.030> continue<00:01:53.270> unless

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
that the song doesn't continue unless

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.130 
that the song doesn't continue unless
you<00:01:53.840> open<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.289> chest<00:01:54.619> here<00:01:54.979> which<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.550> a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
you open this chest here which is a

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.570 
you open this chest here which is a
redstone<00:01:57.220> trap<00:01:58.220> chest<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.119> when<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.300> open<00:01:59.330> it

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
redstone trap chest so when you open it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
redstone trap chest so when you open it
sends<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.670> signal<00:02:02.259> plays<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.410> last<00:02:03.530> part<00:02:07.600> so

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
sends a signal plays the last part so

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.930 
sends a signal plays the last part so
what<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.019> chest<00:02:09.320> does<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.829> it<00:02:10.220> powers<00:02:10.670> this

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
what this chest does is it powers this

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.030 
what this chest does is it powers this
dispenser<00:02:11.420> right<00:02:11.840> here<00:02:12.140> which<00:02:12.860> then

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
dispenser right here which then

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.660 
dispenser right here which then
dispenses<00:02:13.610> cobblestone<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.769> wooden

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
dispenses cobblestone on to a wooden

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.080 
dispenses cobblestone on to a wooden
pressure<00:02:16.820> plate<00:02:17.150> which<00:02:17.780> then<00:02:17.959> sends<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.440> signal

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
pressure plate which then sends a signal

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.380 
pressure plate which then sends a signal
plays<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.299> final<00:02:20.600> part<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.170> song<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:23.150> it

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
plays the final part of the song but it

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.569 
plays the final part of the song but it
also<00:02:23.600> sends<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.110> signal<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:24.890> piston<00:02:25.430> right

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
also sends a signal to this piston right

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.479 
also sends a signal to this piston right
here<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:26.450> cut<00:02:26.630> off<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.079> same<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.160> you<00:02:28.220> can't

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
here to cut off the same so you can't

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.509 
here to cut off the same so you can't
continuously<00:02:29.090> play<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.360> song<00:02:30.370> because<00:02:31.370> when

Zelda it's only played once for that
specific<00:02:36.170> chest<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.340> in<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:37.940> way<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.780> only

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
specific chest so in this way it's only

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.030

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
cobblestone block here D spawns it then

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.819 
cobblestone block here D spawns it then
cuts<00:02:49.519> off<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.790> signal<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:51.709> then

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
give you a better idea of how the note

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.960 
give you a better idea of how the note
blocks<00:03:21.680> are<00:03:21.920> laid<00:03:22.160> out<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.580> number<00:03:22.790> of

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
blocks are laid out and the number of

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.160 
blocks are laid out and the number of
delays<00:03:23.510> between<00:03:23.810> each<00:03:24.050> repeaters<00:03:24.470> oops<00:03:26.170> this

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
delays between each repeaters oops this

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.520 
delays between each repeaters oops this
is<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:28.310> general<00:03:28.970> idea<00:03:29.180> how<00:03:29.360> I<00:03:29.390> did<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.380> these

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
is a general idea how I did it so these

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.840 
is a general idea how I did it so these
are<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.740> three<00:03:30.980> note<00:03:31.400> blocks<00:03:31.670> in<00:03:31.790> the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
are the three note blocks in the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.940 
are the three note blocks in the
beginning<00:03:32.210> at<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.840> top<00:03:33.020> where<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.320> starts<00:03:33.680> and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
beginning at the top where it starts and

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.070 
beginning at the top where it starts and
the<00:03:34.220> number<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.490> clicks<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:34.820> need<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.240> play

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
the number of clicks you need to play

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.250 
the number of clicks you need to play
the<00:03:36.290> songs<00:03:36.500> just<00:03:37.150> one<00:03:38.150> click<00:03:38.420> then<00:03:38.930> three

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
the songs just one click then three

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.860 
the songs just one click then three
three<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:39.920> on<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:40.310> forth<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:41.240> in

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
three and so on and so forth and in

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.120 
three and so on and so forth and in
between<00:03:41.990> each<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.320> these<00:03:42.530> no<00:03:42.680> blocks<00:03:42.950> are

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
between each of these no blocks are

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.480 
between each of these no blocks are
repeaters<00:03:43.490> each<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:44.330> three<00:03:44.810> ticks<00:03:45.020> of<00:03:45.170> delay

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
repeaters each on three ticks of delay

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.400 
repeaters each on three ticks of delay
and<00:03:46.490> then<00:03:47.030> this<00:03:47.390> is<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.570> first<00:03:47.720> row<00:03:47.960> ends<00:03:48.290> at

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
and then this is the first row ends at

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.960 
and then this is the first row ends at
the<00:03:48.620> note<00:03:48.860> block<00:03:49.010> with<00:03:49.160> seven<00:03:49.430> clicks<00:03:49.670> then

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
the note block with seven clicks then

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.890 
the note block with seven clicks then
continues<00:03:50.480> on<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:52.100> eight<00:03:52.250> clicks<00:03:52.900> and

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
continues on to the eight clicks and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.530 
continues on to the eight clicks and
continues<00:03:54.860> down<00:03:55.070> also<00:03:55.790> with<00:03:56.090> three<00:03:56.180> ticks<00:03:56.420> of

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
continues down also with three ticks of

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.390 
continues down also with three ticks of
delay<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.410> can<00:03:57.560> just<00:03:57.740> pause<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.160> video

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
delay you can just pause the video

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.510 
delay you can just pause the video

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
blocks two ticks again this time is just

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.780 
blocks two ticks again this time is just
a<00:04:15.320> repeater<00:04:15.620> down<00:04:15.830> don't<00:04:16.310> have<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.460> click<00:04:16.640> on

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
to get the different sounds it's mostly

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.130 
to get the different sounds it's mostly
using<00:04:30.080> dirt<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.790> wooden<00:04:31.790> planks<00:04:32.210> whenever

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
a wooden plank and then the rest of its

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.900 
a wooden plank and then the rest of its
on<00:04:46.610> dirt<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.410> yeah<00:04:48.650> that's<00:04:48.830> it's<00:04:49.550> really<00:04:49.760> easy
