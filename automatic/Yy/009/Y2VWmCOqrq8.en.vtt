feature you probably notice that there's

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.910 
feature you probably notice that there's
a<00:02:15.580> bit<00:02:15.700> more<00:02:15.880> detail<00:02:16.300> on<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.780> face<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.470> your

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
half hours now the way that works is

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.930 
half hours now the way that works is
where<00:02:40.240> your<00:02:40.480> your<00:02:41.380> our<00:02:41.560> counter<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.640> whether

the second half hour of your dive and
what<00:02:51.040> are<00:02:51.130> some<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.430> other<00:02:51.550> safety

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
what are some of the other safety

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.120 
what are some of the other safety
features<00:02:52.270> that<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:52.570> got<00:02:52.810> well<00:02:53.740> they've

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
features that it's got well they've

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.180 
features that it's got well they've
designed<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.880> new<00:02:55.440> rotating<00:02:56.440> bezel<00:02:56.620> system

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
designed a new rotating bezel system

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.540 
designed a new rotating bezel system
that<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:58.270> going<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.720> be<00:02:58.840> safer<00:02:59.260> you<00:03:00.220> actually

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
that is going to be safer you actually

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.380 
that is going to be safer you actually
have<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.940> lift<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.750> rubber<00:03:02.410> ring<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.970> turn<00:03:04.209> it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
have to lift the rubber ring to turn it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.960 
have to lift the rubber ring to turn it
and<00:03:04.510> then<00:03:04.600> lock<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.050> back<00:03:05.170> down<00:03:05.440> again

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
and then lock it back down again

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.610 
and then lock it back down again
the<00:03:06.970> bezel<00:03:07.180> itself<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.050> beautiful<00:03:08.230> design

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
the bezel itself is a beautiful design

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.210 
the bezel itself is a beautiful design
its<00:03:09.660> ceramic<00:03:10.660> what's<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.440> first<00:03:11.620> one<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
its ceramic what's the first one the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.860 
its ceramic what's the first one the
first<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:12.880> going<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.209> ceramic<00:03:13.510> here

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
first one is going to be ceramic here

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.229 
first one is going to be ceramic here
and<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.200> think<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:15.040> really<00:03:15.220> going<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.459> be<00:03:15.520> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
and I think it's really going to be the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.630 
and I think it's really going to be the
way<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.630> future<00:03:16.980> also<00:03:17.980> even<00:03:18.400> though<00:03:18.489> we

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
way of the future also even though we

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.580 
way of the future also even though we
haven't<00:03:18.850> seen<00:03:19.030> actual<00:03:19.600> watch<00:03:19.900> yet<00:03:20.320> just

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
haven't seen actual watch yet just

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.920 
haven't seen actual watch yet just
looking<00:03:20.890> at<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.100> brochure<00:03:21.520> here<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.480> design

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
looking at this brochure here the design

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.930 
looking at this brochure here the design
and<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.410> detail<00:03:23.890> on<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.310> bezel<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.820> look

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and the detail on the bezel just look

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.930 
and the detail on the bezel just look
fantastic<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.959> stemming<00:03:26.920> from<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.700> fact

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
fantastic and stemming from the fact

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.840 
fantastic and stemming from the fact
that<00:03:28.030> all<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.360> other<00:03:28.980> thousand<00:03:29.980> meter<00:03:30.160> rated

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
that all the other thousand meter rated

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.910 
that all the other thousand meter rated
divers<00:03:31.810> tend<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.110> have<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.350> helium<00:03:32.650> release

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
divers tend to have the helium release

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.009 
divers tend to have the helium release
valve<00:03:33.250> there<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.239> a<00:03:34.269> slight<00:03:34.510> difference<00:03:34.660> with

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
valve there is a slight difference with

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.420 
valve there is a slight difference with
this<00:03:35.110> one<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.530> now<00:03:35.769> what<00:03:35.950> at<00:03:36.040> this<00:03:36.130> meeting

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
this one and now what at this meeting

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.190 
this one and now what at this meeting
it's<00:03:36.910> got<00:03:37.090> an<00:03:37.180> automatic<00:03:37.420> healing<00:03:37.959> release

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
it's got an automatic healing release

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.580 
it's got an automatic healing release
