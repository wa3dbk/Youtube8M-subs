Hi I'm Jamie Miller and today I'm
making a fresh and flavorful summer

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.430
salad--marinated

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.480
cherry tomatoes. I start by pouring some
EVOO, extra virgin olive oil,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.980
in a large bowl. A quarter of a cup should do
it for today's recipe.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.560
I've got some white wine vinegar. We're
gonna make it

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.449
really delicious marinade here. And next I'm gonna
add a little bit of sugar to really

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.990
help those tomatoes along

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.990
and a little bit of salt. Alright I'm just gonna whisk that together.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.760
I'm also mixing in a bunch of fresh herbs. I've
got some flat leaf parsley

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.890
and then you can really choose any herbs
you like. Today I'm going with some

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.390
minced up fresh thyme

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.370
and oregano. I'm gonna go ahead and
chop up some nice

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.539
fresh oregano. You can also try rosemary,

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.059
basil, or marjoram in this recipe. They'd all
be delicious

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.340
Mm, smells fantastic already.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.380
Alright that is looking good and smelling
fantastic.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.380
Go ahead and add it to the mix. Now a few
more ingredients.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.590
I've got some sliced up green onion.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.680
Just one green onion will do ya. A little bit of

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.780
nice fragrant garlic and some freshly
ground pepper.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.900
And that is all we need for our marinade. 
Wisk that all together really well

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.140
and then we can add our tomatoes.  Alright so we 
just need to slice them in half,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.520
either way is fine and then we toss em
right in that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.100
lovely marinade. I've got a nice big
bowl of them here ready to go.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.210
We're just gonna toss those in so
they're all just

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.090
going in the bowl and then we're gonna give them a good stir.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.560
At this point you wanna let them sit at
room temperature and marinate for only

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
about 30 minutes, but you certainly could
go a little bit longer.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.050
You can serve the tomatoes atop a bed a
greens for a gorgeous summer salad.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.069
Or spoon them atop crusty grilled
bread for a terrific summer appetizer.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.579
You can easily grow your own Bonnie
cherry tomatoes to prepare this recipe.

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.769
Plant your tomato in a raised bed

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.769
are large container filled with good
quality potting soil and

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.890
where it gets good sun. To plant, remove
the label and gently tear away the bottom of the pot.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.450
You can cut off the lower leaves just to
make it easier to handle the plant.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.609
The plant will grow fine with or without
cutting off the leaves.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.150
Plant the tomato so that two-thirds of the
plant is buried.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.230
The buried stem sprouts roots to make
the plant stronger.
