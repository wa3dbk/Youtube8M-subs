all right so today we're going to

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.809 
all right so today we're going to
measure<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:03.620> thrust<00:00:04.620> washer<00:00:04.770> play<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.609> the

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819

crank it's part of my resto I'm trying
to<00:00:08.250> figure<00:00:08.400> out<00:00:08.519> if<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.849> need<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:10.460> start

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
to figure out if I need to start

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.850 
to figure out if I need to start
checking<00:00:11.610> out<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.840> bottom<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.349> block<00:00:13.590> and

checking out the bottom of the block and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.919 
checking out the bottom of the block and
the<00:00:13.950> crank<00:00:14.790> bearings<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.360> stuff<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:15.690> that

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
the crank bearings and stuff like that

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.390 
the crank bearings and stuff like that
one<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.350> main<00:00:16.500> things<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.920> tier<00:00:17.130> six

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
one of the main things on the tier six

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.359 
one of the main things on the tier six
is<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:19.199> rear<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.529> there's<00:00:19.740> two<00:00:19.890> rear<00:00:20.070> thrust

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
is the rear if there's two rear thrust

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
is the rear if there's two rear thrust
washers<00:00:20.789> at<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> end<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.570> crank<00:00:21.840> they

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
washers at the end of the crank they

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.170 
washers at the end of the crank they
start<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> wear<00:00:22.590> out<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.949> spec<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.730> four<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
start to wear out and spec is four to

start to wear out and spec is four to
eight<00:00:24.300> thousandths<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.980> I've<00:00:26.250> got<00:00:26.430> myself<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:42.319 

dial<00:00:30.660> indicator<00:00:35.690> set<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.820> end<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
dial indicator set up on the end of the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
dial indicator set up on the end of the
fan<00:00:42.570> pulley<00:00:46.280> here<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:55.219> today<00:00:58.850> I've<00:00:59.850> got<00:00:59.910> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
fan pulley here and today I've got it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.650 
fan pulley here and today I've got it
just<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:00.870> zero<00:01:00.930> down<00:01:01.559> zero<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.910> out<00:01:03.030> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
just about zero down zero it out then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.820 
just about zero down zero it out then
we'll<00:01:04.670> press<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> clutch<00:01:06.320> I've<00:01:07.320> pushed<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
we'll press on the clutch I've pushed it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.050 
we'll press on the clutch I've pushed it
all<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:09.229> big<00:01:10.229> screwdriver

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
all the way back with a big screwdriver

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.330 
all the way back with a big screwdriver
levered<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> against<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.100> zero<00:01:14.100> here

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
levered it against this zero here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
levered it against this zero here
leverage<00:01:15.030> against<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> crossmember<00:01:16.229> goes

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
leverage against the crossmember goes

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.370 
leverage against the crossmember goes
right<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.900> pushes<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.870 

crank<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.770> back<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.670> I'll

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
crank all the way back and then I'll

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
crank all the way back and then I'll
press<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.600> clutch<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> we'll<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:25.320> how

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
press in the clutch and we'll see how

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.960 
press in the clutch and we'll see how
far<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.800> comes<00:01:26.010> forward<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> won't<00:01:29.610> try<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
far it comes forward so I won't try and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.390 
far it comes forward so I won't try and
do<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.600> hand<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.470> I'll<00:01:31.619> zero<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
do this with one hand but I'll zero that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.450 
do this with one hand but I'll zero that
out<00:01:33.619> actually<00:01:34.619> can't<00:01:34.830> it's<00:01:34.920> too<00:01:34.950> hard

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
out actually can't it's too hard

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.630 
out actually can't it's too hard
I'll<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.660> then<00:01:36.810> we'll<00:01:37.640> press

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
I'll do that out and then we'll press

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
I'll do that out and then we'll press
the<00:01:38.820> clutch<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.509> we'll<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.780> how<00:01:40.560> good

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the clutch and then we'll see how good

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
the clutch and then we'll see how good
we<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:42.950> all<00:01:43.950> right<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:45.300> don't<00:01:45.330> think<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
we got all right so I don't think it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.440 
we got all right so I don't think it
tell<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:45.990> too<00:01:46.020> bright<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.180> can<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.300> it's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
tell it's too bright you can see it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.389 
tell it's too bright you can see it's
zeroed<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.290> there

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:02:05.900 

so<00:01:53.399> we'll<00:01:53.550> go<00:01:53.640> press<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.880> clutch<00:02:04.429> one<00:02:05.429> solid

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
so we'll go press the clutch one solid

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:16.520 
so we'll go press the clutch one solid
press<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> way<00:02:06.539> before<00:02:13.970> where<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.530> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
press all the way before where we at and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.650 
press all the way before where we at and
it<00:02:16.650> says<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.550> at<00:02:17.910> eleven<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.680> quarter

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
it says it is at eleven and a quarter

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:29.990 
it says it is at eleven and a quarter
you<00:02:21.660> can<00:02:21.690> see<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:23.600> see<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:26.780> bet<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.880> it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you can see it see I bet that so it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.259 
you can see it see I bet that so it's
perpendicular<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:31.049> end<00:02:31.230> crank<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:33.150> I'll

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
perpendicular to the end crank so I'll

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.120 
perpendicular to the end crank so I'll
repeat<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.380> already<00:02:34.799> did<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.100> once

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
repeat that but I already did it once

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.440 
repeat that but I already did it once
before<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.730> was<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.329> twelve<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.329> four<00:02:39.329> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
before it was like twelve so four to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.810 
before it was like twelve so four to
eight<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:40.010> acceptable<00:02:41.010> spec<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.640> little

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
eight is acceptable spec it's a little

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.390 
eight is acceptable spec it's a little
on<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:41.940> high<00:02:42.150> end<00:02:42.530> chord<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.769> forms<00:02:44.130> and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
on the high end chord all the forms and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.240 
on the high end chord all the forms and
looks<00:02:45.150> like<00:02:45.260> I've<00:02:46.260> got<00:02:46.320> thrust<00:02:46.709> washers<00:02:47.070> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
looks like I've got thrust washers to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
looks like I've got thrust washers to

is<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.620> setup<00:03:04.130> ease<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.520> got<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> dial<00:03:05.000> indicator

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
is the setup ease I got a dial indicator

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.920 
is the setup ease I got a dial indicator
the<00:03:06.860> magnetic<00:03:07.310> stand<00:03:07.550> apart<00:03:07.850> from<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.540> bottom

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
the magnetic stand apart from the bottom

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.200 
the magnetic stand apart from the bottom
but<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.320> apart<00:03:09.710> from<00:03:09.950> work<00:03:10.630> does<00:03:12.970> five<00:03:13.970> ten

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
but this apart from work does five ten

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.110 
but this apart from work does five ten
thousand<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:14.990> half<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.320> thousand<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:16.880> just<00:03:17.000> got

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
thousand so half a thousand you just got

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.840 
thousand so half a thousand you just got
to<00:03:17.210> make<00:03:17.300> sure<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:19.160> perpendicular<00:03:19.490> to

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
to make sure it it's perpendicular to

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.100 
to make sure it it's perpendicular to
the<00:03:20.090> axis<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:21.740> crank
