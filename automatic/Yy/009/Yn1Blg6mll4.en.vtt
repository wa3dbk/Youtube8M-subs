00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.219
 hello to all and all these captain 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.410
 brackmard today we end up 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.369
 for the little video just before taste of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.380
 time in fact because simply 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.869
 I was taken as I did not want 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.080
 holder but hey I had to go there 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.609
 So expect the sudden I'll play 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 as I was if I held brief 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.769
 so we're going to do that like we're going to do that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.910
 suddenly and saw that since it was missing 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.530
 some christophe I spent a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.320
 excellent evening yesterday to make me ch is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.840
 totally to prepare all the stuff 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 so that was great so I have to 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.090
 pretty much everything see everything i'm going to you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.129
 show it quickly do we go dad will not go 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 not detail any more because purpose 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.719
 it's not about making a video of 15 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.760
 minutes but we will quickly see that 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.850
 I just have a doubt is what is this 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.239
 that I possibly have a cat cat 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.049
 perfect angora here we will do like 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.090
 that's why I have a calypso dofus 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.890
 is useless we will put a little 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.420
 trophy 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:16.439
 that's him I like him and then no 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.259
 to do that perfect perfect very very well 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.280
 and the cac 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.530
 I'm going to put that we'll do like that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.580
 and then we'll go see what it's like 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.640
 so this is a mode that I like 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.040
 well it's a pretty fun enough mode 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.659
 on the other hand, do I tackle no I 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.890
 not good, it's a pity I did not have to 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.950
 unfortunately this year I have 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 did not have time to buy one and I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.270
 failed to lend 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.409
 too bad too bad too bad then 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.790
 what I wanted to do yes good bah one 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.189
 will shift giant will go right away 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.479
 then we 'll see how it goes 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.280
 level of spells a high level of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.079
 damage you go out so it's gone 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.950
 the shortcut hop it gives at least 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.920
 500 practically panda tac to the face 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.000
 explosive it's pretty nice too 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.880
 you see light a game can ride 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.720
 up to minus 560 while there is the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.709
 place that can go up to 500 45 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.050
 so it's not too bad I like it 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.600
 this mode the flamiches it gives 2 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.350
 maximum sixty five years old 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.090
 what can we look at other 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.300
 possibly a diack shot that can 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.720
 go up to 1028 so that's 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.010
 interesting also from the side of the wave to 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.110
 the soul is still practically 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.240
 700 maximum so that's not too much 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.890
 badly I like it when I go so 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.160
 in mode is the choice is not 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.170
 possibly with a little a little 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.080
 purpose but before I can do is is it 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.640
 all the same at almost six years old 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.310
 I can make points flame is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.840
 like virtually 500 so the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.230
 the element I type the best it stays 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.480
 still lucky here look at me 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.170
 these flamiche 350 the flamiche rather 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.660
 interesting is going to say and here it is 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.890
 I almost show you this mode 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.110
 which is for me not too bad we will see 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.300
 resistances so wait I have my 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.210
 debut that's so the resistors are 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.690
 without it so it gives fifteen 15 25 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:20.160
 10 18 which makes that under picolant cc 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.230
 I'm practically 50 everywhere my 45 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.510
 everywhere we are going to say so it stays that 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.280
 stay not too bad I like it 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.560
 so this is the mode for me it's 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.640
 interesting to play 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.660
 what am I going to do yes we are going 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.350
 show another staff who will have to 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.520
 that I do not do that because I 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.520
 did not put in fast equipment 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.520
 here we are 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.670
 wait I lose myself ppm veil 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:08.569
 here are qt boots 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:12.590
 I have that pasta graft then 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:16.850
 trophy we'll put a clever at the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:24.039
 place of the mighty a scholar instead 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.039
 purple and the ddg will give way to 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:31.780
 since I can put a magnet on the ground 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.570
 like that and and an arc 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.889
 you guessed it a bow and ips is 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.240
 gone then what does it give 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.150
 I have to create a fast equipment because 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.650
 that I have more fashion we will put in 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.080
 the r here is the mode where he is in 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:52.340
 fire mode and fire mode and the moors 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:57.740
 the normal r mode it's gone the fire mode 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.199
 he's here I said he was there and 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.830
 it's gone then in truth their age 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:06.139
 it's his race to see what it gives 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.520
 my damage is practically 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.780
 as final as the late author but 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.169
 it's not for the damage gets stuff 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.539
 it is especially for the support of 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.880
 resistance to these is good in 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:23.949
 practically 25 everywhere except earth 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.949
 so I like it here it's gone 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.030
 I think it's about to go 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.080
 to test 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.199
 So here it gives small blows of 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.719
 cool guys for the mine pretty much to 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.120
 every time so I like that's it 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:45.300
 my mode and sees the 1000 to 1200 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.759
 building so it's very nice and more 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.319
 I tackle it's beautiful good I'm going I'm going 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.020
 very quickly to finish it because I have not 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:55.909
 want to spend my life 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.909
 go hop 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.020
 this is going to putching ball have tarnished 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.690
 more than four what the focus it should the 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.370
 do I go out that dg 475 or that's me 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.199
 so six years and it's still a 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.150
 it's not too bad, I like it 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.039
 so that's the fire mode after I have a 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.099
 fashion to leap the modo you know 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:30.590
 it is among others moma pvm but at 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.419
 little pvp we will say and then I have to 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.340
 what to do 40 billion stuff to little 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.810
 close so that should do it we're going 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.000
 find another happiness in there 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.080
 So here was what was exciting 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.310
 with navin for a little video 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.750
 really present hastily enough 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.919
 quickly modes that I want for the 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.090
 panda in this gotha and then we'll see 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.860
 what that gives in any case at the level 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.330
 teams for the moment we do not know that 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.699
 let's say we do not necessarily get there 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.870
 get along with the others but hey 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:54.949
 it's a little on all the servers here 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.940
 so we find ourselves for other videos 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:57.199
 please put a vest 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.699
 comment if you do not hesitate 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.930
 not to subscribe to pursue more 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:02.449
 easily but video we end up 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.659
 so on the server gut has among others to 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.659
 more
