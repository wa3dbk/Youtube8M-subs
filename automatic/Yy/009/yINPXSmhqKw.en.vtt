hi<00:00:11.300> I<00:00:54.260> got<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> fushigi<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.120> lose<00:00:57.120> Iggy<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
hi I got a fushigi to lose Iggy the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.560 
hi I got a fushigi to lose Iggy the
vines<00:00:58.109> gravity<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.270> just<00:01:00.270> don't<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.480> how<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
vines gravity I just don't know how to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.389 
vines gravity I just don't know how to
use<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> does<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> look<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:02.070> cool<00:01:02.219> right

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
use it does it look really cool right

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
use it does it look really cool right
now<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:03.449> does<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> look<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.170> like

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
now like does it look like I'm like

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.020 
now like does it look like I'm like
totally<00:01:04.619> defying<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> laws<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> gravity

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
totally defying the laws of gravity

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.520 
totally defying the laws of gravity
because<00:01:06.299> i'm<00:01:06.450> really<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.260> actually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
because i'm really not it's actually

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.450 
because i'm really not it's actually
just<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.860> big<00:01:08.760> plastic<00:01:09.090> ball<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.720> nothing<00:01:10.110> just

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
just a big plastic ball of nothing just

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
just a big plastic ball of nothing just
kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.229> mean<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> looks<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.890> I'm

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
kind of I mean if it looks like I'm

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.200 
kind of I mean if it looks like I'm
actually<00:01:14.189> doing<00:01:14.460> something<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.090> that's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
actually doing something and that's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
actually doing something and that's
pretty<00:01:15.330> cool<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.860> because<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.040> like

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pretty cool you know because it's like

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.810 
pretty cool you know because it's like
the<00:01:20.220> antigravity<00:01:20.840> through<00:01:21.840> bull<00:01:22.439> crap<00:01:24.229> that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
the antigravity through bull crap that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.410 
the antigravity through bull crap that
like<00:01:29.479> totally<00:01:30.479> defying<00:01:31.079> laws<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.770> gravity

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
like totally defying laws of gravity

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.899 
like totally defying laws of gravity
with<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.630> fushigi<00:01:34.640> because<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.759> actually

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
with my fushigi because I actually

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.210 
with my fushigi because I actually
didn't<00:01:36.360> read<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> manual<00:01:37.049> even<00:01:38.040> though<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
said it won't work unless I use the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.230 
said it won't work unless I use the
manual<00:01:39.890> kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.979> having<00:01:41.159> fun<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.549> doing
