00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.300 

now<00:00:01.020> we<00:00:01.079> want<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.439> change<00:00:01.680> their<00:00:01.920> scale<00:00:02.389> so

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
now we want to change their scale so

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.360 
now we want to change their scale so
we'll<00:00:05.310> create<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:06.210> vector<00:00:07.049> since<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:08.069> dealing

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
we'll create a vector since it's dealing

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.000 
we'll create a vector since it's dealing
with<00:00:08.550> XY<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.150> Z<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.170> need<00:00:10.410> three<00:00:10.800> pieces

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
with XY and Z so you need three pieces

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:24.859 
with XY and Z so you need three pieces
of<00:00:11.219> data<00:00:12.710> for<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:21.170> okay<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:23.570> we're<00:00:24.570> gonna<00:00:24.720> do

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
of data for that okay so we're gonna do

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.470 
of data for that okay so we're gonna do
the<00:00:24.990> same<00:00:25.289> sort<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> thing<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:27.000> did<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the same sort of thing as we did for the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.370 
the same sort of thing as we did for the
custom<00:00:27.840> index<00:00:28.170> however<00:00:29.929> there's<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.019> more

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
custom index however there's one more

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.930 
custom index however there's one more
step<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.859> need<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.719> if<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.960> were<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.940> just

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
step we need to do if we were to just

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.160 
step we need to do if we were to just
type<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.480> out<00:00:38.120> copy<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.540> here

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.920 

and<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.890> vector<00:00:44.270> we've<00:00:45.270> seen<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.809> know

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and it's a vector we've seen you know

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:59.889 
and it's a vector we've seen you know
what<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:48.920> if<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.370> ask<00:00:52.219> if<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.340> did<00:00:53.520> this

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.440 

it's<00:01:00.899> gonna<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.380> a<00:01:01.620> random<00:01:01.950> number<00:01:02.130> for<00:01:02.640> XY<00:01:03.270> &amp;

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
it's gonna get a random number for XY &amp;

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.729 
it's gonna get a random number for XY &amp;
z<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.900> different<00:01:04.260> from<00:01:04.409> each<00:01:04.589> other

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
z that are different from each other

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.670 
z that are different from each other
like<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.280> 1<00:01:05.670> 2<00:01:06.030> &amp;<00:01:06.240> 3<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:07.020> shapes<00:01:07.260> gonna<00:01:07.530> be

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
like so 1 2 &amp; 3 so your shapes gonna be

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.399 
like so 1 2 &amp; 3 so your shapes gonna be
distorted<00:01:08.360> if<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.510> want<00:01:09.690> it<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> scaled

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
distorted if you want it to be scaled

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.960 
distorted if you want it to be scaled
uniformly<00:01:11.210> first<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.630> declare<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
uniformly first you have to declare a

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.080 
uniformly first you have to declare a
float<00:01:14.970> variable<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> we're<00:01:17.610> gonna<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:17.910> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
float variable and we're gonna use that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.710 
float variable and we're gonna use that
one<00:01:18.150> float<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.440> generates<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:21.000> birth<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> then

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
one float it generates at birth and then

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.430 
one float it generates at birth and then
we're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.800> plug<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.190> in<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> we'll

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
we're going to plug it in here so we'll

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.840 
we're going to plug it in here so we'll
call<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:27.259> scale<00:01:28.259> them

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:41.260 

equals<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:34.700> random<00:01:35.700> value<00:01:35.910> B<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:38.149> point<00:01:39.149> two<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
equals a random value B to point two and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.040 
equals a random value B to point two and
four<00:01:42.740> straight<00:01:43.740> exam<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.990> just

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
four straight exam so then we can just

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:58.390 
four straight exam so then we can just
take<00:01:49.440> this<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:53.250> paste<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.000> here

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:19.660 

I<00:01:58.490> tried<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.240> copy<00:01:59.480> it<00:01:59.720> again

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.790 

all<00:02:20.670> right<00:02:20.849> we<00:02:21.629> got<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> syntax<00:02:22.140> here<00:02:24.769> let<00:02:25.769> me

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
all right we got a syntax here let me

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.660 
all right we got a syntax here let me
put<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.580> dollar<00:02:26.819> sign

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.970 

okay<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.300> after<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.990> get<00:02:33.140> our<00:02:33.290> expressions

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
okay so after we get our expressions

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.460 
okay so after we get our expressions
written<00:02:34.610> we're<00:02:35.330> gonna<00:02:35.540> go<00:02:35.810> up<00:02:35.959> here<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.440> our

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
written we're gonna go up here to our

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.949 
written we're gonna go up here to our
particle<00:02:37.100> again<00:02:37.640> under<00:02:38.150> our<00:02:38.420> instance<00:02:38.990> or<00:02:39.170> tab

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
particle again under our instance or tab

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.320 
particle again under our instance or tab
and<00:02:41.959> set<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> scale<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:43.090> custom<00:02:44.090> scale<00:02:46.330> now

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
and set the scale to custom scale now

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.510 
and set the scale to custom scale now
when<00:02:47.600> we<00:02:47.750> play<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.170> everything<00:02:48.920> has<00:02:49.220> a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
when we play it everything has a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.010 
when we play it everything has a
different<00:02:50.060> scale

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
different scale

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.100 
different scale
here's<00:02:52.010> two<00:02:52.340> Tauruses<00:02:53.860> different<00:02:54.860> scale
