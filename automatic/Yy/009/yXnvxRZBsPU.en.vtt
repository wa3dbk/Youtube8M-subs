the grass from coming through and then

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.350 
the grass from coming through and then
I've<00:01:47.560> got<00:01:47.590> my<00:01:47.830> horse<00:01:48.130> manure<00:01:48.369> on<00:01:48.550> top<00:01:48.910> I<00:01:49.119> didn't

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
nice little layer of horse manure to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.749 
nice little layer of horse manure to
bring<00:01:53.410> in<00:01:53.560> some<00:01:53.830> beneficial<00:01:54.280> microorganisms

bring in some beneficial microorganisms

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.199 
bring in some beneficial microorganisms
and<00:01:55.690> some<00:01:55.989> you<00:01:56.709> know<00:01:56.739> nitrogen<00:01:57.429> and<00:01:57.580> nutrients

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
week I'll have a finished sheet mulch to

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.380

show you and I'll show you the whole
thing<00:02:07.450> then<00:02:09.360> other<00:02:10.360> than<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.989> guess<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
thing then other than that I guess the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960 
thing then other than that I guess the
one<00:02:11.680> thing<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.190> making<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.610> garden

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
one thing that is making this garden

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.630 
one thing that is making this garden
less<00:02:13.690> beautiful<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.409> I<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:14.920> have<00:02:15.219> to<00:02:15.340> put<00:02:15.519> up

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
less beautiful is I do have to put up

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.970 
less beautiful is I do have to put up
something<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.030> keep<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.510> bunny<00:02:17.379> rabbits<00:02:17.829> out

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
something to keep the bunny rabbits out

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.500 
something to keep the bunny rabbits out
because<00:02:18.189> they<00:02:18.310> like<00:02:18.489> vegetables<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.329> as

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
because they like vegetables just as

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.190 
because they like vegetables just as
much<00:02:19.629> as<00:02:19.840> me

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
much as me

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.040 
much as me
I<00:02:20.230> was<00:02:20.410> saying<00:02:20.620> yesterday<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.280> blog<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.690> I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
I was saying yesterday in the blog so I

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.990 
I was saying yesterday in the blog so I
haven't<00:02:23.680> secured<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.220> thing<00:02:24.519> yet<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:24.910> I've

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
haven't secured this thing yet but I've

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.210 
haven't secured this thing yet but I've
roughed<00:02:25.300> in<00:02:25.510> some<00:02:25.930> bamboo<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.739> some<00:02:26.920> chicken

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
roughed in some bamboo and some chicken

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.759 
roughed in some bamboo and some chicken
wire<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:28.300> fairly<00:02:28.629> unobtrusive<00:02:29.080> it's

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
wire and it's fairly unobtrusive it's

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.979 
wire and it's fairly unobtrusive it's
only<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.220> couple<00:02:30.610> feet<00:02:30.910> tall<00:02:31.120> which<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.450> found<00:02:31.720> in

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
only a couple feet tall which I found in

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.780 
only a couple feet tall which I found in
the<00:02:32.080> past<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.560> all<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.890> really<00:02:33.340> need<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.610> keep

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the past is all I really need to keep

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.050 
the past is all I really need to keep
rabbits<00:02:34.239> out<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:36.400> that's<00:02:36.550> really<00:02:36.760> all<00:02:36.849> I<00:02:36.970> have

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
rabbits out and that's really all I have

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.600 
rabbits out and that's really all I have
today<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.720> guess<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.380> also<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.830> the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
today I guess you can also see that the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.120 
today I guess you can also see that the
lawn<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:40.060> loaded<00:02:40.569> with<00:02:40.599> dandelions<00:02:41.319> you<00:02:42.040> know

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
lawn is loaded with dandelions you know

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.610 
lawn is loaded with dandelions you know
this<00:02:42.819> is<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> rural<00:02:43.750> setting<00:02:43.959> out<00:02:44.200> here<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.590> we

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
this is a rural setting out here so we

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.960 
this is a rural setting out here so we
don't<00:02:44.800> really<00:02:44.980> tend<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> worry<00:02:45.459> about<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.819> we

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
don't really tend to worry about it we

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.350 
don't really tend to worry about it we
eat<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.780> dandelion<00:02:47.319> greens<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.190> it's<00:02:48.880> fine

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
eat the dandelion greens and it's fine

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.360 
eat the dandelion greens and it's fine
but<00:02:49.629> probably<00:02:50.349> at<00:02:50.560> some<00:02:50.739> point<00:02:50.980> this<00:02:51.099> year<00:02:51.160> I

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
but probably at some point this year I

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.720 
but probably at some point this year I
will<00:02:51.580> take<00:02:51.879> a<00:02:51.910> section<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.430> show<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.489> how<00:02:54.670> to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
will take a section and show you how to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.559 
will take a section and show you how to
get<00:02:54.910> rid<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.150> those<00:02:55.620> organically<00:02:57.569> without

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
get rid of those organically without

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.850 
get rid of those organically without
digging<00:02:59.019> them<00:02:59.260> all<00:02:59.380> out<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:01.650> yeah<00:03:02.650> that's

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
digging them all out so yeah that's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.110

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
hopefully I'll put some lessons together

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.009 
hopefully I'll put some lessons together
as<00:03:07.120> soon<00:03:07.239> as<00:03:07.360> I'm<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.510> little<00:03:07.750> bit<00:03:07.840> less

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
as soon as I'm a little bit less

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.800 
as soon as I'm a little bit less
overwhelmed<00:03:08.590> with<00:03:08.680> this<00:03:08.860> project<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.750> know

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
overwhelmed with this project you know

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.910 
overwhelmed with this project you know
putting<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.230> vegetable<00:03:11.380> garden<00:03:11.620> isn't

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
putting it a vegetable garden isn't

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.289 
putting it a vegetable garden isn't
really<00:03:12.250> not<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.489> big<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.700> deal<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.269> a

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
really not that big a deal and this is a

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.819 
really not that big a deal and this is a
pretty<00:03:13.540> small<00:03:13.660> vegetable<00:03:14.019> garden<00:03:14.500> I've<00:03:14.590> kept

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
pretty small vegetable garden I've kept

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.690 
pretty small vegetable garden I've kept
it<00:03:14.950> small<00:03:15.069> because<00:03:16.739> because<00:03:17.739> basically<00:03:17.950> that

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
it small because because basically that

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.430 
it small because because basically that
I'm<00:03:18.940> learning<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:19.569> about<00:03:19.810> ten<00:03:20.049> percent<00:03:20.200> of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
I'm learning that's about ten percent of

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.289 
I'm learning that's about ten percent of
the<00:03:20.500> process<00:03:20.920> here<00:03:21.250> because<00:03:21.819> what<00:03:21.970> I'm<00:03:22.030> doing

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
the process here because what I'm doing

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.360 
the process here because what I'm doing
is<00:03:22.390> everything<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:22.989> I'm<00:03:23.530> putting<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.220> on

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
is everything I do I'm putting it on

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.789 
is everything I do I'm putting it on

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.099 
video and I'm writing an article and so
it's<00:03:26.980> really<00:03:27.609> a<00:03:27.760> lot<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:28.030> work<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.660> thought

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
it's really a lot of work so I thought

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.809 
it's really a lot of work so I thought
just<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.590> year<00:03:29.620> I'll<00:03:29.980> keep<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.340> garden

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
just this year I'll keep the garden

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.220 
just this year I'll keep the garden
small<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.299> manageable<00:03:31.389> so<00:03:31.870> i<00:03:31.930> can<00:03:32.079> really

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
small and manageable so i can really

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.729 
small and manageable so i can really
focusing<00:03:32.680> on<00:03:32.799> focus<00:03:33.190> on<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.700> teaching<00:03:34.739> so

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
focusing on focus on the teaching so
