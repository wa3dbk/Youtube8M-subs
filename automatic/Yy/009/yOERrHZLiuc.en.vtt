00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.110 
anyway uh I bets here's a picture of my
phone<00:00:39.559> then<00:00:39.829> when<00:00:40.040> I<00:00:40.070> was<00:00:40.430> finished<00:00:40.790> with<00:00:40.940> it

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
phone then when I was finished with it

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.930 
phone then when I was finished with it
and<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:42.320> took<00:00:42.379> a<00:00:42.739> selfie<00:00:43.219> and<00:00:43.460> put<00:00:43.730> it<00:00:43.850> on

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
and I took a selfie and put it on

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.119 
and I took a selfie and put it on
Instagram<00:00:44.210> because<00:00:44.750> that's<00:00:45.199> just<00:00:45.500> how<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:45.680> roll

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
Instagram because that's just how I roll

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.849 
Instagram because that's just how I roll
and<00:00:46.820> I<00:00:47.719> personally<00:00:48.199> think<00:00:48.320> that<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.559> rainbow

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
and I personally think that the rainbow

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.470 
and I personally think that the rainbow
looks<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.250> best<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:49.850> some<00:00:50.059> people<00:00:50.300> just

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
looks the best but some people just

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.049 
looks the best but some people just
choose<00:00:50.660> one<00:00:50.960> color<00:00:51.579> some<00:00:52.579> people<00:00:52.820> choose<00:00:53.000> a

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
to want to do is make sure that all of

I've got a lot of glass and there so I'm

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:34.900 
I've got a lot of glass and there so I'm
really<00:01:33.920> glad<00:01:34.009> that<00:01:34.099> I<00:01:34.280> did<00:01:34.459> that<00:01:34.610> because<00:01:34.759> I

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
really glad that I did that because I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.190 
really glad that I did that because I
would<00:01:35.090> have<00:01:35.300> ended<00:01:35.539> up<00:01:35.750> cutting<00:01:35.989> myself

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
would have ended up cutting myself

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.010 
would have ended up cutting myself
eventually<00:01:36.679> if<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.580> hadn't<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.690> way<00:01:38.869> it

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
eventually if I hadn't now the way it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.630 
eventually if I hadn't now the way it
works<00:01:39.050> is<00:01:39.410> pretty<00:01:39.649> straightforward<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.459> mean

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
works is pretty straightforward I mean

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.040 
works is pretty straightforward I mean
you're<00:01:40.789> using<00:01:40.940> permanent<00:01:41.360> marker<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.780> you're

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
you're using permanent marker and you're

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.529 
you're using permanent marker and you're
wiping<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:42.709> on<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:43.130> your<00:01:43.489> the<00:01:43.759> you<00:01:44.090> know<00:01:44.209> the

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
wiping it on to your the you know the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.050 
wiping it on to your the you know the
back<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> your<00:01:45.080> phone<00:01:45.319> and<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.340> Sharpie<00:01:46.819> is

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
back of your phone and the Sharpie is

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.479 
back of your phone and the Sharpie is
going<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.539> seep<00:01:47.840> into<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.440> cracks<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.160> stay

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:49.489 
going to seep into the cracks and stay

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.969 
going to seep into the cracks and stay
there<00:01:49.670> but<00:01:50.300> obviously<00:01:50.569> I<00:01:50.989> mean<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.619> best<00:01:51.830> way

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
there but obviously I mean the best way

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.669 
there but obviously I mean the best way
to<00:01:52.130> do<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.459> is<00:01:52.610> just<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:53.060> cover<00:01:53.420> all<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:54.560> the

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
to do it is just to cover all of the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:55.990 
to do it is just to cover all of the
portion<00:01:55.039> of<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.280> cracks<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.789> want<00:01:55.940> to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
portion of the cracks that you want to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.449 
portion of the cracks that you want to
do<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.479> smooth<00:01:56.690> parts<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.259> not<00:01:57.500> just<00:01:57.709> you

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
do so the smooth parts to not just you

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.460

do that is just a color all over all of
the<00:02:04.429> parts<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:05.119> cracks<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.569> want<00:02:05.869> to

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
the parts of the cracks that you want to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
stuck into the cracks obviously and then

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.820 
stuck into the cracks obviously and then
it<00:02:42.879> came<00:02:43.090> off<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.599> white<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.530> should<00:02:44.709> do

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
it came off of the white you should do

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.369 
it came off of the white you should do
that<00:02:44.950> pretty<00:02:45.190> much<00:02:45.370> right<00:02:45.610> away<00:02:45.760> just<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:47.260> be

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
that pretty much right away just to be

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.170 
that pretty much right away just to be
sure<00:02:47.410> because<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.830> mean<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.549> gonna<00:02:48.730> wipe<00:02:48.940> off

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180

but<00:02:49.629> the<00:02:50.470> less<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:51.010> more<00:02:51.160> time<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.400> give<00:02:51.549> it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
but the less the more time you give it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.330 
but the less the more time you give it
to<00:02:51.730> dry<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.510> harder<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.019> gonna<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.220> get

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
to dry the harder it is gonna be to get

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.309

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.500 
it off so and then I you know I made the
blue<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.099> green<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> red<00:02:58.269> and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.970 
blue and the green and then the red and
the<00:02:58.900> further<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.290> went<00:02:59.440> down<00:02:59.590> on<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.769> phone

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980
