00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.100
 good afternoon teacher I present the 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.810
 elaboration of my good spartan case 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.780
 for materials we use what is 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.900
 cardboard interest coach that can help 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.480
 hold plaster bandages white paint and 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.100
 metallic paint ducted 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.100
 well we will see the procedure 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.360
 once 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.340
 first the trimmed of the different 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.340
 parts 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.760
 then we move to the middle part 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.109
 armed where it will be seen that the castro has 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.109
 distinguished custom designed 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.330
 then we went to give the injected to 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.760
 seal certain parts and from there we go to 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.360
 try it if all parties close 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.360
 as they should 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.860
 from there we go to the next process that 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.870
 is the adapted similarity to the case 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.150
 original 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.970
 applies and that in different parts 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.590
 to give it a finished medium 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.240
 as you can see the picture is being 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.240
 extending the layer of 10 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.579
 then a layer of 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.940
 liquid plaster so that the mask has 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.310
 a smoother finish 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.240
 after them after that he lay 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.240
 to the white paint layer 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.520
 and at the end it is painted with tuco paint 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.520
 metallic and the finished 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.330
 Y 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.009
 the day
