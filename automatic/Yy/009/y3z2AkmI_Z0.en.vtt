00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
never early got into the gearing stuff

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.069 
never early got into the gearing stuff
alright<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.210> basically<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.780> got<00:00:51.930> here

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
alright so basically what we got here

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.090 
alright so basically what we got here
and<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> case<00:00:53.070> for

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and this is going to be the case for

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.869 
and this is going to be the case for
every<00:00:53.420> electric<00:00:54.829> RC<00:00:55.829> car<00:00:56.039> buggy

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
every electric RC car buggy

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
every electric RC car buggy
it<00:00:57.239> doesn't<00:00:57.600> matter<00:00:57.750> they're<00:00:58.350> all<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.620> to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it doesn't matter they're all going to

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.369 
it doesn't matter they're all going to
have<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> same<00:00:59.449> two<00:01:00.449> gearing's<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> that's

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
have the same two gearing's and that's

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
have the same two gearing's and that's
what<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.399> sperg<00:01:02.760> spur

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
what we got here is we have a sperg spur

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.280 
what we got here is we have a sperg spur
gear<00:01:03.629> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.229> big<00:01:04.409> black<00:01:05.309> gear<00:01:06.290> that's

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
gear which is the big black gear that's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.600 
gear which is the big black gear that's
that<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:07.799> gonna<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.100> connected<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.520> your

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that that's gonna be connected to your

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.090 
that that's gonna be connected to your
transmission<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> pinion

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
transmission and then we have the pinion

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
transmission and then we have the pinion
gear<00:01:11.180> which<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.479> small<00:01:12.750> gear<00:01:12.960> that's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
gear which is the small gear that's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.920 
gear which is the small gear that's
connected<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> your<00:01:13.830> motor<00:01:14.720> those<00:01:15.720> are<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
connected to your motor those are the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.510 
connected to your motor those are the
two<00:01:16.080> real<00:01:16.350> gears<00:01:16.710> without<00:01:16.890> trying<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.430> too

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
two real gears without trying to get too

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
two real gears without trying to get too
technical<00:01:17.790> those<00:01:18.299> are<00:01:18.450> two<00:01:18.570> real<00:01:18.780> gears<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
technical those are two real gears that

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770 
technical those are two real gears that
you're<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:19.950> dealing<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.659> when<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
you're going to be dealing with when you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.560 
you're going to be dealing with when you
want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> change<00:01:22.320> some<00:01:22.530> gearing<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:24.060> reason

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
want to change some gearing the reason

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.960 
want to change some gearing the reason
why<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.960> change<00:01:24.990> gearing<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.970> you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
why you want to change gearing is you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
why you want to change gearing is you
know<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.180> got<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.450> fast<00:01:27.840> motor<00:01:28.110> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
know if you got a really fast motor you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.140 
know if you got a really fast motor you
really<00:01:29.189> can't<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> potential<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
really can't get the potential out of

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.109 
really can't get the potential out of
your<00:01:30.240> motor<00:01:31.040> if<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.250> not<00:01:32.430> geared<00:01:32.579> properly

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
your motor if it's not geared properly

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.539 
your motor if it's not geared properly
could<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.360> geared<00:01:33.600> away<00:01:33.810> low<00:01:34.049> could<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.710> could

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
could be geared away low could be could

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.069 
could be geared away low could be could
be<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:35.850> way<00:01:36.090> high<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.689> could<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.869> getting

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
be your way high and it could be getting

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
be your way high and it could be getting
it<00:01:37.259> could<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.470> overheating<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.509> wanted

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
it could be overheating so I just wanted

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.190 
it could be overheating so I just wanted
to<00:01:39.810> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> touch<00:01:40.140> base<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:42.899> guess

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to kind of touch base on that I guess

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
to kind of touch base on that I guess
the<00:01:43.409> first<00:01:43.619> thing<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.920> wanted<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> just

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the first thing I wanted to kind of just

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.940 
the first thing I wanted to kind of just
discuss<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.360> gearing<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.619> gearing<00:01:46.860> down

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
discuss is gearing up and gearing down

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.870 
discuss is gearing up and gearing down
if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.799> any<00:01:49.979> bash<00:01:50.250> your<00:01:50.430> friends

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
if you you know any bash your friends

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.510 
if you you know any bash your friends

gear up gear down gear up means you need
to<00:02:02.430> gear<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.759> where<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.420> more<00:02:03.570> speed<00:02:03.840> more

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to gear it where you get more speed more

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.280 
to gear it where you get more speed more
top<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.619> gear<00:02:05.490> down<00:02:05.790> means<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.899> need<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> get

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
top in gear down means you need to get

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.660 
top in gear down means you need to get
more<00:02:07.619> torque<00:02:07.920> more<00:02:08.160> low<00:02:08.580> end<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:09.379> if<00:02:10.379> your

more torque more low end or if your

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
more torque more low end or if your
for<00:02:11.819> two<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.390> you're<00:02:12.569> geared<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:13.020> high<00:02:13.260> your

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
for two if you're geared to high your

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.910 
for two if you're geared to high your
motors<00:02:14.010> overheating<00:02:15.470> then<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.560> want<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.800> gear

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
motors overheating then you want to gear

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.979 
motors overheating then you want to gear
down<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.709> overheating<00:02:20.280> could<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:20.989> you

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
down and really overheating could be you

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.229 
down and really overheating could be you
could<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.230> too<00:02:22.470> low<00:02:22.650> geared<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:23.670> I'm

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
could be too low geared to so but I'm

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.059 
could be too low geared to so but I'm
not<00:02:24.330> gonna<00:02:24.540> try<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.750> get<00:02:24.900> into<00:02:25.170> too<00:02:25.770> much<00:02:25.920> of

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
not gonna try to get into too much of

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.180 
not gonna try to get into too much of
that<00:02:26.099> stuff<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> basically<00:02:28.440> what<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:28.890> got<00:02:29.010> here

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
that stuff so basically what we got here

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.990 
that stuff so basically what we got here
is<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> pinion<00:02:29.700> gear<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.840> spur<00:02:31.230> gear

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
is the pinion gear and the spur gear

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
is the pinion gear and the spur gear
when<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.030> hear<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> term<00:02:33.510> gear<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:34.250> somebody

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
when you hear the term gear up somebody

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.250 
when you hear the term gear up somebody
says<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.550> need<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> gear<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.120> or<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:37.170> you're

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
says you need to gear it up or if you're

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.990 
says you need to gear it up or if you're
gonna<00:02:37.350> you<00:02:37.650> know<00:02:37.830> if<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.340> car<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.580> not<00:02:38.700> fast

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
gonna you know if your car is not fast

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.960 
gonna you know if your car is not fast
enough<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.569> want<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> make<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.019> faster

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
enough you want to make it faster

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.220 
enough you want to make it faster
really<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.090> main<00:02:42.569> gear<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.019> want<00:02:43.170> to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the gear that's connected to the motor

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.830 
the gear that's connected to the motor
this<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.120> one<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.360> really<00:02:48.510> want<00:02:48.630> to

mess with aspergers burger too much

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.970 
mess with aspergers burger too much
unless<00:03:24.600> you've<00:03:25.049> exhausted<00:03:25.380> all<00:03:25.769> your<00:03:25.799> options

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
unless you've exhausted all your options

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.410 
unless you've exhausted all your options
on<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:28.350> pinion<00:03:29.250> gear<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:30.209> really

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
on this on this pinion gear you really

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.140 
on this on this pinion gear you really
would<00:03:30.570> want<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.870> focus<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.290> your<00:03:31.410> pinion<00:03:31.709> gear

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
would want to focus on your pinion gear

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.349 
would want to focus on your pinion gear
so<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.329> want<00:03:33.480> more<00:03:33.600> speed<00:03:33.959> more<00:03:35.030> teeth<00:03:36.030> on

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
so if you want more speed more teeth on

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.340 
so if you want more speed more teeth on
your<00:03:36.510> pinion<00:03:36.959> if<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.859> want<00:03:38.070> less<00:03:38.579> speed<00:03:38.880> or

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
your pinion if you want less speed or

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.650 
your pinion if you want less speed or
more<00:03:40.350> torque<00:03:41.000> less<00:03:42.000> teeth<00:03:42.239> on<00:03:42.450> your<00:03:42.480> pinion

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
more torque less teeth on your pinion

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
more torque less teeth on your pinion
that's<00:03:45.660> that's<00:03:45.900> basically<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.709> again<00:03:47.640> you

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
that's that's basically it again you

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.039 
that's that's basically it again you
don't<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.030> want<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.269> mess<00:03:48.420> with<00:03:48.510> your<00:03:48.660> with

don't really want to mess with your with

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.509 
don't really want to mess with your with
your<00:03:49.079> spur<00:03:49.470> gear<00:03:49.709> which<00:03:49.859> is<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.130> big<00:03:50.280> black

one unless you've exhausted you know all

one unless you've exhausted you know all

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
your options save you've you've put

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.849 
your options save you've you've put
about<00:03:57.120> as<00:03:57.239> high<00:03:57.420> as<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.660> pinion<00:03:58.170> gear<00:03:58.530> as<00:03:58.709> you

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
about as high as a pinion gear as you

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.370 
about as high as a pinion gear as you
can<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.430> it's<00:03:59.519> still<00:03:59.819> not<00:04:00.060> as<00:04:00.840> fast<00:04:01.109> as<00:04:01.260> you

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
can and it's still not as fast as you

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.809 
can and it's still not as fast as you
want<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.980> your<00:04:02.130> temperature<00:04:02.459> still

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
want it and your temperature still

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.180 
want it and your temperature still
within<00:04:03.000> range<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.720> can<00:04:03.840> still<00:04:04.109> stand<00:04:04.890> for

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
within range and you can still stand for

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.349 
within range and you can still stand for
it<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.430> go<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> little<00:04:05.670> faster<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.269> little

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
it to go a little faster and a little

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.509 
it to go a little faster and a little
hotter<00:04:06.660> then<00:04:07.650> yeah<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.859> want<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.160> change<00:04:08.400> your

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
hotter then yeah you want to change your

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.190 
hotter then yeah you want to change your
spur<00:04:09.060> gear<00:04:09.980> now<00:04:10.980> one<00:04:11.160> thing<00:04:11.310> about<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.790> and

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
spur gear now one thing about this and

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.990 
spur gear now one thing about this and
I'm<00:04:13.200> trying<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.650> not<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:13.889> let<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.519> confuse<00:04:14.819> it

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
I'm trying to not to let it confuse it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.840 
I'm trying to not to let it confuse it
because<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.269> can<00:04:15.450> get<00:04:15.600> confusing<00:04:16.760> when<00:04:17.760> you

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
because it can get confusing when you

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.820 
because it can get confusing when you
want<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.090> gear<00:04:18.269> up<00:04:18.329> which<00:04:18.989> means<00:04:19.139> go<00:04:19.350> faster

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
want to gear up which means go faster

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.979 
want to gear up which means go faster
you<00:04:20.190> have<00:04:20.370> more<00:04:20.549> teeth<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> pinion<00:04:21.090> well

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
you have more teeth on the pinion well

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.860 
you have more teeth on the pinion well
that's<00:04:22.200> completely<00:04:22.520> opposite<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.789> your

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that's completely opposite of your

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.580 
that's completely opposite of your
per<00:04:24.960> year<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:26.280> want<00:04:26.520> more<00:04:27.210> top<00:04:27.479> speed<00:04:27.930> it's

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
per year if you want more top speed it's

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.820 
per year if you want more top speed it's
gonna<00:04:28.740> be<00:04:28.889> less<00:04:29.100> teeth<00:04:29.600> if<00:04:30.600> you<00:04:30.870> want<00:04:31.110> more

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
gonna be less teeth if you want more

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.340 
gonna be less teeth if you want more
torque<00:04:32.220> more<00:04:32.340> low-end<00:04:32.820> it's<00:04:33.810> gonna<00:04:33.900> be<00:04:34.080> more

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
torque more low-end it's gonna be more

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.030 
torque more low-end it's gonna be more
teeth<00:04:34.729> again<00:04:35.729> just<00:04:36.120> focus<00:04:36.479> on<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.750> pinion

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
teeth again just focus on the pinion

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.070 
teeth again just focus on the pinion
more<00:04:38.040> teeth<00:04:38.280> faster<00:04:38.820> less<00:04:39.210> teeth<00:04:39.479> slower<00:04:39.810> and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
more teeth faster less teeth slower and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.500 
more teeth faster less teeth slower and
just<00:04:40.680> think<00:04:40.889> this<00:04:41.190> burgers<00:04:41.520> opposite<00:04:42.090> and

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
just think this burgers opposite and

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.879 
just think this burgers opposite and
that's<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.840> best<00:04:43.020> way<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.169> remember<00:04:43.470> it

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
that's the best way to remember it

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.330 
that's the best way to remember it
so<00:04:44.790> pinion<00:04:45.210> more<00:04:45.810> teeth<00:04:45.990> faster<00:04:46.470> less<00:04:47.100> teeth

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
so pinion more teeth faster less teeth

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.400 
so pinion more teeth faster less teeth
slower<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.860> Spurs<00:04:50.100> completely<00:04:50.550> opposite

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
slower and the Spurs completely opposite

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.740 
slower and the Spurs completely opposite
so<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:53.070> think<00:04:53.490> that's<00:04:53.820> about<00:04:53.940> all<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.330> wanted<00:04:54.630> it

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
so I think that's about all I wanted it

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.529 
so I think that's about all I wanted it
to<00:04:54.810> touch<00:04:54.960> on<00:04:56.060> if<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.150> guys<00:04:57.240> have<00:04:57.419> any
