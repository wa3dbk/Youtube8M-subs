00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.410 
hand very flexible um
that's<00:01:07.780> right<00:01:08.020> what<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.380> job<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:10.180> need<00:01:10.300> to

that's right what a job you need to

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.360 
that's right what a job you need to
practice<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:10.960> motion<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.770> get<00:01:11.980> your<00:01:12.130> hand

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
practice this motion to get your hand

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.970 
practice this motion to get your hand
used<00:01:12.730> to<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.120> peak<00:01:13.480> that<00:01:13.750> you're<00:01:13.900> using<00:01:14.080> brush

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
used to the peak that you're using brush

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.850 
used to the peak that you're using brush
against<00:01:15.480> tension<00:01:16.480> strings<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:17.830> a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
against tension strings so that is a

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.900 
against tension strings so that is a
barrier<00:01:18.640> most<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.270> guys<00:01:19.420> should<00:01:19.480> get<00:01:20.470> over

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
barrier most of you guys should get over

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.280 
barrier most of you guys should get over
so<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:21.970> see<00:01:22.270> when<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.570> are<00:01:22.600> doing<00:01:22.870> a<00:01:23.050> Down

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
so you see when you are doing a Down

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.220 
so you see when you are doing a Down
stroke

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.790 

I'm<00:01:28.230> slanting<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.010> pic<00:01:29.310> outward<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
I'm slanting my pic outward so it

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.890 
I'm slanting my pic outward so it
naturally<00:01:32.100> glass<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:35.000> as<00:01:36.000> over<00:01:36.330> this<00:01:36.480> latter

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
naturally glass down as over this latter

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.380 
naturally glass down as over this latter
I<00:01:37.170> flick<00:01:37.710> up

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:50.590 

you<00:01:41.390> see<00:01:41.560> now<00:01:42.560> uh<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:43.159> just<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.520> flick<00:01:49.600> he

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
anyway so my goodies are gonna kill me

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.350 
anyway so my goodies are gonna kill me
so<00:02:00.729> practice<00:02:01.729> flicking<00:02:02.509> on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.720> strings<00:02:04.360> see

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
so practice flicking on the strings see

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.490 
so practice flicking on the strings see
that<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.619> ok<00:02:07.579> let's<00:02:07.610> try<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.119> together<00:02:08.209> ok<00:02:08.720> um

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
that so ok let's try it together ok um

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.530 
that so ok let's try it together ok um
let's<00:02:10.720> mute<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:12.769> left<00:02:12.980> hand<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:14.239> get<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
let's mute the left hand to get the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.360 
let's mute the left hand to get the
strings<00:02:14.840> let's<00:02:15.170> try<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.470> without<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
strings let's try it without the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.610 
strings let's try it without the
metronome<00:02:16.910> first<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:17.780> first<00:02:18.080> on<00:02:18.200> quarter

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
metronome first so it's first on quarter

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.460 
metronome first so it's first on quarter

excellent yet make sure your strums are
punchy<00:02:45.190> not<00:02:46.190> sluggish<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:49.840> okay<00:02:50.870> this

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
punchy not sluggish like that okay this

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.720 
punchy not sluggish like that okay this
punchy<00:02:52.730> shot<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.420> see<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> gotta<00:02:55.579> get

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
punchy shot and see so you gotta get

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.960 
punchy shot and see so you gotta get
used<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.120> your<00:02:56.359> pick<00:02:57.370> against<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.489> tension<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
used to your pick against the tension of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.849 
used to your pick against the tension of
the<00:02:59.030> string<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.930> takes<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.470> while<00:03:00.500> and

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
the string so that takes a while and

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.460 
the string so that takes a while and
takes<00:03:01.489> quite<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.910> bit<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.180> practice<00:03:02.329> to<00:03:03.230> bring

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
takes quite a bit of practice to bring

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.500 
takes quite a bit of practice to bring
up<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.769> speed<00:03:03.890> line<00:03:06.100> something

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
up to speed line something

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.149 
up to speed line something
you<00:03:09.379> see<00:03:09.530> okay<00:03:11.360> takes<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.409> bit<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.590> practice<00:03:12.769> to

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
you see okay takes a bit of practice to

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.430 
you see okay takes a bit of practice to
get<00:03:13.310> today<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.060> kind<00:03:14.299> of<00:03:14.330> speed<00:03:14.599> so<00:03:15.019> let's<00:03:15.260> try

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
get today the kind of speed so let's try

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.229 
get today the kind of speed so let's try
out<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> metronome<00:03:16.069> for<00:03:16.370> all<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:16.909> viewers

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
out the metronome for all you viewers

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.619 
out the metronome for all you viewers
out<00:03:17.569> there<00:03:20.530> straightening<00:03:22.239> okay<00:03:23.239> let's<00:03:23.450> not

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
out there straightening okay let's not

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:43.740 
out there straightening okay let's not
try<00:03:23.989> playing<00:03:24.409> eighth<00:03:25.340> notes<00:03:27.519> ECOT<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.819> to

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
you know if you do it and run through it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.380 
you know if you do it and run through it
again

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
again

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.430

inch we have so I'm playing I'm gonna

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:53.769 
inch we have so I'm playing I'm gonna
play<00:05:43.369> a<00:05:43.399> quarter<00:05:43.849> note<00:05:43.999> over<00:05:44.449> the<00:05:44.509> 16

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:06:01.219 

you<00:05:54.779> see<00:05:59.360> let's<00:06:00.360> try<00:06:00.539> it<00:06:00.599> on

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
you see let's try it on

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.219 
you see let's try it on
ene<00:06:01.680> at<00:06:02.159> nine<00:06:02.369> o'clock<00:06:02.399> okay<00:06:02.879> so<00:06:03.389> I'm<00:06:04.080> gonna

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
ene at nine o'clock okay so I'm gonna

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.480 
ene at nine o'clock okay so I'm gonna
play<00:06:04.439> the<00:06:04.559> first<00:06:04.830> two<00:06:05.240> one<00:06:06.240> two<00:06:06.659> quarter<00:06:07.379> notes

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490

play the first two one two quarter notes
three<00:06:08.490> four<00:06:08.849> sixteen<00:06:09.330> notes<00:06:09.449> okay

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.920 

okay<00:06:36.400> so<00:06:36.700> I<00:06:36.730> guess<00:06:36.970> that's<00:06:37.210> about<00:06:37.330> it<00:06:37.480> for<00:06:37.750> your
