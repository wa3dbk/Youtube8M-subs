00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 little by little one is understanding the idea 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.120
 that the technician has because pekerman 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.760
 because this the bay wants to impose its 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.230
 style your way of playing the form with the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.690
 that he has become a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.620
 prestigious technician and everything then not 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 I think the problems have 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.660
 Colombians suddenly on the topic of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.170
 be a little more this one not so showy 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 to the tribune a little more this 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.289
 blunt is when one has to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.180
 playing will surely cost you not 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.920
 because that's how Colombian soccer is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 rogue is a folk so it seemed more like 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.790
 Peruvian mind but surely because this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.320
 that the technician will understand 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.969
 brings in one has to fit into what 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 what they ask you do not know what you have in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.120
 Everywhere when it's your turn to play in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.309
 all sides up to come to train 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 has the responsibility that is logical 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.710
 that when you go out to play a game 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.110
 as with your selection and the whole country 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.480
 is aware of that that has a little 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.750
 more not but it's the same, I think one is already 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.980
 professional soccer player and he knows that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.820
 this kind of matches are like that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.890
 they understand then they are 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 they are complicated games but the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.960
 experience that almost all 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.120
 boys there because this serves you 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.800
 to be able to manage but I think that 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.600
 play for your selection of 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.950
 represent your country is the cutest 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.500
 what can happen to a player in I think 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.180
 that a 1 to 0 and playing well would not be a 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.280
 good indication that this is Peru 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.790
 is improving because it's useless 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.550
 we classify the world 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.869
 then we will return us in 23 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.000
 matches we are not back 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.590
 the idea is that what teacher wants 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.380
 Markarián is trying to give her a 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.420
 identity to Peruvian soccer with good 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.610
 game or the ball deal that already 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.920
 if we have it then you have to 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.450
 back to that you understand me but how do you 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.020
 play football today understand me be 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.820
 a football that always seeks to find 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.979
 spaces drag marks have 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.229
 sacrifice who believes that he should be the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.330
 indicated to cut against him for the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.270
 match against colombia manabita penny 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.429
 because he is working he is playing 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.310
 I think Raúl Fernández is not playing 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.740
 in France your team comes something 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.120
 complicated the last game they played 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.430
 he was not even in the bank 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.160
 then it 's penny coming it's doing 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.540
 a good job in the juan aurich a 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.340
 Although he did not have much danger he had 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.500
 some balls that went were 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.570
 important that we as a coach 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.570
 we see them important but you are 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.150
 complicated one that the one they shoot almost 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.850
 stick to the stick a ball with a boat where 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.790
 he made the technical gesture take off his foot and 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.080
 bag the one and the other so that it 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.980
 threw a ball 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.290
 also complicated stuck to the stick where 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.790
 crashes the ball to the bounce bounces 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.450
 collides him and evens and turns to go 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.960
 it is not to that it means that it was 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.840
 attentive for more that he did not have many 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.380
 interventions the few that he had was 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.380
 successful not
