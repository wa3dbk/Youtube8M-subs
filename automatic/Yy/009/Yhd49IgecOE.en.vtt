00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.260 
me I mean I don't I don't see it at hard
because<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.290> it's<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.030> food<00:01:51.030> it's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
because I just it's just it's food it's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.510 
because I just it's just it's food it's
vegetable<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.990> fruit<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.860> mean<00:01:53.189> if

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
vegetable this fruit you know I mean if

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.450 
vegetable this fruit you know I mean if
you're<00:01:54.210> lazy<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> cook

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
you're lazy and you don't like to cook

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.679 
you're lazy and you don't like to cook
might<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> little<00:01:56.729> difficult<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
might be a little difficult for you

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.719 
might be a little difficult for you
because<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
because you know you kind of have to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
because you know you kind of have to
cook<00:02:00.119> living<00:02:00.540> off<00:02:00.719> unless<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.170> go<00:02:01.320> raw<00:02:01.469> food

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
cook living off unless you go raw food

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.230 
cook living off unless you go raw food
you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.979> definitely<00:02:02.189> do<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.880> can

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you can definitely do that you can

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.910 
you can definitely do that you can
maybe<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> raw<00:02:03.689> foodist<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.680> you'll<00:02:04.829> probably

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
maybe a raw foodist and you'll probably

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
maybe a raw foodist and you'll probably
feel<00:02:05.490> even<00:02:05.820> better<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.540> because

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
feel even better than I do because

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
feel even better than I do because
that's<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.509> good

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that's what it is like so it's so good

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
that's what it is like so it's so good
not<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.140> eat<00:02:10.319> things<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.830> are<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.190> cooked

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
not to eat things that are like cooked

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.339 
not to eat things that are like cooked
because<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.239> say<00:02:12.450> things<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.810> are<00:02:12.989> cooked<00:02:13.170> are

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
because I say things that are cooked are

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.110 
because I say things that are cooked are
dead<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.489> you're<00:02:14.580> eating<00:02:14.730> things<00:02:15.030> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
dead so when you're eating things that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.020 
dead so when you're eating things that
are<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.810> know<00:02:15.840> still<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:17.069> know<00:02:17.250> fresh

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
are like you know still you know fresh

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
are like you know still you know fresh
and<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.930> know<00:02:18.989> cooked<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.560> all<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and not you know cooked and all the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.589 
and not you know cooked and all the
nutrients<00:02:20.430> are<00:02:20.519> drained<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.209> know<00:02:21.330> once

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
nutrients are drained out you know once

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.360 
nutrients are drained out you know once

regular meat potatoes type of diet that
a<00:03:03.480> lot<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.840> people<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.349> me<00:03:04.500> that's<00:03:04.950> because

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
a lot of people to me that's because

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.699 
a lot of people to me that's because
that's<00:03:05.370> what<00:03:05.640> we've<00:03:05.790> been<00:03:06.360> fed<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.470> that's

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that's what we've been fed and that's

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.370 
that's what we've been fed and that's
what<00:03:07.980> we've<00:03:08.130> grown<00:03:08.340> up<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.670> pun<00:03:09.090> intended<00:03:09.380> but

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
what we've grown up on pun intended but

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.780 
what we've grown up on pun intended but
you<00:03:11.160> get<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.340> lot<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.549> antioxidants<00:03:12.180> from

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
you get a lot of antioxidants from

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.430 
you get a lot of antioxidants from
nutrient<00:03:14.790> supplements<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.230> wouldn't

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
nutrient supplements that you wouldn't

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.699 
nutrient supplements that you wouldn't
normally<00:03:16.560> get<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.400> that's<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.269> good<00:03:18.299> place<00:03:18.780> you

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
normally get so that's a good place you

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.319 
normally get so that's a good place you
are<00:03:19.859> less<00:03:20.100> lazy<00:03:20.340> because<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.940> kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.209> have

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
are less lazy because you kind of have

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.310 
are less lazy because you kind of have
to<00:03:21.359> cook<00:03:21.570> for<00:03:21.660> yourself<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.989> little<00:03:22.049> bit<00:03:22.230> more

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
to cook for yourself a little bit more

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.490 
to cook for yourself a little bit more
often<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:24.350> those<00:03:25.350> are<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.739> main<00:03:26.130> reasons<00:03:27.500> why

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
often so those are the main reasons why

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.319 
often so those are the main reasons why
