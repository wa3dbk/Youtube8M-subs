going to need to re mold when this
theory<00:02:30.060> race<00:02:30.270> when<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.760> starts

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
theory race when all of this starts

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.100 
theory race when all of this starts
looking<00:02:33.060> really<00:02:33.239> bad<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.750> starting<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.050> get

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
looking really bad and starting to get

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.540 
looking really bad and starting to get
all<00:02:34.290> those<00:02:34.410> bubbles<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:35.040> stuff<00:02:35.130> coming<00:02:35.489> out

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
all those bubbles and stuff coming out

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.640 
all those bubbles and stuff coming out
really<00:02:35.970> bad<00:02:36.270> then<00:02:36.690> that's<00:02:37.380> what<00:02:37.500> I'm<00:02:37.590> gonna

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
really bad then that's what I'm gonna

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.640 
really bad then that's what I'm gonna
make<00:02:37.830> another<00:02:38.040> one<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:40.340> go<00:02:41.340> again<00:02:42.500> but<00:02:43.500> right

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
make another one and go again but right

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.040 
make another one and go again but right
now<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:44.190> looking<00:02:44.370> okay<00:02:45.150> there<00:02:45.720> are<00:02:45.900> some

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
now it's looking okay there are some

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.210 
now it's looking okay there are some
small<00:02:46.500> infection<00:02:46.920> throughout<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.940> tail

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
small infection throughout the tail

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.900 
small infection throughout the tail
nothing<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.550> can't<00:02:51.860> fix<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:55.790> think<00:02:56.790> I'll

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
nothing that I can't fix I think I'll

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.110 
nothing that I can't fix I think I'll
just<00:02:57.060> let<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:58.050> right<00:02:58.200> now<00:02:58.230> for<00:02:59.120> my

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
just let it be for right now for my

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.470 
just let it be for right now for my
first<00:03:00.330> tail<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.550> after<00:03:02.550> we're<00:03:02.730> finished<00:03:02.760> with

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
first tail and after we're finished with

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.590 
first tail and after we're finished with
this<00:03:03.510> those<00:03:03.930> are<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> time<00:03:04.830> crunch<00:03:05.420> we<00:03:06.420> can

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
this those are on a time crunch we can

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.949 
this those are on a time crunch we can
always<00:03:06.810> work<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.620> slowly<00:03:08.130> tiny<00:03:09.030> filling<00:03:09.810> in

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
always work on slowly tiny filling in

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.460 
always work on slowly tiny filling in
the<00:03:10.140> tiny<00:03:10.350> little<00:03:10.530> holes<00:03:10.830> as<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.140> I

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
the tiny little holes as you and I

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.620 
the tiny little holes as you and I
believe<00:03:13.890> saline<00:03:14.400> suggested

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.320 

we<00:03:18.230> will<00:03:18.470> work<00:03:18.950> on<00:03:19.130> getting<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> six<00:03:19.700> episodes

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
we will work on getting the six episodes

until<00:03:20.510> done<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:23.690> said<00:03:24.020> ten<00:03:24.440> constraints<00:03:25.160> so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
until done you said ten constraints so

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.680 
until done you said ten constraints so
there<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.050> someone<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.770> think<00:03:28.490> we<00:03:29.240> haven't<00:03:29.540> said
