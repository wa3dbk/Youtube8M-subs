00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
just were can be a little rigid to get

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.139 
just were can be a little rigid to get
them<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.860> also<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.369> can<00:01:54.490> see<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.729> legs<00:01:54.910> have

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
right off there's no way to connect them

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.590 
right off there's no way to connect them
in<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:02.320> we<00:02:02.380> go

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.270 

get<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.780> back<00:02:08.019> on<00:02:08.050> there<00:02:08.259> then<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.099> just

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
get that back on there then you just

fold<00:02:09.399> these<00:02:09.610> over<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:10.000> head<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
fold these over the head the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.900 
fold these over the head the
instructions<00:02:11.709> suggest<00:02:12.129> taking<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.610> head<00:02:12.760> off

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
instructions suggest taking the head off

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
but yeah you really don't kind of need

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
but yeah you really don't kind of need
to<00:02:17.160> take<00:02:18.160> these<00:02:21.000> slide<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> right<00:02:22.300> back<00:02:22.480> in

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
to take these slide it right back in

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.539 
to take these slide it right back in
there<00:02:22.840> fold<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.920> over<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:28.830> look<00:02:29.830> at<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.040> all

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
there fold it over and look at that all

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.589 
there fold it over and look at that all
of<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.730> sudden<00:02:31.000> you've<00:02:31.090> got<00:02:31.120> yourself<00:02:31.510> a

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
of a sudden you've got yourself a

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.240
