00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
coolest thing about this is if you

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.600 
coolest thing about this is if you
actually<00:01:36.960> swipe<00:01:37.259> again<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> left<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.549> if

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
as you can see it just kind of puts the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.649 
as you can see it just kind of puts the
time<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.299> words<00:02:37.230> at<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.620> top<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.190> as<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.540> can

time in words at the top and as you can

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.170 
time in words at the top and as you can
see<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:40.230> let<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.829> screen<00:02:41.129> dim<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:42.000> weather

see if we let the screen dim the weather
kind<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.659> goes<00:02:43.109> in<00:02:43.319> nicely<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:43.799> there

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
kind of goes in nicely with there

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.740 
kind of goes in nicely with there
basically<00:02:44.459> any<00:02:44.579> notification<00:02:45.359> that<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.569> have
