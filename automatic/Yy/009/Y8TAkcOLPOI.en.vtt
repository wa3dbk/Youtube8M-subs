you<00:00:00.690> want<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.900> ask<00:00:00.989> me<00:00:01.110> anything<00:00:01.350> before<00:00:01.979> yeah

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
you want to ask me anything before yeah

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.800 
you want to ask me anything before yeah
it<00:00:02.370> just<00:00:02.399> it's<00:00:03.330> it's<00:00:03.720> interesting<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.560> me<00:00:04.740> that

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
it just it's it's interesting to me that

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.459 
it just it's it's interesting to me that
so<00:00:06.810> diverse<00:00:07.440> I<00:00:07.710> mean<00:00:08.330> from<00:00:09.330> remediation<00:00:10.230> to

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
so diverse I mean from remediation to

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.150 
so diverse I mean from remediation to
the<00:00:10.559> medical<00:00:11.010> field<00:00:11.929> and<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.320> many<00:00:13.500> girls<00:00:13.830> in

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the medical field and so many girls in

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.990 
the medical field and so many girls in
between<00:00:14.660> it's<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.990> interesting<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:17.000> know

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
between it's just interesting to know

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.400 
between it's just interesting to know
better<00:00:18.330> than<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.539> hear<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
better than to hear that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.310 
better than to hear that
well<00:00:19.590> what<00:00:20.119> major<00:00:21.119> epiphany<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.779> my<00:00:21.869> life<00:00:22.080> is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
well what major epiphany in my life is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.810 
well what major epiphany in my life is
that<00:00:22.350> habitats<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.070> immune<00:00:23.340> system<00:00:23.670> just

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
that habitats have immune system just

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.839 
that habitats have immune system just
like<00:00:23.850> people<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.500> all<00:00:25.650> organisms<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.460> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
like people and and all organisms do and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.089 
like people and and all organisms do and
we're<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.269> laced<00:00:27.660> together<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.890> network

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
we're all laced together in this network

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.849 
we're all laced together in this network
and<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> mycelium<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.320> foundation<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
and the mycelium is the foundation of a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.000 
and the mycelium is the foundation of a
food<00:00:32.070> web<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:33.020> they're<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> grand<00:00:34.649> molecular

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
food web and they're the grand molecular

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.830 
food web and they're the grand molecular
disassemblers<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> nature<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.570> raked

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
disassemblers of nature and they raked

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
disassemblers of nature and they raked
out<00:00:36.989> by<00:00:37.200> an<00:00:37.260> animal<00:00:37.530> tissue<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.610> create

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
out by an animal tissue and they create

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.780 
out by an animal tissue and they create
soil<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.140> pathway<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
soil and that pathway to in the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.959 
soil and that pathway to in the
decomposition<00:00:42.570> process<00:00:43.520> spins<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
decomposition process spins out and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880 
decomposition process spins out and
feeds<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.750> sorts<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.079> other<00:00:46.230> organisms<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
feeds all sorts of other organisms and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.840 
feeds all sorts of other organisms and
life<00:00:47.070> cycles<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.200> this

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
life cycles and so this this this

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.660 
life cycles and so this this this
consequence<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> mycelium<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
consequence of the mycelium is the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
consequence of the mycelium is the
interface<00:00:53.969> organ<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.690> life<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> death<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.860> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
interface organ in life and death and so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.599 
interface organ in life and death and so
as<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.789> mycelium<00:00:57.800> enters<00:00:58.800> into<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.100> habitat

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
as the mycelium enters into a habitat

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.560 
as the mycelium enters into a habitat
and<00:01:00.000> does<00:01:00.570> its<00:01:00.899> job<00:01:01.250> that<00:01:02.250> feeds<00:01:02.520> nutrients<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and does its job that feeds nutrients to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.590 
and does its job that feeds nutrients to
all<00:01:03.600> sorts<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.140> other<00:01:05.150> life<00:01:06.150> cycles<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
all sorts of other life cycles and

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.630 
all sorts of other life cycles and
you<00:01:08.110> know<00:01:08.230> what<00:01:08.440> fungi<00:01:08.860> really<00:01:09.310> are

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
you know what fungi really are

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.190 
you know what fungi really are
exceptionally<00:01:10.210> good<00:01:10.360> at<00:01:10.390> is<00:01:10.750> knocking<00:01:11.140> down

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
exceptionally good at is knocking down

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.399 
exceptionally good at is knocking down
toxic<00:01:11.800> base<00:01:12.010> like<00:01:12.310> toxic<00:01:12.640> barriers<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.900> enable

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
toxic base like toxic barriers to enable

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.250 
toxic base like toxic barriers to enable
other<00:01:14.620> life-forms<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.430> grow<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.540> fungi<00:01:17.050> was<00:01:17.229> a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
other life-forms to grow so fungi was a

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.070 
other life-forms to grow so fungi was a
the<00:01:18.220> first<00:01:18.250> organ<00:01:18.790> in<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:18.970> pen<00:01:19.150> tool<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.510> 1.3

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the first organ in the pen tool and 1.3

the first organ in the pen tool and 1.3
billion<00:01:20.560> years<00:01:20.830> ago<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.640> plants<00:01:22.180> followed

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
billion years ago and plants followed

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.420 
billion years ago and plants followed
several<00:01:22.810> hundred<00:01:23.020> million<00:01:23.200> years<00:01:23.530> later<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
several hundred million years later the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.480 
several hundred million years later the
fungi<00:01:24.790> actually<00:01:25.180> munch<00:01:25.420> rocks

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
fungi actually munch rocks

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.670 
fungi actually munch rocks
here's<00:01:27.490> oxalic<00:01:27.940> acids<00:01:28.330> that<00:01:28.509> pull<00:01:28.750> calcium

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
here's oxalic acids that pull calcium

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.980 
here's oxalic acids that pull calcium
iron<00:01:29.950> manganese<00:01:30.160> and<00:01:30.460> other<00:01:30.720> minerals<00:01:31.720> out<00:01:31.900> of

iron manganese and other minerals out of

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.990 
iron manganese and other minerals out of
rocks<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.410> they<00:01:32.470> pockmarked<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.130> rocks<00:01:33.340> and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
rocks and they pockmarked the rocks and

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.910 
rocks and they pockmarked the rocks and
in<00:01:34.119> doing<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:34.420> they<00:01:34.720> critical<00:01:35.200> Mike<00:01:35.380> these

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
in doing so they critical Mike these

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.880 
in doing so they critical Mike these
little<00:01:36.130> micro<00:01:36.369> cavities<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.090> then<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.320> then

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
little micro cavities and then and then

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.830 
little micro cavities and then and then
fungi<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.759> algae<00:01:40.000> combined<00:01:40.660> together

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
fungi and algae combined together

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.410 
fungi and algae combined together
foreign<00:01:41.830> lichens<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.460> then<00:01:43.000> liking

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
foreign lichens and then liking

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.180 
foreign lichens and then liking
communities<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:44.080> also<00:01:44.440> begin<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.740> much<00:01:45.009> too

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
communities to also begin to much too

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.240 
communities to also begin to much too
lost<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:46.149> so<00:01:46.330> fungi<00:01:46.750> comes<00:01:47.020> puns<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:48.039> come

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
lost and so fungi comes puns I come

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.630 
lost and so fungi comes puns I come
first<00:01:48.430> on<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:48.910> land<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.600> then<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.190> way<00:01:51.369> in

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
first on the land and then in the way in

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.050 
first on the land and then in the way in
the<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.720> after<00:01:52.869> wave<00:01:53.350> of<00:01:53.380> mycelium

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the and and the after wave of mycelium

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.109 
the and and the after wave of mycelium
marches<00:01:55.060> all<00:01:55.270> these<00:01:55.420> other<00:01:55.570> increasingly<00:01:56.200> by

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
marches all these other increasingly by

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.969 
marches all these other increasingly by
biologic<00:01:58.119> biologically<00:01:59.080> come<00:01:59.259> complex

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
biologic biologically come complex

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.760 
biologic biologically come complex
communities<00:02:00.460> thereafter<00:02:00.940> so<00:02:01.360> this<00:02:02.259> is<00:02:02.410> a<00:02:02.440> the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
communities thereafter so this is a the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.800 
communities thereafter so this is a the
cool<00:02:02.950> thing<00:02:03.130> about<00:02:03.160> fungi<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:04.090> they<00:02:04.660> can

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
cool thing about fungi is that they can

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.859 
cool thing about fungi is that they can
navigate<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.220> ecosystems<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.090> because

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
navigate in the ecosystems and because

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.109 
navigate in the ecosystems and because
they<00:02:08.080> have<00:02:08.229> trillions<00:02:08.979> upon<00:02:09.100> trillions<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.910> n

resilience<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:45.849> that<00:02:46.000> these<00:02:46.150> are<00:02:46.300> vast<00:02:46.569> mental

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
resilience is that these are vast mental

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.229 
resilience is that these are vast mental

that have so many different receptor

microscopic<00:02:55.870> experiments<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.010> when<00:02:57.850> they

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
microscopic experiments and when they

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.050 
microscopic experiments and when they
are<00:02:58.330> successful<00:02:59.100> then<00:03:00.100> by<00:03:00.250> definition<00:03:00.519> they

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
are successful then by definition they

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.840 
are successful then by definition they
reproduce<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.170> search<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.640> these

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
reproduce in the search and so these

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.800 
reproduce in the search and so these
things<00:03:04.060> are<00:03:04.299> extremely<00:03:04.680> adaptive<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.600> I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
things are extremely adaptive and and I

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.559 
things are extremely adaptive and and I

you<00:04:24.110> can<00:04:24.200> train<00:04:24.830> these<00:04:25.040> strains<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.640> they<00:04:25.730> can

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you can train these strains and they can

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.270 
you can train these strains and they can
adapt<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.660> they<00:04:27.350> can<00:04:27.470> act<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:27.800> then<00:04:27.950> so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
adapt and they can act and then so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.250 
adapt and they can act and then so
they're<00:04:28.400> very<00:04:28.670> good<00:04:28.910> at<00:04:29.060> responding<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.990> ever

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
they're very good at responding to ever

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.800 
they're very good at responding to ever
changing<00:04:30.680> circumstances<00:04:31.430> and<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:32.480> lesson<00:04:32.750> of

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
changing circumstances and the lesson of

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.750 
changing circumstances and the lesson of
evolution<00:04:33.410> through<00:04:33.710> natural<00:04:33.800> selection<00:04:34.100> of

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
evolution through natural selection of

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.430 
evolution through natural selection of
those<00:04:34.970> organisms<00:04:35.300> that<00:04:35.540> can<00:04:35.750> adapt<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.200> change

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
those organisms that can adapt to change

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.040 
those organisms that can adapt to change
survive<00:04:36.860> well<00:04:37.760> this<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.330> exactly<00:04:38.720> what<00:04:38.930> these

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
survive well this is exactly what these

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.070 
survive well this is exactly what these
things<00:04:39.260> do<00:04:39.530> a<00:04:39.830> very<00:04:40.550> rapid<00:04:41.060> way<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.840> that's

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
things do a very rapid way and that's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.590 
things do a very rapid way and that's
why<00:04:42.230> we're<00:04:42.560> slow<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.890> adapt<00:04:43.400> but<00:04:44.360> you<00:04:44.480> know

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
why we're slow to adapt but you know

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.110 
why we're slow to adapt but you know
we're<00:04:44.810> successful<00:04:45.140> organism<00:04:45.770> thus<00:04:46.070> far<00:04:46.340> we

we're successful organism thus far we
