00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:08.450
 Thank you for watching the dividend the other day 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:09.559
 It had been found by chance and we went to the shop I Popondetta of railway blur this 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.679
 I am a child yes 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.960
 You see, it's right here It was released from Kato 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:20.100
 9 c 62 is a second-hand product, so it is sold separately 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.030
 You wrote me the motorized length 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.680
 It was 3000 yen but I think 3000 yen is not a cheap price 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.510
 At first I say I mean is I do not even need another buy want archaic already kicking Chukoya 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.070
 Or a sl being sold san 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:40.090
 His maternal So is it bought with I think the kana I'll fix in but it is poor nano 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.500
 I'm surprised I'm surprised that even if the doll is not good, even if it has a good name terrace 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.550
 I'm often today to run I would like to do the maintenance in it 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 Let's open another 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 Since it is written with a motorized head, a driving test is required first 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:00.899
 Usho It is I, and this is after all I 9 c 6 sometimes big 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.949
 Say There is only power test It comes with Toka dumping because it is a used product, this is it this is good 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.949
 It depends 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.889

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.170
 This is an awkward feeling like the previous one when it came to running because I was running unexpectedly. 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.369
 We will continue to take a sound dirt of the wheels with a fine sandpaper of the eye 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.970
 I polished the part of the bone street with a file of fine eyes because I entered 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.920
 It is time to polish, but actually put it on the rails like this 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.920
 Run with a considerable reconnaissance 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 And its stopped was because this stops when you run and I in such Fu wheel is dirty 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:46.400
 The dirty Fu that is polished with stops When you also Part 1 is to also run polish in this position 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.400
 I will take it and it will look like this 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:00.510
 Oh yes, I started to run normally and it was n't just the employees who were awkward to work on the rails. 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.920
 Because there is dirt, if you clean the neko and take the dirt, it will be a good woman's document 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.390
 And in recent years there have been many Les Motors' steam locomotives, so I compared them to this 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.320
 You're here in the motor when 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.290
 It might have been sold thought I do not it what or funny old steam locomotive 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.220
 I overtook one car 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.720
 I think it's good 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.520
 The but is c 62 not that have been sold in this I Popondetta properly as in So 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.710
 I started to run when I polished it 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:26.350
 It's just second hand, the body is dirty or scratched, but there is also maintenance 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.310
 It will be so steep that you have 15 models too 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.210
 I think that it is good , so I bought this time with a book 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.190
 say that maintenance of the c 62 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:46.560
 It was 4 and see you in the video Thank you very much 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:46.560
