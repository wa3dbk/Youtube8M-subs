00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
use that so that you can compare how we

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.310 
use that so that you can compare how we
do<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:36.890> with<00:00:37.190> how<00:00:37.400> they<00:00:37.550> do<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:37.989> most<00:00:38.989> people

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
do it with how they do it most people

it's<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.649> messy<00:00:45.920> process<00:00:46.130> but<00:00:47.000> fairly<00:00:47.300> simple

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
it's a messy process but fairly simple
