here in the college we have a very wide
range<00:00:08.469> of<00:00:08.889> labs<00:00:09.160> they<00:00:09.670> go<00:00:10.240> anywhere<00:00:10.600> from

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
range of labs they go anywhere from

the<00:00:59.740> discovery<00:01:00.210> telescope<00:01:01.210> mirror<00:01:01.450> there

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
the discovery telescope mirror there

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.469 
the discovery telescope mirror there
also<00:01:02.620> are<00:01:03.310> some<00:01:03.700> labs<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.150> deal<00:01:04.330> with

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
also are some labs that deal with

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.340 
also are some labs that deal with
ophthalmology<00:01:05.259> so<00:01:05.670> looking<00:01:06.670> at<00:01:06.880> ways<00:01:07.780> that<00:01:07.840> we

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
ophthalmology so looking at ways that we

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.410 
ophthalmology so looking at ways that we
can<00:01:08.860> measure<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.700> properties<00:01:09.939> of<00:01:10.149> your<00:01:10.270> eye

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
can measure the properties of your eye

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.830 
can measure the properties of your eye
to<00:01:10.869> either<00:01:10.990> detect<00:01:11.670> disease<00:01:12.670> earlier<00:01:13.210> for

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
to either detect disease earlier for

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.469 
to either detect disease earlier for
preventative<00:01:14.320> causes<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:15.159> detect<00:01:16.149> diseases

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
preventative causes to detect diseases

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.920 
preventative causes to detect diseases
more<00:01:16.689> accurately<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:18.369> have

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
more accurately we have

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.930 
more accurately we have
Labs<00:01:19.620> that<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.130> display<00:01:20.430> for

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
Labs that do display for

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.500 
Labs that do display for
three-dimensional<00:01:22.010> displays<00:01:23.420> there<00:01:24.420> are

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
three-dimensional displays there are

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.000 
three-dimensional displays there are
many<00:01:24.660> labs<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> college<00:01:25.410> that<00:01:25.590> focus<00:01:25.920> on

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
many labs in the college that focus on

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.070 
many labs in the college that focus on
polarization<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> quality<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.810> light

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
polarization which is a quality of light

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.320 
polarization which is a quality of light
and<00:01:28.460> how<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.760> use<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.180> determine

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
and how we can use that to determine

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.480 
and how we can use that to determine
things<00:01:30.960> about<00:01:31.530> our<00:01:31.710> environment<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:32.340> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
things about our environment that we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.750 
things about our environment that we
can't<00:01:32.820> normally<00:01:33.510> see<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.550> of<00:01:35.580> the

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
can't normally see and so one of the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.810 
can't normally see and so one of the
groups<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.330> working<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.290> an<00:01:38.220> imager<00:01:38.550> called

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
groups is working on an imager called

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
groups is working on an imager called
the<00:01:38.970> multi-angle<00:01:39.420> spectra<00:01:40.080> polar<00:01:40.320> metric

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the multi-angle spectra polar metric

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.250 
the multi-angle spectra polar metric
imager<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.729> ever<00:01:41.880> miss<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:43.229> that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
imager that ever miss be and what that

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.780 
imager that ever miss be and what that
does<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.160> to<00:01:44.220> go<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.460> space<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
does is it's going to go into space and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.810 
does is it's going to go into space and
using<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.810> polarization<00:01:46.260> of<00:01:46.470> light<00:01:46.580> look<00:01:47.580> at

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
using the polarization of light look at

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
using the polarization of light look at
the<00:01:48.119> levels<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.540> different<00:01:48.990> materials<00:01:49.590> such

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the levels of different materials such

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.460 
the levels of different materials such
as<00:01:50.280> aerosols<00:01:50.760> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.090> atmosphere<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:52.350> can

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
as aerosols in the atmosphere we can

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.680 
as aerosols in the atmosphere we can
also<00:01:52.590> use<00:01:52.830> polarization<00:01:53.550> on<00:01:53.850> assembly<00:01:54.660> lines

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
also use polarization on assembly lines

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.560 
also use polarization on assembly lines
so<00:01:55.410> if<00:01:55.800> there<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.190> somebody<00:01:56.430> making<00:01:56.820> bottles

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
so if there is somebody making bottles

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.050 
so if there is somebody making bottles
and<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.470> want<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.860> test<00:01:59.190> stress<00:01:59.550> and<00:01:59.759> strain

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and they want to test stress and strain

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.540 
and they want to test stress and strain
and<00:02:00.390> based<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.800> different<00:02:02.190> colors<00:02:02.460> that

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
and based on the different colors that

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.889 
and based on the different colors that
you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.240> shows<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> where<00:02:03.720> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you can see it shows you where the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.320 
you can see it shows you where the
stress<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.170> strain<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
uses are very interesting that you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.270 
uses are very interesting that you
wouldn't<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:08.790> think<00:02:08.880> about<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.160> your

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
wouldn't really think about so in your

wouldn't really think about so in your
daily<00:02:11.370> life<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.910> come<00:02:12.090> across<00:02:12.320> optical

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
daily life you come across optical

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.949 
daily life you come across optical
sciences<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:14.100> your<00:02:14.340> DVD<00:02:14.760> player<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.720> have

sciences in your DVD player you have

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.410 
sciences in your DVD player you have
lenses<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.860> lasers<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.489> allow<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:18.300> to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
lenses and lasers that allow you to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380 
lenses and lasers that allow you to
watch<00:02:18.630> movies<00:02:18.840> another<00:02:19.770> area<00:02:19.980> could<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:20.489> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
watch movies another area could be the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.199 
watch movies another area could be the
sports<00:02:21.690> cameras<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.920> lot<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.280> sports<00:02:23.760> arena

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
sports cameras and a lot of sports arena

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.420 
sports cameras and a lot of sports arena
as<00:02:24.390> they<00:02:24.510> take<00:02:24.690> photographs<00:02:25.320> for<00:02:25.799> magazine

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
as they take photographs for magazine

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.880 
as they take photographs for magazine
few<00:02:26.670> things<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.269> before<00:02:27.870> those<00:02:28.320> those

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
few things and before those those

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.220 
few things and before those those
objectives<00:02:29.580> when<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.850> cameras<00:02:30.209> were<00:02:30.390> huge

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
objectives when the cameras were huge

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.080 
objectives when the cameras were huge
and<00:02:31.440> wait<00:02:31.650> await<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.950> lot<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.850> they're<00:02:33.000> able

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and wait await a lot and so they're able

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.850 
and wait await a lot and so they're able
to<00:02:33.239> take<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.660> some<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.140> glass<00:02:34.380> elements

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
to take out some of the glass elements

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.960 
to take out some of the glass elements
in<00:02:34.950> there<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.340> replace<00:02:35.700> them<00:02:35.910> with

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
in there and replace them with

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.420 
in there and replace them with
holographic<00:02:36.540> optical<00:02:36.930> elements<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.830> that

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
holographic optical elements and that

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.310 
holographic optical elements and that
allowed<00:02:38.640> them<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.150> shrunk<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.720> made<00:02:40.140> much

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
allowed them to be shrunk and made much

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.020 
allowed them to be shrunk and made much
lighter<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.370> makes<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.640> easier<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:41.940> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
lighter and it makes it easier on the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.729 
lighter and it makes it easier on the
photographer's<00:02:42.570> as<00:02:42.900> well<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.320> correcting

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
photographer's as well as correcting

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.870 
photographer's as well as correcting
some<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.130> problems<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.610> pictures

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
some of the problems in the pictures

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.390 
some of the problems in the pictures
that<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.269> sometimes<00:02:45.450> another<00:02:46.400> area

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
that you see sometimes another area

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.940 
that you see sometimes another area
would<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.930> any<00:02:48.930> telescope<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:49.709> you're<00:02:49.890> an

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
would be any telescope if you're an

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.039 
would be any telescope if you're an
astronomer<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.000> love<00:02:51.269> astronomy<00:02:51.600> you

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
astronomer if you love astronomy you

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.240 
astronomer if you love astronomy you
know<00:02:52.140> every<00:02:52.380> time<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.620> pull<00:02:52.769> your<00:02:52.830> telescope

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
know every time you pull your telescope

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.410 
know every time you pull your telescope
out<00:02:53.400> you're<00:02:53.700> using<00:02:53.880> optical<00:02:54.269> sciences

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
out you're using optical sciences

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.449 
out you're using optical sciences
now<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.480> Mars<00:02:56.750> rover<00:02:57.200> has<00:02:57.470> all<00:02:57.890> sorts<00:02:58.250> of

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
now the Mars rover has all sorts of

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.660 
now the Mars rover has all sorts of
imaging<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.180> spectroscopy<00:03:00.370> tools<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:01.640> it

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
imaging and spectroscopy tools on it

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.490 
imaging and spectroscopy tools on it
that<00:03:02.209> you<00:03:02.240> can<00:03:02.480> use<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.110> look<00:03:03.140> at<00:03:03.410> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
that you can use to look at the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.530 
that you can use to look at the
environment<00:03:03.800> and<00:03:04.310> to<00:03:04.550> see<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.970> know<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.300> there

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
environment and to see you know is there

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.390 
environment and to see you know is there
water<00:03:05.720> there<00:03:06.020> what<00:03:06.590> kind<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:06.830> rocks<00:03:07.040> are<00:03:07.250> there

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
water there what kind of rocks are there

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.520 
water there what kind of rocks are there
and<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.910> lot<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.480> optical<00:03:08.990> sciences<00:03:09.350> as

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
and a lot of that is optical sciences as

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.870 
and a lot of that is optical sciences as
well<00:03:09.580> it's<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.700> very<00:03:10.880> busy<00:03:11.120> very<00:03:11.209> big<00:03:11.540> arena
