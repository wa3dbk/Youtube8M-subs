hi<00:00:00.179> this<00:00:00.240> is<00:00:00.390> dr.<00:00:00.750> Karen<00:00:01.020> Becker<00:00:01.199> and<00:00:01.350> today

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
hi this is dr. Karen Becker and today

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.500 
hi this is dr. Karen Becker and today
we're<00:00:01.709> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.920> discuss<00:00:02.100> glaucoma<00:00:02.850> which<00:00:03.300> is

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
we're going to discuss glaucoma which is

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.570 
we're going to discuss glaucoma which is
increased<00:00:04.110> intraocular<00:00:04.890> pressure<00:00:05.009> or

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
increased intraocular pressure or

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309 
increased intraocular pressure or
increased<00:00:06.299> pressure<00:00:06.569> within<00:00:06.839> your<00:00:07.049> pets<00:00:07.200> eye

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
increased pressure within your pets eye

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.500 
increased pressure within your pets eye
the<00:00:08.160> cells<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.610> eye<00:00:08.639> produce<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.210> clear

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the cells of the eye produce a clear

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.690 
the cells of the eye produce a clear
fluid<00:00:09.690> called<00:00:10.110> aqueous<00:00:10.740> humor<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.340> provides

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
fluid called aqueous humor that provides

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.999 
fluid called aqueous humor that provides
nutrients<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.570> tissues<00:00:12.929> inside<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> eye<00:00:13.679> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
nutrients to tissues inside the eye and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.369 
nutrients to tissues inside the eye and
also<00:00:14.429> helps<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> maintain<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.299> eye<00:00:15.509> shape<00:00:15.990> so

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
also helps to maintain the eye shape so

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.800 
also helps to maintain the eye shape so
it's<00:00:16.560> basically<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.010> fluid<00:00:17.400> filled<00:00:17.640> ball<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
it's basically a fluid filled ball the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.750 
it's basically a fluid filled ball the
aqueous<00:00:19.140> humor<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.619> fluid<00:00:20.100> inside<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> eye

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
aqueous humor is fluid inside the eye

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880 
aqueous humor is fluid inside the eye
whereas<00:00:21.210> tears<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:21.869> fluid<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.680> course

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
