good morning everyone this is NCP I've
been<00:00:03.330> kind<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.629> getting<00:00:03.780> lately<00:00:04.110> into<00:00:04.620> a

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
been kind of getting lately into a

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.330 
been kind of getting lately into a
little<00:00:05.430> bit<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.899> astrophotography<00:00:06.899> and

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
little bit of astrophotography and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.410 
little bit of astrophotography and
eventually<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.400> want<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.700> get<00:00:08.790> into<00:00:09.030> deep<00:00:09.240> space

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
eventually I want to get into deep space

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.150 
eventually I want to get into deep space
ask<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.050> toffee<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.469> some<00:00:10.679> nebulas<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
ask for toffee and some nebulas and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.589 
ask for toffee and some nebulas and
stuff<00:00:11.460> but<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:11.790> not<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.000> equipment<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.509> that

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
stuff but I'm not the equipment for that

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.530 
stuff but I'm not the equipment for that
right<00:00:12.780> now<00:00:13.460> but<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.820> took<00:00:14.969> me<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> while<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
right now but it took me a while to

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.240 
right now but it took me a while to
figure<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.900> out<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.139> haven't<00:00:16.890> found<00:00:17.130> this

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
figure this out I haven't found this

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.740 
figure this out I haven't found this
information<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
information on that I just kind of

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.800 
information on that I just kind of
figured<00:00:19.109> out<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.410> asked<00:00:19.560> people<00:00:19.740> but

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
figured out and asked people but

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.439 
figured out and asked people but
attaching<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> digital<00:00:22.380> camera<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
attaching a digital camera to a

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.160 
attaching a digital camera to a
telescope<00:00:25.010> is<00:00:26.029> um<00:00:27.029> tough<00:00:27.689> not

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
telescope is um tough not

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.939 
telescope is um tough not
straightforward

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
straightforward

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.980 
straightforward
I<00:00:28.980> should<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.580> say<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.029> ignore<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> write<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
I should I say I ignore the write a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.569 
I should I say I ignore the write a
script<00:00:31.289> today<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.769> kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.219> but

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
script today so I'm kind of going but

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.130 
script today so I'm kind of going but
here's<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.710> t<00:00:35.100> t<00:00:35.730> adapter<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
here's the the t t adapter and the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.799 
here's the the t t adapter and the
tearing<00:00:37.590> then<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.700> give<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> pull<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.600> off

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
tearing then we give it a pull this off

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.880 
tearing then we give it a pull this off
and<00:00:39.840> tree<00:00:40.170> how<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> works

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and tree how it works

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.790 
and tree how it works
um<00:00:41.510> just<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.660> basically<00:00:43.140> slide<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> back

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
um just just basically slide to the back

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.000 
um just just basically slide to the back
a<00:00:43.860> telescope<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.120> picture<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.660> okay

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
a telescope like this picture here okay

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.830 
a telescope like this picture here okay
that's<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.520> setup<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.450> other<00:00:48.629> night

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that's the setup I use the other night

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.830 
that's the setup I use the other night
which<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> camera<00:00:49.890> like<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
which it's a camera like that and you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
which it's a camera like that and you
can<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.289> pretty<00:00:52.500> pretty<00:00:53.160> simple

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
can see it's pretty pretty simple

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
can see it's pretty pretty simple
going<00:00:53.910> forward<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:55.170> camera<00:00:55.500> goes<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
going forward the camera goes in the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.920 
going forward the camera goes in the
back<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> eyepiece<00:00:56.789> projection<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
back and the eyepiece projection and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
back and the eyepiece projection and
that's<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> very<00:00:59.609> small

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that's it now this is a very small

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.720 
that's it now this is a very small
telescope<00:01:00.920> more<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> spotting<00:01:02.699> scope

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
telescope more like a spotting scope

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.390 
telescope more like a spotting scope
actually<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.780> that's<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.010> did

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
actually but that's what we did

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.980 
actually but that's what we did
so<00:01:06.350> let<00:01:07.350> me<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> video<00:01:10.790> okay

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
so let me get back to the video okay

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
so let me get back to the video okay
pull<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.080> off<00:01:13.320> from<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.130> make<00:01:14.250> sure<00:01:14.340> my

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
pull this off from I can make sure my

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.890 
pull this off from I can make sure my
camera's<00:01:14.790> off<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.509> don't<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
camera's off because I don't want to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.039 
camera's off because I don't want to
expose<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.500> lens<00:01:16.770> or<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.700> CCD<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
expose the lens or the CCD with the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.260 
expose the lens or the CCD with the
power<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.610> because<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> very<00:01:21.030> powerful

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
power on because that's a very powerful

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.100 
power on because that's a very powerful
one

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
one

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.640 
one
electrostatic<00:01:23.180> tractor<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.409> get<00:01:25.500> rid<00:01:25.619> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
electrostatic tractor so we get rid of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.370 
electrostatic tractor so we get rid of
this<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.040> let's<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.400> into<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.700> here

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
this on let's go into this here

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.310 
this on let's go into this here
basically<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.130> you'll<00:01:29.340> need<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> uh

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
basically this is what you'll need to uh

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
basically this is what you'll need to uh
to<00:01:31.320> attach<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.770> telescope<00:01:32.310> tool<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:33.030> am<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.600> mean

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
to attach a telescope tool to am I mean

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
to attach a telescope tool to am I mean
a<00:01:33.840> camera<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> telescope<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.700> you'll<00:01:36.030> need

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
a camera to a telescope and you'll need

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.660 
a camera to a telescope and you'll need
the<00:01:36.360> key<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.810> pull<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> pull<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.860> back<00:01:38.549> up

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the key really pull and pull one back up

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.319 
the key really pull and pull one back up
here<00:01:39.680> if<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.920> lens<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.549> my<00:01:42.060> peace

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
here if that lens out of there my peace

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.219 
here if that lens out of there my peace
pipe<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.170> projector<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.430> basically<00:01:45.229> you'll

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
pipe the projector so basically you'll

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.800 
pipe the projector so basically you'll
need

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
need

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.040 
need
this<00:01:48.810> piece<00:01:49.080> right<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:50.360> this<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.870> is<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
this piece right here this is this is a

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.290 
this piece right here this is this is a
T<00:01:52.380> ring<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.400> what<00:01:53.580> attaches<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.240> your

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
T ring this is what attaches to your

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.200 
T ring this is what attaches to your
camera<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.920> case<00:01:56.160> it's<00:01:56.370> an<00:01:56.490> f-stop<00:01:56.820> one

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990 
camera in this case it's an f-stop one
for<00:01:57.450> Nikon<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:59.280> you'll<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.550> your<00:01:59.610> T

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
for Nikon then you'll have your T

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.380 
for Nikon then you'll have your T
adapter<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.550> this<00:02:02.550> has<00:02:02.820> two<00:02:03.120> things

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
adapter here and this has two things

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.180 
adapter here and this has two things
this<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.720> for<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.620> quarter<00:02:04.920> inch<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
this is for a one and a quarter inch I

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.910 
this is for a one and a quarter inch I
guess<00:02:05.340> adapter<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.810> certain<00:02:07.590> tongue<00:02:07.710> feels

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
guess adapter for certain tongue feels

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.890 
guess adapter for certain tongue feels
like<00:02:08.070> Questor<00:02:08.460> on<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.540> they<00:02:09.630> have<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
like Questor on and then they have the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.390 
like Questor on and then they have the
bigger<00:02:10.110> adapter<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.770> bigger<00:02:10.980> telescope

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
bigger adapter for the bigger telescope

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
bigger adapter for the bigger telescope
you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.670> usually<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.970> get<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.690> one<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
you can usually just get this one and

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
you can usually just get this one and
I'll<00:02:13.800> screw<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I'll screw in like that

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.030 
I'll screw in like that
and<00:02:15.630> you'll<00:02:15.990> be<00:02:16.080> good<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.290> go<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.590> plug<00:02:16.920> down

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and you'll be good to go and plug down

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.490 
and you'll be good to go and plug down
in<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.220> back<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.460> telescope<00:02:18.080> but<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.260> wanted

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
in the back to telescope but I wanted

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.990 
in the back to telescope but I wanted
the<00:02:19.620> bigger<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.070> for<00:02:20.430> multiple<00:02:20.880> reasons<00:02:21.030> um

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
the bigger one for multiple reasons um

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.210 
the bigger one for multiple reasons um
one<00:02:24.000> reason<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.800> when<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.830> put<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
one reason is when I put on the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.630 
one reason is when I put on the
telescope<00:02:26.700> like<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.770> put<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> camera

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
telescope like this and put the camera

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.250 
telescope like this and put the camera
right<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.390> always<00:02:30.540> come<00:02:30.810> out<00:02:30.990> blurry

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
right in there it always come out blurry

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.160 
right in there it always come out blurry
just<00:02:31.560> couldn't<00:02:31.830> focus<00:02:32.070> or<00:02:32.520> not

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
just couldn't focus or not

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.200 
just couldn't focus or not
now<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> reason<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.920> no<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.610> told<00:02:35.760> me<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.150> you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
now the reason is no one told me but you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.730 
now the reason is no one told me but you
have<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:36.810> put<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.050> eyepiece<00:02:37.410> down

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
have to actually put the eyepiece down

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.790 
have to actually put the eyepiece down
inside<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:39.140> you'll<00:02:40.140> whack<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.470> down<00:02:40.650> and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
inside there you'll whack it down and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.080 
inside there you'll whack it down and
click<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.160> there<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:41.670> your

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
click it in there like that so your

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.910 
click it in there like that so your
anger<00:02:42.360> fire<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.870> they'll<00:02:43.440> work<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:43.590> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
anger fire and they'll work with that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.920 
anger fire and they'll work with that
but<00:02:44.130> that's<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.300> pull<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.690> point

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
but that's what I would pull it point

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.990 
but that's what I would pull it point
out<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.280> put<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.610> eyepiece

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
out is that you have to put the eyepiece

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.430 
out is that you have to put the eyepiece
inside<00:02:48.450> there<00:02:50.390> there's<00:02:51.390> no<00:02:51.570> documentation<00:02:52.200> on

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
inside there there's no documentation on

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.400 
inside there there's no documentation on
the<00:02:52.500> web<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> found<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.459> how<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.640> use<00:02:53.850> this

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
the web that I found on how to use this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.930 
the web that I found on how to use this
so<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.709> put<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> eyepiece<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.520> there<00:02:56.700> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
so you put the eyepiece in there and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.210 
so you put the eyepiece in there and
give<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.300> Ragnar<00:02:57.630> fire<00:02:57.860> now<00:02:58.860> some<00:02:59.190> have

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
give you a Ragnar fire now some have

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.690 
give you a Ragnar fire now some have
glass<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.150> them<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:02.010> did<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.489> went

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
glass in them this one I did I went

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.880 
glass in them this one I did I went
without<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.090> glass<00:03:03.320> can<00:03:04.320> still<00:03:04.530> have<00:03:04.680> some

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
without the glass can still have some

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.100 
without the glass can still have some
are<00:03:05.010> part<00:03:05.250> of<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.370> Barlow<00:03:05.820> lens<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.810> don't

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
are part of a Barlow lens but I don't

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.990 
are part of a Barlow lens but I don't
want<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.650> I<00:03:07.860> want<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.850> like<00:03:08.970> a

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
want to do that one I want to like a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.530 
want to do that one I want to like a
switch<00:03:09.330> out<00:03:09.570> whatever<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.989> want<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.290> there<00:03:10.530> so

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
there you go that's a real simple way to

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.240 
there you go that's a real simple way to
hook<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.640> telco<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.650> let<00:03:16.650> me<00:03:16.739> show<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:16.980> the

hook up to telco and let me show you the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
hook up to telco and let me show you the
image<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.820> got<00:03:18.000> last<00:03:18.239> night<00:03:18.510> ornelas<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.170> guess

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
picture of the moon through that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.100 
picture of the moon through that
telescope<00:03:29.130> with<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.760> setup<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.780> saw

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
telescope with that setup that you saw

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.930 
telescope with that setup that you saw
um<00:03:31.790> let's<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:32.970> take<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.180> on<00:03:33.420> january<00:03:34.140> 9th
