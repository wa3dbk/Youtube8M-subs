and do you think the role was of my time

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
going back coming back as a producer I

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.900 
going back coming back as a producer I
think<00:00:08.720> I<00:00:08.900> think<00:00:09.140> that<00:00:09.290> it<00:00:09.410> matters<00:00:09.770> a<00:00:09.800> lot<00:00:10.100> like

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
think I think that it matters a lot like

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.600 
think I think that it matters a lot like
I<00:00:11.060> said<00:00:11.120> I<00:00:11.300> think<00:00:11.750> it<00:00:11.930> creates<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.920> bit<00:00:13.100> of<00:00:13.130> a<00:00:13.400> you

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
I said I think it creates a bit of a you

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.580 
I said I think it creates a bit of a you
know<00:00:15.970> creatively<00:00:16.970> free<00:00:17.660> atmosphere<00:00:17.930> but<00:00:18.500> I

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
know creatively free atmosphere but I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.520 
know creatively free atmosphere but I
also<00:00:18.830> think<00:00:18.980> that<00:00:19.750> during<00:00:20.750> this<00:00:20.869> production

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:21.530 
also think that during this production

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.510 
also think that during this production
we<00:00:22.160> had<00:00:22.400> we<00:00:23.330> didn't<00:00:23.630> have<00:00:23.720> so<00:00:23.930> much<00:00:24.080> time<00:00:24.440> and<00:00:25.369> I

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
we had we didn't have so much time and I

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.490 
we had we didn't have so much time and I
think<00:00:25.760> that<00:00:25.940> he<00:00:26.090> managed<00:00:26.480> really<00:00:26.930> well<00:00:27.140> to

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
think that he managed really well to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.090 
think that he managed really well to
make<00:00:27.949> us<00:00:28.990> yeah<00:00:29.990> make<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:30.380> best<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.740> the<00:00:30.859> time

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
make us yeah make the best of the time

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.469 
make us yeah make the best of the time
that<00:00:31.640> we<00:00:31.820> had<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:32.449> you<00:00:32.660> know<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.179> think

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:35.479 
that we had and you know and I think

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.149 
that we had and you know and I think
actually<00:00:35.629> for<00:00:36.050> everybody<00:00:36.499> the<00:00:36.800> the

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:37.159 
actually for everybody the the

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.250 
actually for everybody the the
responsibility<00:00:38.059> was<00:00:38.300> was<00:00:38.659> also<00:00:39.019> bigger

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
responsibility was was also bigger

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.049 
responsibility was was also bigger
because<00:00:39.499> we<00:00:39.649> were<00:00:39.920> not<00:00:39.949> working<00:00:40.429> with<00:00:40.729> a<00:00:40.760> team

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
because we were not working with a team

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.959 
because we were not working with a team
of<00:00:41.120> like<00:00:41.510> many<00:00:42.170> producers<00:00:42.530> who<00:00:43.100> hold<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.819> by

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
of like many producers who hold you by

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.750 
of like many producers who hold you by
the<00:00:44.030> hand<00:00:44.269> so<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.839> I<00:00:45.559> think<00:00:45.620> that<00:00:45.889> yeah<00:00:46.729> I

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
the hand so and I think that yeah I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.819 
the hand so and I think that yeah I
think<00:00:46.879> it<00:00:47.149> matters<00:00:47.479> a<00:00:47.510> lot<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.049> I<00:00:48.469> think<00:00:48.499> he

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
think it matters a lot and I think he

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.639 
think it matters a lot and I think he
was<00:00:48.979> also<00:00:49.370> all<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.510> time<00:00:50.719> kind<00:00:51.019> of<00:00:51.139> keeping<00:00:51.499> in

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
was also all the time kind of keeping in

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.799 
was also all the time kind of keeping in
mind<00:00:51.679> that<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.579> songs<00:00:52.879> kind<00:00:53.269> of<00:00:53.389> remained

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
mind that the songs kind of remained

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.410 
mind that the songs kind of remained
true<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.139> the<00:00:55.039> initial<00:00:55.519> idea<00:00:55.879> that<00:00:56.089> we<00:00:56.209> had

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
true to the initial idea that we had

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.619 
true to the initial idea that we had
when<00:00:56.719> we<00:00:56.780> wrote<00:00:57.109> them<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.389> yeah<00:00:59.389> I<00:00:59.420> definitely

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
when we wrote them so yeah I definitely

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.819 
when we wrote them so yeah I definitely
think<00:01:00.289> that<00:01:01.209> in<00:01:02.209> that<00:01:02.269> way<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.869> put<00:01:03.289> its<00:01:03.469> mark

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
think that in that way it put its mark

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.090 
think that in that way it put its mark
on<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.699> record<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:05.840> what<00:01:06.410> time<00:01:06.710> span<00:01:07.070> that

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
on the record and what time span that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.950 
on the record and what time span that
was<00:01:07.430> there<00:01:07.640> was<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:07.970> record<00:01:08.750> breaker

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
was there was this record breaker

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.500 
was there was this record breaker
written<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:10.580> hard<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:10.820> say<00:01:10.910> because<00:01:11.240> we

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
written it's hard to say because we

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.110 
written it's hard to say because we
usually<00:01:11.690> usually<00:01:12.620> right<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.490> know<00:01:13.610> anywhere

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
usually usually right you know anywhere

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.260 
usually usually right you know anywhere
between<00:01:14.560> one<00:01:15.560> or<00:01:15.590> one<00:01:16.280> or<00:01:16.310> three<00:01:16.640> times<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:17.240> week

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
between one or one or three times a week

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.740 
between one or one or three times a week
and<00:01:17.780> evening<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.800> couple<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.220> hours<00:01:19.580> so<00:01:20.330> it's

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
and evening a couple of hours so it's

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.320 
and evening a couple of hours so it's
not<00:01:20.900> like<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.440> sit<00:01:21.740> down<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.220> studio<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.000> we

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
not like we sit down in a studio and we

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.720 
not like we sit down in a studio and we
only<00:01:23.480> come<00:01:23.810> out<00:01:23.870> when<00:01:24.260> we<00:01:24.440> when<00:01:25.190> we<00:01:25.220> finish<00:01:25.610> the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
only come out when we when we finish the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.910 
only come out when we when we finish the
album<00:01:25.850> which<00:01:26.210> was<00:01:26.240> kind<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.720> more<00:01:26.990> with<00:01:27.770> our

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
album which was kind of more with our

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.830 
album which was kind of more with our
previous<00:01:28.460> record<00:01:28.970> where<00:01:29.120> we<00:01:29.270> really<00:01:29.570> just

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
previous record where we really just

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.820 
previous record where we really just
spent<00:01:30.170> two<00:01:30.770> months<00:01:30.980> in<00:01:31.250> Sweden<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:33.290> rewrite

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
spent two months in Sweden to to rewrite

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.390 
spent two months in Sweden to to rewrite
everything<00:01:34.300> but<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.570> think<00:01:35.930> we<00:01:36.080> kind<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:37.210> we<00:01:38.210> I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
everything but I think we kind of we I

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.940 
everything but I think we kind of we I
think<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.700> beginning<00:01:40.850> of<00:01:41.150> last<00:01:41.390> summer<00:01:41.950> we

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
think in the beginning of last summer we

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.540 
think in the beginning of last summer we
started<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.700> really<00:01:44.690> write<00:01:45.020> write<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:45.830> lot<00:01:46.040> so

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
started to really write write a lot so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.090 
started to really write write a lot so
from<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:47.690> to<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:51.260> beginning<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.620> January

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
from then to to the beginning of January

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.820 
from then to to the beginning of January
when<00:01:52.370> we<00:01:52.520> deliver<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.150> master<00:01:53.540> well<00:01:54.320> because

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
when we deliver the master well because

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.210 
when we deliver the master well because
it's<00:01:55.490> quite<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:56.020> estimation<00:01:57.020> before<00:01:57.320> it's<00:01:58.040> the

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
it's quite a estimation before it's the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.940

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
well to to our music so it's also just a

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.559 
well to to our music so it's also just a
matter<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.739> timing<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.910> course<00:03:01.209> it<00:03:01.420> would

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
matter of timing and of course it would

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.710 
matter of timing and of course it would
have<00:03:01.660> been<00:03:01.780> possible<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.410> release<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.340> later

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
have been possible to release it later

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.569 
have been possible to release it later
but<00:03:04.720> yeah<00:03:05.260> we<00:03:05.440> were<00:03:05.590> kind<00:03:05.889> of<00:03:05.980> aiming<00:03:06.340> for<00:03:06.519> the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
but yeah we were kind of aiming for the

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.099 
but yeah we were kind of aiming for the
right<00:03:06.730> moment<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.209> have<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.510> perfect<00:03:07.720> setup

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
right moment to have the perfect setup

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.580 
right moment to have the perfect setup
and<00:03:08.760> we<00:03:09.760> thought<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.329> this<00:03:10.989> would<00:03:11.230> be<00:03:11.290> the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
and we thought that this would be the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.390 
and we thought that this would be the
right<00:03:11.799> moment<00:03:12.359> yeah<00:03:13.359> well<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:15.220> also

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
second second guess a lot of things that

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.539 
second second guess a lot of things that
we're<00:03:47.739> doing<00:03:47.859> so<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:50.319> we<00:03:51.069> just<00:03:51.400> basically

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549

so<00:03:53.920> sometimes<00:03:54.430> we<00:03:54.670> have<00:03:54.819> made<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.239> choice<00:03:55.450> to

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
so sometimes we have made the choice to

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.949 
so sometimes we have made the choice to
to<00:03:57.099> work<00:03:57.310> with<00:03:57.489> less<00:03:57.790> because<00:03:58.180> we<00:03:58.480> thought<00:03:58.660> you

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
to work with less because we thought you

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.180 
to work with less because we thought you
know<00:03:59.019> whatever<00:03:59.319> we<00:03:59.650> kind<00:03:59.859> of<00:03:59.919> have<00:04:00.069> to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
know whatever we kind of have to

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.979 
know whatever we kind of have to
establish<00:04:00.370> ourselves<00:04:00.970> as<00:04:01.359> a<00:04:01.419> band<00:04:01.660> more

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
establish ourselves as a band more

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.440 
establish ourselves as a band more
independently<00:04:02.650> from<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.250> know<00:04:03.400> who<00:04:04.180> works

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
independently from you know who works

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.449 
independently from you know who works
with<00:04:04.720> us<00:04:04.930> but<00:04:05.230> at<00:04:05.260> this<00:04:05.560> point<00:04:05.829> you<00:04:06.099> know<00:04:06.130> we've

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
with us but at this point you know we've

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.220 
with us but at this point you know we've
been<00:04:06.489> going<00:04:06.880> at<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.030> for<00:04:07.180> like<00:04:07.359> eight<00:04:07.660> years<00:04:07.690> by

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
been going at it for like eight years by

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.770 
been going at it for like eight years by
now<00:04:08.439> so<00:04:09.220> we<00:04:09.430> thought<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.540> is<00:04:10.750> not

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
now so we thought that that is not

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.520 
now so we thought that that is not
something<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.560> we<00:04:11.650> really<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:12.099> to

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
something that we really have to

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.500 
something that we really have to
not<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.680> consider<00:04:14.980> until<00:04:15.460> that<00:04:15.670> extent

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
not to consider until that extent

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.319 
not to consider until that extent
anymore<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.250> we<00:04:18.250> have<00:04:18.370> chosen<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.850> work<00:04:19.030> with

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
anymore and we have chosen to work with

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.090 
anymore and we have chosen to work with
some<00:04:19.540> of<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.780> guests<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.109> we're<00:04:20.350> actually<00:04:20.560> a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
some of the guests that we're actually a

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.610 
some of the guests that we're actually a
part<00:04:21.579> of<00:04:21.670> our<00:04:21.820> music<00:04:22.210> on<00:04:22.840> our<00:04:23.080> first<00:04:23.320> two

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
part of our music on our first two

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.490 
part of our music on our first two
records<00:04:24.450> yeah<00:04:25.450> most<00:04:25.690> notably<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.140> think

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
records yeah most notably I think

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.560 
records yeah most notably I think
mercury<00:04:27.160> eat<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.430> lot<00:04:27.700> since<00:04:27.910> he<00:04:28.000> was<00:04:28.240> under

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
mercury eat a lot since he was under

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.340 
mercury eat a lot since he was under
both<00:04:29.200> of<00:04:29.950> our<00:04:30.160> first<00:04:30.460> records<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.060> he<00:04:31.960> kind<00:04:32.230> of

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
both of our first records and he kind of

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.500 
both of our first records and he kind of
became<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.770> really<00:04:33.220> prominent<00:04:33.700> part<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.390> her

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
became a really prominent part of her

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.890 
became a really prominent part of her
sound<00:04:34.810> back<00:04:35.170> then<00:04:35.410> so<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:37.150> cost<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.660> fact

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
sound back then so this cost the fact

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.780 
sound back then so this cost the fact
that<00:04:38.020> whenever<00:04:38.290> we<00:04:38.680> write<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:39.010> song<00:04:39.310> we<00:04:39.550> try<00:04:39.730> to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
that whenever we write a song we try to

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.310 
that whenever we write a song we try to
imagine<00:04:40.090> male<00:04:40.420> vocals<00:04:40.870> we<00:04:41.050> kind<00:04:41.260> of

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
imagine male vocals we kind of

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.230 
imagine male vocals we kind of
automatically<00:04:41.860> imagine<00:04:42.280> his<00:04:42.460> male<00:04:42.730> vocals

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240

automatically imagine his male vocals
and<00:04:43.650> yeah<00:04:44.650> we<00:04:44.830> thought<00:04:45.040> what<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.490> hell<00:04:45.640> we

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
and yeah we thought what the hell we

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.730 
and yeah we thought what the hell we
just<00:04:46.060> ask<00:04:46.330> him<00:04:46.600> again<00:04:46.870> he<00:04:47.140> was<00:04:47.320> happy<00:04:47.620> to

very first record and I kind of think
that<00:05:00.430> it's<00:05:00.640> cool<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:00.910> this<00:05:01.300> record<00:05:01.720> in<00:05:01.990> that

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
that it's cool that this record in that

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.750 
that it's cool that this record in that
way<00:05:02.350> refers<00:05:02.740> back<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.040> our<00:05:03.220> first<00:05:03.460> records

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
way refers back to our first records

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.750 
way refers back to our first records
