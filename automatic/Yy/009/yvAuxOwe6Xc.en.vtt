00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.560
 to have 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.280
 more questions 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.289
 my opinion about the first date 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:33.600
 perfect the reason is good because the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.790
 hearts this is the second video that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.010
 I told you that I bring you that I record you 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.730
 I bring you today is also advice 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.550
 well the second as I said is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.470

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.470

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.130
 How can I tell you terma marmosets I have 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.100

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.989
 malet also that matisse the area a 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 mixture is worth at the end I'm sure the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.250
 area of ​​here is worth the frown only 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.340

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.400
 eyebrows and good and around here is also 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.410
 quite uncomfortable 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.890
 For example, the hands you make if you have 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.890
 eczema 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.630

 makeup stores that have that in 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.830
 etc 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.970

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.250

 make up stories what is called a make 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.440
 up stories one I remember very well is 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.280
 an old helmet store that you can 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.369
 find you have then you have tennis 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.890
 you have 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.360
 you have creams of 6-3 lots of things 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 good knicks there you have a lot of 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.640
 marks tristan monte sion er 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.709
 and good for me for now is the one 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.850
 It has gone better for me and I is that good 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.290
 next you are not going to notice that good 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.300
 I when uruguay the skin seems that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.600
 I have the skin of a grandmother vaguely not 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.930
 he 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.330
 although this is due I do not know if it should 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.000
 lose a lot around here even though it 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.150
 should eczemas good 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.790
 temperature change 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.360
 it's like an example I wash my hands with 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.260
 cold water 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.739
 dry candles 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.569
 temperature you go to the hot water shower 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.510
 change of temperature you go to the street 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.060
 It is cold, changing temperature 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.269
 the hands suffer the hands arise in the 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.000
 body and what happens as the skin becomes dry 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.610
 it starts then as to crack not 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.840
 exactly but to get rough the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.959
 skin and I advise you to have good 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.239
 the skin seemingly hydrated 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.890
 hands if your skin because because to the 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.390
 minimum with these time changes that 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.700
 we are so crazy that it rains access 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.790
 the heat suddenly one day and another day 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.269
 you go with the jacket and another day you go 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.840
 on another day low cards almost on 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.209
 temple days because you have to take care of yourself because 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.670
 we have is very bad especially here in 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.069
 the north in the north are missing the same 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.500
 very bad changes and well hydrated 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.510
 our skins I for example as you see 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.550
 do not throw the cream now for meaning 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.490
 we challenge children left me a little good 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.770
 As you can see I am going to tell you how to hydrate 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.470
 your pires because you know I 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.030
 I have done the births from the wrist 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.650
 also by the wrist suffers also 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.960
 between the fingers that I also usually 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.660
 come out extreme and they hydrate very well 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.900
 is the skin and well then so simple 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.900
 like that so that it does not dry out and good 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.510
 it will take me days to heal because 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.740
 with this time for it to be healed and 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.110
 then there is a part of the type there is also 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.890
 days I forget to throw cream on me 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.420
 imagine yourself taking twice as long but 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.440
 Well, what I do is throw myself out 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.390
 example 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.239
 4 I get up well after eating more 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.970
 well I have done then then I made myself 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.709
 also before sleep because that's how good 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.180
 dries better and as I'm not going to walk 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.520
 the computer or the phone and nothing 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.319
 good 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.080
 and as you can see, I have a lot of skin 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.870
 sprinkle is noticeable because you will not see 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.639
 but when you throw the cream it stays like no 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.120
 I know how to tell you the batteries and others chase 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.370
 as it has been is a rare thing 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.169
 and it does not take long to absorb what is 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.129
 the palms and it takes a little bit a while 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.620
 little less to be absorbed here in 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.190
 this area does not 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.070
 it does not take long the truth I do not know and that's how it is 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.620
 that you take care that you have to hydrate 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.760
 the skin the face and so on etcetera in 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.389
 all sides 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.880
 they were peeling and then nothing to tell you that 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.280
 I told them if I said thousands of times that 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.729
 I was going to record today we are going to record the video 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.979
 of make up josu video bets 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.840
 but is that this time does not accompany another 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.639
 part that we see the two of us have been 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.760
 with flu I was a lot more time 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.130
 with flu three weeks imagine more 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.889
 Of course, if it is cold depressed 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.690
 same record but yes good there is also 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.160
 what to see with a lot of wind because what happens 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.160
 that the camera is going to be taken by bag and 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.380
 you stay and quantity 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.780
 and because we're looking at birds one day 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.640
 end a stable day ago we can 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.800
 he can come and be able to 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.310
 wash quietly in the park and 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.410
 put us on the job so to 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.670
 see if there is luck of a sandal 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.370
 accompanies a little the time we can 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.170
 stay one day one morning and we recorded that 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.170
 I want to director mile 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.400

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.190
 a lot of pity because we are doing 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.610
