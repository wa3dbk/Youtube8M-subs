the main of lure or the main attraction
we<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.100> camera<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.789> I<00:01:12.300> think

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
we will have to this camera is I think

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.320 
we will have to this camera is I think
it's<00:01:12.659> its<00:01:13.110> simplicity<00:01:13.890> there's<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> whole

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
it's its simplicity there's not a whole

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.520 
it's its simplicity there's not a whole
lot<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.539> it<00:01:15.979> it's<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> medium<00:01:17.399> format<00:01:17.610> film<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
lot to it it's a medium format film and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.020 
lot to it it's a medium format film and
the<00:01:19.530> focusing<00:01:20.039> are<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.700> symbols

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the focusing are these little symbols

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.749 
the focusing are these little symbols
here<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:22.289> people<00:01:22.319> like<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.369> Holga

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
here what people like about the Holga

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.199 
here what people like about the Holga
is<00:01:23.970> how<00:01:24.390> simple<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.459> there's<00:01:26.459> not<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.199 --> 00:01:27.209 
is how simple it is there's not a lot of

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:28.160 
is how simple it is there's not a lot of
controls<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
controls on it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.850 
controls on it
you<00:01:28.289> have<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.799> focusing<00:01:29.869> points<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.229> it's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
you have your focusing points here it's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
you have your focusing points here it's
like<00:01:32.039> one<00:01:32.310> person<00:01:32.340> three<00:01:33.240> people<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.780> crowd<00:01:33.959> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
like one person three people a crowd and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.419 
like one person three people a crowd and
then<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.130> mountain<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.970> infinity<00:01:37.340> it's<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
then a mountain for infinity it's a

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.520 
then a mountain for infinity it's a
fixed<00:01:39.319> 60<00:01:40.319> millimeter<00:01:40.770> f/8<00:01:41.759> lens<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.229> needs

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
fixed 60 millimeter f/8 lens so it needs

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.910 
fixed 60 millimeter f/8 lens so it needs
plenty<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> sunlight<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.740> cool

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
plenty of sunlight and it's it's a cool

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.219 
plenty of sunlight and it's it's a cool
camera<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.479> plastic<00:01:48.719> it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
camera because it's all plastic it's

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.919 
camera because it's all plastic it's
very<00:01:49.469> inexpensive<00:01:49.939> it's<00:01:50.939> prone<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
very inexpensive it's prone to like a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.120 
very inexpensive it's prone to like a
lot<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> light<00:01:53.189> leaks<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.969> lo5
