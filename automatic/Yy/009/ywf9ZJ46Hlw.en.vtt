issues is one of them is volume throw in
some<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.489> volume<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.150> having<00:01:06.479> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
some more volume are you having a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
some more volume are you having a
legging<00:01:06.930> muscle<00:01:07.260> group<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.710> you're<00:01:07.830> trying

to develop is your chest legging are

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
to develop is your chest legging are
your<00:01:10.049> delts<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.590> legs<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:11.070> hands<00:01:11.250> whatever

your delts your legs your hands whatever
the<00:01:11.939> muscle<00:01:12.240> group<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.990> lagging<00:01:13.189> one

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the muscle group is is it lagging one

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.249 
the muscle group is is it lagging one
thing<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.150> lot<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.990> people

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
thing that you can do a lot of people

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 
thing that you can do a lot of people
focus<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.740> frequency<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.490> everything<00:01:17.759> too

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
focus on frequency and everything too

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.190 
focus on frequency and everything too
which<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.090> great<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.750> wonderful<00:01:18.930> i

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
which is great which is wonderful i

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.719 
which is great which is wonderful i
think<00:01:19.380> frequency<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.979> important<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> maybe

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
think frequency is important to maybe

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.550 
think frequency is important to maybe
train<00:01:21.030> arms<00:01:21.299> twice<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> week<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.439> or

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
train arms twice a week you know or

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.770 
train arms twice a week you know or
however<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.220> set<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.090> i

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
however you want to set it up but i

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
however you want to set it up but i
think<00:01:25.049> volume<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> also<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> great<00:01:26.340> tool<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
think volume is also a great tool that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
think volume is also a great tool that
is<00:01:27.060> underestimated<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.049> help<00:01:28.320> induce

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
is underestimated to help induce

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.190 
is underestimated to help induce
hypertrophy<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:29.939> growth<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.659> stimulate
