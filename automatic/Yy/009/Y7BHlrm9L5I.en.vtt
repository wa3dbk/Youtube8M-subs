00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.200
 Today we will talk about the new jo jo q 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.700
 sony santa monica and a game in the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.670
 that everything comes down to moving around the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.340
 scenario we do it in normal mode 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.340
 Quick 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.340
 slow 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.320
 or super fast while we stay in 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.680
 let's move with its beautiful shapes and 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.680
 colors 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.220
 I admit to have special devotion for 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.020
 this kind of games remember me 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.690
 spent weeks hooked on the pixel junk 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.910
 eden of q20 and it relaxes me a lot to play 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.290
 to these crazy things without pretension 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.290
 see how the hours go by without control 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.309
 for being an atypical game one of those in 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.440
 those that goal markers 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.120
 they shine by their absence and the one that arrives 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.190
 of new probably do not know very well 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.870
 what is going to face we decided 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.320
 make this video to show you how 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.320
 works 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.940
 is a game with no cuts so more or 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.260
 least you can get an idea that 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.470
 the challenge can come to offer their 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.470
 puzzles 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.150
 each zone has its particular appearance 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 it's like you see park of 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.110
 attractions gone through an overdose of 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.000
 acid and our goal in these 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.130
 curious places will always be moving 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.650
 on the stage looking for what 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.990
 we can interact and how it affects their 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.280
 characters and objects the passage of our 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.280
 snake above them 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.280
 the objective in each of these zones 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.780
 is to find a lost snake a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.570
 challenge that will be completed when activating 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.370
 mechanisms to carry out concrete actions to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.760
 bring characters and objects from a site 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.760
 to another 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.289
 As you can see here there are different puzzles and 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.880
 each of them gives us a new 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.929
 piece for the roller coaster that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.929
 found in the center of the stage 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.340
 much of the grace of the game resides 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 precisely there in those walks that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.480
 We do every time we encounter 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.519
 a new area looking for the Kazakh 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.620
 that what clues are in the area that 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.019
 can they make our 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.189
 objective but also enjoy the 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.189
 animations that populate the area 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.020
 you can remember the images of 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.880
 looking for wally or looking for a simile 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.310
 let us touch more closely those 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.380
 Yungas hobby books in 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.880
 which part of the challenge was to find 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.880
 funny or unusual situations 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.170
 It is a curious and entertaining proposal 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.659
 although as often happens with this type of 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.400
 titles also something short we're 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.769
 accustomed to these experiences so 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.560
 fleeting as satisfactory but the 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.049
 problem of this game cum is another one 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.760
 that precisely because of the style of play 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.760
 that is we did not think to find 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.439
 I'm talking about how short -sighted you can 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.170
 become to present us the puzzles 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.629
 sometimes repetitive in others 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.489
 totally predictable and in others what 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.280
 smart enough to join 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.930
 the few options it has and shape 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.140
 to a fantastic battle against a boss 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.140
 final 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.190
 I explain 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.320
 following this same mechanics that you can 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.090
 see on screen of moving characters 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.910
 we will have to face the elephant 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.950
 giant of a module hunter for 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.890
 we will feed the rest of the apes 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.390
 we will transport ourselves to the enemy and 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.550
 there we will have to dodge projectiles 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.050
 while the monicacos throw fruit 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.850
 elephant up to release his mate 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.100
 it becomes as simple as the rest of the 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.480
 game is true but it is inevitable 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.310
 think that at that moment the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.910
 designers were a lot more 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.910
 inspired 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.959
 we were looking for something more than a simple 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.460
 visual display that is precisely what 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.350
 that saves you from burning when you deliver 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.150
 moments as special as the ones 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.400
 first minutes of the game 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.930
 at that time accompanied by all 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.850
 snakes that will then be lost between 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.410
 puzzles we attend a dance 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.449
 synchronized that we control with the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.449
 stick and that is a real wonder 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.640
 being aware of that you already know that 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.780
 you are going to find an enjoyable game 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.490
 if you approach him without many 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.990
 pretensions but by no means the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.580
 indie stamp wonder that could 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.600
 appear because of how well it enters the 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.550
 eyes 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.500
 a pity that the work in the section 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.340
 artistic is so above the 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.230
 ideas from the designers 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.389
 often gives the impression that what 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.410
 first they ate second and then 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.410
 the mixture goes to the rack 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.419
 in short eye cum is enjoyable more 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.150
 that a simple good game but nothing more 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.860
 his appearance is his best asset but at the 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.120
 playable few times get to be at 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.070
 height 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.600
 neither does it encourage you to recommend your purchase 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.880
 make it one of those titles that seems 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.770
 meat of playstation plus especially 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.139
 now gameplay 614 the service seems 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.139
 lack of really juicy news 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.479
 like those who sit 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.490
 attracted by the idea but it should be 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.150
 very fan to remember him with affection 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.150
 in a few years
