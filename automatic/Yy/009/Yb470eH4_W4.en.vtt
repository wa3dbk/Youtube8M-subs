kind<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.720> stick<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.520> bend<00:02:17.910> it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
kind of like a stick so you can bend it

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.630 
kind of like a stick so you can bend it
a<00:02:18.270> little<00:02:18.300> bit<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.990> then<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:20.010> would<00:02:20.130> be<00:02:20.250> really

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
a little bit and then it would be really

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.290 
a little bit and then it would be really
good<00:02:21.150> as<00:02:21.500> eyebrow<00:02:22.500> brush<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.120> make
