someone asked the following question why

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.810 
someone asked the following question why
does<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.990> take<00:00:10.139> more<00:00:10.349> XP<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.889> go<00:00:11.010> from<00:00:11.219> level<00:00:11.460> 11

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
does it take more XP to go from level 11

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.879 
does it take more XP to go from level 11
to<00:00:12.059> level<00:00:12.300> 12<00:00:12.570> than<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.290> does<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.620> go<00:00:13.740> from

that<00:00:16.440> even<00:00:16.740> come<00:00:16.980> from<00:00:17.010> I'm<00:00:17.490> playing<00:00:18.060> MMORPG

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that even come from I'm playing MMORPG

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.359 
that even come from I'm playing MMORPG
right<00:00:18.960> now<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.650> idea<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.130> really

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
right now and that idea is really

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.189 
right now and that idea is really
ticking<00:00:20.550> me<00:00:20.699> off<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.240> guess<00:00:21.720> maybe<00:00:21.990> it's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
ticking me off I guess maybe it's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.570 
ticking me off I guess maybe it's
modeling<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> idea<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.250> harder<00:00:23.490> to

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
modeling the idea that it's harder to

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.200 
modeling the idea that it's harder to
learn<00:00:23.699> stuff<00:00:24.000> when<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:24.539> more<00:00:25.880> now<00:00:26.880> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
learn stuff when you know more now I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.359 
learn stuff when you know more now I
think<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.810> answer<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.320> question<00:00:28.380> from

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
think I can answer this question from

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950 
think I can answer this question from
the<00:00:29.490> way<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> look<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.510> are<00:00:30.630> various

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the way I look at it there are various

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.569 
the way I look at it there are various
good<00:00:31.199> reasons<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:31.710> doing<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.340> none<00:00:32.520> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
good reasons for doing this and none of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.069 
good reasons for doing this and none of
them<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:32.940> anything<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.480> modeling

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
them have anything to do with modeling

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
them have anything to do with modeling
something<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.500> reality<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.610> reason<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
something in reality the reason for the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.850 
something in reality the reason for the
discrepancy<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.590> takes<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
discrepancy in the time it takes to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740 
discrepancy in the time it takes to
level<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.190> later<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> game<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.270> because

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
level up later on in the game is because

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600 
level up later on in the game is because
early<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.200> leveling<00:00:40.739> should<00:00:40.920> come<00:00:41.129> quick<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
early on leveling should come quick to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.880 
early on leveling should come quick to

that is a whole nother topic on its own
now<00:02:45.860> another<00:02:46.190> reason<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.970> many<00:02:47.210> games
