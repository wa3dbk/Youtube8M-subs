00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hello 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:10.370
 Business petit course of Yoshino plum 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.370
 Delivered from Kyoto of Gion Festival 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:21.900
 Wording of Tereapo success I think I want to tell this 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:25.050
 What I will tell from now on is the eastern part I found myself as a newcomer 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.009
 There were people who were 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:35.610
 I still believed that my exaggeration was white 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:37.430
 We wanted to take the tomorrow of apo somehow apo can not be taken is said to Tossa by telephone 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.150
 I guess 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:49.250
 It is 10 am tomorrow, so I can still take reservations for now 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 I asked if it was 10 o'clock tomorrow, but this was born from the package 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.910
 It was an opportunity 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.769
 I said that it would still be possible to make a reservation if it was 10 am tomorrow 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.579
 Who is the reservation 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.830
 It is my reservation 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:10.480
 Heat customers san seemed a little big, but I said, 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:15.970
 I heard that it was only 10 o'clock that tomorrow 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.870
 In So I'm good at any time and are contained in the ginger is not so does not go to Iuwake 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.620
 Was 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.160
 And When the audience is young lady. 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.820
 It is Tan said at 10:00 thank you and of the 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.120
 Standing or daddy did 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.830
 It was a circulation 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:36.409
 In addition I went actually to the next morning at 10 I was Ocha' it to this 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.979
 I asked if it was only 10 o'clock that morning 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.380
 Since it can not be said at any time it is good and was also entered 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:48.049
 And you were saying your way 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:54.080
 After all, the products of Uta-ku are nasty 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:58.230
 Everyone listens to explanations, so I thought I would also listen once 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 Also I mon not know or get to the next is always come 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.600
 And if it was this moment, it would be effective 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.330
 I built myself 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.360
 It is said that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.480
 He said he was reservoir words I is good at any time 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.900
 If it was water on the contrary, it is still for now 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.760
 It is that more of such words is good, which can be in trying to burn the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.780
 It is a tape that can make a big change with a little difference of words 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.780
 Please try it by all means
