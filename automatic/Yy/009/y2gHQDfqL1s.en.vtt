 Marca Tunes 

00:00:06.517 --> 00:00:07.693
 Casillas calls friends 

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:11.703
 Yes, of course we have to solve it. 

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:16.301
 Well, that's it! This guy's talking all day with Xavi on the phone. I'm going to take care of it. 

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:18.374
 Yes, I love you too, baby. 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:20.761
 honey? So it's really serious between you and Xavi ... 

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.633
 Bye, Sarah. - Sarah? Was not that Xavi? 

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:24.305
 You said you had to solve something. 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.432
 Yes. We have to change the day we set for dinner with her parents. Why? 

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:30.134
 With whose parents? Xavi's? - Forget about it. 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.125
 Give me your phone. 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.462
 Good. Six Two Nine ... 

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:36.409
 No! Not the phone number. Give me the device. 

00:00:36.444 --> 00:00:37.800
 Why? Do you need to make a call? 

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:41.768
 No. I want you to not be able to make calls or receive calls. So you can not talk to Casillas. 

00:00:41.803 --> 00:00:43.113
 I hardly speak to Casillas. 

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:47.266
 Yeah sure. You talk on the phone all day, and you take it out of concentration. - I am? Maybe it was Sara? 

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:51.339
 Obviously. And yesterday when they called about a proposal from Cellcom? "Maybe it was Cellcom. 

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:56.187
 I do not think so. It's you. You try to incite against me. You're pseudo-Madrid! Barcelona. 

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.978
 Same. Give me the phone. 

00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:00.722
 No. More than that, I'll call Casillas and tell him what's going on. 

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:02.194
 Do not you dare! - what is going on here? 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.971
 Mourinho wants to take my mobile. - Oh. 

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.404
 Mourinho wants to take my cell phone! - What ?! I will not let that happen. 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.644
 Who wants to take what to whom? "What the fucker husband does here?" 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.911
 You do not scare me. I have no problem fighting you. 

00:01:13.946 --> 00:01:15.076
 so come on. - Why not? 

00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:17.693
 As soon as I push you a little, you'll just throw yourself on the floor, as always. 

00:01:18.104 --> 00:01:21.198
 Ikir, Xavi calls you. "I'm in the bathroom." 

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:23.591
 Yes? - Give me the phone! 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.472
 What did Xavi want? 

00:01:27.507 --> 00:01:32.201
 Uh ... uh ... he wanted ... uh ... 

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:34.640
 Ask me something else. please. 

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:40.441
 On Shabbat we'll have a real celebration. Real Madrid vs. Getafe. 

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:43.297
 Do not talk to me about it. - Are you nervous? 

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:48.339
 No way? No. Actually ... maybe a little. That is... 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.689
 I'm very nervous! - but why? - We're playing against Getafe. 

00:01:53.724 --> 00:01:57.954
 What if Pedro Leon scored against us? And it turns out that in the end he was good? 

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:01.748
 Pedro Leon will not play. According to his contract he can not play against Madrid. 

00:02:01.783 --> 00:02:07.138
 Oh no? Well, he would not do anything like that, Pedro Leon. 

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:10.532
 Now I'm relaxed. "You're so dumb."
