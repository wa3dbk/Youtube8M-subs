00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.009
 hi little zenith today we will go down to the peninsula 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:17.119
 Iberian 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.109
 to teach you some flamenco chords 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.140
 you will see it is very nice nothing very complicated 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.609
 five agreements including a sequence of two agreements 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.300
 which sounds divinely good flamenco 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.500
 normally flamenco played on a rather atypical guitar stanic at 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.880
 classic with nylon ropes 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.080
 but not having classical guitars that I'm going to play light on my 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.960
 acoustic guitar with metal strings 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.530
 it sounds a little less well but it's still flamenco chords 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.240
 it starts with a mine leader 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.590
 embedded 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.590
 or by granting Bahrain like this 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.190
 so beautiful 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.500
 to master it 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 this lifting 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.940
 and the two agreements 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.460
 typical flamenco 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.650
 the milan gr 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 the wall 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 and you to the advanced fingers all the fingers of a box 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.010
 like a hungry sambare 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.010
 we called that the flamenco accord 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.890
 and come back in mua pictures 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.360
 the mic the flamenco chord come back on him 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.500
 Holy saÃ«ns 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.460
 in a balloon 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
 cfa which is flexible 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.130
 people think about it reminds me of episodes 2 euros 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.590
 normally there is a pretty little part 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.089
 in arpeggios that accompany these chords 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:12.809
 I just want to make a little demo to put you a little bit 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:13.859
 mouth watering 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.560
 and I'll explain it on an upcoming video what's going to be a little bit 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.069
 longer 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 it starts like that 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.739
 then 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.939
 but angela merkel i do not agree 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.229
 the flamenco requires five fingers of the right hand very clever if you do not 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:20.290
 do not know just like me you can always serve you I do not present 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.019
 more 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.149
 of these little ones 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:24.499
 media create 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.499
 the safer rhythmic 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
 bravo to the changes 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.029
 marco change 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.590
 do not forget the title is our eyebrows 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.590
 for them that sounds more Spanish 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.089
 there it will come 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.089
 % 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.659
 nothing 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.759
 no 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:21.589
