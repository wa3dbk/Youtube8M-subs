position<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> gqf<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.409> looking

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
position on the gqf so it's looking

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499

pretty<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.159> qualification<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.299> next

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
pretty good for qualification for next

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.080 
pretty good for qualification for next
year<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> ease<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.100> these

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
year so it's going to ease that these

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.460 
year so it's going to ease that these
are<00:01:27.330> pressure<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> rest<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> year

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
