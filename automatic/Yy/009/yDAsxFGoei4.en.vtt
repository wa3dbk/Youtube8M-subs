increases attack speed by three percent

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.849 
increases attack speed by three percent
and<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.660> three<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.900> ten<00:00:22.050> damage<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.769> might

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
be saying oh well it's four to twelve

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.509 
be saying oh well it's four to twelve
damage<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.320> super<00:00:25.680> high<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
damage is super high and this and that

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.929 
damage is super high and this and that
but<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.599> actually<00:00:27.630> does<00:00:28.050> more<00:00:28.380> damage<00:00:28.460> than<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
but it actually does more damage than a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.959 
but it actually does more damage than a
head<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:31.019> two<00:00:31.289> three<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.769> 12s<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.489> like

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
head like two three to 12s with like

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.930 
head like two three to 12s with like
crit<00:00:33.270> damage<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.780> them<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.710> ring<00:00:35.010> does<00:00:35.250> more

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
crit damage on them this ring does more

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
crit damage on them this ring does more
damage<00:00:36.559> than<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> other<00:00:37.860> ones

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
damage than the other ones

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.069 
damage than the other ones
and<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.940> well<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.780> three<00:00:40.020> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and as well as this one it's three to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
and as well as this one it's three to
nine<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.469> has<00:00:40.620> attack<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> increased

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
nine but has attack on it and increased

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.830 
nine but has attack on it and increased
attack<00:00:41.969> speed<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> increased<00:00:42.690> attack

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
attack speed so the increased attack

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
attack speed so the increased attack
speed<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.649> boosting<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.129> DPS<00:00:44.550> by<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
speed is really boosting your DPS by a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.670 
speed is really boosting your DPS by a
really<00:00:45.210> high<00:00:45.750> percentage<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.760> also<00:00:47.760> got<00:00:48.030> um

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
really high percentage I also got um

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.130 
really high percentage I also got um
this<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.610> these<00:00:50.789> gloves<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.660> +1

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
this I think it was these gloves with +1

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.549 
this I think it was these gloves with +1
attack<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.649> them<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:54.199> I<00:00:55.789> think<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.629> it

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.270 

yeah<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.809> that<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.710> reason<00:01:04.890> why<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:05.220> doing

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
yeah so that is the reason why I'm doing

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
yeah so that is the reason why I'm doing
so<00:01:05.460> much<00:01:05.640> more<00:01:05.850> damage<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.540> gloves<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.409> plus

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
so much more damage the gloves with plus

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.179 
so much more damage the gloves with plus
one<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:07.920> tech<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.090> ring<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.080> course<00:01:10.290> so

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
one more tech and the ring of course so

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.980 
one more tech and the ring of course so
go<00:01:11.520> ahead<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.670> take<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.060> look<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.780> bottom

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.590 

so<00:02:55.540> there<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.750> go<00:02:55.870> guys<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.790> shock<00:02:58.030> roams<00:02:58.240> it

so there you go guys the shock roams it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.070 
so there you go guys the shock roams it
seemed<00:02:58.840> like<00:02:58.960> it<00:02:59.080> did<00:02:59.200> work<00:02:59.490> not<00:03:00.490> sure<00:03:00.790> if<00:03:01.060> I<00:03:01.750> I

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
seemed like it did work not sure if I I

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.810 
seemed like it did work not sure if I I
think<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.710> faster<00:03:03.100> than<00:03:03.130> point<00:03:03.490> six

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
think it was faster than point six

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.430 
think it was faster than point six
because<00:03:04.180> he<00:03:04.330> didn't<00:03:04.540> even<00:03:04.630> scream<00:03:05.020> out<00:03:05.230> or

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
because he didn't even scream out or

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.010 
because he didn't even scream out or
laugh<00:03:05.650> or<00:03:05.860> anything<00:03:06.100> like<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.780> looks

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
laugh or anything like that so it looks

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.050 
laugh or anything like that so it looks
like<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.680> killed<00:03:09.190> him<00:03:09.340> really<00:03:09.670> really<00:03:09.700> fast

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
