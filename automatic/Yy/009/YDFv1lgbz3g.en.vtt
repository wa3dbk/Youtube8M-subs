00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.710
 to 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.830
 so 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.149
 good friends my name is evelyn pigeon 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.540
 jiménez ramírez I was born in tepic nayarit a 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.760
 day April 11 , 1992 but I am 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.100
 proudly from bay of 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.820
 flags and my inch of the future and 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.910
 san vicente 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.370
 first of all it was a big surprise 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.210
 but with a very and very emotional purpose 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.820
 and above all with a goal in which 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.129
 we have to visualize the progress and 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.409
 advance of our municipality I think that 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.659
 this opportunity was presented by the 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.210
 qualities that I developed in my 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.820
 demarcation and especially in something very 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.299
 cute in something very beautiful that is in the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.180
 catechesis of my future I want to leave 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.299
 very clear that it is not to take anything else 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.860
 the name or politicization of a 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.380
 candidate for alderman 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.689
 I think that candidate for alderman is a 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.790
 nickname what we have to focus on and 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.100
 we have to be very clear is that 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.290
 they are public servants born of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.170
 village for the people and for the people 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.670
 I think that's the job and the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.720
 performance that you have to perform a 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.490
 public server 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.550
 and especially with the popularity of a 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.180
 alderman I think that the greatest strength of 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.670
 represent a demarcation is to work 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.810
 as a team but have a solid team 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.340
 that represents honesty work 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.820
 formality and especially something very 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.740
 important because humility is nothing 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.800
 more than saying it out of the mouth 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.560
 you have to feel it, you have to make it feel 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.320
 you have to project it I think an alderman 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.300
 they are the bases that it has to have and this 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.910
 young man they have here in front of you 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.760
 I have said it is not politics is not born of 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.590
 politics is born from a public service the 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.500
 which is recognized in my community 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.130
 I want to make it very clear that pigeon 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.100
 jiménez has five axes five axes of 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.590
 proposals in which you want to cover 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.320
 the needs of your demarcation these 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.450
 five axes are born from the dialogue of going to 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.209
 knock door to door go talk 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.800
 with my inhabitants of my demarcation with 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.980
 my beautiful people of the future and san 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.580
 Vicente on which they focus first 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.640
 second education third support the field 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.680
 fourth something very important that I wear it 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.690
 in the flesh and that is a necessity 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.090
 fundamental infrastructure in the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.370
 public services I think it's something that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.000
 it is as a priority that we have to 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.220
 push not to cover the sun with a finger and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.160
 project it as a work that you have 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.920
 what to do but not to say it and not 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.690
 to do it but to give words but what 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.579
 demonstrate with facts and something very 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.150
 important that represents me as 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.220
 candidate that is support for women 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.590
 something very important that support for women 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.030
 to young mothers who 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.849
 they have some family but they are 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.129
 single that responsibility of that 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.840
 strength that feel that human warmth 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.239
 that a woman represents her in Bay of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.769
 flags I think it's to make it clear that 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.410
 in flags bay women have 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.150
 opportunity we have a voice we have a vote 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.190
 but we also have that strength to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.840
 project our municipality and be able to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.420
 move forward together with families 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.940
 because although they say it 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.010
 helping our children we can 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.010
 correct the adult problem 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.470
 the demands of the people is something that 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.840
 we listen day by day is something basic and 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.380
 something fundamental that I think from a 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.150
 City Hall is paramount and above all 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.390
 you have the projects and services 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.400
 to address them that I mean 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:15.520
 public services lighting drainage 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.590
 water service drinking water that's what 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.480
 what hurts my people the most, that's what 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.670
 that hurts makes him feel like a pigeon 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.220
 to enjoy this project love it 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.850
 get out with all the energy day by day and 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.220
 give everything and 100% to rescue the 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.230
 needs of my demarcation and as well as 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.690
 they tell me that it hurts that makes them 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.870
 lack that they need it that we forget 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.240
 I want to tell you something pigeon too 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.820
 live in that dove demarcation also 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.850
 he suffers day by day pigeon also what 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.610
 feels and that is why pigeon today is 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.460
 here in front of you fighting for this 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.770
 project that is not yours but is of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.480
 the demarcation 6 of bay of flags of 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.700
 the demarcation of the future of 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.670
 marking of the san vicente in bay of 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.860
 flags are drawn to us because we have 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.410
 an ample wealth because we are a 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.080
 tourist municipality because we give sources 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.960
 of employment because we have a wide range 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.380
 of services that catalog us as a 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.350
 first world municipality 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.710
 all dove to tell you jiménez 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.780
 go from house to house and the streets of 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.690
 future and san vicente I've noticed 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.810
 otherwise our society our 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.200
 community suffers day by day the lack of 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.930
 resource services and above all of 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.840
 sources of employment it is normal that bay of 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.720
 flags suffer these shortcomings in their 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.820
 populated when their tourist level is 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.330
 in higher rank 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.930
 I ask you you want me to go to 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.970
 flags follow that state of marginalization 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.510
 it is time that flags bay and its 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.450
 demarcation go ahead at your level 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.520
 tourist status is time that bay 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.830
 of flags you open the sources of 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.410
 employment is time that the families of 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.260
 Bay of flags sit on the level 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.540
 that your municipality is cataloged but 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.450
 It is also true that to achieve it, 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:16.530
 it's easy but that's why the youth 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:19.350
 the lack of employment and especially the 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.690
 want to get ahead come together make 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.020
 mix and that's what makes it strong so that 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.210
 paloma jiménez leave this society 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.330
 go out and fight to provide support and 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.010
 especially want to fight these 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.010
 needs in my demarcation 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.100
 simply because the word the 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.350
 strength and the heart of women is 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.390
 what it gives us to desire and what we 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.630
 catalog in that security that 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.850
 we will know how to answer but pigeon jiménez 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.550
 not for being a woman not for having a great 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.710
 heart leaves aside the strength of 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.230
 our men from our municipality 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.600
 This woman needs the strength of each 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.690
 one of its inhabitants young adults 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.460
 older men and women working that 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.460
 is what cataloga a paloma jiménez 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.520
 Y
