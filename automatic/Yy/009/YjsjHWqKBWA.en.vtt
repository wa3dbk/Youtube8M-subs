00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.840
 Thank you 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.900
 the fire service because it is a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.520
 very very hard and demanding service 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.439
 so then they are situations in which 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.360
 could be faced in any 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.580
 moment 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.210
 the fire department is to say go up to 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.890
 auto scale can be very good 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.260
 prepared for anything else but 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.810
 if one has vertigo then he can not 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.370
 can be a firefighter equally, if one 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.530
 You have claustrophobia and you get into a 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.239
 closed site with a lot of smoke and three 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.510
 Orient because neither are these last 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.239
 tests that are practically the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.550
 Definitive before recognition 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.620
 doctor are two tests to measure a the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.210
 vertigo theme that explain that no 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.860
 have not got vertigo for that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.380
 We use a self-scale test of 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.449
 up to 20 meters high and a test 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.570
 of claustrophobia since your work 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.720
 many times it makes us be introduced 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.850
 in somewhat narrow environments and in 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.950
 we can have a feeling of anguish 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.930
 Well, well, through a tube 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.310
 narrow in which the applicant is had 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.550
 to enter and cross it then 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.770
 we measure that they do not have claustrophobia to 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.180
 the narrow sites and it's also the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.700
 first time you do a test of 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.759
 claustrophobia what happens that the phrase 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.870
 put a smoke maze something else 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.500
 special 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.610
 because this in silos or phobias has little 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.990
 a tube of 10-12 meters 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.640
 and nothing more than in Madrid they are not very 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.140
 usual in fact I believe that we 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 we are the first ones that we are 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.190
 doing in the rest of Spain if there 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.230
 services that are doing them if not 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.790
 you are exactly others very similar and 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.610
 more or less you have done some climbing 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.770
 something is up there high, more or less in 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 the same feeling because good with the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.460
 test pressure that the first time and 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 the nerves of sant but nothing more 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.410
 they have many candidates and very good 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.119
 has presented us we could say that the 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.120
 Cream of all Spain cream 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.190
 because the current situation does not come out 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.720
 many fire stations or of 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.400
 any other type of staff does not 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.080
 then in that we have a self that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.900
 I was traveling for three years already doing first 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.940
 here madrid are pretty hard physics 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.080
 about them and the people are very prepared 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.520
 to stay a little more than a hundred days 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.900
 there are 20 seats 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.980
 is teaching me out is a test 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.870
 selective 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.500
 and finally, the 20 best 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.110
 clear just today it happens from 19 right in the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.580
 plaza so good the experience a 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.379
 little bit of nerves that yes especially 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.030
 because we did not know at what speed what 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.620
 we have to do a little bit of 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.170
 respect, but if you do not have a phobia, 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.200
 you are relatively easy afraid too 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.459
 it serves as a practice for others 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.140
 oppositions in which they have proof 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.330
 similar and well do not have them 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.370
 face at that time as a first 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.200
 time if you extended them do before here power 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.420
 they are better for her clear the number of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.090
 effective was already quite diminished 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.000
 in fact it was low minimums 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.930
 we covered but firefighter's speed by 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.379
 habitant 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.540
 we already have the extreme need to take 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.700
 those squares is true that probably 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.890
 Because we are the only municipality that is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.450
 year then done one is a call 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.379
 of these characteristics and I think that 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.379
 throughout the legislature
