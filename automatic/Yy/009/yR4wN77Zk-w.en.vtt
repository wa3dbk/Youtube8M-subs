00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.950
 explained 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.950
 simple gentlemen 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.730
 she must give up 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.770
 and like pouring something to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.270
 take the staff despite this 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.410
 context there is that it's a moment 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.410
 a highlight 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.929
 the luck that I have 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.850
 the city six months six months earlier 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.829
 could not imagine such a scenario 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.519
 what's going on deep inside you 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.519
 it's still something 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.870
 a quarter of an hour some balloons 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.280
 free in japan 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:36.260

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.500
 usually this bet on yonne facing the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.710
 Brazil two rounds 81500 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.710
 in 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.960
 the bid in the beginning even if we all have a little 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.340
 boring he is booed hissed but in the end 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.140
 you have a little bit returned the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.970
 public on this particular sentence he 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.800
 ya 4 who went not far from the pole 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.300
 you say it does not matter that it's okay 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:22.080
 to pass with the time when it has you when 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:23.550
 even disappointed a little bit to be happy 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.610
 rather for his supporters who in the end 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.019
 we applauded on these strikes or 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.860
 tablet you bet a message 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:36.030
 then to their musical reach it's a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.440
 little short we have to make a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.630
 evaluation of getting into a match 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.130
 international with players of this 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.630
 level there what his wife on stage 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.290
 opposite identified a remedy in 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.290
 upper part 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.610

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.360
 stories around rezai in algeria 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.360
 France in its premises 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.340
 I asked you at play when you 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.340
 have returned 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.230
 that efforts 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.940
 because during that quarter hour on 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.360
 the lawn 4 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.360
 different 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:48.840
 when your learning to play a match 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:51.379
 interesting face to lose but it speaks 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.379
