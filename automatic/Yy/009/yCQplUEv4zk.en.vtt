through mod 2 wait let me put a hyphen

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.130 
through mod 2 wait let me put a hyphen
just<00:03:05.109> in<00:03:05.230> case<00:03:05.350> don't<00:03:06.190> copy<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.579> then<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.930> go

and so over here now you see how this is

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.800 
and so over here now you see how this is
one<00:03:11.079> point<00:03:11.200> five<00:03:11.350> point<00:03:11.410> two<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.480> need<00:03:13.600> one

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
one point five point two and we need one

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.520 
one point five point two and we need one
point<00:03:14.079> five<00:03:14.200> point<00:03:14.260> one<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:15.190> hit<00:03:15.790> select<00:03:16.530> you

point five point one so hit select you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.849 
point five point one so hit select you
know<00:03:18.840> then<00:03:19.840> this<00:03:20.109> is<00:03:20.230> where<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:20.680> point

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
know then this is where the one point

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.970 
know then this is where the one point
five<00:03:20.950> point<00:03:21.010> one<00:03:21.250> jar<00:03:21.609> comes<00:03:21.790> in<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.150> seat

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
five point one jar comes in this seat

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.960 
five point one jar comes in this seat
see<00:03:23.980> how<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.160> one<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.430> one's<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:24.700> point

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
see how this one this one's the point

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.420 
see how this one this one's the point
