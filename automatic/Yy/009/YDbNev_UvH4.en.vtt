00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.470 

after<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.400> couple<00:04:57.760> of<00:04:57.850> minutes<00:04:58.150> out<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.360> your

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
after a couple of minutes out of your

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:07.800 
after a couple of minutes out of your
day<00:04:58.630> tater

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.490 

add<00:05:08.810> in<00:05:09.020> your<00:05:09.199> fish<00:05:09.500> sauce<00:05:10.060> sugar<00:05:11.110> salt<00:05:12.110> and

let's<00:05:50.389> see<00:05:50.569> what<00:05:50.689> it<00:05:50.779> tastes<00:05:50.960> like<00:05:51.139> so<00:05:51.379> far

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.090 

I<00:05:58.410> think<00:05:59.410> it<00:05:59.500> needs<00:05:59.680> a<00:05:59.740> little<00:05:59.770> bit<00:06:00.040> more

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
I think it needs a little bit more

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:13.300 
I think it needs a little bit more
flavor<00:06:00.520> let's<00:06:00.970> add<00:06:01.210> in<00:06:01.600> some<00:06:01.840> extra<00:06:01.960> salt

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.000 

if<00:06:14.120> you<00:06:14.360> want<00:06:14.600> yourself<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:15.320> be<00:06:15.440> a<00:06:15.470> little<00:06:15.740> bit

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
if you want yourself to be a little bit

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.360 
if you want yourself to be a little bit
thicker<00:06:16.280> then<00:06:17.090> you<00:06:17.450> can<00:06:17.840> add<00:06:18.200> in<00:06:18.680> some<00:06:18.710> tomato

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
thicker then you can add in some tomato

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:29.430 
thicker then you can add in some tomato
paste<00:06:19.760> and<00:06:20.090> this<00:06:20.240> is<00:06:20.360> definitely<00:06:20.750> optional

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.960 

it's<00:06:30.440> been<00:06:30.680> about<00:06:30.889> a<00:06:30.950> minute<00:06:31.310> so<00:06:31.610> now<00:06:31.639> let's

it's been about a minute so now let's

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:39.010
