the part eat all round be a good Spidey

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.750 
the part eat all round be a good Spidey
however<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.650> big<00:02:46.980> problem<00:02:47.640> he

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
however there is one big problem he

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.610 
however there is one big problem he
already<00:02:47.910> plays<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.570> flash<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.290> know

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
already plays the flash so you know

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.560 
already plays the flash so you know
there's<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.520> realize<00:02:51.000> actors<00:02:51.390> can

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
there's that I do realize actors can

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.090 
there's that I do realize actors can
play<00:02:51.720> more<00:02:51.870> than<00:02:52.020> one<00:02:52.080> superhero<00:02:52.500> characters

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
play more than one superhero characters

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.590 
play more than one superhero characters
but<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.490> one<00:02:53.670> would<00:02:53.820> be<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.910> little<00:02:54.210> weird<00:02:54.420> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
but this one would be a little weird and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810 
but this one would be a little weird and
distracting<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> guess<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.070> kind<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.610> yes

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
distracting so I guess it's kind of yes

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.790 
distracting so I guess it's kind of yes
kind<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.360> no<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.930> last<00:02:58.140> one<00:02:58.230> isn't<00:02:58.710> for

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
kind of no and this last one isn't for

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.800 
kind of no and this last one isn't for
Peter<00:02:58.980> Parker<00:02:59.220> but<00:02:59.670> rather<00:02:59.910> Miles<00:03:00.330> Morales

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
Peter Parker but rather Miles Morales

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.780 
Peter Parker but rather Miles Morales
