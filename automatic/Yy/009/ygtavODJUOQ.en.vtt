think that later on then the format that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.420 
think that later on then the format that

my<00:00:31.460> opinion<00:00:31.640> tanger<00:00:32.090> Nordics<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:34.700> reason<00:00:35.120> why

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
my opinion tanger Nordics the reason why

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.900 
my opinion tanger Nordics the reason why
i<00:00:35.330> think<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:36.110> was<00:00:36.740> not<00:00:37.010> as<00:00:37.160> good<00:00:37.190> last<00:00:37.550> format

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
i think it was not as good last format

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.660 
i think it was not as good last format
as<00:00:38.120> it<00:00:38.150> is<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.630> because<00:00:38.990> that<00:00:39.440> last<00:00:40.280> format

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
as it is now is because that last format

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.820 
as it is now is because that last format
it<00:00:41.180> really<00:00:41.450> didn't<00:00:41.720> have<00:00:41.780> much<00:00:41.840> support<00:00:42.620> to

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
it really didn't have much support to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.770 
it really didn't have much support to
the<00:00:42.950> deck<00:00:43.160> I<00:00:43.340> mean<00:00:43.490> like<00:00:43.610> it<00:00:43.790> had<00:00:43.970> support<00:00:44.630> it

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
the deck I mean like it had support it

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.270 
the deck I mean like it had support it
had<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.050> complete<00:00:45.350> deck<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:45.890> everything

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
had the complete deck and everything

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.150 
had the complete deck and everything
it's<00:00:46.880> just<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.600> format<00:00:48.020> itself<00:00:48.410> with<00:00:48.980> it

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
it's just that the format itself with it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.240 
it's just that the format itself with it
being<00:00:49.400> heavy<00:00:49.790> trap<00:00:50.180> if<00:00:50.990> you<00:00:51.380> get<00:00:51.620> your<00:00:51.890> Odin

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
being heavy trap if you get your Odin

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.460 
being heavy trap if you get your Odin
solemn<00:00:52.640> warning<00:00:53.000> or<00:00:53.240> your<00:00:53.540> black<00:00:53.780> rose<00:00:53.810> solemn

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
solemn warning or your black rose solemn

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.310 
solemn warning or your black rose solemn
warning<00:00:54.829> your<00:00:55.070> basically<00:00:55.880> just<00:00:56.320> nagging

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
warning your basically just nagging

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.850 
warning your basically just nagging
yourself<00:00:57.770> to<00:00:57.950> death<00:00:59.079> once<00:01:00.079> you<00:01:00.260> make<00:01:00.470> plays

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
yourself to death once you make plays

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.190 
yourself to death once you make plays
like<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:01.670> that's<00:01:01.910> why<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.149> think<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.750> um

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
like that so that's why I think that um

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.530 
like that so that's why I think that um
it<00:01:03.560> wasn't<00:01:03.800> supported<00:01:04.489> last<00:01:04.670> format<00:01:05.210> very

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
it wasn't supported last format very

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.120 
it wasn't supported last format very
well<00:01:07.000> so<00:01:08.000> yeah<00:01:08.470> I'm<00:01:09.470> going<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.740> get<00:01:09.830> into<00:01:10.100> it

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
well so yeah I'm going to get into it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.850 
well so yeah I'm going to get into it

three super nimble mega hamsters this is

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.619 
three super nimble mega hamsters this is
probably<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.680> heart<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.340> Nordic<00:02:08.239> engine

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
probably the heart of the Nordic engine

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.959 
probably the heart of the Nordic engine
in<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.840> deck<00:02:09.019> in<00:02:09.200> itself<00:02:09.530> because<00:02:10.459> what<00:02:10.819> you

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:10.969 
in the deck in itself because what you

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.869 
in the deck in itself because what you
do<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.329> you<00:02:11.450> can<00:02:11.599> turn<00:02:11.810> one<00:02:12.049> set<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.799> like<00:02:13.549> set

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
do is you can turn one set and like set

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.809 
do is you can turn one set and like set
a<00:02:14.090> back<00:02:14.450> row<00:02:14.659> or<00:02:14.870> something

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
a back row or something

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.030 
a back row or something
and<00:02:16.329> then<00:02:16.629> like<00:02:16.840> they're<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.469> to<00:02:17.590> attack<00:02:17.709> it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and then like they're going to attack it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
and then like they're going to attack it
next<00:02:18.249> turn<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.790> it's<00:02:19.120> going<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.450> flip<00:02:19.930> you're

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
next turn and it's going to flip you're

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.660 
next turn and it's going to flip you're
going<00:02:20.439> to<00:02:20.499> get<00:02:20.620> as<00:02:20.739> effect<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.219> probably<00:02:21.430> set

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
going to get as effect and probably set

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.929 
going to get as effect and probably set
this<00:02:21.700> guy<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.799> then<00:02:24.069> they<00:02:24.340> really<00:02:24.609> can't<00:02:24.849> do

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
this guy and then they really can't do

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.580 
this guy and then they really can't do
anything<00:02:24.969> about<00:02:25.389> this<00:02:25.599> card's<00:02:25.930> flip<00:02:26.200> next

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
anything about this card's flip next

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.470 
anything about this card's flip next
turn<00:02:26.769> especially<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.909> can<00:02:28.060> kill<00:02:28.329> their

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
turn especially if you can kill their

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.349 
turn especially if you can kill their
back<00:02:28.599> row<00:02:28.840> but<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:30.519> that<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.999> just

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
back row but it's not that this just

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.569 
back row but it's not that this just
makes<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.749> deck<00:02:31.930> basically<00:02:35.010> three<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.340> the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
makes the deck basically three of the

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.470 
makes the deck basically three of the
year<00:02:36.730> black<00:02:37.000> goat<00:02:37.239> in<00:02:37.389> the<00:02:37.420> deck<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:40.239> really

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
year black goat in the deck it's really

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.129 
year black goat in the deck it's really
good<00:02:40.689> because<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.469> set<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:42.090> with<00:02:43.139> hamsters

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
good because you set this with hamsters

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.830 
good because you set this with hamsters
effect<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.859> then<00:02:45.099> next<00:02:45.310> turn<00:02:45.579> you<00:02:46.389> flip<00:02:46.689> them

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
effect and then next turn you flip them

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.509 
effect and then next turn you flip them
into<00:02:47.019> attack<00:02:47.230> mode<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.709> then<00:02:48.159> you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.489> go

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
into attack mode and then you can go

a<00:05:08.110> little<00:05:08.350> inconsistent<00:05:08.680> by<00:05:09.160> three<00:05:09.490> like<00:05:11.460> like

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
a little inconsistent by three like like

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.810 
a little inconsistent by three like like
that<00:05:12.610> infernity<00:05:13.090> guy<00:05:13.330> at<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.960> i<00:05:14.700> think<00:05:15.700> was

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
that infernity guy at the i think was

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.540 
that infernity guy at the i think was
like<00:05:15.970> Rhode<00:05:16.210> Island<00:05:16.570> or<00:05:16.660> something<00:05:17.130> YCS<00:05:18.130> and

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
like Rhode Island or something YCS and

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.680 
like Rhode Island or something YCS and
he<00:05:18.640> only<00:05:18.760> played<00:05:19.030> like<00:05:19.060> one<00:05:19.390> infernity

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
he only played like one infernity

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.780 
he only played like one infernity
inferno<00:05:20.410> so<00:05:20.680> I<00:05:20.710> was<00:05:20.919> thinking<00:05:21.040> maybe<00:05:21.280> like<00:05:21.430> one

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790
