 will teach you how to change the logo 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.760
 windows startup 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.269
 so like those that are displayed to your 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.830

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.080
 simple so you're going to see now 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.190
 their results when starting your pc 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.460
 windows seven 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 so we notice here so that we can 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 change the logo both masters windows 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.680
 7 on the screen of goods lamy hello 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.350
 world and we put the name of our pc 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.160
 just below I have copyright 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.860
 So we are left immediately for 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.240
 handling so we're back on 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 our pc 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 by the way you will notice that I have 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.840
 changed the theme one of seven basic and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.729
 so to do the manipulation that I 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.610
 just showed you he'll need you 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.039
 a software called windows seven 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.410
 goal web twitter that I would put you 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.910
 obviously linked in the description 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.450
 is also displayed theme if you 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.880
 want to change 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.799
 the animation will explain in the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.670
 tutorial or that I launch everything from 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.490
 software suite to show you 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.450
 then that land So here is it in 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.280
 done is the startup update 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.810
 of windows seven the logo that we just 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.220
 see 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.970
 so you can do a lot of things 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.020
 with this software 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.450
 so the first thing you can 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.140
 to do is to modify the present text 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.360
 here windows this windows windows seven 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.909
 so instead of that we started in 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.490
 windows you go into message and you 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.189
 change here you put for example 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.409
 hello world for example you can 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.030
 also change the color of the text 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.870
 so be careful because the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.489
 background color and will stay north the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.810
 size that's fine the size could 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.610
 change your size the felix has 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.180
 grown up as well as skin color 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.430
 smooth now changes for example 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.120
 copyright microsoft cooperation let's say 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.680
 our pc name that's how it all 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.500
 simply 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.600
 and you can also change the font 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.560
 it's super nice at the level of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.020
 the animation you can change the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.280
 color obviously too 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.210
 you can put a meter too 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.560
 so that will be a little counter that she 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.200
 even startup times 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 finally a lot of things like that and what 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.240
 here you can change the recovery to the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.200
 recovery of windows still images or that 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.550
 you searched in your file and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.030
 if you go to the start tab 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.070
 you will have horizon ming windows so 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.960
 it's when you feel you go out 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.580
 of the eve for example you put the 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.220
 message that you also want for 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.700
 customize those high level and 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.470
 backup at the level of backups and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.000
 well to reset windows 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.400
 there is a little button that is some 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.440
 share this way I find 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.780
 I think it's in the queue finally 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.750
 remember more so if you want 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.070
 now see what your animation has 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.500
 given so I'm going back in 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.970
 my second file i'm going to edit so 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.700
 windows ok perfect 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.160
 there we put it by default so here is 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:49.240
 done that's it it's by default and I have 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.840
 created on pause and you will run 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.610
 the animation will launch 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.040
 so we will put it in full screen by 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.480
 example so do not worry you 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.640
 go see a so here we are back 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.940
 in the screen I tap the space bar 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.130
 when you go there you very ugly with the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.650
 little windows here so here it is by train 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.810
 to read then we will come out as 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.860
 it's just there I have nothing to myself 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.360
 as text as you can see 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.549
 to buckle the buckle 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.750
 here and so now what we 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.400
 can do with these software too 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.870
 his to load a bit of what they 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.880
 imbibe skins are people who 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.370
 have modified the startup logo of 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.500
 windows and who put I do not know me 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.870
 a little animation other than the little one 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.460
 logo and what you see here that 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.020
 found a lot on the site becomes 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.419
 art for those who know a little 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.890
 little you will also put to say towards 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.010
 these tips of skins in the descriptions 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.740
 I took off the change 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.820
 so small mistake to go in a 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.540
 kind and his end of what it takes 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.980
 click on file 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.720
 once in your mud file 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.740
 screen shaped point 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.990
 bs seven or open question and your 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.820
 your wallpaper has just been modified 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.170
 with the bund skins so we can see that 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.210
 the bund which is really more pretty 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.680
 and now we can see all and 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.070
 all these animations so that will be 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.520
 automatically set all the settings 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.920
 will be set according to setting the 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.770
 boussekin that has been modified so if we 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:25.100
 click on the loop we are worth m at the beginning 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.050
 loop and we see that the logo is going to 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.080
 load such as the logo windows seven but 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.010
 in much better me I love what he 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.490
 you will have several links in the 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.470
 description 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.030
 finally to read towards the page becomes an art 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.670

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.080

 heard you can do it yourself 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.910
 also what is that enough 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.940
 difficult I find but you can 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.770
 still try so when you will have 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.950
 finished handling you will click on 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.320

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.780
 automatically the changes that are put 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.060
 Pandora file update you can 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.230
 manually update but that I 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.810
 you do not recommend it is why we have 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.310

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.880
 all this and hop 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.260
