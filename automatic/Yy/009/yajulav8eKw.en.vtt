wind<00:00:21.810> tunnel<00:00:22.080> case<00:00:22.289> well<00:00:23.449> let's<00:00:24.449> get<00:00:24.630> started

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
wind tunnel case well let's get started

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.120 
wind tunnel case well let's get started
this<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> front<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> wind<00:00:27.599> tunnel

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
this is the front of the wind tunnel

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.890 
this is the front of the wind tunnel
it's<00:00:29.130> got<00:00:29.279> their<00:00:29.429> logo<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.750> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it's got their logo up here which is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.150 
it's got their logo up here which is
kind<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.109> neat<00:00:31.289> because<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.590> an<00:00:31.710> X<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.130> a

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
kind of neat because it's an X with a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.080 
kind of neat because it's an X with a
circle<00:00:32.579> around<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.500> go<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.670> panel

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
circle around it you go down the panel

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.830 
circle around it you go down the panel
and<00:00:37.370> let<00:00:38.370> me<00:00:38.489> open<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and let me open this up over that's the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900 
and let me open this up over that's the
temperature<00:00:40.050> readout<00:00:40.610> that's<00:00:41.610> pretty

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
temperature readout that's pretty

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910 
temperature readout that's pretty
unusual<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.899> double<00:00:43.530> check<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
unusual actually double check what you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.410 
unusual actually double check what you
read<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.280> built<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> front<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
read out built right into the front of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
read out built right into the front of
the<00:00:45.510> case<00:00:45.739> it's<00:00:46.739> got<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> reads<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the case it's got that reads out in

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.130 
the case it's got that reads out in
Celsius<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> case<00:00:48.660> temperature

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
Celsius of the case temperature

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.720 
Celsius of the case temperature
internally<00:00:51.170> then<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.460> mesh

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
internally then we got to see this mesh

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.950 
internally then we got to see this mesh
screen<00:00:54.030> well<00:00:54.629> behind<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.680> mesh<00:00:55.860> screen<00:00:56.160> is

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
screen well behind this mesh screen is

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.380 
screen well behind this mesh screen is
hard<00:00:57.960> drive<00:00:58.020> base<00:00:58.500> look<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.239> could

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
hard drive base look at that you could

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.060 
hard drive base look at that you could
come<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:00.960> sort<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.230> hot<00:01:01.410> swap<00:01:01.770> on

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
come up with some sort of hot swap on

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
come up with some sort of hot swap on
the<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:02.609> side<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.449> could<00:01:03.629> just<00:01:03.690> pull

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the other side so you could just pull

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
the other side so you could just pull
the<00:01:04.049> hard<00:01:04.229> drives<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> front<00:01:05.040> pretty

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the hard drives out the front pretty

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270 
the hard drives out the front pretty
neat<00:01:05.970> huh<00:01:06.320> let's<00:01:07.320> clip<00:01:07.530> that's<00:01:07.680> back<00:01:08.010> into

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
neat huh let's clip that's back into

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:20.200 
neat huh let's clip that's back into
place<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.380> back<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.710> place

these<00:03:16.739> 250<00:03:17.459> millimeter<00:03:17.910> fans<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:19.010> there's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
these 250 millimeter fans is there's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.619 
these 250 millimeter fans is there's
hardly<00:03:20.489> any<00:03:20.669> options<00:03:21.120> out<00:03:21.299> there<00:03:21.329> because

hardly any options out there because

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.580 
hardly any options out there because
they're<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.049> large<00:03:23.569> for<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:25.139> know<00:03:25.260> buying

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
they're so large for you know buying

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.909 
they're so large for you know buying
them<00:03:25.799> along<00:03:26.370> with<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.609> 200<00:03:27.090> millimeter

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
them along with the 200 millimeter

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.990 
them along with the 200 millimeter
there's<00:03:28.919> hardly<00:03:29.220> any<00:03:29.430> options<00:03:29.850> out<00:03:30.000> there

there's hardly any options out there

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.300 
there's hardly any options out there
but<00:03:31.810> there<00:03:32.380> are<00:03:32.410> like<00:03:33.310> one<00:03:33.610> or<00:03:33.760> two<00:03:33.790> options<00:03:35.310> so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
but there are like one or two options so

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.020 
but there are like one or two options so
hopefully<00:03:36.850> this<00:03:37.600> catches<00:03:38.080> on<00:03:38.260> with<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.250> fan

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
hopefully this catches on with the fan

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.270 
hopefully this catches on with the fan

case my previous case I was getting

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.430 
case my previous case I was getting
around<00:03:59.170> 35<00:04:00.100> Celsius<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.720> that's<00:04:01.900> like<00:04:02.050> that's

8-pin<00:05:20.260> I<00:05:20.820> 12<00:05:21.820> volt<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.180> then<00:05:22.780> we<00:05:22.900> got<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.639> 24

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
8-pin I 12 volt and then we got that 24

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.050 
8-pin I 12 volt and then we got that 24
pin<00:05:24.880> over<00:05:25.150> here<00:05:25.479> of<00:05:25.690> course<00:05:26.039> so<00:05:27.060> everything

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
pin over here of course so everything

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.640 
pin over here of course so everything
really<00:05:28.270> came<00:05:28.539> together<00:05:28.750> rather<00:05:29.410> well<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:31.650> like

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
really came together rather well I like

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.600 
really came together rather well I like
this<00:05:32.800> case<00:05:33.240> it's<00:05:34.240> sweet<00:05:35.080> if<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.100> if<00:05:36.340> you<00:05:36.460> need

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
this case it's sweet if you if you need

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.730 
this case it's sweet if you if you need
something<00:05:36.850> with<00:05:37.120> a<00:05:37.180> good<00:05:37.660> air<00:05:37.870> flow<00:05:37.900> solution

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
something with a good air flow solution

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.740 
something with a good air flow solution
because<00:05:39.039> you<00:05:39.160> got<00:05:39.310> some<00:05:39.550> high<00:05:39.910> temp<00:05:40.240> card<00:05:40.449> like

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
because you got some high temp card like

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.629 
because you got some high temp card like
the<00:05:40.870> one<00:05:41.020> I<00:05:41.050> got<00:05:41.380> this<00:05:41.889> is<00:05:42.070> definitely<00:05:42.550> the

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
the one I got this is definitely the

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.670 
the one I got this is definitely the
case<00:05:42.789> for<00:05:43.060> you<00:05:43.770> put<00:05:44.770> on<00:05:44.860> this<00:05:44.979> side<00:05:45.280> panel<00:05:45.669> I

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
case for you put on this side panel I

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.950 
case for you put on this side panel I
was<00:05:47.680> leaning<00:05:47.889> over<00:05:48.099> now<00:05:48.780> then<00:05:49.780> also<00:05:51.570> I<00:05:52.770> had<00:05:53.770> I

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
was leaning over now then also I had I

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.119 
was leaning over now then also I had I
had<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:56.110> problem<00:05:56.470> with

this rail right here this trail that
goes<00:06:04.199> across<00:06:04.409> here<00:06:05.839> well<00:06:06.839> I<00:06:07.169> have<00:06:07.589> to<00:06:07.739> hook<00:06:07.889> in

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
goes across here well I have to hook in

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.769 
goes across here well I have to hook in
my<00:06:08.159> cables<00:06:08.580> from<00:06:08.699> this<00:06:08.939> side<00:06:09.259> and<00:06:11.539> put<00:06:12.539> a<00:06:12.569> lot

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:12.779 
my cables from this side and put a lot

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:15.259 
my cables from this side and put a lot
of<00:06:12.809> tension<00:06:13.229> on<00:06:13.349> my<00:06:13.379> power<00:06:13.709> cable<00:06:14.009> I<00:06:14.339> had<00:06:15.149> to

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:15.269 
of tension on my power cable I had to

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:17.689 
of tension on my power cable I had to
really<00:06:15.479> pull<00:06:15.809> on<00:06:15.989> this<00:06:16.169> to<00:06:17.129> get<00:06:17.279> my<00:06:17.429> power

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
really pull on this to get my power

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:30.430 
really pull on this to get my power

sling<00:06:31.440> that<00:06:31.620> burns<00:06:31.860> there<00:06:32.130> and<00:06:32.760> then<00:06:33.270> on<00:06:33.570> this

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
sling that burns there and then on this

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.130 
sling that burns there and then on this
side<00:06:33.900> of<00:06:34.140> the<00:06:34.260> case<00:06:34.530> look<00:06:35.690> this<00:06:36.690> side<00:06:36.960> also

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
side of the case look this side also

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.240 
side of the case look this side also
slides<00:06:37.650> off<00:06:37.950> say<00:06:38.750> it's<00:06:39.750> a<00:06:39.840> plate<00:06:40.110> you<00:06:40.860> can<00:06:41.070> see

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
slides off say it's a plate you can see

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.540 
slides off say it's a plate you can see
the<00:06:41.340> plate<00:06:41.580> behind<00:06:41.760> it<00:06:42.120> what<00:06:43.250> well<00:06:44.250> you<00:06:44.340> can't

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
the plate behind it what well you can't

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.680 
the plate behind it what well you can't
see<00:06:44.730> it<00:06:44.850> but<00:06:44.970> if<00:06:45.120> there's<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.330> plate<00:06:45.540> behind

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
see it but if there's a plate behind

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.280 
see it but if there's a plate behind
here<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.670> on<00:06:47.670> this<00:06:48.060> side<00:06:48.300> of<00:06:48.450> the<00:06:48.540> case<00:06:48.750> I<00:06:49.050> was

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
here and on this side of the case I was

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.710 
here and on this side of the case I was
thinking<00:06:49.650> about<00:06:49.740> taking<00:06:50.520> a<00:06:50.790> dremel<00:06:51.600> or

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
thinking about taking a dremel or

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.970 
thinking about taking a dremel or
something<00:06:52.140> and<00:06:52.260> cutting<00:06:52.590> some<00:06:52.770> holes<00:06:52.950> out<00:06:53.190> and

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
something and cutting some holes out and

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.290 
something and cutting some holes out and
turning<00:06:55.980> around<00:06:56.250> the<00:06:56.430> hard<00:06:56.670> drives<00:06:57.000> and

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
turning around the hard drives and

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.410 
turning around the hard drives and
running<00:06:57.690> the<00:06:57.780> cables<00:06:58.140> through<00:06:58.260> the<00:06:58.350> back<00:06:58.530> side

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
running the cables through the back side

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.260 
running the cables through the back side
so<00:07:00.420> I<00:07:00.950> don't<00:07:01.950> have<00:07:02.040> to<00:07:02.130> worry<00:07:02.370> about<00:07:02.520> that<00:07:02.640> a

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
so I don't have to worry about that a

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.820 
so I don't have to worry about that a
little<00:07:03.690> bar<00:07:03.960> that<00:07:04.140> goes<00:07:04.230> across<00:07:04.290> that<00:07:04.740> I've

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
little bar that goes across that I've

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.450 
little bar that goes across that I've
shown<00:07:05.070> you<00:07:05.300> it<00:07:06.300> only<00:07:06.840> hinders<00:07:07.440> the<00:07:07.770> Raptors

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
shown you it only hinders the Raptors

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.670 
shown you it only hinders the Raptors
with<00:07:09.360> the<00:07:09.510> secondary<00:07:10.050> hard<00:07:10.290> drive<00:07:10.470> and<00:07:10.560> I'm

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
with the secondary hard drive and I'm

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.220 
with the secondary hard drive and I'm
Barracuda<00:07:11.280> the<00:07:11.430> power<00:07:11.640> and<00:07:11.970> the<00:07:12.230> connections

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230 
Barracuda the power and the connections

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.710 
Barracuda the power and the connections
are<00:07:13.350> down<00:07:13.590> a<00:07:13.620> little<00:07:13.950> lower<00:07:14.250> so<00:07:14.460> that<00:07:14.820> bar<00:07:15.600> is

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 
are down a little lower so that bar is

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.930 
are down a little lower so that bar is
