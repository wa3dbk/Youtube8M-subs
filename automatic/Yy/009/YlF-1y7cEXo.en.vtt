00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello and welcome to something 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.830
 Others, and there is today 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.469
 thanks a little thank you to the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.179
 best community he was 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 we cracked the 20,000 subscribers 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.500
 and that's just crazy 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.750
 this is just amazing i am happy 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.789
 I never thought so 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.199
 You may know about one and a half before 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.140
 years I have the first videos 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.449
 the goods were funny I was that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.519
 not used to people anyway 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.869
 speak or actually speak I have 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.369
 actually talking to anyone 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.800
 my screen and that is very much 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.380
 unfamiliar but it was fun and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.879
 dear ducati and dear god the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.129
 Yes, both encouraged to do that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.989
 make my first appearance in the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.360
 Internet in itself I had at the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.410
 lithography on the channel and it has me 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.000
 really fun because of that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.219
 I thought I just try and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.680
 The quality in the beginning was grottig 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.789
 That was very quiet at work 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.250
 Microphones have to be purchased first 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.379
 and so on but it has become 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 worth it and I think my quality 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.590
 meanwhile a little better and it does 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.270
 I still have a lot of fun 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.250
 just like the first day just me 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.630
 I can talk a bit freely now 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.880
 a little more to tell that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.040
 I do not care too much anymore 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 easy with my microphone or with 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.720
 to talk to my screen and yes it is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.970
 just nice when you go in the morning 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 wakes up and then you directly the channel 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 looks and reads the comments I read 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 Still all comments even if I am 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.500
 can not or will not respond to all 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.049
 because sometimes you just can not 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.250
 some people can answer some people's answers 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.270
 do not answer because they are in the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.020
 Settings from youtube not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.909
 have enabled and still I read 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.440
 every comment that makes every day 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.760
 new fun 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.730
 yes you can see that, too 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.500
 livestreams I'm on my legs 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.510
 has put up with the silver lake xl because 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.400
 So I say there again best 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.210
 community but I was live in many 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
 streams present 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.980
 But what's going on in the chat that makes 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.290
 just fun the people are friendly 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.910
 to each other they ask each other 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.110
 Somehow what they do not know 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.670
 can help each other that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.760
 the same applies to the community 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.310
 clear the bug load yes I do not have 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.399
 so much time but I think it's great 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.770
 that there love horb the zf and love 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.530
 lothar or an eye on it have that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.820
 there is always something going on that the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.380
 people can play with each other 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.200
 with the server and all the trimmings 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.850
 So thank you very much at this point and 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.100
 Of course many thanks to the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.950
 athlete click bookstore umbrella of 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.300
 everything holds together without jumbo I would have 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.470
 probably long since stopped too 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.620
 before I even play with youtube 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.690
 jumbo is for me 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.950
 how a second family became that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.110
 There are so many nice people there 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.000
 in there and without jumbo I would have too 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.990
 never all the chic panzer's 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.670

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.000
 polka or the object or knows the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.060
 vulture 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.190
 because she makes time possible that we are in 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.140
 any clear campaign somehow always 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.360
 earlier this well can now 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.950
 but not otherwise and it does 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.410
 every day fun with the people 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.970
 to drive and complain where in the team and so on 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.910

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.989
 had to jimbo and libraries 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.650
 Of course there were other people as well 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.450
 who supported me here and also 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.850
 I have to thank you for that 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.220
 for example, at silver lake and biscuits the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.050
 always there are also available for in the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.380

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.190

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.280

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.420
 has helped strange situations and too 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.760
 good last of course still in the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.250
 other community contractors without you 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.110
 it would not be possible 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.510
 but what in the last one? 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.940
 time has happened I still have that 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.070
 not digested everything yes I was up 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.610
 buffed.de the lovely rossi and oliver 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.140
 Haake almost worked there, I was the one 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.709
 first guest was really cool has a lot 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.070
 fun 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.630
 besides, there was also gamestar here and there 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.160
 I was able to do one of my videos 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.700
 publish even came on really well 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.560
 the ahs community 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.230
 at least I read the newspaper 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.720
 since 1997 that has me right 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.050
 happy and I would have watched TV too 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.010
 but I do not want that 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.640
 then maybe you'll see me 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.430
 next year 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.890
 but that will not get any smaller 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.250
 because I still have my own things here 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.739
 do 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.569
 and at the moment it does not suit me 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.769
 Therefore, you must dig sideways into the trench 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.200
 We as a little wait, I hope 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:18.790
 You have patience with me and with mine 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.709
 junk and yes 20,000 subscribers I would have 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.600
 I never thought about the first one 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.470
 subscribers were pleased 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.639
 I got over the first ten 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.889
 Subscribers are looking forward to the first 100 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.520
 over the first 1000 and thought okay 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.220
 now it is easy and suddenly it is 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.470
 20,000 so you can not do that 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.000
 imagine having 20,000 interpret so much 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.400
 I have never been good in my life 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.830
 I can not say that day 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.650
 at that time already had a radio show 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.580
 at today music and advisory frost poppy 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.169
 and there were no more than 5,000 people 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.790
 had been listening and even that was 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.710
 so terrific I keep therefore always 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.850
 still the record but 20,000 euros are 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.760
 very much 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.440
 yes , we also came up with something 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.490
 Let it be a whole soon 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.419
 special livestream go though 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.970
 later more 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.479
 So I only say 13 aft in the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.760
 direction 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.320
 keep your day free as it opens up 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.840
 each case also come for the 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.520
 community is of course taken care of and times 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.350
 See what else I can do 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.080

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.310
 and whether it is gravel or what 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.289
 Other and yes I will stay tuned 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.840
 and I hope we get something else 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.570
 cool in otherwise i can just 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.180
 thank me again for a lot 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.280
 Over 20,000 views per day on mine 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.770
 This is a lonely tip in the world of 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.920
 tanks in germany and it does everybody 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.270

 I would like to thank you for that 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.470

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.980
 is so successful and so much fun 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.440
 drive 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.970
 I hope you continue to live 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.280
 under the background you see now 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.660
 even as I torpedo a bit 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.950
 then we 'll see each other at the next video 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.990
 never at the next live stream 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.990
