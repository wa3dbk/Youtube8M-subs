affect one another just because modern
warfare<00:02:01.380> 2<00:02:01.860> sniping<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.930> let's<00:02:03.930> say<00:02:04.049> easy<00:02:04.590> i

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
warfare 2 sniping is let's say easy i

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.560 
warfare 2 sniping is let's say easy i
don't<00:02:05.280> think<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.759> easy<00:02:06.090> i<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.329> it's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
don't think it's easy i think it's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.169 
don't think it's easy i think it's
easier<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.439> doesn't<00:02:07.680> mean<00:02:07.770> it's<00:02:07.920> easy

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
easier but that doesn't mean it's easy

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.449 
easier but that doesn't mean it's easy
but<00:02:09.470> again<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:10.619> getting<00:02:11.039> into<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
but again we're getting into a lot of

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.250 
but again we're getting into a lot of
subjective<00:02:11.970> things<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.300> but

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
subjective things here but

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.470 
subjective things here but
assume<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.830> easy<00:02:14.099> just<00:02:14.519> because<00:02:15.060> modern

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
assume it's easy just because modern

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
assume it's easy just because modern
warfare<00:02:15.870> two<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:16.709> three<00:02:16.980> or<00:02:17.159> whatever<00:02:17.310> sniping

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
warfare two or three or whatever sniping

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.080 
warfare two or three or whatever sniping
is<00:02:18.209> easy<00:02:18.450> doesn't<00:02:19.439> mean<00:02:19.709> it's<00:02:19.980> not<00:02:20.220> balanced

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
is easy doesn't mean it's not balanced

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.110 
is easy doesn't mean it's not balanced
and<00:02:21.209> vice<00:02:21.870> versa<00:02:22.319> just<00:02:22.829> because<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.610> hard

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and vice versa just because it's hard

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.319 
and vice versa just because it's hard
just<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:24.959> sniping<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:26.040> some<00:02:26.640> game<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
just because sniping in some game is

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.330 
just because sniping in some game is
hard<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.959> see<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.319> lot<00:02:28.439> with<00:02:28.620> black<00:02:28.860> ops<00:02:29.099> way

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
hard I see it a lot with black ops way

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.309 
hard I see it a lot with black ops way
too<00:02:29.400> much<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.790> black<00:02:30.000> ops<00:02:30.239> so<00:02:30.750> let's<00:02:30.989> let's

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
too much with black ops so let's let's

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.809 
too much with black ops so let's let's
stick<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:31.980> because<00:02:32.220> black<00:02:32.519> ops

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
stick with that just because black ops

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.140 
stick with that just because black ops
sniping<00:02:33.329> is<00:02:33.480> or<00:02:33.930> was<00:02:34.200> hard<00:02:34.530> doesn't<00:02:35.489> mean<00:02:35.819> it's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
sniping is or was hard doesn't mean it's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.899 
sniping is or was hard doesn't mean it's
balanced<00:02:36.989> it<00:02:37.140> means<00:02:37.349> it's<00:02:37.560> hard<00:02:37.950> now<00:02:38.579> if<00:02:38.760> you

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
balanced it means it's hard now if you

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.369 
balanced it means it's hard now if you
want<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> talk<00:02:39.390> about<00:02:39.420> balance<00:02:40.109> and<00:02:40.200> that's

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
want to talk about balance and that's

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.720 
want to talk about balance and that's
what<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> lot<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.829> these<00:02:40.980> people<00:02:41.220> claim<00:02:41.579> they're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
what a lot of these people claim they're

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.729 
what a lot of these people claim they're
talking<00:02:42.120> about<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.140> understand<00:02:43.620> it

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
talking about and and I understand it

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.259 
talking about and and I understand it
from<00:02:43.799> a<00:02:43.950> commentators<00:02:44.549> perspective<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.239> mean

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
from a commentators perspective I mean

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.300 
from a commentators perspective I mean
they<00:02:45.540> want<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.810> feel<00:02:45.959> special<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.620> they<00:02:47.099> want

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
they want to feel special and they want

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.830 
they want to feel special and they want
to<00:02:47.370> hold<00:02:47.609> on<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.120> thing<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.690> they

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
to hold on to that thing that they

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
to hold on to that thing that they
believe<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.260> they<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.680> really<00:02:50.190> really

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670
