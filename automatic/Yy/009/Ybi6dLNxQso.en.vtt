00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 highschool football is in the us 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.580
 definitely a big deal with that though 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.240
 not really much in this country 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.130
 can 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.400
 accordingly skeptical on the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.080
 trailer of the games test if 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.950
 anyone else has something to say 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.950
 should that be now 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.320
 twelve years and 151 games 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.179
 behind each other 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.190
 but it was all about winning but 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:36.309
 therefore our families and ours 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.550
 city ​​together with walks series of 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.199
 spell the end of the series was 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.699
 a challenge that can be solved by 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.699
 such an idiot at the two years ago 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.470
 tackle please let your game 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.420
 we define here since that's for sure 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.010
 still yourself 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:01.089
 sv we have always only done what 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:01:02.680
 the best for me would be again and again 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:09.820
 asked how never to lose 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.960
 today i am lost i try the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.710
 series that deepens me almost 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 would have killed 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.780
 I am alone we are not only 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.229
 By blood 65.23 stars represents you 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.010
 your fears vaster with 147 kilo pure 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.900
 aggression 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.460
 you face the whole game 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.530
 we got caught off the path 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.950
 our media hype the celebrity the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.280
 boom 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.110
 so we are not you have to decide 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.600
 what you want to be i leave this 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.030
 at the latest on a question you have why 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.030
 it fits me best to allow 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.470
 brother for life 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.160
 who 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.160
 that's how it happened 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.990
 nothing will ever come what we do 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.990
 just now 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.570
 The trailer is not really mine 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.800
 thing and walls games becomes the store 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.090
 then a bit as if it could 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.470
 you do not just convey the topic 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.940
 but also as if you were the whole 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.290
 many clichés or in 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.330
 The story of people tell the story 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.650
 oh so they are in a circle and somehow to it 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.450
 you have to find yourself what you are 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.830
 but it can normally pack well 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.420
 somehow it will be a bit of a ski 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.070
 and a whole lot of young actors 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.960
 packed together like that sometimes goes 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.360
 tends to turn into the games 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.290
 transpower brings and sony pictures 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.570
 expected from the twelfth of february 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.610
 2015 in German cinemas and in the movie 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.780
 to release while the berlinale shows 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.190
 sometimes a little something 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.900
 you should keep the film at the end 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.310
 Look, I'm definitely more skeptical 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.690
 what is the story of bob told 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.459
 A trainer from once helped at one 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.140
 highschool football team the one 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.070
 Sieges series of this you have no equal 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.930
 Never before had there been 251 victories in Rome 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.700
 when he died of a heart attack 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.050
 Many months have to expire 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.430
 some are returning now 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.350
 his best player on the college 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.730
 it's clear if you have to try that 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.530
 rudder rumzuißen whether it is around 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.820
 sports spirit goes or character 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.380
 stronger friendship among each other 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.000
 when the limelight at once too 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.620
 disappear threatens that's all 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.610
 the topic of the film at least if 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.590
 you either try yourself 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.640
 I do not have to pick it up completely 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.720
 honestly I am so interested 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.739
 really and the child too many 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.450
 Focuses on the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.830
 welds together for easy 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.630
 This can lead to the focus 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.730
 forget it now a sports movie is a 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.620
 drama and sport frame that is sometimes 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.239
 complicated mix you see I am 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.350
 skeptical then you also like to let me 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 know in the comments 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.350

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.730
 at the latest as the twelfth of february 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.739
 can convince what when the game 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.360
 store has to offer, I have went through in 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.560
