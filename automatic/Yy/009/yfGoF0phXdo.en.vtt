00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 this week an event took place 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.250
 which is the next few years 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.649
 should change the degree of comfort 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.450
 many Petersburgers and guests arriving 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.099
 our city given the current 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 economic situation is an event 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.769
 found a special positive shade in 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.960
 Petersburg 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.000
 no matter what the high exchange rate 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 and the crisis mood opens after 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.289
 reconstruction is powerful and very modern 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 air x 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.869
 it is clear that it was planned 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.240
 construction still at a price of over 100 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.170
 dollars a barrel but fly then 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.180
 Airplanes will now be ours since 1973 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 the city did not know such events until 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.649
 At times this is the famous airport building 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.420
 Pulkovo which called glasses for 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.820
 especially architectural solutions were 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.860
 a breakthrough in the field of air transport 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.450
 logistics and it was very scary not 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.239
 will this spoil our Leningrad 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.250
 phenomenon authors of the reconstruction project 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.260
 whether its uniqueness of alarm will remain 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.579
 the authors failed in vain 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 connect the functionality and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.430
 originality of our air gate 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.079
 St. Petersburg 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.730
 And special correspondent Dmitri have 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.590
 markets gathered uncomplicated luggage and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 went to the airport so that you can 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.939
 experience what it means to be 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.020
 air travelers in the modern doll 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.820
 let's see his observations important 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.010
 what should the tourist know arriving or 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.990
 departing Petersburg in historical 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.420
 building Pulkovo-1 now there is no entrance nor 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.320
 out of all the pre-flight procedures 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.659
 carried out here in the new terminal 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.530
 now this is the main air gate 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.530
 northern capital 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.909
 check-in for all flights are here 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.250
 here is the usual route for the year 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.649
 need to find your flight on the scoreboard here 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.810
 he Moscow Sheremetyevo and issue a ticket 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.920
 on one of the dozens that I am to register 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.920
 just one ticket to Moscow 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.940
 weekends 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.710
 thank you with the revival of the old Pulkovo 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.320
 all of Petersburg airport terminal 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.510
 complex now it's t-shaped transport 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.060
 not a giant to the right hall and international 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.190
 departures left building with glasses flights 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.930
 only domestic direction amount 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.540
 now air pool x kolo can 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:17.760
 serve up to 17 million passengers in 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:23.130
 year vault system of precisely this 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.520
 Pulkovo-1 terminal building our airport 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.930
 St. Petersburg becomes 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.150
 the largest airport in northern europe and 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.420
 It seems to me that this is a decent air 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.550
 gate to northern european world capital 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.320
 the scale is all somewhat more modest airport 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.320
 in atlanta last year took over 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.220
 ninety four million passengers 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.500
 the legendary and the largest in Europe 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.540
 London Heathrow 72 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 so in this rating Pulkovo Maxim 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.530
 can enter the hundred busiest 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.470
 airports too Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.880
 only in the top ten but old 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.680
 terminal Pulkovo opened 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.810
 not for records but for quality 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.940
 service gallery now connects 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.739
 two terminals original glass 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.690
 a bridge 10 meters long and hence 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.980
 seen on vilenchik which at the time 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.320
 reconstruction of a historic building 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.630
 Pulkovo-1 replaced it and now from this 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.080
 nondescript single-storey building flew 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.360
 passengers from petersburg across the country 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.010
 amid growing passenger traffic 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.420
 Russian Federation for January 2015 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.390
 around the country with the same period we have 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.440
 the increase was more than 20 percent 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.420
 passenger traffic in the Russian Federation 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.550
 of course we were very keen 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.130
 need to translate Russian 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.260
 passenger traffic from temporary storage 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.260
 into this spacious new terminal 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.540
 after the crush of the flea market in the old Pulkovo 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.940
 when because 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.380
 multimeter bursts sometimes suitcase 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.020
 it was just impossible to pass here 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.000
 Now it seems that people 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.800
 not at all, but this is understandable because 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.700
 thanks to the reconstruction area 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.680
 terminal expanded 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.330
 40 percent the only one 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.310
 inconvenience is now a small amount 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.830
 the seats need their complete absence on 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.930
 they say this is a temporary rule not soon 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.050
 these seats are for relaxing passengers already 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.060
 we will establish in comparison with the largest 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.890
 who are looking for airports at rapa 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.650
 as a neighborhood of a big city 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.690
 saudi giant king fact occupies 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.550
 area in half of Petersburg but in 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.710
 compactness of the north air gate 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.230
 capital and there is an advantage to 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:25.150
 fly in transit from abroad no longer 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.990
 need to go by bus from the building 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.900
 Pulkovo-2 airport Pulkovo is the first 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.680
 object training championship 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.650
 world cup and of course we are very 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.810
 expect that 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.440
 St. Petersburg along with Moscow will take 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.780
 to myself 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.970
 including transit flows to 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.680
 global service standards 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.450
 passengers will bring 6 telescopic 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.610
 ladders are an obvious necessity for 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.710
 rainy peters inland 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.660
 flights are not able to be on the plane 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.730
 going out appeared only after 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.950
 the reconstruction should have time to look 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.910
 updated shelf in 1 to us very 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.970
 I liked the company Borovsk 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.620
 do not often go to a new one anyway 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.320
 more beautiful civile 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.210
 so let's say it takes a long time to walk if 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.840
 compare let's back western 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.140
 airports there they have moving 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.570
 lublin and 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.000
 for transitions and so on here with us 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.310
 until I see speeding up the whole route 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.110
 passengers horizontal escalators 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.480
 from the post of inspection dovorot departure 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.270
 technically almost impossible task 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.880
 fee for maintaining 5 glasses brand 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.560
 recognizable for decades technically 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.360
 new airplanes will appear in the extension 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.760
 which will soon be built next to the old 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.040
 building modernization of the whole complex 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.390
 Pulkovo will be held continuously yet 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.910
 quarter of century 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.490
 and familiarity with the updated terminal 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.650
 Pulkovo-1 remains an ambivalent feeling 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.540
 your old friend did on 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.430
 temporary liposuction tightening seemingly 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.320
 the same person looks different 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.210
 relationship to him is different so here 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.650
 still soaked with the spirit of it 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.020
 Leningrad airport with five 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.600
 glasses but of course it's perfect 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.850
 other terminal since time and newer 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.890
 more beautiful the only thing now to him 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.500
 there is still to get used and probably 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.160
 love dmitry beetles 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.160
 let cities
