articulated<00:00:18.189> joints<00:00:22.290> we're<00:00:23.290> going<00:00:23.439> to<00:00:23.500> add

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
articulated joints we're going to add

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.230 
articulated joints we're going to add
onto<00:00:23.830> this<00:00:23.950> hand<00:00:24.310> to<00:00:24.550> build<00:00:24.700> it<00:00:24.820> up<00:00:24.880> towards

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240

so<00:00:27.939> these<00:00:28.060> will<00:00:28.210> simply<00:00:28.570> be<00:00:28.750> cut<00:00:29.410> into<00:00:29.590> shape

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
so these will simply be cut into shape

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.130 
so these will simply be cut into shape
and<00:00:30.160> then<00:00:30.310> glued<00:00:30.519> together<00:00:30.670> ice<00:00:31.510> on<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.930> fence

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
and then glued together ice on the fence

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.320 
and then glued together ice on the fence

socket<00:00:37.540> which<00:00:37.809> I've<00:00:37.989> just<00:00:38.199> cut<00:00:38.410> out<00:00:38.620> using<00:00:38.949> a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
socket which I've just cut out using a

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.950 
socket which I've just cut out using a
chisel<00:00:39.220> now<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.820> top<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.360> fence<00:00:40.600> roast

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
chisel now to the top of the fence roast

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.439 
chisel now to the top of the fence roast
to<00:00:41.800> go<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.129> upper<00:00:42.370> arm<00:00:42.400> your<00:00:43.000> brown<00:00:43.210> piece

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
to go to the upper arm your brown piece

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.180 
to go to the upper arm your brown piece
has<00:00:43.660> been<00:00:43.839> carved<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.410> sanded<00:00:44.739> into<00:00:44.950> shape

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
has been carved and sanded into shape

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.700 
has been carved and sanded into shape
this<00:00:45.820> now<00:00:46.030> needs<00:00:46.300> an<00:00:46.570> attachment<00:00:46.899> at<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.469> top

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
this now needs an attachment at the top

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.049 
this now needs an attachment at the top
so<00:00:47.950> that<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.160> can<00:00:48.250> be<00:00:48.340> attached<00:00:48.610> to<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.850> shoulder

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
so that it can be attached to a shoulder

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.209 
so that it can be attached to a shoulder
I'm<00:00:49.899> going<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.140> attach<00:00:50.379> this<00:00:50.530> at<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.770> shoulder

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
I'm going to attach this at the shoulder

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.650 
I'm going to attach this at the shoulder
by<00:00:51.430> using<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.760> piece<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:52.120> black<00:00:52.329> plastic

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
and over the top so they can be attached

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.249 
and over the top so they can be attached
in<00:01:02.860> place<00:01:03.039> I<00:01:03.309> screwed<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.390> plastic<00:01:04.869> piece<00:01:05.080> of

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.710 
thread a bolt through to the other side
which<00:01:32.709> will<00:01:32.860> hold<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.190> place<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.569> ball

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
which will hold in place so the ball

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.480 
which will hold in place so the ball
joint<00:01:34.959> is<00:01:35.110> now<00:01:35.229> connected<00:01:35.740> using<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.250> bottom

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.640

of elastic to a hook by using elastic

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.900 
of elastic to a hook by using elastic
here<00:02:56.660> again<00:02:56.930> when<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.290> straighten<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.920> arm<00:02:58.070> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
here again when I straighten the arm the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.500 
here again when I straighten the arm the
chain<00:02:59.209> will<00:02:59.420> maintain<00:02:59.570> its<00:03:00.200> tension<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:02.360> by

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
chain will maintain its tension so by

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.009 
chain will maintain its tension so by
using<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.019> elastic<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:04.280> chain<00:03:04.810> retains<00:03:05.810> its

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
using the elastic the chain retains its

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.900 
using the elastic the chain retains its
tension<00:03:06.470> as<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.680> arm<00:03:07.040> straightens<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.579> bends

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
tension as the arm straightens and bends

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.860 
tension as the arm straightens and bends
and<00:03:08.390> doesn't<00:03:08.900> slack<00:03:09.110> off<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:10.329> need<00:03:11.329> to<00:03:11.450> cover<00:03:11.660> up

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
and doesn't slack off I need to cover up

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.660 
and doesn't slack off I need to cover up
the<00:03:12.140> pieces<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.560> elastic<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.220> hook<00:03:13.400> that
