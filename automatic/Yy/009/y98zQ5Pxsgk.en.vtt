00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.130
 it's that simple 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.740
 if you worry about how much it will cost 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.160
 participate do not worry 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.520
 the program is also free there's no 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.120
 costs to change service nothing 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.069

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 and maintenance of your lines of 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.890
 electricity or transformer pipes 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.080
 meters etc continues to be 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.000
 administered by the historical provider 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.880
 who still owns the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.239
 infrastructure will still read the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.720
 meters and by the way will continue to be 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.600
 paid for providing those services not 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.269
 There is no charge for you except for 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.950
 Of course the lowest price you will pay 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.769
 now I can even have energy 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.310
 free taking all this into account 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.610
 because you would not do it there's no logical reason 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.730
 true the only thing you could say 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.700
 It's good but I can not explain it 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.470
 I am not a good seller or I do not have the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.190
 true time 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 ok but you do not have to do everything 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.810
 what you have to do is send your 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.910
 friends to watch this video and explain it by 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.970
 you as I am explaining it to you 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.270
 now and when they register as a client 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.910
 of enver you get credit for them a 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.580
 once you have 15 registered referrals 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.360
 and they start paying your bills 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.990
 You receive free energy every month month after 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.480

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.510
 you both receive the price benefit 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.640
 super competitive prices beat 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.860
 of the historical suppliers between 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.610
 10 and 30 percent for electricity 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.490

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.450

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.900
