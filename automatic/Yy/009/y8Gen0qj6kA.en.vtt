00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:10.179
 in this opportunity it is like raising a 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:12.519
 general and specific objective taking 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:18.059
 account the framework methodology 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.059
 logical everything a tree 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.330
 of problems in the network then our 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.980
 central problem is limited standard 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.290
 edition in the company's product 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.080
 here below will always be the causes and 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.510
 the serious effects say that they have two 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.050
 direct causes that would be ability 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.090
 limited equipment and machines 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.090
 and limited process control 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.980
 productive then this is the tree of 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.430
 problems and they already made the tree 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 of objectives that is the following 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.690
 look at the limited level 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.630
 of standardization of the products of 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 the company turned the situation 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.710
 positive and it was improved 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.040
 standardization in the products of the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.070
 company this is our tree of 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.229
 objectives east of the center that was a 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.200
 problem of olvin goal is the 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.810
 general objective of the investigation 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.810
 to detect in this tree would be 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.820
 improve the level of organization is 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.430
 say one does not invent the objective 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.070
 general if I do not say it general comes out 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.670
 transform the central problem into 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.500
 positive ready then here we have 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.899
 limited capacity of equipment and 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.860
 positive machines improve the 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.210
 use of machinery in negative 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.080
 limited control of the productive process 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.259
 in positive greater control of the process 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.350
 productive these that are here that are 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:48.900
 the direct causes 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.780
 here returns by bus 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.880
 are specific objectives of the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.530
 investigation then this 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.030
 research as a general objective 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.320
 tended to improve the level of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 standardization in the product of the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.090
 company and as specific objectives of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.970
 two that is to improve the use of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.550
 machinery and greater control of 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.840
 productive process then you in 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.600
 your problem tree are going to be 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.330
 exactly the same when they have already 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.670
 elaborated the objectives tree here in 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.350
 the center will be subjectively general and in 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.180
 the direct things that you have determined 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.470
 when they have transformed them into positive 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.010
 will be your typical objectives that's 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.010
 the
