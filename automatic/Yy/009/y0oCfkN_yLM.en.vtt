date<00:03:32.050> it's<00:03:32.230> important<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:32.860> keep<00:03:33.010> aspects<00:03:33.459> of

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
date it's important to keep aspects of

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.640 
date it's important to keep aspects of
your<00:03:33.670> personality<00:03:34.020> kind<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.080> popping<00:03:35.440> out<00:03:35.500> of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
your personality kind of popping out of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.680 
your personality kind of popping out of
the<00:03:35.770> look<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.160> then<00:03:36.700> I<00:03:36.880> like<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.360> show<00:03:37.540> my
