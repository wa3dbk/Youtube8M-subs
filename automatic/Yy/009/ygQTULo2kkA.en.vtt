tutorial for saw blades this design is
stitched<00:00:05.430> by<00:00:05.910> first<00:00:06.390> stitching<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.460> large

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
stitched by first stitching a large

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.959 
stitched by first stitching a large
circle<00:00:09.110> and<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.740> can<00:00:10.889> make<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.160> as<00:00:11.340> big<00:00:11.370> or

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
circle and you can make this as big or

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.970 
circle and you can make this as big or
as<00:00:12.030> small<00:00:12.150> as<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.570> want<00:00:12.660> really<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.500> I'd<00:00:13.710> say

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
as small as you want really but I'd say

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.369 
as small as you want really but I'd say
aim<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.849> size<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.269> quarter<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:15.990> least

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
aim for the size of a quarter at least

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.920 
aim for the size of a quarter at least
then<00:00:17.369> you're<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> swirl<00:00:18.029> around<00:00:18.420> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
then you're going to swirl around and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.260 
then you're going to swirl around and
inside<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.500> its<00:00:19.680> art<00:00:19.920> shape<00:00:20.250> aiming<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
inside with its art shape aiming for the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.000 
inside with its art shape aiming for the
center<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.930> circle<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.439> can<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
center of the circle you can I have to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.910 
center of the circle you can I have to
visualize<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.850> center<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> circle<00:00:24.920> and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
visualize the center of the circle and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.589 
visualize the center of the circle and
you're<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.519> simply<00:00:26.699> travel<00:00:27.240> such

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you're going to just simply travel such

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
you're going to just simply travel such
and<00:00:27.810> work<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.230> way<00:00:28.289> around<00:00:28.590> arching<00:00:29.550> into

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and work your way around arching into

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.209 
and work your way around arching into
that<00:00:30.179> center<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> back<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> edge<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
that center and back out to the edge of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.299 
that center and back out to the edge of
the<00:00:32.340> circle<00:00:32.600> back<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.660> forth<00:00:34.230> until<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the circle back and forth until you

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
the circle back and forth until you
reach<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.300> around<00:00:36.840> back<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
reach all the way around back to the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.729 
reach all the way around back to the
beginning<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:39.780> creates<00:00:40.170> an<00:00:40.320> effect<00:00:40.590> that

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
beginning this creates an effect that

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.979 
beginning this creates an effect that
kind<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> looks<00:00:41.460> like<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.700> saw<00:00:42.090> blade<00:00:42.360> that's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
kind of looks like a saw blade that's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
kind of looks like a saw blade that's
why<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> named<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
why I named it that and if you want to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.119 
why I named it that and if you want to
you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.660> fill<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.620> circles

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you can fill in with little circles

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.610 
you can fill in with little circles
around<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.600> kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.930> aim<00:00:49.140> for

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
around it but really I kind of aim for

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.420 
around it but really I kind of aim for
really<00:00:50.550> big<00:00:50.730> circles<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.739> it<00:00:52.739> can

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
really big circles here it can

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
really big circles here it can
definitely<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.329> fill<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.230> very<00:00:55.440> nice<00:00:55.649> fill

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
definitely be a fill in a very nice fill

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.209 
definitely be a fill in a very nice fill
but<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.360> want<00:00:57.690> these<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.199> big<00:00:58.710> enough<00:00:58.859> so

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
but you want these to be big enough so

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
but you want these to be big enough so
that<00:00:59.250> you're<00:00:59.520> not<00:00:59.640> squishing<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> really

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that you're not squishing and and really

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
that you're not squishing and and really
struggling<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.520> these<00:01:02.730> beautiful<00:01:03.359> art

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
struggling to get these beautiful art

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.310 
struggling to get these beautiful art
shapes<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.430> space<00:01:06.080> consistently<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
shapes into the space consistently I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.340 
shapes into the space consistently I
really<00:01:08.280> liked<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.729> whenever<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.350> starting

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
really liked it whenever the starting

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.080 
really liked it whenever the starting
circle<00:01:10.799> was<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.280> least<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.640> size<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
circle was at least the size of a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
circle was at least the size of a
quarter<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.320> also<00:01:13.500> found<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
quarter and I also found that it was a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
quarter and I also found that it was a
lot<00:01:14.549> easier<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> branch<00:01:15.960> into<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
lot easier to kind of branch into it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.550 
lot easier to kind of branch into it
when<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.479> moving<00:01:18.479> into<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> circle

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
when I was moving into the circle

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
when I was moving into the circle
coveted<00:01:20.340> down<00:01:20.549> remotion

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
coveted down remotion

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.550 
coveted down remotion
you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:22.049> I'm<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
you can see how I'm just kind of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.530 
you can see how I'm just kind of
swirling<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:24.509> arch<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.950> downward

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
swirling that arch in the the downward

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
swirling that arch in the the downward
direction<00:01:27.540> whenever<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.530> trying<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.250> form

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
direction whenever I was trying to form

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.569 
direction whenever I was trying to form
it<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> opposite<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:31.040> kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> creating

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it the opposite way kind of creating

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.080 
it the opposite way kind of creating
more<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.329> C<00:01:33.869> shape<00:01:34.200> than<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> U<00:01:34.860> shape<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.490> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
more of a C shape than a U shape I just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.429 
more of a C shape than a U shape I just
found<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.570> bit<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.869> difficult<00:01:37.320> but

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
found it a little bit more difficult but

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.020 
found it a little bit more difficult but
play<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.640> what<00:01:38.820> works

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
play with it and then see what works

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.240 
play with it and then see what works
best<00:01:39.329> for<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.780> play<00:01:40.530> with<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> different

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
best for you play with the different

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.420 
best for you play with the different
directions<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.689> found<00:01:43.170> making<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.310> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
directions so I found making it in that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830 
directions so I found making it in that
direction<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.270> stitched<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.720> then

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
direction that I just stitched and then

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690 
direction that I just stitched and then
I<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:46.950> changed

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
I you see that I actually changed

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.160 
I you see that I actually changed
direction<00:01:47.970> right<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.020> was

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
direction right there and that was

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.990 
direction right there and that was
because<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.770> felt<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.130> awkward<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
because it just felt a little awkward to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.660 
because it just felt a little awkward to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
brains work differently so one way might

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.789

going to be a design that works best in

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.300 
going to be a design that works best in
areas<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.060> are<00:02:34.780> kind<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.710> open<00:02:36.160> and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
areas that are kind of open and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.060 
areas that are kind of open and
uncomplicated<00:02:36.970> yes<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.110> could<00:02:38.560> make<00:02:38.890> these

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
uncomplicated yes you could make these

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.190 
uncomplicated yes you could make these
saw<00:02:39.340> blades<00:02:39.640> very<00:02:39.790> small<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.600> tiny<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
saw blades very small and tiny and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080 
saw blades very small and tiny and
squish<00:02:41.470> them<00:02:41.650> into<00:02:41.860> small<00:02:42.070> areas<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:42.760> it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
squish them into small areas but it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.970 
squish them into small areas but it
would<00:02:43.240> probably<00:02:43.450> be<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.990> big<00:02:44.260> giant<00:02:44.530> headache

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
would probably be a big giant headache

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.280 
would probably be a big giant headache
so<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> would<00:02:46.030> say<00:02:46.150> an<00:02:46.270> open<00:02:46.630> uncomplicated

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
so I would say an open uncomplicated

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.100 
so I would say an open uncomplicated
area<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.100> around<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.670> very<00:02:49.090> large<00:02:49.420> applique

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
area like around a very large applique

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.250 
area like around a very large applique
or<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.860> pieced<00:02:51.460> blocks<00:02:51.910> that's<00:02:52.510> be<00:02:52.870> really

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
or in pieced blocks that's be really

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.840 
or in pieced blocks that's be really
good<00:02:53.440> areas<00:02:53.770> for<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.070> design<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.520> go<00:02:54.670> in

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
good areas for this design to go in

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.970 
good areas for this design to go in
another<00:02:55.810> thing<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.140> keep<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.410> mind<00:02:56.470> even

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
another thing to keep in mind even

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.150 
another thing to keep in mind even
though<00:02:57.400> these<00:02:57.910> are<00:02:58.090> very<00:02:58.420> large<00:02:58.780> circles<00:02:59.500> it

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
though these are very large circles it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.820 
though these are very large circles it
is<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.430> time-consuming<00:03:01.120> design<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.590> took

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
is a time-consuming design it took

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.580 
is a time-consuming design it took
around<00:03:02.950> 30<00:03:03.550> minutes<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.300> fill<00:03:04.600> this<00:03:04.870> four<00:03:05.320> inch

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
around 30 minutes to fill this four inch

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.700 
around 30 minutes to fill this four inch
square<00:03:06.160> with<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:07.480> size<00:03:08.020> and<00:03:08.320> shape<00:03:08.530> of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
square with this size and shape of

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.220 
square with this size and shape of
circles<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.910> can<00:03:10.060> kind<00:03:10.270> of<00:03:10.360> multiply<00:03:10.990> that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
circles so you can kind of multiply that

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.930 
circles so you can kind of multiply that
by<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.530> space<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.190> you're<00:03:12.310> wanting<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.730> fill

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
by the space that you're wanting to fill

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.030 
by the space that you're wanting to fill
in<00:03:13.060> your<00:03:13.150> quilt<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:14.320> how<00:03:14.560> time-consuming

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
in your quilt and see how time-consuming

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.850 
in your quilt and see how time-consuming
it's<00:03:15.760> going<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.180> be<00:03:16.390> it's<00:03:17.050> not<00:03:17.290> something<00:03:17.709> I

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
it's going to be it's not something I

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.920

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.650 
would want to cover acres and acres led
it<00:03:20.230> would<00:03:20.410> just<00:03:20.650> take<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.860> lot<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.400> time<00:03:21.670> so

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
it would just take a lot of time so

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.150 
it would just take a lot of time so
