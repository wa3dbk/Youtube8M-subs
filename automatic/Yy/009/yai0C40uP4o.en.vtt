some C tape around the edge just to save
the<00:00:51.120> paint<00:00:51.659> protection<00:00:54.290> it's<00:00:55.290> just<00:00:55.470> a<00:00:55.559> slow

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800

Jagr kid for drilling a hole just for
the<00:01:08.370> boiling<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:08.880> through<00:01:11.840> easy<00:01:14.570> you'll

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the boiling to go through easy you'll

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.050 
the boiling to go through easy you'll
probably<00:01:15.900> find<00:01:16.230> that<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.890> wire<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.820> comes

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
probably find that the wire that comes

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
probably find that the wire that comes
with<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> badge<00:01:18.900> will<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.980> be<00:01:20.100> added<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
with the badge will have to be added to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.240 
with the badge will have to be added to
to<00:01:21.120> get<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.300> these<00:01:21.660> connection<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.710> light

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to get to these connection for the light

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.880 
to get to these connection for the light
switch<00:01:23.430> gears<00:01:23.850> slightly<00:01:24.210> adjustment<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.650> um

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
switch gears slightly adjustment just um

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.330

took<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.970> black<00:01:27.180> panel<00:01:27.510> off<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> top<00:01:28.340> then

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
took that black panel off the top then

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.600 
took that black panel off the top then
you<00:01:29.370> can<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:30.590> wire<00:01:31.590> hook<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.190> pull<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
you can get a wire hook and pull the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.780 
you can get a wire hook and pull the
cable<00:01:33.210> through<00:01:33.540> its<00:01:33.810> easiest<00:01:34.110> way<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.560> it

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
cable through its easiest way to do it

cable through its easiest way to do it
better<00:01:35.790> than<00:01:35.940> going<00:01:36.119> underneath<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.930> found<00:01:37.680> it

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
better than going underneath I found it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.910 
better than going underneath I found it
much<00:01:37.860> easier<00:01:38.160> just<00:01:39.119> extend<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.630> of

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
much easier just extend a bit of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.170 
much easier just extend a bit of
electrical<00:01:40.920> wire<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.550> go<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.940> switch

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
electrical wire on to go to the switch

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.200 
electrical wire on to go to the switch
and<00:01:42.509> you'll<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.750> right<00:01:43.940> just<00:01:44.940> doing

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and you'll be right just doing

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.440 
and you'll be right just doing
reassembly<00:01:45.930> putting<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> respective<00:01:46.920> setter

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
reassembly putting the respective setter

the<00:01:48.450> Waring<00:01:49.190> actually<00:01:50.190> worked<00:01:50.430> pretty<00:01:50.520> good

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the Waring actually worked pretty good

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:00.440 
the Waring actually worked pretty good
going<00:01:51.119> through<00:01:58.759> we've<00:01:59.759> worked<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.180> which

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
going through we've worked out which

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.150 
going through we've worked out which
word<00:02:00.750> connects<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:02.899> you<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.140> cut<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.920> trim

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
word connects and you just cut and trim

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
word connects and you just cut and trim
the<00:02:05.310> wire<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.030> connect<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.399> sender<00:02:08.479> light<00:02:09.479> to
