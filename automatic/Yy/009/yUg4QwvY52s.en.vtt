to take some time out and show you some
tricks<00:00:20.170> along<00:00:20.500> the<00:00:20.560> way<00:00:21.330> okay<00:00:22.330> first<00:00:22.630> of<00:00:22.840> all

tricks along the way okay first of all

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.419 
tricks along the way okay first of all
when<00:00:23.140> you're<00:00:23.230> stacking<00:00:23.500> stone<00:00:23.949> what<00:00:24.189> I<00:00:24.220> want

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
when you're stacking stone what I want

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.740 
when you're stacking stone what I want
you<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:24.580> know<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.760> there's<00:00:24.910> always<00:00:25.090> a<00:00:25.240> top<00:00:25.539> and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
you to know is there's always a top and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.900 
you to know is there's always a top and
a<00:00:25.810> bottom<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.260> the<00:00:26.380> rock<00:00:26.590> always<00:00:27.550> sometimes

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
a bottom to the rock always sometimes

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.220 
a bottom to the rock always sometimes
there's<00:00:28.090> multiple<00:00:28.480> tops<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:28.869> bottoms<00:00:29.109> but

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
there's multiple tops and bottoms but

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.200 
there's multiple tops and bottoms but
for<00:00:29.410> example<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:30.429> can<00:00:30.580> see<00:00:30.730> this<00:00:30.849> guy<00:00:31.029> has<00:00:31.179> a

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
for example you can see this guy has a

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.850 
for example you can see this guy has a
nice<00:00:31.390> flat<00:00:31.720> edge<00:00:31.960> we're<00:00:32.650> going<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.800> be

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
nice flat edge we're going to be

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.740 
nice flat edge we're going to be
stacking<00:00:33.280> up<00:00:33.399> on<00:00:33.489> top<00:00:33.730> of<00:00:33.910> this<00:00:34.000> so<00:00:34.480> you<00:00:34.510> don't

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
stacking up on top of this so you don't

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.110 
stacking up on top of this so you don't
want<00:00:34.870> this<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.110> be<00:00:35.230> round<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:36.700> first<00:00:37.000> and

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
want this to be round that's first and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.810 
want this to be round that's first and
foremost<00:00:37.379> this<00:00:38.379> rock<00:00:38.620> for<00:00:38.829> example<00:00:38.860> it<00:00:39.670> has<00:00:39.789> a

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
foremost this rock for example it has a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.750 
foremost this rock for example it has a
couple<00:00:40.149> of<00:00:40.210> edges<00:00:40.570> kind<00:00:41.320> of<00:00:41.440> flat<00:00:41.649> here<00:00:42.039> it's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
couple of edges kind of flat here it's

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.250 
couple of edges kind of flat here it's
got<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.940> back<00:00:43.149> it's<00:00:43.390> flat<00:00:43.600> here<00:00:43.809> so<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.020> can<00:00:44.110> go

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
got a back it's flat here so it can go

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.430 
got a back it's flat here so it can go
up<00:00:44.350> tight<00:00:44.559> against<00:00:44.920> here<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.420> we<00:00:47.020> drop<00:00:47.289> this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
up tight against here so we drop this

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.270 
up tight against here so we drop this
rock<00:00:47.649> in<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:49.090> it's<00:00:49.270> nice<00:00:49.719> and<00:00:49.750> flat<00:00:50.140> plain<00:00:50.469> so

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
rock in now it's nice and flat plain so

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.160 
rock in now it's nice and flat plain so
let<00:00:51.489> me<00:00:51.550> just<00:00:51.699> show<00:00:51.789> you<00:00:51.820> what<00:00:52.270> this<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.140> a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
let me just show you what this is a

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.869 
let me just show you what this is a
great<00:00:53.410> rock<00:00:53.590> there's<00:00:54.129> a<00:00:54.190> bunch<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.520> tops<00:00:54.730> and

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
great rock there's a bunch of tops and

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.880 
great rock there's a bunch of tops and
bottoms<00:00:55.149> this<00:00:55.989> one<00:00:56.199> I<00:00:56.379> don't<00:00:56.440> like<00:00:56.559> it<00:00:56.800> this

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
bottoms this one I don't like it this

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.830 
bottoms this one I don't like it this
way<00:00:57.100> as<00:00:57.219> much<00:00:57.430> because<00:00:57.940> it's<00:00:58.090> slanted<00:00:58.570> here

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
way as much because it's slanted here

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.930 
way as much because it's slanted here
and<00:00:58.989> it's<00:00:59.469> round<00:00:59.739> here<00:01:00.100> I<00:01:00.280> want<00:01:00.579> to<00:01:00.640> get<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.789> nice

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
and it's round here I want to get a nice

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.000 
and it's round here I want to get a nice
flat<00:01:01.239> plane<00:01:01.510> for<00:01:01.719> stacking<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.649> I<00:01:02.680> would<00:01:02.890> say

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
flat plane for stacking so I would say

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.610 
flat plane for stacking so I would say
this<00:01:03.129> is<00:01:03.280> definitely<00:01:03.309> not<00:01:03.699> a<00:01:03.760> top<00:01:07.440> this<00:01:08.440> side

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
this is definitely not a top this side

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.430 
this is definitely not a top this side
for<00:01:08.770> example<00:01:08.860> that's<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.850> great<00:01:10.060> top<00:01:10.270> now<00:01:10.870> also

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
for example that's a great top now also

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.200 
for example that's a great top now also
what<00:01:11.830> we're<00:01:11.950> doing<00:01:12.190> is<00:01:12.340> we'll<00:01:12.880> take<00:01:13.000> some

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
what we're doing is we'll take some

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.200 
what we're doing is we'll take some
other<00:01:13.330> size<00:01:13.540> stone<00:01:13.810> like<00:01:14.020> this<00:01:14.910> and<00:01:15.910> we'll<00:01:16.030> use

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
other size stone like this and we'll use

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.410 
other size stone like this and we'll use
it<00:01:16.360> in<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.110> cracks<00:01:17.380> like<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.150> what<00:01:19.330> this

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
it in the cracks like this and what this

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.000 
it in the cracks like this and what this
does<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.750> helps<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:20.080> lock<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.560> stones<00:01:20.800> into

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
does it helps to lock the stones into

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.070 
does it helps to lock the stones into
place<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:22.050> we'll<00:01:23.050> use<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> foam<00:01:23.470> gun<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:25.080> not

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
place and we'll use a foam gun and not

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.500 
place and we'll use a foam gun and not
everyone<00:01:26.410> does<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.770> but<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.850> like<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.270> go<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
everyone does this but we like to go the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.720 
everyone does this but we like to go the
extra<00:01:28.630> mile<00:01:29.020> here<00:01:29.200> we'll<00:01:30.070> just<00:01:30.220> drop<00:01:30.370> a<00:01:30.430> little

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
extra mile here we'll just drop a little

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.480 
extra mile here we'll just drop a little
bit<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:30.880> foam<00:01:31.060> in<00:01:31.240> here<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:33.130> when<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> foam

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
bit of foam in here and when the foam

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.600 
bit of foam in here and when the foam
solidifies<00:01:34.090> it's<00:01:34.360> expanding<00:01:34.870> foam<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:36.400> locks

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
solidifies it's expanding foam it locks

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.770 
solidifies it's expanding foam it locks
everything<00:01:36.910> into<00:01:37.150> place<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.570> gives<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.750> more

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
everything into place and gives you more

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:48.370 
everything into place and gives you more
stability<00:01:38.080> especially<00:01:39.070> on<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.220> taller<00:01:39.460> wall

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.770 

now<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.680> professional<00:01:50.159> gun<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.659> gun

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
now this is a professional gun the gun

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.190 
now this is a professional gun the gun
cost<00:01:52.020> about<00:01:52.229> 80<00:01:52.439> bucks<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:55.020> really

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
cost about 80 bucks but it's really

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.420 
cost about 80 bucks but it's really
worth<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.619> you're<00:01:55.740> doing<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.979> larger<00:01:56.250> pond

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
worth it if you're doing a larger pond

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.340 
worth it if you're doing a larger pond
but<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:56.700> also<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.479> do-it-yourself

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
but you also can get a do-it-yourself

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.679 
but you also can get a do-it-yourself
can<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.040> foam<00:01:59.220> has<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> long<00:02:00.060> applique<00:02:00.540> ting

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
can of foam has a long applique ting

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.820 
can of foam has a long applique ting
nozzle<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.320> squirt<00:02:01.500> into<00:02:01.680> the

nozzle that you can squirt into the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.039

that<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.270> think<00:03:03.480> every<00:03:03.660> pond<00:03:03.840> should<00:03:04.050> have

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that I think every pond should have

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.750 
that I think every pond should have
right<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.890> fish<00:03:05.340> tunnel<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
right here this is a fish tunnel that

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.820 
right here this is a fish tunnel that
we're<00:03:05.910> creating<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> pond<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.680> can

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
we're creating in the pond as you can

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.199 
we're creating in the pond as you can
see<00:03:07.950> we've<00:03:08.099> integrated<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.580> little<00:03:08.760> shelf<00:03:09.000> into

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.750 
see we've integrated a little shelf into
the<00:03:09.480> excavation<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.319> we<00:03:11.130> put<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.459> large

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
the excavation and we put this large

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.150 
the excavation and we put this large
culvert<00:03:12.209> pipe<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.569> here<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.470> about<00:03:13.620> 14

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
culvert pipe in here it's about 14

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.510 
culvert pipe in here it's about 14
inches<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:15.560> once<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.680> finish<00:03:16.920> rocking<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
inches and once we finish rocking it and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.390 
inches and once we finish rocking it and
you<00:03:17.580> won't<00:03:17.700> see<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.000> at<00:03:18.180> all<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:19.280> what's<00:03:20.280> going

underneath<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:27.650> rubber<00:06:27.830> liner<00:06:28.040> here<00:06:28.340> to

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
underneath the rubber liner here to

protect it from roots and sharp stones
and<00:06:30.680> such<00:06:30.860> so<00:06:31.930> liners<00:06:33.040> it's<00:06:34.040> resilient<00:06:34.610> I<00:06:34.700> mean

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
and such so liners it's resilient I mean

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.340 
and such so liners it's resilient I mean
it<00:06:35.000> can<00:06:35.120> handle<00:06:35.330> a<00:06:35.420> lot<00:06:35.630> of<00:06:35.750> compression<00:06:36.050> we

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
it can handle a lot of compression we

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.080 
it can handle a lot of compression we
can<00:06:36.500> put<00:06:36.680> a<00:06:36.710> 10-ton<00:06:37.190> Rock<00:06:37.400> right<00:06:37.700> on<00:06:37.850> top<00:06:38.060> of

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
can put a 10-ton Rock right on top of

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.960 
can put a 10-ton Rock right on top of
the<00:06:38.300> slider<00:06:38.540> and<00:06:38.720> not<00:06:38.870> damage<00:06:39.290> it<00:06:39.850> however<00:06:40.850> it

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
the slider and not damage it however it

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.030 
the slider and not damage it however it
doesn't<00:06:41.210> take<00:06:41.330> abrasion<00:06:41.840> very<00:06:42.050> well<00:06:42.260> so<00:06:42.590> if

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
doesn't take abrasion very well so if

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.260 
doesn't take abrasion very well so if
you<00:06:43.190> wanted<00:06:43.400> to<00:06:43.490> put<00:06:43.610> a<00:06:43.640> rock<00:06:43.820> down<00:06:43.970> and<00:06:44.150> move

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
you wanted to put a rock down and move

you wanted to put a rock down and move
it<00:06:44.420> around<00:06:44.540> a<00:06:44.810> little<00:06:44.930> bit<00:06:45.080> it's<00:06:45.440> good<00:06:45.620> to<00:06:45.710> have

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
it around a little bit it's good to have

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.720 
it around a little bit it's good to have
a<00:06:45.860> little<00:06:46.100> piece<00:06:46.220> of<00:06:46.250> underlayment

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
a little piece of underlayment

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.790 
a little piece of underlayment
underneath<00:06:47.180> here<00:06:47.420> so<00:06:48.050> since<00:06:48.620> we're<00:06:48.770> using

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800
