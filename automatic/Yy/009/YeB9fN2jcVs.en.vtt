from the last year's
your<00:02:03.240> seasons<00:02:03.690> match<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.120> it's<00:02:06.120> probably

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
your seasons match so it's probably

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.950 
your seasons match so it's probably
gonna<00:02:06.690> be<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.900> whole<00:02:07.320> lot<00:02:07.350> like<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:07.980> one<00:02:08.960> if

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
gonna be a whole lot like that one if

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.630

you<00:02:10.200> want<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.740> go<00:02:10.890> back<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.340> look<00:02:11.490> at

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you want to just go back and look at

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.180 
you want to just go back and look at
that<00:02:11.910> that'll<00:02:12.750> probably<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.380> fairly<00:02:13.830> good

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
that that'll probably be a fairly good

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.900 
that that'll probably be a fairly good
