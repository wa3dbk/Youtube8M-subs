00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.429

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.990
 come to me a little bit by chance he gets 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.820
 find that I had been interested since 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.260
 a long time ago and at one point I 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.689
 met the California tattoo artist 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.859
 sony bic and she saw my job she 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.960
 offered to take it 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.519
 so I was his apprentice for a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 period of two years and then here is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 since now I work for myself 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.440
 on my side in my voice 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.960
 commander which I started with 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.129
 a few months then the name is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 not something that I found 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.450
 but it's not something that I had 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.309
 the right to choose in learning 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 a little traditional the chosen master 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.670
 for the student and suddenly it's my 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 boss who called me this is their 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.260
 romance in honor in memory we will say 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.030

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.219

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.789
 flop it was to selor or captain and 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.309
 for marine tattoos cd no a 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.260
 obliged I was told my passion for the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 middle me then he's pretty simple me 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.850
 I grew up near the sea between 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.430
 Brittany and Normandy 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.470
 my house of quarrels and saint malo 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 on the beach and that's how I grew up 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.939
 word my youth by the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.590
 boat going to sea being one goes 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.670
 say passionate about the maritime history of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.409
 the history of discovery 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.869
 and then here I am a traveler 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.210
 which I admire people who to others 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.960
 epochs traveling with maybe more than 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.090
 risks now 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.070
 So I'm trying my job 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.680
 celebrates the lives of travelers 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.240
 so I started drawing there are 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.090
 long enough I started the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.500
 to draw at the age of 4-5 we will tell 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.729
 from the age of 10 I have for 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 crowned almost every day at 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.450
 drawing so I have some training to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 the origin of illustrators in the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.829
 advertising in publishing and I 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.899
 worked for several years as 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.759
 artistic director and illustrator 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.770
 professional before I devote more 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.960
 to my sailors tattoos and suddenly 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.820
 it's more a turnaround but it's been 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.070
 everything is based precisely on the fact that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.450
 I like drawings and it's my 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.200
 universe that I'm trying to put forward 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.140
 tattoos 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.240
 I liked them 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.459
 man we see the old tattoo that 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.840
 have become all blue and is almost 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.730
 like a stain on the arms and I 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.650
 always found that beautiful and then 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.420
 me when I started working on 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.310
 will tell my drawings I was not yet 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.020
 your thouars at the time but it was already 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.340
 tattooed and we had tattoos in 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.860
 color it turns out I have some 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.660
 allergic reactions to the color of the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.490
 I started making my notebooks 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.260
 of drawings just black because I 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.910
 knew that if I had to make them 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.950
 it would be necessary that the black faces the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.080
 only color that my skin endure I 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.580
 do not know today how much I have 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.440
 made two henna tattoos I know 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.380
 that we are going to have to be several 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.030
 hundreds today because in three 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.940
 four years I saw at first having 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.739
 a few customers and that makes an impression 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.970
 snowball and today we will say 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.100
 I have a lot of demand 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.670
 more because I can assure at 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.440
 daily 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.380
 I already had a large clientele 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.970
 foreign a lot of Americans who 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.670
 I had come there are not very 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.940
 long a submarine captain 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.910
 I had jets had a navy unit 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.860
 seals from the san diego base which i 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.310
 drawn the emblem they all 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.840
 tattooed 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.700
 I have a lot of people who are part 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.380
 really from the marine world and who are not 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.690
 French who are coming so I tell myself 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.430
 that there are bound to be people 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.010
 interested in those countries and suddenly 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.350
 I am very very willing to go 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.959
 theater and I do a lot of tattoos 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.120
 which are related to the marine environment 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.100
 but I also get out of people 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.989
 of backgrounds and power can 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.370
 explore many others so much done 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.150
 me what interests me is to use 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.220
 my my illustrative style to express 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.380
 the things my clients are looking for 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.720
 express on them and suddenly I have not 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.799
 afraid to attack other topics where 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.380
 I find it pretty 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.480
 enriching to be able to extend 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.709
 and precisely I agree with 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.120
 marine but there is also the aspect 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.860
 traveler and traveler it's not 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.870
 simply on a boat it's on foot 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.970
 it's the love of nature the love of the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.739
 life so it does not really have any limits 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.510
 to what can be represented in this 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.610
 universe there now I opened the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.350
 living room and that 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.420
 yeah that allows me to have my clients 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.460
 I would like to work regularly 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.070
 on a book that would group together we'll say 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.700
 my vision of the tattoo code of 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.290
 sailors and that I think it's going to be the 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.690
 project of the two courses of the two 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.519
 coming years will come to create a 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.460
 book that will compensate for what I 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.800
 I have always wanted to find 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.050
 a few is 4 hours 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.700
 does where some sailors adventure 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.250
 have little or no application 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.250
 this is goodbye combined
