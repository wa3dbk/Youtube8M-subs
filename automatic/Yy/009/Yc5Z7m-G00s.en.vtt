00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.980
 elected qoop.nl the link is in the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.870
 Description 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 yo people i'm market of her thanks 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.190
 did this again is the ps speaker remote 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.269
 series team damn shows to play 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.860
 I have to say 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.570
 at least it teams quite fine my only one 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.970
 I do not hope to purchase with the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.949
 goal or how to pronounce it 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.170
 your random 17-year push with five sturgeons 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.850
 weaker leg that until now still 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 nice swimming you may chill sick 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.990
 santiago arias is playing that 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.090
 miraculously often with a fork 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.289
 for the also called Nepal 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.300
 after he boldly scored against 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.920
 vitesse now scored a 0 to go 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.360
 ahead eagles 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.820
 and I sat with my a-team because I thought 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 Purchase it out as always tricky 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 no show also in real life is pretty good 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 awkward but i'll play the ball and you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.010
 Locadia broad narsingh him and great 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.469
 Bertels can turns free of the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.760
 defender nasty and longest keeper to one 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.719
 kind of way no to make at the beginning 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 from the second half 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 and I find myself just like last year 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.739
 when I curiositÃ©s the premier league 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 that I really mega a lot in the beginning 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.870
 effort and whatever I know I know 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.270
 safe sorry had very little trouble 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.040
 but the end when we were full of feyenoord 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 nevertheless ends two and twice in a row 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.250
 so then I have to be very careful 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.049
 that actually does not go wrong 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.700
 but luckily it does n't all go there 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.500
 fine I am at the top so nothing about it 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 hand you have your tongue complaint you know or 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.900
 school time I decided in the competition 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.330
 against nac 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.670
 kind of a baby like that 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.130
 you know what it is marina i can do it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.600
 sometime try so I put the title 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.729
 in premiere prima hendriks tamata 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.320
 tomatoes half then i would like to say 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.820
 but scarce maier 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.920
 salem and then grease than matavz 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.600
 and bakkali now can all play and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.490
 then I hope that goes well and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.590
 I start pretty well because after about 16 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.030
 minutes off here in possession as 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.320
 he gives the ball wide on brown reeds 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.270
 then at least he tries the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.560
 worship of also intercepted attempts 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.909
 him from playing football in the village 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.560
 shy but that is never strong 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.719
 point and bakkali cares about you well 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.060
 wide on my bag and that as shooting 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.680
 because hard in the net 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.210
 and so it is a very borman bag 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.490
 more than a great playing moment 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.079
 nature double o upgrades and then you think 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.509
 pretty quickly this also can not be fine 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.140
 be a player but that is certainly tim matavz 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.430
 well 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.960
 and then everything is cared about here 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.910
 pak allium bakkali with snorkel 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.710
 always dangerous and the ball ended up 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.020
 I at ado but who cares for it 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.820
 head of bryan ruiz and he headed two 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.890
 dollars not all mourning I stand 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.360
 there is a simple lead on my rice and 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.430
 that is so far I tell this story 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 delivery I worrying cruise rules 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.510
 control and then continue the game 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.190
 because if even the moult goes header 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.110
 score yes then you know your best 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.190
 are busy and that's why I complain 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.380
 not even if I have a second one 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.490
 victory book this hallmark ah oh want 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.020
 I can also just dominate them 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.640
 defend super chill 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.250
 at least on corio I have to tell you ho 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.990
 stuff grimaud you know i've been doing it for years 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.240
 it's just mostly it was 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.460
 although I can never play without this year 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.930
 to record for series but good 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.400
 also in the away match against cambuur 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.930
 I file some changes too 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.820
 I decide to put those boxes or something like that 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.860
 sometime some playground suits 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.240
 also by selecting query but that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.550
 is not in c and then I can do something 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.140
 vincent logically and I thought 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.880
 just try because it does 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.900
 ryokans seems to be nobody with much 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.980
 potential 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.740
 and how should I leave him of course 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.360
 play that it can grow much but 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.390
 really what 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.410
 to purify a competition 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.080
 fucking is really unbelievable 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.980
 florian jozefzoon a press for being there 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.290
 quite well the taino will pass the single 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.740
 spanish from well no 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.520
 farmer jan joost such is something real 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.930

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.880

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.500

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.540
 loka that will scare the page 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.820
 alt and that she wants fantastic together 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.830
 what score twice now but as offline 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.960
 as a gloriani jos person not 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.300
 than what I just really played 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.280
 five made process 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.830

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.070

 16 with his left can not it is real 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.620
 for you to cry so bad I think there 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.410
 almost to our contracts 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.520
 but if we still have terrace for I have 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.100
 have a question 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.060
 in what they are incredible 1 or episode 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.139
 2 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.090
 get the bodysuit chuck back 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.090
 I almost lied but lied 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.249

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.240

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:30.069

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.449
 or I better not do it 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.599
 Your moment let me know in one 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.979
 response that shuttle is not looking for chuck 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:38.199
 and I notice the majority 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.529
 but this exercise comes on 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.639
 lines 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.139
 if you want that for the more 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.900
 do match delivery then you can 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.400
 let know in the comments and also let 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.199
