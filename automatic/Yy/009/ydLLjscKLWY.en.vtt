 joy of live and dream not the good 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.970
 music had remained focused and is 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.550
 stayed in my childhood that's fine 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:42.080
 what do you think about it? 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.970
 bravo huh it's precisely I wanted the 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.620
 noted that I am a little 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.570
 destabilizing when it's not good 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.800
 song 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.360
 bravo for your song choice 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.740
 I do not know this song the other 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.570
 very original is always doing it 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.730
 for a judge to learn new 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.040
 things are theirs as well as my songs 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.200
 I learned and you sing you are you see 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.970
 really angelic sings of two 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.390
 treated great accuracy with great 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.990
 rightness 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.990
 Bravo 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.889
 to be the same thing writing angel voice 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.779
 see in I believe more and that's true 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.499
 but it's a nice one later he had 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.939
 four men 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.649
 from then on one in the middle of the 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.779
 song I'm glimpsed a column 

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:24.330
 smile in the corner that has turned out géraud 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:26.759
 and must at once all of several 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.149
 sides to your personality it's beautiful to 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.949
 look at these mirages not I think we 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:33.629
 unanimously agree against a 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.219
 good choice of original songs too 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:38.069
 it's the first thing I noticed 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:40.319
 those paris dudes I felt they were 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.930
 maybe a little shy in your 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.479
 song but a continent of really 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.479
 a beautiful voice maybe become a 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.709
 little more we see for us maybe 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.259
 because we are on the side but go 

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:54.209
 see when a bath league but do not 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:58.289
 can let your shyness take over 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:06:01.189
 because you really have a hospital at
