 [Music] 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:12.900

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:16.520

 [Music] 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.530
 the years passed we went back to see each other

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.390
 would kill 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.700
 I want to eat you instead 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.700

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.369
 how to speak 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.369
 part of my mind is yours 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.189

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.189
 how to speak 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.630
 how to tell you 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 what was my fear 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.280
 by chance 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.280
 blame nothing 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.659
 and dies in your hands a piece of 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:45.270
 ice undone on the lips 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:45.270
 goodbye keeps ringing the war has finished 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.950

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.490
 each part 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.640
 in the device 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.180
 not to mention 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.410

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.360

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.480
 your mother 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.270
 and another nearby 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.090
 as speaking 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.410
 in the part of my mind she 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.410
 I find the words 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.740
 when you speak 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.080
 how to say it 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.990
 so it arrives 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.550

 [Music] 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.060
 and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.519
 part of my mind 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.060
 grilled 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.830
 because I do not know how to say 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.260
 what do you want? 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.790
