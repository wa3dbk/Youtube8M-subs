00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 so here for this first video the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.309
 leaflets rally so I'm going to do a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.219
 detailed presentation of those of his 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.400
 car hercé and if you have other 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.080
 questions to ask about this vehicle you 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 tell me in comment and I will 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.330
 will answer so let's start with the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.910
 body 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.099
 so here it is in soft plastic 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 everywhere we perceive that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:40.110
 will find after then so here's the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:43.410
 car is pretty enough here 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.020
 not bad then we will go see 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.050
 interior 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:57.710
 so we remove the little hooks that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 are here you go 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.400
 then that and that's it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.270
 there we have the whole interior of the car 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.010
 let's start with the bumper 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.860
 so that's it and if you're at the front at 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.299
 the backside nothing apart because the shock 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.820
 it's usually ahead so that's it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.360
 it is foam and just sticks 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.659
 directly to the front part here 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.140
 for rigidity 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:31.079
 then the suspensions that is at each 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.680
 kick each side this walk 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.740
 individually that's where all of a 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.610
 blow is then the car is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.400
 waterproof 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 so here's for the in the puddles 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.100
 water but little it takes not too 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 abuse for example that can not go 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.640
 on the water completely his breads 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.540
 submersible so here is a wet weather 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.890
 even rainy we can roll glue so 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.170
 then the tires are mostly erasers 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.710
 hard and tender 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.610
 that's good for that it hangs 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.489
 we are going to say it's not bad 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.290
 then the battery that is located here it 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.730
 just take off like on the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.390
 bodywork the little thing that has it 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.280
 then keeps plugged in and cables 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.520
 something like that 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.030
 then press the button that here you are 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.930
 here by here 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.120
 then it will flash red and the set 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.130
 and that means that the car and time 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.239
 and then with remote control enough 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:51.810
 to light here it could help me 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:54.840
 how and how to roll but I think 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.080
 that it will always be this part 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.330
 there of the car then there is bass and 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.510
 same thing as the nakhlé stuff before here 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.870
 for the customer the bodywork and so 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.500
 right now 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.760
 so the car is about compared 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:19.769
 it's not a hand not here 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:22.340
 to do that it's over we're going to say 30 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:26.959
 pennies that nurtures the third 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.480
 track the cdu in eighteenth the car 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.359
 and then I tell you everything else 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:38.640
 then let's move on to the remote that 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:44.760
 is from here so here in advance we go back 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:48.510
 where we brake so this little thing 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:52.170
 hours it serves to put a case to 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:58.350
 aligned the front wheels for a pack of 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:00.420
 life here is the romance to find 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.160
 then the little red button that 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.860
 exist to choose the modes and yes 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.820
 it's on this car there are three 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.880
 modes the sport mode the race mode and the 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.160
 Fashion's love the fashion race could 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.620
 to go straight 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.980
 she can not roll back and will roll to 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.110
 bottom and can not go back 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.930
 the sport mode can go back to 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.300
 bottom and test mode will roll at 50% of 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.450
 his abilities 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.420
 example if a role at 58 m eur she will have 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:39.590
 more than 25 m eur half is a 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.440
 example I do not know how much rolls 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:49.170
 then the car will be delivered delivered 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:53.640
 in a carton where there will be so 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:56.060
 car presentation and mode 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.810
 it was a gift 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.940
 and as this car comes from the states 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.220
 United 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:09.900
 you have to buy an adapter for the 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:14.630
 load because expected because, 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.630
 does the charger is written like that 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.050
 and so you have to buy an adapter 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.990
 for France me I do a little 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.700
 DIY because it did not come back 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.900
 then that's so since she puts in 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.200
 and that's so I think the to die 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.200
 above 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:41.939
 after the worship mileage of the car 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.309
 I'm telling the speed at which a 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:46.409
 role I'm not sure I would 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:50.399
 test later in a 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:53.460
 next video and no that's it I think 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:56.669
 that my ski was now because 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.129
 I do not see anything else to say if 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.469
 you have questions about who they are 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.149
 are 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:08.089
 it can be the car without my chain 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:11.039
 or on the next coming videos 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:13.610
 do not hesitate i will answer you we will 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.610
 see thanks
