that is the trick when you're working
with<00:01:15.299> multiple<00:01:15.540> colors<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.590> ones<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.520> will

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
with multiple colors use ones that will

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.060 
with multiple colors use ones that will
complement<00:01:19.080> each<00:01:19.110> other<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.680> look<00:01:19.830> good

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
complement each other and look good

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.320 
complement each other and look good
together<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.930> they're<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.500> blend<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.330> so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
together when they're all blend in so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.649 
together when they're all blend in so
here's<00:01:24.659> our<00:01:24.840> color<00:01:25.170> number<00:01:25.470> two<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:29.700> give

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
here's our color number two and to give

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.039 
here's our color number two and to give

I some<00:02:10.709> dimension<00:02:11.360> now<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.420> trick<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
I some dimension now the trick of

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.380 
I some dimension now the trick of
applying<00:02:13.680> multiple<00:02:13.890> colors<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.730> said<00:02:15.090> is

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
applying multiple colors like I said is

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.289 
applying multiple colors like I said is
to<00:02:15.569> get<00:02:15.750> ones<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.579> just<00:02:17.579> look<00:02:17.879> well<00:02:18.090> together

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
to get ones that just look well together

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:27.800 
to get ones that just look well together
the<00:02:18.900> blend<00:02:19.170> well<00:02:19.379> together<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.900> match<00:02:24.049> so<00:02:26.810> we

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
the blend well together and match so we

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.600 
the blend well together and match so we
