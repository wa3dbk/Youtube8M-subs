00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
I'm gonna have a little bit more speed

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.110 
I'm gonna have a little bit more speed
this<00:02:07.710> time<00:02:07.950> since<00:02:08.220> I'm<00:02:08.369> coming<00:02:08.670> from<00:02:08.789> jail

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.960 

that<00:02:13.120> was<00:02:13.300> like<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:14.470> was<00:02:14.680> honestly<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.490> I

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
that was like that was honestly like I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.570 
that was like that was honestly like I
know<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.450> game<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.930> are<00:02:17.290> not<00:02:17.770> lag<00:02:18.070> but

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
know this game and are not lag but

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.180 
know this game and are not lag but
something<00:02:19.450> bugged<00:02:19.750> was<00:02:20.050> was<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.800> thing

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
something bugged was was on the thing

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.230 
something bugged was was on the thing
there<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:23.190> might<00:02:24.190> impress<00:02:24.550> some<00:02:24.790> button<00:02:25.090> by

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
there I might impress some button by

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.000 
there I might impress some button by
mistake<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.930> went<00:02:26.320> too<00:02:26.440> far<00:02:26.680> away<00:02:26.860> but

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
mistake and I went too far away but

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.210 
mistake and I went too far away but
anyway<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.970> way<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.350> jump<00:02:29.680> down

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
anyway that is the way if you jump down

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.410 
anyway that is the way if you jump down
to<00:02:30.730> there<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.380> will<00:02:32.560> be<00:02:32.620> going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.460> a<00:02:33.820> room

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
to there you will be going to a room

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.910 
to there you will be going to a room
where<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.630> can<00:02:34.780> get<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:34.990> couple<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.380> guns<00:02:35.530> they

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
where you can get a couple of guns they

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.160 
where you can get a couple of guns they
are<00:02:36.240> rifles<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:38.200> there's<00:02:38.410> an<00:02:38.530> SMG<00:02:38.940> but

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
are rifles and and there's an SMG but

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.540 
are rifles and and there's an SMG but
they're<00:02:41.170> not<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.440> best<00:02:41.560> weapons<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.370> map

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
they're not the best weapons on this map

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.160 
they're not the best weapons on this map
if<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.880> want<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.180> get<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.420> best<00:02:43.660> weapon<00:02:44.080> so

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
if you want to get the best weapon so

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.540 
if you want to get the best weapon so
you're<00:02:44.260> gonna<00:02:44.350> want<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.680> go<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.830> Morrow<00:02:45.220> room

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
you're gonna want to go to Morrow room

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.520 
you're gonna want to go to Morrow room
and<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:45.790> actually<00:02:46.000> gonna<00:02:46.210> try<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.780> go<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and I'm actually gonna try and go to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.260 
and I'm actually gonna try and go to
Mario<00:02:47.920> room<00:02:48.100> now<00:02:48.280> I'm<00:02:48.460> gonna<00:02:48.670> show<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.000> one<00:02:49.240> of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
Mario room now I'm gonna show you one of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.540 
Mario room now I'm gonna show you one of
the<00:02:49.570> simplest<00:02:50.020> ways<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.680> get<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.040> mari<00:02:51.280> room

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
the simplest ways to get to mari room

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.760 
the simplest ways to get to mari room
it's<00:02:51.790> not<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.120> fastest<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:52.780> if<00:02:53.290> playing<00:02:53.620> in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
it's not the fastest so if playing in

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.320 
it's not the fastest so if playing in
the<00:02:53.830> serious<00:02:54.160> game<00:02:54.340> people<00:02:54.580> probably<00:02:55.000> already

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
the serious game people probably already

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.530 
the serious game people probably already
be<00:02:55.690> there<00:02:55.900> but<00:02:56.050> hopefully<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:57.420> killing<00:02:58.420> other

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
be there but hopefully and killing other

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.970 
be there but hopefully and killing other
people<00:02:58.900> would<00:02:59.020> be<00:02:59.110> turned<00:02:59.350> off<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.710> you<00:02:59.800> want

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
people would be turned off so you want

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.680 
people would be turned off so you want
to<00:03:00.070> go<00:03:00.160> down<00:03:00.460> like<00:03:00.700> this<00:03:01.060> you're<00:03:01.330> gonna<00:03:01.450> want

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
to go down like this you're gonna want

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.770 
to go down like this you're gonna want
to<00:03:01.780> go<00:03:01.900> around<00:03:02.080> in<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.740> loop<00:03:03.040> like<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.780> down

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
to go around in a loop like this down

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.500 
to go around in a loop like this down
here<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:05.830> like<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.550> that<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.730> not<00:03:07.120> so

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
here and up like that and that is not so

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.780 
here and up like that and that is not so
simple<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.560> haven't<00:03:08.830> played<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.220> game<00:03:09.490> a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
simple if you haven't played this game a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.560 
simple if you haven't played this game a
lot<00:03:10.240> before<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.200> guess<00:03:11.890> but<00:03:12.460> all<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.000> wanna<00:03:13.270> do

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
lot before I guess but all you wanna do

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.620 
lot before I guess but all you wanna do
is<00:03:13.600> just<00:03:13.810> practice<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.450> about

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
is just practice and it's just about

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.980 
is just practice and it's just about
gaining<00:03:17.260> momentum<00:03:18.210> going<00:03:19.210> around<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.750> map

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
gaining momentum going around the map

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.240 
gaining momentum going around the map
having<00:03:20.950> fun<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.000> just<00:03:22.560> tricking<00:03:23.560> around<00:03:23.950> and

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
having fun and just tricking around and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.460 
having fun and just tricking around and
that<00:03:24.820> was<00:03:24.940> actually<00:03:25.060> quite<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.510> bad<00:03:25.810> run<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.110> did

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
that was actually quite a bad run I did

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.950 
that was actually quite a bad run I did
right<00:03:26.650> there<00:03:26.680> but<00:03:27.480> when<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.570> get<00:03:28.660> tomorrow

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
right there but when you get tomorrow

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.240 
right there but when you get tomorrow
room<00:03:29.170> you're<00:03:29.320> gonna<00:03:29.440> get<00:03:29.590> even<00:03:29.920> more<00:03:30.040> momentum

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
room you're gonna get even more momentum

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.370 
room you're gonna get even more momentum
and<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.820> can<00:03:31.120> go<00:03:31.240> speed<00:03:31.600> around<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.900> map<00:03:32.110> and

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
and you can go speed around the map and

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.780 
and you can go speed around the map and
get<00:03:32.560> higher<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:32.920> higher<00:03:32.980> speed<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.490> don't<00:03:33.640> want

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
get higher and higher speed I don't want

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.190 
get higher and higher speed I don't want
to<00:03:33.850> make<00:03:33.940> this<00:03:34.060> too<00:03:34.270> long<00:03:34.300> though<00:03:34.690> but<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:34.990> hope
