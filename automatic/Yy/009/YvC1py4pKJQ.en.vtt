00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
that our arms took out this is the data

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.289 
that our arms took out this is the data
cable<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.070> came<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.729> don't<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.180> what

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
cable that came I just I don't know what

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.089 
cable that came I just I don't know what
this<00:02:06.390> actually<00:02:06.689> goes<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.770> guys<00:02:07.890> know

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
this actually goes to if you guys know

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.130 
this actually goes to if you guys know
what<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.280> data<00:02:08.489> cable<00:02:08.670> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
what a data cable is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.370 
what a data cable is
tell<00:02:10.560> me<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:14.640> get<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.819> boss<00:02:15.090> sticker<00:02:15.480> I'm<00:02:16.050> not

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
right here these are right here these

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.750 
right here these are right here these
are<00:02:26.280> what<00:02:26.340> cover<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.630> arm<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> speaker

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
are what cover the arm like the speaker

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.490 
are what cover the arm like the speaker
wires<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.270> all<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.870> right<00:02:31.050> here<00:02:31.080> cover

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
wires and all that this right here cover

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.350 
wires and all that this right here cover

e so when you get this amp and you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.940 
e so when you get this amp and you
probably<00:02:33.900> looking<00:02:34.140> confused<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.770> how<00:02:34.890> you

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
probably looking confused on how you

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.890 
probably looking confused on how you
plus<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.340> unscrew<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.090> off<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.570> stuff<00:02:36.720> like

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
with two of those you gotta take both

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.820 
with two of those you gotta take both
those<00:02:54.510> off<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:54.959> haven't<00:02:55.110> put<00:02:55.260> my<00:02:55.410> back<00:02:55.650> on

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.380 
those off I just haven't put my back on
you<00:02:57.680> instructions<00:02:58.680> which<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.610> pretty<00:03:00.209> much

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
you instructions which is pretty much

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.890 
you instructions which is pretty much
this<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.959> think<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:02.580> boss<00:03:02.760> pH<00:03:03.120> 3000<00:03:03.750> through

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
this I think the boss pH 3000 through

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.210 
this I think the boss pH 3000 through
the<00:03:03.959> five<00:03:04.140> dollar<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.500> pretty<00:03:04.739> much<00:03:04.800> built<00:03:05.100> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the five dollar I pretty much built the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.120 
the five dollar I pretty much built the
same<00:03:05.400> way<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.239> your<00:03:06.959> handbook<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.680> pretty<00:03:07.950> much

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
same way so your handbook is pretty much

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.330 
same way so your handbook is pretty much
in<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:09.269> small<00:03:09.780> handbook<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:13.130> that's<00:03:14.130> pretty

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
in one small handbook so that's pretty

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.430 
in one small handbook so that's pretty
much<00:03:14.430> all<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.660> I'm<00:03:15.870> yeah<00:03:16.049> that's<00:03:16.290> pretty

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
much all that and I'm yeah that's pretty

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.280 
much all that and I'm yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.890> dumb<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:18.030> far<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.540> UM<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.110> amp

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
much it dumb as far as the UM the amp

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.250 
much it dumb as far as the UM the amp
itself<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.040> am<00:03:20.400> very<00:03:21.030> satisfied<00:03:21.510> with<00:03:21.870> it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
itself I am very satisfied with it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.240 
itself I am very satisfied with it
um<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:24.360> Ford<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.079> be<00:03:25.200> fought<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.950> claim

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
um it it Ford to be fought for to claim

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.520 
um it it Ford to be fought for to claim
five<00:03:26.549> thousand<00:03:27.000> watts<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.930> all<00:03:28.110> know<00:03:28.350> that

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
five thousand watts we all know that

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.080 
five thousand watts we all know that
it's<00:03:28.680> not<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.829> true<00:03:29.130> wattage<00:03:29.579> because<00:03:29.910> just

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
it's not a true wattage because just

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.170 
it's not a true wattage because just
because<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:30.480> boss<00:03:30.690> audio<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:33.060> to

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
because it's boss audio but I have to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.050 
because it's boss audio but I have to
say<00:03:33.420> as<00:03:34.079> far<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.160> true<00:03:35.430> waters<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.910> it

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
say as far as like the true waters of it

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.750 
say as far as like the true waters of it
I<00:03:36.180> think<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:37.489> potty<00:03:38.489> about<00:03:39.769> 300<00:03:40.769> M<00:03:40.890> mmm<00:03:41.549> no<00:03:41.730> I

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
I think it is potty about 300 M mmm no I

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.710 
I think it is potty about 300 M mmm no I
probably<00:03:42.030> 3,500<00:03:42.630> Watts<00:03:43.370> all<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.760> way<00:03:44.940> maybe

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
probably 3,500 Watts all the way maybe

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.630 
probably 3,500 Watts all the way maybe
if<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.930> get<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.170> up<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.410> 1<00:03:46.590> ohm<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:47.160> apart<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.549> be

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
if you get it up to 1 ohm it apart to be

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.140 
if you get it up to 1 ohm it apart to be
a<00:03:47.900> party<00:03:48.900> at<00:03:49.019> 5,000<00:03:49.620> watts<00:03:49.799> but<00:03:50.519> as<00:03:50.790> far<00:03:51.120> as

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
a party at 5,000 watts but as far as

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.720 
a party at 5,000 watts but as far as
like<00:03:51.329> my<00:03:51.360> subwoofer<00:03:52.320> my<00:03:53.070> subwoofers<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.640> I'm

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
like my subwoofer my subwoofers that I'm

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.880 
like my subwoofer my subwoofers that I'm
using<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.360> have<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.690> setup<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.560> probably

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
using and I have a setup I'm probably

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.449 
using and I have a setup I'm probably
only<00:03:56.130> getting<00:03:56.549> about<00:03:56.989> I'll<00:03:57.989> say<00:03:58.320> about<00:03:58.459> 4000

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
only getting about I'll say about 4000

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.069 
only getting about I'll say about 4000
watts<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.970> about<00:04:00.650> maybe<00:04:01.650> about<00:04:01.860> 18<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:03.329> 2,000

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079
