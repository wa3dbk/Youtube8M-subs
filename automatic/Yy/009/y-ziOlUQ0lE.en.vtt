I like to build super guns and hopefully
you<00:00:19.080> guys<00:00:19.199> will<00:00:19.259> learn<00:00:19.949> something<00:00:20.279> or<00:00:20.490> pick<00:00:20.910> up

a new trick maybe you can tell me how
you<00:00:23.400> do<00:00:23.699> some<00:00:23.910> things<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.929> bit

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
you do some things a little bit

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.390 
you do some things a little bit
differently<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> might<00:00:25.829> save<00:00:26.039> me<00:00:26.220> some

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
differently and it might save me some

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.769 
differently and it might save me some
time<00:00:26.550> later<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.720> is

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
time later because that's what this is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.529 
time later because that's what this is

that I saw my website and are a little
bit<00:00:37.200> more<00:00:37.320> expensive<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.920> their<00:00:38.100> quality<00:00:38.310> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
bit more expensive but their quality is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.100 
bit more expensive but their quality is
unparalleled<00:00:40.760> about<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.090> year<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.720> half<00:00:42.900> ago

any<00:00:51.450> of<00:00:51.570> my<00:00:51.660> builds<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.380> found<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
any of my builds because I found that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.320 
any of my builds because I found that
there<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.130> lot<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.370> crosstalk<00:00:53.820> between<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
there was a lot of crosstalk between the

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.400 
there was a lot of crosstalk between the
wires<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:55.230> quality<00:00:55.620> wasn't<00:00:56.040> there<00:00:57.290> most<00:00:58.290> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
wires the quality wasn't there most of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
wires the quality wasn't there most of
them<00:00:58.560> are<00:00:58.680> made<00:00:58.830> in<00:00:58.980> China<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.450> not

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
them are made in China which is not

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.020 
them are made in China which is not
necessarily<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.200> bad<00:01:01.410> thing<00:01:01.470> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
necessarily a bad thing I think the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
necessarily a bad thing I think the
Chinese<00:01:03.270> market<00:01:03.720> makes<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> very<00:01:04.379> good

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
Chinese market makes a lot of very good

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.960 
Chinese market makes a lot of very good
quality<00:01:04.799> things<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.460> got<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> know

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
quality things you just got to know

quality things you just got to know
where<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> find<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.570> unfortunately<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.499> have

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
where to find them unfortunately I have

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679 
where to find them unfortunately I have
yet<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> find<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.549> good<00:01:08.700> quality<00:01:08.820> Jama<00:01:09.299> harness

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
yet to find a good quality Jama harness

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.429 
populated harness like these there's a
few<00:01:44.069> wires<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.609> don't<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.409> they<00:01:46.409> don't

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
few wires that you don't need they don't

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.230 
few wires that you don't need they don't
really<00:01:46.679> do<00:01:46.920> anything<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.759> super<00:01:48.090> gun

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
really do anything in a super gun

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.669 
really do anything in a super gun
situation<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:49.200> they're<00:01:49.319> really<00:01:49.469> meant

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
situation because they're really meant

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.949 
situation because they're really meant
for<00:01:49.770> arcade<00:01:50.159> cabinets<00:01:50.609> in<00:01:51.329> protection<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
for arcade cabinets in protection of the

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.489 
for arcade cabinets in protection of the
arcade<00:01:52.289> cabinet<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:54.840> already<00:01:55.079> taken<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
arcade cabinet so I've already taken a

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.440 
arcade cabinet so I've already taken a
few<00:01:55.649> wires<00:01:55.889> out<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.249> this<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.579> specifically

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
few wires out of this one specifically

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.149 
few wires out of this one specifically
the<00:01:57.659> coin<00:01:57.840> counter<00:01:58.079> wires<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.859> well<00:01:59.009> as<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the coin counter wires as well as the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.279 
the coin counter wires as well as the
lockout<00:01:59.520> coil<00:01:59.850> wires<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.719> reason<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> did

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
lockout coil wires and the reason I did

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.019 
lockout coil wires and the reason I did
that<00:02:01.319> is<00:02:01.590> because<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.069> our<00:02:02.310> super<00:02:02.639> gun<00:02:02.789> there's

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:03.029 
that is because in our super gun there's

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.969 
that is because in our super gun there's
no<00:02:03.179> use<00:02:03.359> for<00:02:03.630> them

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
no use for them

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.319 
no use for them
so<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.159> we're<00:02:05.249> gonna<00:02:05.310> do<00:02:05.520> today<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.999> I'm

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
so what we're gonna do today is I'm

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.419 
so what we're gonna do today is I'm
gonna<00:02:06.810> show<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.289> I<00:02:07.319> do<00:02:07.499> that<00:02:07.770> I'm<00:02:08.280> gonna

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
gonna show you how I do that I'm gonna

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.710 
gonna show you how I do that I'm gonna
set<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> one<00:02:08.819> aside<00:02:08.880> since<00:02:09.390> we've<00:02:09.569> already

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
set this one aside since we've already

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.479 
set this one aside since we've already
done<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> I'm<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> open<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
done it and I'm going to open up this

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.150 
done it and I'm going to open up this
brand<00:02:11.730> new<00:02:11.879> harness

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
brand new harness

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.220 
brand new harness
I<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.550> pulled<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:13.910> my<00:02:14.420> stock<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:18.050> we're

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
I just pulled on my stock and we're

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.560 
I just pulled on my stock and we're
gonna<00:02:18.320> pull<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> couple<00:02:18.770> wires<00:02:19.070> out<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:20.450> I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
gonna pull a couple wires out like I

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.300 
gonna pull a couple wires out like I
said<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.080> coin<00:02:21.290> counters<00:02:21.740> as<00:02:21.950> well<00:02:21.980> as<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
said the coin counters as well as the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.210 
said the coin counters as well as the
lockout<00:02:22.640> coils<00:02:22.970> are<00:02:23.150> not<00:02:23.330> needed<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.620> we're

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
lockout coils are not needed so we're

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.320 
lockout coils are not needed so we're
gonna<00:02:25.310> go<00:02:25.490> ahead<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.700> take<00:02:25.880> them<00:02:26.000> out

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
gonna go ahead and take them out

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.850 
gonna go ahead and take them out
the<00:02:26.420> reason<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.780> do<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:27.260> because<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.770> don't

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the reason I do that is because I don't

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.340 
the reason I do that is because I don't
like<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.130> trim<00:02:28.400> them<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.810> looks<00:02:29.960> ugly

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
like to trim them because it looks ugly

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.470 
like to trim them because it looks ugly
and<00:02:30.550> too<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.580> don't<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.060> leave<00:02:32.150> them<00:02:32.300> long

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and too I don't like to leave them long

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.000 
and too I don't like to leave them long
because<00:02:32.840> then<00:02:32.990> it<00:02:33.080> just<00:02:33.200> creates<00:02:33.320> extra<00:02:33.800> wires

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
because then it just creates extra wires

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.250 
because then it just creates extra wires
inside<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.940> supergun<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.660> that's<00:02:36.080> not

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
inside the supergun and that's not

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.590 
inside the supergun and that's not
necessary<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.060> all<00:02:38.300> you're<00:02:38.450> going<00:02:38.540> to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
necessary to do this all you're going to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.630 
necessary to do this all you're going to
need<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> small<00:02:39.110> flat-head<00:02:40.040> jewel<00:02:40.460> or

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
need is a small flat-head jewel or

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.150 
need is a small flat-head jewel or
screwdriver<00:02:41.120> like<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.130> can

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
screwdriver like this so that you can

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.970 
screwdriver like this so that you can
simply<00:02:43.730> pop<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.240> wires<00:02:44.420> out<00:02:44.720> now<00:02:45.380> note<00:02:45.740> that

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
simply pop the wires out now note that

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.770 
simply pop the wires out now note that
unless<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.370> have<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.580> nice<00:02:46.850> quality<00:02:47.090> harness

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
unless you have a nice quality harness

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.540 
unless you have a nice quality harness
like<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.140> where<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.440> pins<00:02:48.740> are<00:02:49.040> crimped

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
like this where the pins are crimped

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.010 
like this where the pins are crimped
onto<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.850> wire<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.240> then<00:02:50.390> insert<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.900> into

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
onto the wire and then insert it into

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.520 
onto the wire and then insert it into
the<00:02:51.550> assuming<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.670> harness<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:54.110> this<00:02:54.350> isn't

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
the assuming the harness that this isn't

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.410 
the assuming the harness that this isn't
going<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:54.770> work<00:02:54.950> those<00:02:55.280> types<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.820> use<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
going to work those types that use the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.110 
going to work those types that use the
these<00:02:57.080> solder<00:02:57.980> on<00:02:58.190> connections<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.910> heat

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
these solder on connections with heat

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.930 
these solder on connections with heat
shrink<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.630> some<00:02:59.840> sites<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:00.350> will<00:03:01.310> not<00:03:01.340> work

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
shrink that some sites so will not work

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.370 
shrink that some sites so will not work
with<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.240> method<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.810> actually<00:03:02.990> have

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
with this method and you actually have

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.950 
with this method and you actually have
to<00:03:03.410> clip<00:03:04.160> those<00:03:04.310> off<00:03:04.520> with<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> pair<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.690> this

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
to clip those off with a pair of this

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.040 
to clip those off with a pair of this
flush<00:03:06.350> cutters<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:08.000> what<00:03:08.600> we're<00:03:08.690> going<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.840> do

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
flush cutters so what we're going to do

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.300 
flush cutters so what we're going to do
is<00:03:09.290> I'm<00:03:09.380> going<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.530> get<00:03:09.650> close<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.070> camera

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
is I'm going to get close to the camera

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.070 
is I'm going to get close to the camera
and<00:03:10.460> hopefully<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:10.790> can<00:03:10.850> see<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.300> I'm<00:03:11.930> going

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
and hopefully you can see this I'm going

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.690 
and hopefully you can see this I'm going
to<00:03:12.140> take<00:03:12.260> my<00:03:12.380> small<00:03:12.620> jeweler<00:03:12.950> screwdriver<00:03:13.430> and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
to take my small jeweler screwdriver and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.890 
to take my small jeweler screwdriver and
I'm<00:03:13.760> going<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.910> find<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.210> pin<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.450> want<00:03:14.690> right

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
I'm going to find the pin I want right

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.870 
I'm going to find the pin I want right
here<00:03:15.170> which<00:03:15.320> is<00:03:15.350> count<00:03:15.800> counter<00:03:16.460> number<00:03:16.700> two

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
here which is count counter number two

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.640 
here which is count counter number two
and<00:03:17.120> then<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:17.780> going<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.959> simply<00:03:18.290> take<00:03:18.320> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
and then I'm going to simply take the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.860 
and then I'm going to simply take the
screwdriver<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.459> insert<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.480> between<00:03:20.630> the

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
screwdriver and insert it between the

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.410 
screwdriver and insert it between the
pin<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.650> plastic<00:03:22.040> artists<00:03:22.520> once<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.270> get

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
pin and the plastic artists once I get

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.180 
pin and the plastic artists once I get
that<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:23.780> I'm<00:03:24.230> gonna<00:03:24.380> make<00:03:24.530> sure<00:03:24.560> my<00:03:24.680> hands<00:03:24.980> not

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
that in I'm gonna make sure my hands not

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.610 
that in I'm gonna make sure my hands not
in<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.340> way<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.700> I'm<00:03:25.820> a<00:03:25.880> push<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:29.570> it's<00:03:30.500> gonna

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
in the way and I'm a push and it's gonna

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.900 
in the way and I'm a push and it's gonna
cause<00:03:31.010> you're<00:03:31.310> gonna<00:03:31.430> hear<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.610> little<00:03:31.730> click

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
cause you're gonna hear a little click

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.110 
cause you're gonna hear a little click
and<00:03:32.360> that's<00:03:32.630> gonna<00:03:32.810> loosen<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.920> wire<00:03:34.120> from

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and that's gonna loosen the wire from

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.850 
and that's gonna loosen the wire from
the<00:03:35.180> harness<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.050> then<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.290> can<00:03:36.410> simply<00:03:36.709> take

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
the harness and then you can simply take

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.920 
the harness and then you can simply take
it<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.280> pull<00:03:37.550> it<00:03:37.640> aside<00:03:37.700> don't<00:03:38.630> throw<00:03:38.810> this

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
it and pull it aside don't throw this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.540 
it and pull it aside don't throw this
wire<00:03:39.170> away<00:03:39.320> because<00:03:39.800> if<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.040> need<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.280> use<00:03:40.400> it

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
wire away because if you need to use it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.520 
wire away because if you need to use it
again<00:03:40.760> for<00:03:40.790> something<00:03:41.180> else<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.930> can<00:03:42.200> and

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
again for something else you can and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.810 
again for something else you can and
it's<00:03:42.800> good<00:03:42.950> wire<00:03:45.220> okay<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.550> was<00:03:46.610> coin

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
it's good wire okay so that was coin

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.920 
it's good wire okay so that was coin
counter<00:03:46.970> -<00:03:47.239> we're<00:03:47.360> gonna<00:03:47.480> do<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.690> same<00:03:47.870> thing

was something that neo geo used and

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.210 
was something that neo geo used and

select down and most JAMA games by the

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.200 
select down and most JAMA games by the
way<00:05:13.320> also<00:05:14.040> don't<00:05:14.250> use<00:05:14.460> this<00:05:14.700> player<00:05:14.910> five

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
way also don't use this player five

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.730 
way also don't use this player five
button<00:05:15.570> they<00:05:15.660> only<00:05:15.810> go<00:05:15.960> up<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.110> player<00:05:16.380> three

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
button they only go up to player three

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.560 
button they only go up to player three
so<00:05:17.220> on<00:05:17.370> this<00:05:17.550> harness<00:05:17.760> it<00:05:18.120> goes<00:05:18.270> all<00:05:18.450> the<00:05:18.480> way

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
so on this harness it goes all the way

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.930 
so on this harness it goes all the way
up<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:18.840> point<00:05:18.990> five<00:05:19.350> or<00:05:19.710> players<00:05:20.250> one<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:20.850> two

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
up to point five or players one and two

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.150 
up to point five or players one and two
button<00:05:21.300> number<00:05:21.420> five<00:05:21.720> so<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.620> way<00:05:22.770> you<00:05:22.830> can

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
button number five so that way you can

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.130 
button number five so that way you can
use<00:05:23.340> this<00:05:23.550> harness<00:05:23.970> on<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.180> newer<00:05:24.510> system<00:05:24.810> like

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
use this harness on a newer system like

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.740 
use this harness on a newer system like
a<00:05:25.170> JVs<00:05:25.740> system<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:27.240> requires<00:05:27.570> an

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
a JVs system that requires an

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.630 
a JVs system that requires an
input/output<00:05:28.380> board<00:05:28.620> in<00:05:28.830> it<00:05:29.130> senses<00:05:29.610> that

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
input/output board in it senses that

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.030 
input/output board in it senses that
player<00:05:30.240> number<00:05:30.570> five<00:05:30.810> button<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.380> then<00:05:31.860> on

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
player number five button and then on

a<00:06:39.830> Jayamma<00:06:40.130> system<00:06:40.550> I<00:06:40.670> would<00:06:40.790> pull<00:06:41.150> this<00:06:41.360> extra

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
a Jayamma system I would pull this extra

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.000 
a Jayamma system I would pull this extra

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
speaker connection out here at the

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.430 
speaker connection out here at the
bottom<00:06:43.340> because<00:06:43.910> inside<00:06:44.540> we're<00:06:45.080> gonna<00:06:45.200> mount

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
bottom because inside we're gonna mount

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.410 
bottom because inside we're gonna mount
an<00:06:45.650> audio<00:06:45.920> attenuation<00:06:46.580> circuit<00:06:46.970> that

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
an audio attenuation circuit that

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.900 
an audio attenuation circuit that
doesn't<00:06:48.020> require<00:06:48.290> the<00:06:48.590> negatives<00:06:48.950> connection

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
doesn't require the negatives connection

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.430 
doesn't require the negatives connection
it<00:06:50.030> only<00:06:50.180> requires<00:06:50.510> a<00:06:50.600> grounding<00:06:51.050> connection

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
it only requires a grounding connection

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.660 
it only requires a grounding connection
so<00:06:51.890> it<00:06:52.070> can<00:06:52.280> properly<00:06:52.820> bring<00:06:53.210> the<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:54.830> speaker

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
so it can properly bring the the speaker

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.880 
so it can properly bring the the speaker
level<00:06:55.850> volume<00:06:56.270> down<00:06:56.450> to<00:06:56.630> a<00:06:56.660> preamp<00:06:57.290> volume<00:06:57.680> so

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
level volume down to a preamp volume so

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.410 
level volume down to a preamp volume so
you<00:06:57.920> don't<00:06:58.160> hurt<00:06:58.280> your<00:06:58.460> TV<00:06:58.820> or<00:06:59.030> your<00:06:59.150> stereo

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420 
you don't hurt your TV or your stereo

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.050 
you don't hurt your TV or your stereo
system<00:06:59.920> so<00:07:00.920> that's<00:07:01.040> all<00:07:01.250> there<00:07:01.400> is<00:07:01.430> to<00:07:01.670> it<00:07:01.850> when
