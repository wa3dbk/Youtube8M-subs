Transformer trio which is basically an

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.160 
Transformer trio which is basically an

with<00:00:24.349> the<00:00:24.410> tablet<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.039> a<00:00:25.099> detachable<00:00:25.429> you

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
with the tablet so it's a detachable you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.849 
with the tablet so it's a detachable you
have<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.029> house<00:00:26.240> well<00:00:26.480> in<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.839> base<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.650> an

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
have a house well in the base and an

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.300 
have a house well in the base and an
11.6<00:00:28.580> inch<00:00:28.730> screen<00:00:29.119> in<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.509> tablet<00:00:30.230> style<00:00:30.560> but

11.6 inch screen in the tablet style but

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.370 
11.6 inch screen in the tablet style but
if<00:00:31.580> you<00:00:31.699> press<00:00:31.939> like<00:00:31.970> I<00:00:32.450> think<00:00:32.960> it's<00:00:33.110> this

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
if you press like I think it's this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.940 
if you press like I think it's this
button<00:00:33.740> right<00:00:33.770> here<00:00:35.289> it<00:00:36.289> says<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.680> screen

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
button right here it says in the screen

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.490 
button right here it says in the screen
it's<00:00:37.340> basically<00:00:37.789> the<00:00:38.420> device<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:38.960> lets<00:00:39.110> both

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's basically the device that lets both

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.819 
it's basically the device that lets both
Android<00:00:40.039> and<00:00:40.070> Windows<00:00:40.699> 8<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:41.870> have<00:00:42.110> not

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
Android and Windows 8 so you have not

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.459 
Android and Windows 8 so you have not
only<00:00:42.860> Intel<00:00:43.670> Haswell<00:00:43.879> question<00:00:44.780> Angele<00:00:45.230> for

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
only Intel Haswell question Angele for

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.560 
only Intel Haswell question Angele for
processor<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.190> there<00:00:46.399> but<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:47.120> also<00:00:47.270> have

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
processor in there but you also have

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.319 
processor in there but you also have
another<00:00:47.809> Intel<00:00:48.680> Atom<00:00:48.920> CPU<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:49.940> there<00:00:50.090> which<00:00:50.300> is

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
another Intel Atom CPU in there which is

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.750 
another Intel Atom CPU in there which is
the<00:00:50.570> two<00:00:50.719> gigahertz<00:00:51.129> until<00:00:52.129> Adam<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.579> think

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
the two gigahertz until Adam I think

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.509 
the two gigahertz until Adam I think
it's<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:52.940> 2518<00:00:53.719> dual-core<00:00:54.320> we<00:00:55.250> don't<00:00:55.430> know

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
it's a 2518 dual-core we don't know

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:56.889 
it's a 2518 dual-core we don't know
anything<00:00:55.850> about<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.149> RAM<00:00:56.300> yet<00:00:56.539> because<00:00:56.780> they

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
anything about the RAM yet because they

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.689 
anything about the RAM yet because they
have<00:00:57.019> wouldn't<00:00:57.440> tell<00:00:57.710> us<00:00:57.859> aren't<00:00:58.370> and

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
have wouldn't tell us aren't and

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.750 
have wouldn't tell us aren't and
basically<00:00:59.390> is<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.620> ultimate<00:01:01.039> combination<00:01:01.280> of

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
basically is the ultimate combination of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.049 
basically is the ultimate combination of
mobile<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:02.929> their<00:01:03.019> devices<00:01:03.379> it's<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:04.190> tablet

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
mobile and their devices it's a tablet

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.030 
mobile and their devices it's a tablet
and<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.570> notebook<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:06.500> running<00:01:06.680> Android

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
and a notebook and it's running Android

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.890 
and a notebook and it's running Android
and<00:01:07.310> Windows<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.060> can<00:01:08.240> basically<00:01:08.390> switch

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
and Windows and you can basically switch

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.230 
and Windows and you can basically switch
on<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.320> fly<00:01:09.500> between<00:01:09.860> them<00:01:09.979> was<00:01:10.220> by<00:01:10.820> pressing

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
on the fly between them was by pressing

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.910 
on the fly between them was by pressing
that<00:01:11.270> button<00:01:11.390> we're<00:01:12.320> going<00:01:12.439> to<00:01:12.500> take<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.680> quick

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
that button we're going to take a quick

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.980 
that button we're going to take a quick
look<00:01:13.040> around<00:01:13.159> up<00:01:13.850> here<00:01:13.909> we<00:01:14.270> have<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.450> webcam<00:01:14.840> we

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
look around up here we have a webcam we

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.719 
look around up here we have a webcam we
don't<00:01:15.140> really<00:01:15.290> know<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.619> specs<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.430> think

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
don't really know the specs and I think

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.600 
don't really know the specs and I think
that<00:01:16.850> should<00:01:17.060> be<00:01:17.090> at<00:01:17.320> 1.2<00:01:18.320> or<00:01:18.350> 1.3<00:01:18.799> or<00:01:19.189> maybe

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
that should be at 1.2 or 1.3 or maybe

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.450 
that should be at 1.2 or 1.3 or maybe
even<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:20.060> two<00:01:20.240> megapixel<00:01:20.390> camera<00:01:21.049> up<00:01:21.170> there

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
even a two megapixel camera up there

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.530 
even a two megapixel camera up there
otherwise<00:01:22.460> it's<00:01:22.759> in<00:01:22.880> another<00:01:22.970> point<00:01:23.329> six

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
otherwise it's in another point six

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.660 
otherwise it's in another point six
years<00:01:23.720> between<00:01:24.110> this<00:01:24.409> looks<00:01:24.770> like<00:01:25.009> it's<00:01:25.280> full

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
years between this looks like it's full

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.700 
years between this looks like it's full
HD<00:01:26.090> screen<00:01:26.119> because<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:26.840> icon<00:01:27.350> size<00:01:27.530> they

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
HD screen because of the icon size they

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.890 
HD screen because of the icon size they
haven't<00:01:27.979> told<00:01:28.100> us<00:01:28.250> about<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:28.520> yet<00:01:28.850> down<00:01:29.659> here
