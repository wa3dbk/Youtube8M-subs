00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
network name and password and I'll be

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
through my home wireless network rather

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.229 
through my home wireless network rather
than<00:02:49.890> connecting<00:02:50.130> directly<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.000> device

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
than connecting directly to the device

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.210 
than connecting directly to the device
itself<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:52.200> it's<00:02:52.350> not<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.650> heavy<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:53.040> weighs

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
itself so it's not that heavy it weighs

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.620 
itself so it's not that heavy it weighs
about<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:54.000> little<00:02:54.690> under<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> pound<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.480> if

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
about a little under a pound so if

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.300 
about a little under a pound so if
you're<00:02:57.780> using<00:02:57.989> this<00:02:58.230> as<00:02:58.470> an<00:02:58.739> external<00:02:59.190> battery

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
you're using this as an external battery

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.340 
you're using this as an external battery
it<00:02:59.730> does<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.180> two<00:03:00.360> full<00:03:00.569> charges<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.230> at

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
it does have two full charges on it at

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.830 
it does have two full charges on it at
6000<00:03:02.040> milliamp<00:03:02.459> hours<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.269> was<00:03:03.390> really<00:03:03.660> easy

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
6000 milliamp hours it was really easy

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.420 
6000 milliamp hours it was really easy
to<00:03:04.080> set<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.319> there's<00:03:04.680> no<00:03:04.830> software<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.310> install

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
to set up there's no software to install

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.360 
to set up there's no software to install
it<00:03:06.330> connected<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.140> my<00:03:07.380> wireless<00:03:07.590> network<00:03:07.799> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
it connected to my wireless network and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.430 
it connected to my wireless network and
to<00:03:08.489> my<00:03:08.610> computer<00:03:09.030> very<00:03:09.269> easily<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.140> can<00:03:10.230> also

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
to my computer very easily you can also

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.590 
to my computer very easily you can also
use<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:10.920> as<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.220> Wi-Fi<00:03:11.610> repeater<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.239> bridge

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
use this as a Wi-Fi repeater and bridge

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.120 
use this as a Wi-Fi repeater and bridge
an<00:03:12.780> internet<00:03:13.140> connection<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.829> have<00:03:13.980> at

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
an internet connection that you have at

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.979 
an internet connection that you have at
home<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.790> if<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> weak<00:03:15.750> signal

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
home so that if you have a weak signal

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.020 
home so that if you have a weak signal
this<00:03:16.290> will<00:03:16.470> pick<00:03:16.620> up<00:03:16.739> your<00:03:16.769> signal<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.910> then

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
this will pick up your signal and then

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.000 
this will pick up your signal and then
boost<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.110> all<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.500> all<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.860> good

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
boost it so all in all it's a good

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.770 
boost it so all in all it's a good
device<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.790> very<00:03:21.060> straightforward<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.750> use

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
device it's very straightforward to use

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.750 
device it's very straightforward to use
it's<00:03:22.290> not<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.650> heavy<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:23.010> carry<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.579> want

it's not that heavy to carry if you want

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.080 
it's not that heavy to carry if you want
to<00:03:23.850> travel<00:03:24.060> with<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:26.640> provides<00:03:26.940> a
