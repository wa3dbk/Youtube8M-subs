eyeshadow in scene and I'm gonna use a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.240 
eyeshadow in scene and I'm gonna use a
little<00:02:06.780> bit<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> crease<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
little bit of that in the crease just to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.070 
little bit of that in the crease just to
define<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:08.970> we're<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.119> gonna<00:02:09.539> use<00:02:09.629> very

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
define it but we're not gonna use very

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.570 
define it but we're not gonna use very
much<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.560> seen<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.129> there

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
much that's seen right there

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.710 
much that's seen right there
so<00:02:11.820> I'm<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.030> taking<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so I'm just taking this on like a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.540 
so I'm just taking this on like a
pointed<00:02:13.350> kind<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.100> brush<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.520> a

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
pointed kind of brush it's like a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.130 
pointed kind of brush it's like a
dome-shaped<00:02:14.820> brush<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.750> put<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> little

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
dome-shaped brush and put it a little

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.600 
dome-shaped brush and put it a little
bit<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> crease<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:16.890> I'm<00:02:17.130> literally

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
bit in the crease and I'm literally

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.010 
bit in the crease and I'm literally
working<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.090> slowly<00:02:18.390> on<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
working so slowly on this because I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.600 
working so slowly on this because I
don't<00:02:19.320> want<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.710> super<00:02:19.890> defined<00:02:20.340> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
don't want it to be super defined and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.700 
don't want it to be super defined and
then<00:02:21.060> kind<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.390> blend<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:22.170> towards<00:02:22.590> the

then kind of blend that down towards the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.440 
then kind of blend that down towards the
outer<00:02:22.890> corner<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.580> lash<00:02:23.820> line<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.270> we<00:02:24.420> have

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
outer corner of the lash line so we have

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.290 
outer corner of the lash line so we have
a<00:02:24.900> V<00:02:25.620> right<00:02:25.950> there<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.430> we're<00:02:26.580> gonna<00:02:26.640> blend<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
a V right there and we're gonna blend it
