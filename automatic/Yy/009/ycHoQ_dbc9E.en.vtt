4.5<00:00:41.180> turn<00:00:42.250> xeler<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.460> brushless<00:00:43.879> motor<00:00:44.420> and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
4.5 turn xeler on brushless motor and

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.540 
4.5 turn xeler on brushless motor and
esc<00:00:46.100> combo<00:00:46.690> they<00:00:47.690> came<00:00:47.900> as<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.050> combo<00:00:48.530> know<00:00:49.370> me

personally<00:00:49.730> i<00:00:50.090> like<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:50.510> i<00:00:50.720> was<00:00:51.410> running<00:00:51.650> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
personally i like to i was running the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.770 
personally i like to i was running the
smaller<00:00:52.160> batteries<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:52.940> mount<00:00:53.180> on<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.510> tray

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
smaller batteries that mount on the tray

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.020 
smaller batteries that mount on the tray
you<00:00:54.230> get<00:00:54.410> absolutely<00:00:54.680> no<00:00:55.339> life<00:00:55.670> out<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:55.910> them

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
you get absolutely no life out of them

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.840 
you get absolutely no life out of them
so<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:57.049> i'm<00:00:57.260> running<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.650> full<00:00:57.860> size<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.549> sell

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
so now i'm running a full size to sell

normally would mount in here where we're
putting<00:01:07.520> on<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.850> top<00:01:08.030> now<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.479> fell

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659

and we'll give you a little example of
that<00:01:13.909> what<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.240> date<00:01:14.479> unit<00:01:14.840> does<00:01:15.049> for<00:01:15.770> all<00:01:15.860> you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
that what the date unit does for all you
