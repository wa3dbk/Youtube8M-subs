information that I think would make a
nice<00:00:52.110> widget<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.010> let<00:00:53.579> me<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.390> file<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
nice widget so let me go to file and

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.580 
nice widget so let me go to file and
open<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.789> dashboard<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.530> does

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
open in dashboard and what this does

to<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.970> right<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> work

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
to the right I can actually make it work

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.859 
to the right I can actually make it work
so<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> mingles<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:53.909> everything<00:01:54.119> else<00:01:54.329> by
