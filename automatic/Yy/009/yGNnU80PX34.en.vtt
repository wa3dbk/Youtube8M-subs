00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.390
 How does the series and other things in the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.800
 Like I did two seasons ago. 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.300
 this series 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.010
 a bet to win and only 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.129
 Brazilians and another posture to win

 only the barclays the English league that has 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.670

 manchester city and manchester united in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.239

 and how performance was in those 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.100
 other two seasons 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.869
 our last episode and first 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.019
 episode that ended up playing three times 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.640
 We lose and gain a game and two 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.409
 We managed to upgrade our 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.129
 attacker and also in tourism 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.720
 there in the left half only unfortunately 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.270
 we had to withdraw our right half 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.280
 there to put the pedro and the wolves 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.380
 starts betting goitá the goalkeeper of the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 because I felt that our 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.730
 goalkeeper also bad against the hostel 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 worth three cases he comes with this team 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.730
 in the English league and also in the league 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 german 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.650
 lewandowski who now at the front sure 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.690
 of danger and soon I started 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.300
 there exchanging balls love has arrived 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.340
 showing that she was going to give work in 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.870
 marking other keys that touches the ball 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.790
 but ended up playing wrong 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.740
 the team received left the ball with omen 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.860
 who threw forward there our side 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.710
 left him taking even wanted to after 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.260
 to top it off it still yes 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 bananale our goalkeeper he finished 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.830
 taking aim of the Albany 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.960
 We came up so we got it. 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.000
 make a goal there with rés and rodriguez 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.040
 I'm not mistaken, ball is in his head. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.080
 and headed to make it 1 - 1 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.970
 after ruben castro left the ball and with 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.620
 I was going to cross but I gave a 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.420
 stop before the rest rodrigues 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.640
 position in the area and he was 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.039
 alone there for us to do 2 to 1 and see 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.140
 this from there against the bari 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.870
 before the game ends the recess rodrigues 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.340
 saw the ruben castro passing left the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.830
 ball with him that only took the work of 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.530
 to move or not to go and do 3 to 1 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 and before also to end the bari 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.010
 got yet 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.200
 is to convert another goal there to leave a 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.420
 bit the game tense until the end 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.939
 only that it came out with the victory was 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.150
 with seven shots on target and was 13 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:36.689
 we had 82% of correct passes he 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.720
 had 73 plus we had 8 58% ownership 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.569
 also being like this we give xavi pedro 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.819
 that the goalkeeper is more or less and 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.010
 we put the goyta I hope it can 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.409
 help a little since he has eight 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.599
 more gold but I do not even know who knows 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.760
 he can help or not what I know 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.060
 I have faced several pictures 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.530
 very strong and have been quite 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.459
 complicated as in that game there against the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.040
 cbf 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.829
 agüero and messi and neymar rapping of maria 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.989
 finally look there the guy's troupe is more like 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.269
 it has been difficult enough to play 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.370
 because that is if you noticed the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.769
 messi catches the ball outside the box 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.310
 and the goalie is not even in the ball 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.739
 it is notoriously crying out or nothing is the intuition 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.989
 series the like but I tell 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.790
 you who have been quite difficult 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.579
 because any hesitation you the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.919
 defense when contracting that usually 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.409
 It's usually deadly and Uruguayan. 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.650
 I said that maybe he could help the 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.329
 our team and do me that barbarity there 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.590
 after that master's kick 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.250
 and that's how he ended up losing 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.810
 so by cbf 4 to 0 is he played a lot 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.540
 better had a new opportunity to 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.940
 Chutinho to the valley I had three I had 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.729
 greater possession of the ball and hit more 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.709
 passes also 85 to 81 but still 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.989
 it was not possible to make it clear that 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.060
 so I'm not crying complaining about the 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.310
 It's the purpose of the series, I think. 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.099
 It would be a lot cooler if I 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.340
 I could arrange it and it 's other people. 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.919
 that they had teams with the same quality 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.530
 not only showing there the amd team for 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.689
 three fighters but how to say if you had a 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.220
 team with the same quality that I 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.669
 Let's be this way could be a little bit 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.130
 more fair in the sense that we have 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.750
 players with the same performance but 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.139
 who knows in the future we can not 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.659
 I go out with I do not know when there's more 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.860
 people viewing there I have access 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.930
 to more people 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.380
 we try to make the same button that is 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.900
 the original creator of 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.670
 where does he play for example has ten 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.710
 Silver players and other guy have to 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.080
 also play with ten silver players 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.660
 but that's how it ended 3-0 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.820
 for us and we were able to master the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.710
 we had sites in the album 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.620
 Stopped me two, we cried, strange stranger. 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.140
 We also had 74 percent of the 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.490
 the 4th as he had 72 and being 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.890
 so we come to our second 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.500
 victory in the series to put the enemy 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.480
 martins there in our saga since this 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.190
 puzzle he has a good fish it 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.590
 has 77 face 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.250
 has good defense attributes 80 and also 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.780
 has good good heading attributes 79 good 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.120
 Today's episode we got then 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.550
 the two wins and one more defeat 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.310
 we stayed there with six games wagered 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.350
 4 in itself of the two lost 12 houses 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.230
 six cases lost, which gives a 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.330
 The balance is six positive cases that 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.000
 You think I'm going to bet on our 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.650
