so<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> take<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> seam

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
so you're just going to take a seam

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.050 
so you're just going to take a seam
ripper<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:02.390> cut<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:04.589> threads<00:01:05.339> around<00:01:05.790> here

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ripper and cut the threads around here

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.789 
ripper and cut the threads around here
using<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.479> seam<00:01:06.720> ripper<00:01:06.750> until<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.500> Vulcan

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
using a seam ripper until the Vulcan

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
using a seam ripper until the Vulcan
comes<00:01:08.010> loose<00:01:09.650> on<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:11.189> side<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.850> Jeep<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
comes loose on one side of the Jeep and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.100 
comes loose on one side of the Jeep and
you'll<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.400> snapping<00:01:14.400> liner<00:01:14.640> snaps

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
you'll have the snapping liner snaps

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
you'll have the snapping liner snaps
remain<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.590> pant<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> other<00:01:17.610> side

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
remain on the pant but on the other side

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
remain on the pant but on the other side
they'll<00:01:18.960> come<00:01:19.200> loose<00:01:19.470> once<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> velcro<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
they'll come loose once the velcro is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
they'll come loose once the velcro is
removed<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.659> you'll<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.290> sew

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
have to look at snap placement on this

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.390 
have to look at snap placement on this
small<00:03:09.220> as<00:03:09.700> your<00:03:09.850> diaper<00:03:10.030> one<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:11.100> use<00:03:12.100> a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
small as your diaper one I use a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.920 
small as your diaper one I use a
three-quarter<00:03:13.090> inch<00:03:13.950> snow<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.130> gazing<00:03:15.370> on<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
three-quarter inch snow is gazing on the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.240 
three-quarter inch snow is gazing on the
mediums<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:18.280> go<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.030> one<00:03:19.570> inch<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:20.950> can<00:03:21.100> see

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
mediums I go to one inch so you can see

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.210 
mediums I go to one inch so you can see
they're<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> little<00:03:21.670> bit<00:03:21.880> further<00:03:22.060> apart<00:03:23.220> only

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
they're a little bit further apart only

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.030 
they're a little bit further apart only
on<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.579> medium<00:03:25.060> us<00:03:25.239> or<00:03:25.600> largest<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.290> then

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
on the medium us or largest and then

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.039 
on the medium us or largest and then
they<00:03:27.160> are<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.519> smalls<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:31.810> want<00:03:31.989> to

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
they are on the smalls so we want to

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.990 
they are on the smalls so we want to
measure<00:03:32.230> out<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.860> snaps<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:33.850> that's

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
measure out the snaps and so that's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.080 
measure out the snaps and so that's
where<00:03:34.239> we<00:03:34.360> come<00:03:34.570> in<00:03:34.829> with<00:03:35.829> our<00:03:37.049> measuring<00:03:38.049> tape

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
where we come in with our measuring tape

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.130 
where we come in with our measuring tape
we're<00:03:40.090> going<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.390> just<00:03:40.540> lie<00:03:40.750> them<00:03:40.989> right

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
we're going to just lie them right

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.160 
we're going to just lie them right
across<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.620> back<00:03:42.390> here<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.690> found<00:03:43.930> that

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
across the back here and I found that

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.740 
across the back here and I found that
with<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.620> cloth<00:03:44.950> tape<00:03:45.579> measure<00:03:45.790> if<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.239> set<00:03:46.630> it

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
with a cloth tape measure if you set it

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.880 
with a cloth tape measure if you set it
right<00:03:47.049> along<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:48.340> edge<00:03:48.370> here

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
right along the edge here

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.040 
right along the edge here
you<00:03:50.850> get<00:03:51.060> fairly<00:03:51.690> decent<00:03:52.670> centering<00:03:53.930> for<00:03:54.930> the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
you get fairly decent centering for the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.860 
you get fairly decent centering for the
snaps<00:03:55.319> let's<00:03:56.069> use<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.310> regular<00:03:56.550> pen<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:58.709> dot

we<00:04:15.390> start<00:04:15.750> out<00:04:15.840> with<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.140> all<00:04:16.560> tool<00:04:16.859> now<00:04:17.070> this

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
we start out with the all tool now this

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.050 
we start out with the all tool now this
would<00:04:17.340> be<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.430> little<00:04:17.549> bit<00:04:17.700> different<00:04:17.940> if

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
would be a little bit different if

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.840 
would be a little bit different if
you're<00:04:18.180> using<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.840> snap<00:04:19.799> press<00:04:20.250> versus<00:04:20.730> the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
you're using a snap press versus the

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.170 
you're using a snap press versus the
pliers<00:04:21.120> because<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.900> not<00:04:22.500> going<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.740> have

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
pliers because you not going to have

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.900 
pliers because you not going to have
this<00:04:24.180> step<00:04:24.660> but<00:04:25.470> with<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.830> pyres<00:04:26.100> makes<00:04:26.760> it

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
this step but with the pyres makes it

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.659 
this step but with the pyres makes it
much<00:04:27.000> easier<00:04:27.060> just<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.900> use<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:29.160> all<00:04:29.340> tool

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
much easier just to use the all tool

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:37.660 
much easier just to use the all tool
here<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:32.630> poke<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> hole<00:04:33.780> through<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.320> fabric
