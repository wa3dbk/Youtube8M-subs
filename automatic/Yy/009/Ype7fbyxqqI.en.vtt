I<00:02:53.299> think<00:02:53.810> since<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:54.079> entered<00:02:54.170> this

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
I think since we entered this

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.720 
I think since we entered this
competition<00:02:54.620> we've<00:02:55.069> grown<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.310> lot<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.640> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
competition we've grown a lot of the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.339 
competition we've grown a lot of the
band<00:02:55.909> we've<00:02:56.510> learned<00:02:56.720> over<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.959> structure<00:02:57.319> a

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
band we've learned over the structure a

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.420 
band we've learned over the structure a
bit<00:02:57.530> better<00:02:57.650> we've<00:02:57.950> learned<00:02:58.129> how<00:02:58.280> to<00:02:58.340> play

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.610 
bit better we've learned how to play
live<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.909> bit<00:02:59.060> better<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.959> think<00:02:59.989> if<00:03:00.290> we<00:03:00.439> win

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620

live a bit better and I think if we win
it<00:03:00.739> at<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> end<00:03:01.069> we'll<00:03:01.340> probably<00:03:01.549> make<00:03:01.760> the
