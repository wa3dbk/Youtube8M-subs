 was the bridge inside our parana 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.049
 team visited a milk producer who 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.660
 has in its fleet of tractors 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.650
 massey ferguson, with emphasis on 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 big mf 7 140 of 140 horses of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.529
 power 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:25.230
 see more in the article by frederico 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:28.230
 free and eduardo do santos to produce 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.990
 milk in quantity and quality. 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 producer mary bronckhost of the colony 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.360
 of the municipality of arapoti in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.540
 parana manages the animals of the new farm 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.239
 hope of a structure that does not leave 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.129
 nothing to be desired for the best producers 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.129
 from the United States or even from Europe 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.700
 the Dutch immigrant living in Brazil 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.250
 51 years ago her husband commands them all 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.440
 stages of the production process well 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.519
 near here mainly in this shed 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.610
 where there are 260 cows in 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.550
 milking of the Dutch breed which 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.990
 daily about eight thousand and 800 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.000
 liters of milk 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.860
 all stages of milk production 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.830
 here are 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.320
 automated or mechanized from the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.090
 planting of the grain there in the 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.020
 distribution of the food in the trough to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.390
 the animals 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.660
 operations carried out with 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.780
 massey ferguson and 50 to 140 horsepower 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.780
 power 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.000
 the milking shed the course is stainless steel 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.550
 with plenty of water comfort to the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.789
 animals is provided by these coals 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.789
 cows scratch themselves and where they are 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.009
 apart from calves, breastfeeding is 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:49.350
 made by this species of wood 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.350
 high tech call lime daughter 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.960
 and to supply the course three times to the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.079
 day with a mixture of silage made from 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.939
 tifton hay sorghum and concentrates 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:06.700
 the producer uses a massey tractor 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:09.610
 ferguson model mf 42 83 and 86 hp instead of 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.819
 series of tractors and mf 4200 that 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.819
 models from 65 to 130 horsepower 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.790
 that is very versatile as well in terms of 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.620
 This maneuver is with this benefit. 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.150
 The designer for you is unloading. 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.750
 see what's happening in front of 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.299
 tractor 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.030
 all this his design helps in this 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.069
 activity 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.930
 the machine is part of the fleet of nine 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.180
 massey ferguson tractors from the farm 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.860
 new hope that has as its ultimate goal 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.500
 component of this mf 740 of 140 hp from 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.230
 series mf sets in which assists the producer 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.200
 in the management of 80 hectares of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.510
 corn in the summer and see it for the winter and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.709
 annual production of 5 thousand tons of 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.709
 silage for animals 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.860
 the large tractor use mainly in the 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.930
 time to qualify and mainly 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.120
 At the time of doing it for me I need 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.890
 a big tractor to sell the service 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.450
 the characteristics of the mass are 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.770
 simplicity and robustness is a tractor that 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.160
 maintenance and this is not what 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.160
 demand 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.350
 he did not pass on the new one in the maintenance is 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.080
 so much that you saw the field was fine 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.250
 more agile and quicker it is 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.250
 time and time well 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.500
 here is another success story that 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.860
 started in 1982 with the daily production of 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.100
 only 250 liters of milk and today 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.020
 provides this stubborn producer with a 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.020
 real productivity gain 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.830
 I chose to knead and standardize akon 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.640
 mass and the second point is the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.780
 technical 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.330
 Look, I need assistance. 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.450
 technique I have this is very very 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.960
 important when modernizing the farm 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.960
 property
