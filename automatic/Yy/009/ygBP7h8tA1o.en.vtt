 now it is there and only a few want it, among other things, the super gasoline e10 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.660
 7 percent more bioethanol could account for nearly 70 percent of all the risky ones 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.680
 ultimately 7 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.640
 from a vote at the pump can be read 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.530
 Refusal of statements before Stefanie find the reasons for Merck 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:19.300

 White is getting stronger as he a week ago if their vehicle e10 at all 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.669
 withstand 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.689
 to fear for the second 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.220
 However, the consumption has 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.900
 Although it costs less, it does not get me that far 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.430
 and that's why we are not an option as a lucky fairy in my view too little 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.240
 Prescribe information 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.410
 however, the remainder remaining from one of these reality is not like that 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.670
 I still almost have their first fans 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.110
 wet good progress 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.420
 Two with lightness than that alone dad has said the motor mechanic 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.160
 that one admixture of alcohol prohibition with one of their worst ones 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 all hurt I'm just not afraid but not within limits 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.140
 At the weekend, parts of the automotive industry should still have coins or 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.080
 still at the 14th previous year 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320
 warned about the new bio-fuel 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.530
 not just just under ten percent of petrol would be old cars especially 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620
 can not stand the new fuel 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.130
 also on the new vehicles partly serious damage can not be ruled out 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 the people's soul 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 For this reason, increasingly do not want safety 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.390
 For this, simply missing the long-term studies Neumann with clear message 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.680
 at the younger cars to the few known around 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.740
 Problem with the AMD with the plasticisers in plastics and celebs 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.590
 those are the fields do not believe that in the engine or order 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.720
 in the combustion chamber, the burning of the ten euros was almost a sign 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.540
 stand then or can be damaged 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.729
 in the meantime, the automakers have been rowing and the damage has come back so BMW 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.640
 where one leaned to other side very far out the window for the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.700
 Engines there are no problems so from the year of construction 1900 to the gasoline engine 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.450
 Member are clogged ancestor 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.810

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.960
 Experience gas station 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.439
 where you sometimes have a hard time 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.409
 I'm having a tough time just because I like people then 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.749
 again refer to the vehicle manufacturers where they have the 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.569
 Retrieve rows of information from the one amazed 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.420
 should the ECJ be pulling is not suitable model cities damage 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 Gonser to say a few sentences to me have also said whether a run he 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.010
 she will give the doctors a machine if there is information about three 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.229
 Men hard 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.049
 is there in part he says that 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.289
 Staff can open 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:41.779

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.849
 Peter between politics

 Car maker General Industry must be over 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.159
 these are the expectations 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.669
 on the morning of 15 or Minister of Economics BrÃ¼derle clear and 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.090
 Reliable statements from politics and business are demanded GC deserves 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:01.689
 really a second chance 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.159
 it is the more environmentally friendly fuel compared to classic 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.139
 gasoline 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.759
 And now he is not too that he would not be paid today 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.879
 First of all, I asked my mum Jada city and the eyes 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.319
 become 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.370
 Clocks or may say the engine tolerates the Brandenburg Gate 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.550
 the remark that so one percent of the Hamburg St 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.740
 that was at the Munich Gange so weekend was the doctorate law

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.430
