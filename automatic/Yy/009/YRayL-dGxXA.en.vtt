00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
values right there so like if you

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.560 
values right there so like if you
examine<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.700> then<00:03:59.880> I'll<00:04:00.030> tell<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.420> high

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
i can't had them all together but then

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.570 
i can't had them all together but then
of<00:04:04.890> course<00:04:05.220> i<00:04:05.370> did<00:04:05.549> get<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:06.380> 90<00:04:07.380> snow<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.459> I

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
of course i did get a 90 snow and I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.220 
of course i did get a 90 snow and I
didn't<00:04:08.880> get<00:04:09.000> start<00:04:09.450> getting<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.720> snow<00:04:09.989> until

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
didn't get start getting the snow until

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.710 
didn't get start getting the snow until
I<00:04:10.650> actually<00:04:10.739> had<00:04:11.100> one<00:04:11.130> open<00:04:11.880> inventory<00:04:12.420> slot

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
I actually had one open inventory slot

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.890 
I actually had one open inventory slot
and<00:04:12.959> then<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:13.290> started<00:04:13.620> popping<00:04:13.860> up<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.900> not

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
and then it started popping up and not

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.080 
and then it started popping up and not
bad<00:04:16.169> or<00:04:17.750> just<00:04:18.750> randomly<00:04:19.380> picking<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.890> up<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.459> 50

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
bad or just randomly picking it up to 50

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.909 
bad or just randomly picking it up to 50
I<00:04:21.359> did<00:04:21.630> get<00:04:21.750> some<00:04:21.989> more<00:04:22.140> ghostly<00:04:22.560> essence

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
I did get some more ghostly essence

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.580 
I did get some more ghostly essence
which<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.280> nice<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.729> have<00:04:23.880> you<00:04:24.690> can<00:04:24.870> keep<00:04:25.470> your

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
which is nice to have you can keep your

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.960 
which is nice to have you can keep your
ecto<00:04:25.979> place

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
ecto place

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.480 
ecto place
charged<00:04:27.390> up<00:04:27.660> and<00:04:27.840> get<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:29.100> will<00:04:29.280> get<00:04:29.430> a

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
charged up and get the you will get a

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.540 
charged up and get the you will get a
little<00:04:29.730> prayer<00:04:29.940> there<00:04:30.180> too<00:04:30.360> if<00:04:30.600> you<00:04:30.720> do<00:04:30.840> kill

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
little prayer there too if you do kill

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.830 
little prayer there too if you do kill
so<00:04:32.550> it's<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.880> right<00:04:33.060> there<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.300> guess<00:04:33.510> if<00:04:33.720> you

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
so it's it right there I guess if you

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.540 
so it's it right there I guess if you
just<00:04:34.080> added<00:04:34.320> all<00:04:34.620> these<00:04:34.800> up<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.400> could

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
just added all these up and you could

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.680 
just added all these up and you could
those<00:04:35.790> 300<00:04:38.690> 507<00:04:39.800> like<00:04:40.880> 750<00:04:41.880> k<00:04:42.060> for<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.540> hour

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
those 300 507 like 750 k for the hour

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.010 
those 300 507 like 750 k for the hour
just<00:04:43.170> in<00:04:43.380> this<00:04:43.530> stuff<00:04:43.800> alone<00:04:44.690> just<00:04:45.690> in<00:04:45.870> the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
just in this stuff alone just in the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.080 
just in this stuff alone just in the
coins<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.560> alcohols<00:04:47.070> which<00:04:47.250> is<00:04:47.400> not<00:04:47.640> bad<00:04:47.670> at

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090
