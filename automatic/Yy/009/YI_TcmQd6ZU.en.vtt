five<00:00:09.030> days<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> week<00:00:09.330> because<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.719> that<00:00:09.840> time

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
five days a week because at that time

five days a week because at that time
half<00:00:11.070> miles<00:00:11.340> all<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.580> could<00:00:11.730> really<00:00:11.849> run<00:00:12.059> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
half miles all I could really run and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.200 
half miles all I could really run and
every<00:00:12.750> two<00:00:12.929> weeks<00:00:13.139> I've<00:00:13.349> increased<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.980> by<00:00:14.219> an

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
been running two miles a day and I'm do

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.429

weeks<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.340> then<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> should<00:00:23.970> probably<00:00:24.150> just

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
weeks and then I should probably just

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.200 
weeks and then I should probably just
increase<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.380> two<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> half<00:00:26.160> miles<00:00:26.430> but

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
