00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello guys today we are in a new 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:08.650
 video and today I bring you a tutorial of a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.560
 tutorial at once is a sin but to the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:15.130
 time is a tutorial and a gameplay of what 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:17.259
 damn just say good I'm 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.259
 talking about an emulator that is the 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.659
 drastic that is the one of nintendo ds 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.999
 honestly one of the best I've ever 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:27.039
 tested and which will also leave you with 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.859
 a game the super mario bros 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.020
 obviously the nintendo ds and well 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.000
 let's move on to what is first the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.440
 installation you are going to go to the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.210
 description of this video and they are going to 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.370
 find the link to download these 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.530
 two files then they will be in their 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 folder dubbing once downloaded and 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.489
 that would be the new super Mario Bros and the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.769
 emulator the emulator is pay is 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.780
 all cracked without any problem and 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.370
 well, the game will remain points and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.460
 it is not 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.829
 do not decompress it or anything and well 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.890
 let's see ya good I forgot 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.640
 mention them 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.370
 the emulator already know how to install 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.040
 down land in the dweller in install and 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.650
 ready nothing happens absolutely there is no 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.510
 nothing out of the other world and so good 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.990
 now let's open what is the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.290
 emulator 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.800
 is this drastic the first thing that tends to 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.930
 do is give in the new game 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.110
 and they're going to give him here and they're going to go to his 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.470
 folder where they have the game downloaded 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.320
 in this case in dollars because there 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.320
 they have and here is new super mario bros 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.380
 and they give him star game 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.689
 the emulator is good is very good 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.110
 It's very good with how fluent I am 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.570
 run the emulator because it depends on what 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.270
 so good is your device remember 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.010
 that I currently use an engine 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.800
 well let's see let's go as nintendo ds 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.929
 It has two stripes I say two screens I 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.770
 shows them in this case here so good 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.800
 what you sell first in mario 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.240
 game to start the game I have a 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 game we start let's start from 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.120
 zero let's create a new good world 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.200
 and once they gave him they saw that they are 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 small what they have to do is 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.390
 give it in on this date that is here and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.600
 give it in this option here as you see it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.570
 see on giant screen good almost 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.570
 totally great good the game well 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.500
 start and you know the browser that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.510
 wants to play the princess but it says 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 mario oh my god my princess I run 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 run 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.900
 and to evans a mario and in chinga they go to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.040
 chase good that's the inside of the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.950
 game and there it appears is very well the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.380
 I really liked the game and so 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.560
 to start playing you know mario bros 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:09.380
 jump breaks the mushroom and already 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.380
 they know what Mario does normally 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.319
 the game very fluid and for today and this 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.060
 emulator has to save the game 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.550
 bet you give him here in this 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:25.890
 date and they give him in shame and they give him 10 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.140
 and the game is saved well 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.209
 ej 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.420
 now suppose they will kill me to kill me 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.720
 they took things away from me because I gave it here and 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.720
 they have 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.470
 good is that they have to save it as 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.480
 twice but I mean if you 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.950
 they are going to regenerate the last 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.500
 point where they kept means that 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.030
 they could be immortal in this game I 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.030
 he understood they had this well was in this 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.330
 this vato is drugged 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.019
 and if the mario developers are the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.019
 they raffled a little 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.550
 and you and they are going to give me your life they are going to give me 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.060
 two life 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.750
 two lives two good lives to run 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:23.200
 fast is the y and then with the high 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:26.920
 It's great Mario is worth it 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.230
 and they see that the game runs more than well 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.710
 and well, that would practically be 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:36.250
