all right this is the new home of
teachers<00:00:40.469> telescopes<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:42.030> moved<00:00:42.270> smaller

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
teachers telescopes we moved smaller

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.350 
teachers telescopes we moved smaller
facility<00:00:43.800> into<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.160> much<00:00:44.370> larger<00:00:44.640> facility

on<00:03:03.709> our<00:03:03.799> telescopes<00:03:04.220> obviously<00:03:04.670> that's<00:03:04.849> what

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
on our telescopes obviously that's what

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.000 
on our telescopes obviously that's what
we've<00:03:05.209> been<00:03:05.420> known<00:03:05.989> for<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.470> we<00:03:06.560> keep<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.799> lot<00:03:06.950> of

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
the hardware that we use here in stock

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.430 
the hardware that we use here in stock
and<00:03:10.459> this<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.790> our<00:03:10.910> main<00:03:11.120> assembly<00:03:11.629> bench<00:03:12.019> area

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
and this is our main assembly bench area

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.680 
and this is our main assembly bench area
again<00:03:13.989> most<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:15.170> work<00:03:15.319> goes<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:16.630> now<00:03:17.630> if

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
again most of the work goes on now if

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.009 
again most of the work goes on now if
you<00:03:17.870> uh<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.620> follow<00:03:18.889> me<00:03:19.160> this<00:03:19.340> way<00:03:20.019> there's

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
you uh you follow me this way there's

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.400 
you uh you follow me this way there's
more<00:03:21.170> Lane<00:03:21.349> here<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.609> we<00:03:23.540> will<00:03:23.690> make<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:24.049> right

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
more Lane here and we will make a right

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.240 
more Lane here and we will make a right
into<00:03:25.400> our<00:03:25.870> drawing<00:03:26.870> room<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.940> now<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.540> a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
into our drawing room so now this is a

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.680 
into our drawing room so now this is a
real<00:03:31.250> benefit<00:03:31.669> of<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.000> new<00:03:32.180> facility<00:03:32.389> that

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
real benefit of this new facility that

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.550 
real benefit of this new facility that
we<00:03:32.959> have<00:03:32.989> versus<00:03:33.620> our<00:03:33.769> old<00:03:34.010> location<00:03:35.260> back<00:03:36.260> at

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
we have versus our old location back at

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.659 
we have versus our old location back at
her<00:03:36.650> old<00:03:36.799> location<00:03:37.099> we<00:03:37.370> didn't<00:03:37.549> have<00:03:37.639> a

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
her old location we didn't have a

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.909 
her old location we didn't have a
separate<00:03:38.030> room<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.419> separate<00:03:38.720> area<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.709> keep
