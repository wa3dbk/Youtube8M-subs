00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.769
 what I am going to comment 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.800
 possibly 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.740
 I will receive 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.200
 some brutal criticism 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.200
 d 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.489
 but no problem 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.489
 do not worry sua 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.130
 any 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.910
 I have not been worried about others 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.910
 is less 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.790
 so what I 'm going to explain today I'm going to 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.880
 explain in detail how and why 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:00.130
 with name and surname 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.820
 now at the end of September 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.820
 more or less 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.040
 a player and his advisers had the 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.040
 meeting with the president 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.180
 we speak of September the bell of this one 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.540
 last September about two months two 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.450
 months 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.640
 a meeting 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.149
 and the club promised the player and his 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149
 consultants 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.270
 a contract a help an increase 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.280
 the law of October one month later 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.950
 the former club tells its advisers 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.950
 that what was said in that meeting 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.730
 it is not going to produce 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.689
 evidently 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.840
 the environment of the player and the player 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.630
 they get angry rebounds 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.020
 biological 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.240
 because if you and I agree 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.780
 there may be a difference but not one 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.710
 absolute cancellation does not breach a 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.710
 promise or a pact 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.720
 so 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.630
 one month ago 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.570
 that the relationship with the player and his 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.670
 advisors with the club is practically 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.670
 zero but practically 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.680
 having said that 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.770
 the player 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.150
 and has decided 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.150
 leave at the end of the season 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.180
 and let's leave it here a moment 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.220
 we talk about a relationship of a promise 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.020
 that occurred in September 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.069
 in October that promise is broken by 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.489
 part of the right club 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.630
 and recently the game itself environment 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:37.300
 their environment decide 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.300
 to leave the club at the end of the season 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.180
 and 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.689
 to the players it is very important 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.689
 very important world star very top 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.920
 and the club and the sayings 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.030
 s 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.030
 I have not said principle 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.540
 but just in case someone gets up 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.540
 now is the goal club barcelona barcelona 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:18.199
 decision taken absolutely the action 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.199
 this is irrevocable is final 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.840
 even if they are going to do or may occur 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:34.150
 a paper a makeup and you can 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.540
 extend the contract 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.980
 that could be to cover that not 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.400
 means nothing that the player is 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.930
 will march 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.930
 he feels betrayed 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.940
 that footballer knows where he's going 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:57.570
 currently has a verbal agreement 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.570
 I repeat verbal 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.270
 and the club knows it 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.750
 and what I say here today 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.320
 for February, March, it will begin 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.850
 prepare 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.850

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.720
 you can already at home and we are going to 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.610
 leave a pretty so that is very 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.500
 important that françois calmly 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.350
 tell us about the name of that 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.940
 footballer so important you can 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.940
 send messages too and 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.010
 you are not 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.030
 Grace is waiting and knowing 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.030
 the name of the soccer player of the barça 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.600
 we recover a footballer in September 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.090

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.090
 go with the club a contract improvement 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.880
 one month after 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.520
 the club communicated 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.520
 that he will not be able to fulfill that promise 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:16.100
 few days ago that footballer top of the 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.100

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.700

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:28.749
 to see françois ahead 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.130
