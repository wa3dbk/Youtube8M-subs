00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 coherence antijuventini coherence juventus 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.429
 monaco 1 to 0 then a game a bit a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.330
 little strange because for example in the first ones 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.210
 twenty minutes 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.670
 I would have just signed off for 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.710
 a draw because we were in defense 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 stoned like just patches 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.189
 Boer alarm clocks we were put to own 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.630
 there were three dog boy 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.539
 attackers who were faster 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.099
 of the other and as soon as they left I left 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 also the ascom bat and underpants 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.550
 just in full but fortunately between 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.410
 one mistake the other that among other things today 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.540
 enough has also been played to whom 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 he was more wrong and thanks to buffon 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.860
 what luck this is boiled by 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.200
 a few years ago we did not immediately 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.960
 goal while instead from the twentieth onwards 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.780
 after an action that fucking must 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.730
 throw in with your eyes closed tevez 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.039
 we managed to get a little more later 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.500
 of trust we created a lot to 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.360
 end and we managed to get the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.690
 advantage with this rigor than in 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.430
 effects the contact had happened a little 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.190
 before the penalty area would be 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.539
 was therefore punishment but I say to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.159
 all the other Juventus players 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 at least if you want to say that the juventus 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.170
 steals is fine, however, at least seven consistent 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.049
 if he steals he steals in Europe in Italy in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.659
 world on all sides though if you say that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.400
 in europe you don't win because you can't 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.549
 steal and then to the first episode 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.080
 favorable to juventus or not write 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.729
 they managed to steal even in Europe 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.680
 because after that mongoloids 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 also seemed deficient then 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.780
 write that juve steals precisely that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.420
 however apart from what parentheses was more 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.549
 probable goal on a free kick 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 that the goals on a penalty of vidal then to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.229
 end all in all it did not go either 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.810
 However bad they all say that it in 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.340
 rigor however no one says to that era 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 last man and therefore in theory it was 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.540
 red card but shut up because 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.820
 that was not a pro juve episode 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
 therefore dense, however, for the rest besides 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.280
 these to these facts here when I speak 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.600
 to be cynical under the door 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.509
 I'm talking about what happened 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.240
 today they have failed the impossible 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.460
 here we did worse once 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.050
 we have the opponent in europe that 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.410
 misses the impossible doubts 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.080
 try to make as many goals as possible 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.700
 we had two clear opportunities in the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.490
 first time where already in the first half 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.840
 could end 20 and another immediately 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.580
 at the beginning of the second half on football 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.010
 in the corner where their porter went to 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.870
 empty so the game could end 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.870
 including the penalty goal 4-0 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.930
 round round with four clear occasions 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.210
 created while we are deficient and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.760
 we won on 21 to 0 which is good is 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.470
 a more favorable result than the 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.300
 2 to 1 against borussia because al 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.490
 borussia was enough one to zero for 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.480
 pass while while the monk has to 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.230
 win at least two to zero or otherwise 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.060
 making more goals 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.360
 we have to do a great game 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.030
 in eight days even if there is Saturday 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.730
 first team of rome and second in 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.830
 championship that will come to visit us 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.800
 food and stadium so guys 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.520
 we give us Saturday night for juventus 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.350
 lazio 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.210
 if you liked the video and are enjoying it 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.760
 because in the end even if a victory 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.160
 let's do a little pulling the ass we enjoy 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.750
 I always leave a like write that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.330
 under a commentary arrive two opinions 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.850
 on the match has among other things today give you i 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.380
 them in the field if you haven't done it yet 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.780
 invites you to join the io channel 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.780
