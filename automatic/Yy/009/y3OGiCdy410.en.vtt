00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:04.920
 the little port of the madelon on the title there are no borders between the sum and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.969
 the pas-de-calais one of the most beautiful and most preserved of northern europe 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.940
 andré l'hoër is doubly passionate about scuba diving 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.929
 and archeology history 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.869
 this case 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:17.990
 I proved myself 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.199
 pat has magnified the fff 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.130
 the combinations were rejected 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.130
 for France 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.380
 Italian diving in estuaries for their biological richness 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.280
 a lot of plankton a mixture of fresh and salt water 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.270
 a world he knows and always enjoys to discover 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.250
 share 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.390
 the voices to begin and basically communicated 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.320
 and as for the bottle but the one that collide we did it's to 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.850
 catch-up could be passed 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.940
 the truckers and fat and more still free entry exposure blah 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.200
 auteuil 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.360
 eco-driving is safe the opener the species so it's always a little 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.010
 the blue group's beautiful share and we know that in the big handicaps of our 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670
 effective 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.070
 here especially because it's a homicide 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.680
 their so-called troubled writing the dive is hardly possible 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.210
 for andré it does not detract from the magic of the adventurous 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 diving on the site passes the side of the mirror 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.710
 suddenly this surface of the water I look at me I know what happens in 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.690
 below 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 and it's soon also it was fun for receptions to stay above 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.730
 it takes images it takes villages because otherwise 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.160
 it is difficult explained to the prefect can by I do not know finally 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.250
 in any case in this dive there is 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.770
 but still at another moment a vision of things another universe 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.620
 and when we think that it is more than 70% of the surface of the earth in Strasbourg 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.320
 me it always impresses me to say bah finally I know only one 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.600
 part of this world in which I live 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.830
 why and the sea off the coast of Picardy opal coast is in 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.220
 effect offer amazing images the underwater backgrounds are rich and varied 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.530
 the landscapes the fauna and flora of the riders of the sleeve here photographed 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 by yves leduc are still unknown 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.630
 also ignored the archaeological riches of costing us 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.000
 extremes like the ipad 2 goals to 1 medieval albator discovered there are 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.209
 nearly 20 years in the waters of the canoe other synergy treasures 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.209
 will probably still testify to the easy activity 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.129
 cb it is very used in the middle ages 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.019
 it's sure and certain 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.259
 obviously its height as you go 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.259
 in the coming years at the level of heritage and the various 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.679
 discovery proves that one can be 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:34.599
 laurent in the tens or hundreds of years to come since we 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.389
 note i do not have too much 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.979
 he sometimes kept violent tomorrow 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.379
 but in any case as the works end in the researches it is possible 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.159
 actually is still discovering beautiful things 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.159
 when he does not dive show their work at the museum of berck on sea 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.480
 there are paintings that tell me the maritime history of the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.669
 Region cdv retière of the bay of sum or fishermen on board flobarts 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.629
 of the Opal Coast we imagine others of image come to build the mother who 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.659
 is today still taking a part of its history 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.680
 why today we propose now is not beautiful is that 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.739
 and we have very important sand dunes at the bottom 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.889
 in fact one of the particularities of the sleeve is a lot of movement of 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.889
 spill from the sleeve and the North Sea and the North Sea by the sleeve 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:21.029
 e and that makes this dune massif must cover states I want for 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:26.249
 evidence that Catholics to staples when you get home you have more than 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 of a 16th century which are mostly fishing nets 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.899
 that finally we will go things back up after storm 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.559
 the marine natural park project requires a better knowledge 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:38.589
 funds 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:41.689
 to understand ecosystems to protect heritage wealth 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.649
 organic improve sales r the location the nature of what we 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.959
 found under the network will be necessary the testimonies brought by the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.329
 divers is essential and valuable
