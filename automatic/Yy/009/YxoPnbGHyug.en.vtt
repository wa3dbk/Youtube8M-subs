00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 What happened, Juanito, I am 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.710
 again here is possibly in the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.510
 fuck you see if you're not in the fuck 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.330
 zetas and you are only interested in dragon ball 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.969
 dragon ball z and now dragon ball super 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.460
 possibly you are in the new channel that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.340
 we have created to quench your thirst for 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.460
 dragon ball so it's good as I say 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 there is information about the new dragon series 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.859
 super ball what if dragon ball super 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.019
 this series that will that will not 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.610
 we know almost nothing but what we do know 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.160
 it's a couple of things that I'm going to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.380
 comment today because they just launched a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.699
 image that would come to be something that we 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.800
 sample 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.050
 possible or this has been released 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.480
 officially the twitter account of 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.589
 dragon ball super therefore we know 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.469
 that this image is completely 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.600
 veridical in which we see some scenes of 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:56.000
 what would be just as I said 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.769
 the end of this ende we see in it 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 good we see a couple of goyang characters 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.930
 or that we also see as a reference 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.949
 to the small forest this that could 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.899
 to be saying that he is already telling us 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.000
 that somehow we're going to remember the 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.520
 happened in this ending perhaps also 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.920
 something that refers to the past and the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.450
 present since we see the same one 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.179
 character in an adult version that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.479
 I would be showing in a pose similar to 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.070
 the one who told them about their childhood in turn 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.429
 he has also launched something very interesting 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.140
 that first leaked good leaked not 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:29.210
 these things are filtered , that is what 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.069
 happens is that they throw them and one as not 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.050
 know you find them this way and believe 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.960
 that leaked in quotes but 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.440
 well what happened is that in an episode 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.110
 of dragon ball kai already warmed up with that 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.880
 are about to launch this new series 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.990
 called dragon ball super and they put the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.159
 logo on fans 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.140
 this logo the truth that is more than 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.299
 interesting because it evokes a bit of the logo 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.090
 original dragon ball z that is one that 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.310
 I do not just like it, I love it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.829
 bring back all my childhood and so many 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.080
 memories that dragon ball has given me in 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.479
 end two more interesting news 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.209
 that they dress them of the carajo tv of the carajo 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.019
 z anywhere but they are news of the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.759
