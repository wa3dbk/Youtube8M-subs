 I tried to go and I know I started 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.750
 That's what I put to play. It played. 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.900
 Remember the musique owner of himself to the height 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.010

 the pope insured from below or hold 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.060
 here it turns out that defining how it will appear 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.340
 only here the phone rings touch 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.950

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.220
 touch the phone to the test when someone 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.350
 Turn on the alarm clock and 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.200
 Contact touch is for a contact 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:41.050
 and that's not what I want. 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.900
