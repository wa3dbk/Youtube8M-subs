00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello challenge friends 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.179
 it's that time again, though 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.639
 last tutorial for this season 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.970
 how do you see the attitudes at sun 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:23.550
 From 20 40 35, most of them have the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.779
 setting on ice it looks like 25 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.040
 49 26 I drive and snow 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.760
 most I think so 11 15 or 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.820
 like 4 12 16 72 you need that area 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.350
 Try it yourself until you see what happens 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.350
 best is what set 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.890
 5 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.150
 so 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.340
 they really do that 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.680
 decisive for the further course one 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.900
 takes a lot of small things and that is 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.290
 It is important that you do not go to this gate 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.060
 in front of the gate but you see here behind 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.610
 the goal the sport button pushes something 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.670
 tarnished to push the wave 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.680
 and then turn right immediately 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 then hang on this tournament 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.150
 to come by and now stop here 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.990
 take speed 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.990
 edit that 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.980
 will find a 40 come 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550
 now again in the garden 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.910
 sda with 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:52.930
 in front of him goes directly to the right 126 127 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.930
 or to delete 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.460
 try agency cleaning here 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.310
 highly satisfied 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.409
 in front of the gate and now in sight 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.080
 is possible 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.530
 determined that one is 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.530
 16 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.629
 the values 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.790
 With 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.790
 5 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.120
 not these 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
 that does not divorce anything here 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.530
 now the ghosts there is one or 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.260
 others stand on bridges the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.530
 Sport key to take the turns I 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 I'm very short but really quite 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.790
 in short, the very key to me personally 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.710
 the better especially as I said 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.440
 but there is the workout mode come 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.780
 that test everything now if possible 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.840
 not here to the left of the blue line 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.790
 Driving snow is going to be something 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.090
 you should lose speed 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.160
 so in doing is from the blue line 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.490
 stay on the blue line and then this one 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.490
 gate here 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.550
 and 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.900
 now protect part 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.900
 give up now 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.870
 and German 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.209
 to test with this ball 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.090
 the goal 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.290
 These and I hope we see you then 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.260
 next year or next season 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.239
 back to a bag of chips 16 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.730
 and I hope I can help you too 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.370
 again tutorials from the tracks 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.080
 until then all the best beautiful 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.080
 summer and a lot of success in garmisch
