more<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.680> advanced<00:00:47.070> stats<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.930> Dante's

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
more with advanced stats is Dante's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.290 
more with advanced stats is Dante's
already<00:00:49.260> shown<00:00:49.559> unique<00:00:50.129> defensive<00:00:50.820> abilities

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
already shown unique defensive abilities

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.569 
already shown unique defensive abilities
frankly<00:00:52.199> he's<00:00:52.410> two<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.800> three<00:00:53.039> levels<00:00:53.430> ahead

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
frankly he's two or three levels ahead

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.299 
frankly he's two or three levels ahead
of<00:00:53.879> where<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.090> thought<00:00:54.449> he'd<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.620> defensively

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
of where we thought he'd be defensively

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.660 
of where we thought he'd be defensively
I<00:00:56.610> think<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.030> were<00:00:57.149> plus<00:00:57.570> five<00:00:58.280> per<00:00:59.280> 100

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I think we were plus five per 100

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.160 
I think we were plus five per 100
possessions<00:00:59.760> when<00:01:00.359> he<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.809> court

last<00:01:01.500> year<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> nineteen-year-old

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
last year so for a nineteen-year-old

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.450 
last year so for a nineteen-year-old
point<00:01:03.420> guard<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.899> most<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.589> those<00:01:04.710> margins<00:01:05.280> as

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
point guard and most of those margins as

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
point guard and most of those margins as
you<00:01:05.640> would<00:01:05.790> guess<00:01:06.060> were<00:01:06.900> gained<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you would guess were gained because of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
you would guess were gained because of
his<00:01:08.310> defense<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.880> mobility<00:01:09.450> his<00:01:09.600> size<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.170> his

length and you had that with

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
length and you had that with
intelligence<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> character<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
intelligence and character we think and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
intelligence and character we think and
he's<00:01:14.280> already<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> good<00:01:15.500> offensive<00:01:16.500> player<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
he's already a good offensive player and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.320 
he's already a good offensive player and
in<00:01:16.979> time<00:01:17.159> he'll<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.670> offensive<00:01:17.970> player

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
little non-traditional so he can start

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.100

relative to Dante in the offensive part

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430 
relative to Dante in the offensive part
he<00:02:12.629> really<00:02:13.260> do

ferred<00:02:13.740> to<00:02:13.770> Gordon<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.880> Derek<00:02:15.330> some<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.780> our

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
ferred to Gordon to Derek some of our

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.870 
ferred to Gordon to Derek some of our
more<00:02:16.200> mature<00:02:16.650> players<00:02:17.130> he<00:02:17.400> didn't<00:02:17.670> try<00:02:17.850> to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
more mature players he didn't try to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.690 
more mature players he didn't try to
force<00:02:18.750> himself<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> game<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.190> think

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
force himself on the game and I think

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.060 
force himself on the game and I think
that's<00:02:20.910> why<00:02:21.240> even<00:02:21.570> though<00:02:21.720> his<00:02:22.410> per<00:02:22.800> game

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
that's why even though his per game

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.390 
that's why even though his per game
stats<00:02:23.940> were<00:02:24.180> humble<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.230> team<00:02:25.470> function<00:02:26.100> very

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
stats were humble the team function very

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.480 
stats were humble the team function very
well<00:02:26.490> when<00:02:26.850> he<00:02:26.940> was<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.240> game
