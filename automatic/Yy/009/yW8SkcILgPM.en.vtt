we're<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> do<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.679> case<00:00:13.920> is

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
we're going to do in this case is

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.019 
we're going to do in this case is
actually<00:00:14.880> mount<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:16.350> camera<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.760> it's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
actually mount the camera so that it's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.200 
actually mount the camera so that it's
centered<00:00:19.220> then<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.310> can<00:00:20.430> use<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.730> toe<00:00:20.970> ball

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
centered then you can use the toe ball

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
centered then you can use the toe ball
as<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> reference<00:00:21.900> point<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.380> from<00:00:22.980> here<00:00:23.189> with

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
as a reference point so from here with

because we're finished in the back of

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.880 
because we're finished in the back of
the<00:02:58.350> car<00:02:58.530> now

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the car now

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.620 
the car now
so<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.100> we<00:02:59.190> have<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.490> now<00:02:59.640> is<00:02:59.760> just<00:02:59.910> connect

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
so all we have to do now is just connect

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.630 
so all we have to do now is just connect
all<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.870> electronic<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.650> electrical<00:03:02.430> side

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
all the electronic the electrical side

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.449 
all the electronic the electrical side
of<00:03:02.760> things<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.630> need<00:03:03.810> power<00:03:04.220> we<00:03:05.220> need<00:03:05.340> to

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
of things so we need power we need to

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.540 
of things so we need power we need to
ground<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.660> system<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:07.980> need<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.220> connect

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
ground the system and we need to connect

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.250 
ground the system and we need to connect
the<00:03:08.610> two<00:03:08.880> cameras<00:03:09.530> into<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> monitor<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the two cameras into the monitor and the

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.140 
the two cameras into the monitor and the
monitor<00:03:13.260> itself<00:03:13.620> we're<00:03:14.550> trying<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.880> get<00:03:15.000> our

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
monitor itself we're trying to get our

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.060 
monitor itself we're trying to get our
power<00:03:15.450> from<00:03:16.200> one<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.500> these<00:03:16.590> cigarette

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
power from one of these cigarette

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.729 
power from one of these cigarette
lighter<00:03:17.310> sockets<00:03:17.880> from<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.600> back<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.620> it

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
lighter sockets from the back so that it

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.259 
lighter sockets from the back so that it
comes<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.190> off<00:03:20.310> with<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.670> key<00:03:20.880> with<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
comes on and off with the key with the

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.600 
comes on and off with the key with the
ignition<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.380> do<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:23.220> may<00:03:23.400> need<00:03:23.550> to

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
ignition and to do that we may need to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.479 
ignition and to do that we may need to
remove<00:03:23.730> some<00:03:24.739> sections<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.950> console

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
remove some sections of the console

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:38.929 
remove some sections of the console
gentle<00:03:27.209> pull<00:03:27.420> with<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.660> hand

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.300 

now<00:03:39.939> this<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.420> cigarette<00:03:40.750> lightest

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
now this is the cigarette lightest

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.099 
now this is the cigarette lightest
connection<00:03:42.310> here<00:03:42.659> that's<00:03:43.659> where<00:03:43.870> we'll<00:03:43.959> get

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
connection here that's where we'll get

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.789 
connection here that's where we'll get
our<00:03:44.170> power<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.870> now<00:03:47.049> that's<00:03:47.260> completely

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
our power and now that's completely

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.440 
our power and now that's completely
exposed<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.920> from<00:03:51.189> here<00:03:51.430> we<00:03:51.760> now<00:03:51.909> are<00:03:52.150> going<00:03:52.329> to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
exposed so from here we now are going to

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.509 
exposed so from here we now are going to
hide<00:03:52.750> under<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.260> dash<00:03:53.500> all<00:03:53.829> our<00:03:53.980> connections

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
hide under the dash all our connections

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.880 
hide under the dash all our connections
make<00:03:55.480> sure<00:03:55.659> the<00:03:55.780> solder<00:03:56.109> is<00:03:56.230> melted<00:03:56.709> right

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
make sure the solder is melted right

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.280 
make sure the solder is melted right
through<00:03:57.250> all<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.609> cabling<00:03:58.060> not<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:59.049> sitting

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
through all the cabling not just sitting

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.379 
through all the cabling not just sitting
on<00:03:59.379> the<00:03:59.500> top<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.549> that<00:04:00.790> will<00:04:00.849> become<00:04:01.060> our

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
on the top and that will become our

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.690 
on the top and that will become our
earth<00:04:01.540> which<00:04:01.780> will<00:04:02.049> mount<00:04:02.230> in<00:04:02.500> there<00:04:03.010> and

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
earth which will mount in there and

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.759

that's the connection finished just put
it<00:04:05.859> all<00:04:05.980> back<00:04:06.099> together<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:14.409> don't<00:04:14.590> want<00:04:14.799> it

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
it all back together you don't want it

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.860 
it all back together you don't want it
too<00:04:15.189> high<00:04:15.489> on<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.879> screen<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.599> you<00:04:16.690> don't

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
too high on the screen and you don't

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.240 
too high on the screen and you don't
want<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.139> block<00:04:17.349> your<00:04:17.530> vision<00:04:17.650> of<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.070> road

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
want it to block your vision of the road

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.320 
want it to block your vision of the road
either<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:20.259> cable<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.680> now<00:04:20.799> run<00:04:21.150> from<00:04:22.150> the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
either the cable is now run from the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.820 
either the cable is now run from the
monitor<00:04:22.720> across<00:04:23.190> just<00:04:24.190> hidden<00:04:24.520> down<00:04:24.789> in<00:04:24.849> there

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.710 

there<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.910> so<00:04:31.030> now<00:04:31.180> what<00:04:31.300> I'm<00:04:31.360> going<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.509> do<00:04:31.630> is

so you've got your camera connections
here<00:04:34.479> which<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.349> the<00:04:35.440> two<00:04:35.620> leads<00:04:35.830> we<00:04:36.009> ran

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
here which is the two leads we ran

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.969 
here which is the two leads we ran
through<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.580> car<00:04:36.789> will<00:04:36.970> connect<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.419> and<00:04:37.979> this

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
through the car will connect to and this

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.550 
through the car will connect to and this
one<00:04:39.190> here<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:39.460> goes<00:04:39.729> to<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.030> monitor<00:04:40.560> and

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
one here that goes to the monitor and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.129 
one here that goes to the monitor and
then<00:04:41.680> you<00:04:41.800> go<00:04:41.919> in<00:04:42.039> one<00:04:42.220> way<00:04:42.840> line<00:04:43.840> up<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
then you go in one way line up the

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.129 
then you go in one way line up the
arrows<00:04:44.409> again<00:04:44.800> just<00:04:45.610> in<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:49.810> final

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
arrows again just in the final

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.010 
arrows again just in the final
connection<00:04:50.380> is<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.889> monitor<00:04:51.310> connection

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
connection is the monitor connection

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.129 
connection is the monitor connection
once<00:04:53.020> again<00:04:53.320> threaded<00:04:53.849> arrows<00:04:54.870> line<00:04:55.870> up<00:04:56.020> the

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
once again threaded arrows line up the

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:03.809 
once again threaded arrows line up the
arrows
