 the Ile-de-France who express themselves elsewhere so when I see what are the

 havoc did not have much trouble it these relationships nothing happened people 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.990
 were happy to his starters to comfort him they were not told his last 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.420
 rubbish word that many thought were questions 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.369
 the environment and the time of the accounts out of danger% the results 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.759
 reflect the story repeats itself ford 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.149
 a few hours earlier plus several people had gathered in this 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.649
 situation on Monday however at home for her who 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.220
 of the person as long as when ascents are in e on the front on 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.610
 the front of his house 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.960
 in his apartment having opened the 5 million to watch we had a whole 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.830
 list of paper that could serve so enjoy it here is how it is 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.380
 that it happened and for companies it was the same 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.120
 so we have to avoid 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.240
 in europe we can see European companies were better 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.250
 levi received in the sme is celebrating the big components that will not put 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.530
 never paper on pollution anyway came out of the field of march 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.760
 currently in newsstands 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.510
 they did not have a lot to the judge at the moment she do not do it because 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.100
 that they have a paid service directly from time the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.080
 building 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.740
 and who will look directly into the building and the papers so the first 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.540
 accessibility and data center the document 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.180
 complete piquemal infections every night when at home when we live a 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.780
 apartment they are happy 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.359
 other finding is bitter 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.360
 for the leader he could throw from here we want 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.030
 many countries have left it must find the butterflies that to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.750
 different techniques are scared 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.420
 the party hostis 1-0 of the troop 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.860
 in e1 I did not know how we can break a car window in what 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.230
 is youtube internet 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.430
 I do not think we will take it and the right to do this type of study must 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.150
 think what can we do 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.860
 for 100 milliliters the busy bettencourt that's what is 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.540
 interesting 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.280
 and what can we do we can fall in any case with the contribution of 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.220
 unhappy people asked to recover the value the local is a lot less 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.079
 risky is much simpler does not always have to wait 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.729
 the problem here are names are referenced elsewhere to equip 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.579
 both internet questionnaires on the results so you have 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.119
 answered by a turntable for that meaning 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.240
 we can use it on the not not yet exploited in a few seconds 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.100
 a few clicks back to this except that even for some even have 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.100
 took place the principle is simple it's not harder for me by the way 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.309
 arnaud note that I think we were difficult to recover his crown 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.309
 our blues which is really interesting 25% series 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:33.239
 she could not ignore that there were info papers beyond the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.950
 information about this acquis which was not a dream 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.480
 the easily not found there were 10% of recurring problems and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.010
 all the information needed to impersonate the identity in one 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.360
 time 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.940
 example they can for you introduced by the wind carries a pretty 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.699
 goal on a head shot series social security number ares 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:55.149
 only the checkbook and development this rare especially 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:03:00.079
 especially the main role birth to adolescence in addition to the short I 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.549
 think we can understand it 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.939
 sushi 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.749
 only to engage players not scientific modelica inseparable 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.010
 sometimes a credit card center these are things that will have to 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.069
 shell out like that authenty our identity no 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.059
 it's good for us 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:20.479
 yet at the beginning of mixed world of ps turned at the beginning quite the 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.380
 same thing at the beginning of the awareness what a success 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.490
 to the question constitutes the largest of France counted at the beginning of making 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.969
 awareness of the phenomenon 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:30.969
 but the phenomenon and raptors winning a victory 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
 he was proud of his children 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:40.629
 a civil war as I count as a solution with impunity when we 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.829
 takes the goal more and more 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.519
 moment we know it 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.009
 relative foreign language proficiency 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.969
 10 it can not do like that + could we be done if there is not a membership 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.259
 our society
