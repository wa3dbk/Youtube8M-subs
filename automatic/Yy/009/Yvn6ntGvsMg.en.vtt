00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
 when electronics first started
computers<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:55.920> forth<00:00:56.159> you<00:00:56.249> had<00:00:56.399> these<00:00:56.550> big

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
computers and so forth you had these big

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.079 
computers and so forth you had these big
bulky<00:00:57.030> vacuum<00:00:57.059> tubes<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.909> then

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
bulky vacuum tubes you know and then

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.910 
bulky vacuum tubes you know and then
eventually<00:01:00.390> move<00:01:00.749> on<00:01:00.929> transistors<00:01:01.559> which

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
eventually move on transistors which

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.180 
eventually move on transistors which
were<00:01:02.039> also<00:01:02.370> great<00:01:02.899> but<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.650> integrated

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
were also great but the integrated

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.640 
were also great but the integrated
circuit<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:06.210> very<00:01:06.450> important<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.350> was

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
circuit was very important I it was

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310 
circuit was very important I it was
developed<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> 50s<00:01:08.940> right<00:01:09.690> but<00:01:10.200> by

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
developed in the in the 50s right but by

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the time the 70s came along it was

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
the time the 70s came along it was
actually<00:01:12.060> getting<00:01:12.210> cheap<00:01:12.450> enough<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.870> stick

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
primitive but pretty cool all the time I

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.110

brightness of the different LEDs you

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.800 
brightness of the different LEDs you
really<00:03:48.489> have<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.730> be<00:03:48.820> able<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.030> tell<00:03:49.270> which<00:03:49.510> one
