00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.350
 chess or in the network why today is not 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.230
 Sneaks no fish no matter how humble 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.390
 be when the thing gets ugly closes 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.390
 well fists pray to whoever cares 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 of his compis the strongest in the fight 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.630
 Teach your teeth and protect your 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.330
 plot I think I'm learning 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.530
 soon to live in a town and not have 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.510
 silly hair 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.640
 roman to be better in a moment what 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.370
 dismounted and sent him to take it for ass 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.560
 well away from the rubble today of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.080
 awoken in a bad mood so I do not give 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.300
 message in this letter only hardcore 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.820
 I turn the volume on until I stay 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.100
 deaf writing beautiful letters in a 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.710
 computer on a rhythm that gives 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.290
 stomp on the reader but today it does not give me 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.600
 It's a pity that they rot everything while they're 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.509
 well mine to give to the world if you 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.280
 were a few everything would be better but 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.770
 I have to learn that I am good and not 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.830
 I am God and still flying high raze 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.060
 with everything every day more street more but 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.880
 of my abrupt 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.979
 and what's around me if you've 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.320
 seen when I pick up the micro and upload as much 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.970
 high and balls like the alien attacked 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.310
 by the predator if you have seen me a 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.200
 Saturday night throws a drunk and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.210
 and to your camel that his drug is good there 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.520
 to see you cheap though sometimes this 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.100
 it's expensive for every phrase that spits out 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.720
 cool and 30 more to criticize it but what 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.549
 that you feel inside you always have to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.860
 tell it and those who talk from behind 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.320
 they defecate their vocabulary speak shit and 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.179
 well they have the breath I know it's cubes 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.490
 roses with thorns and that's why I'm 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.959
 happy I know I try hard and I 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.610
 I keep cool 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.619
 I know that the difficulty of the level is 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.410
 keep it but I think I'm ready 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.290
 for this why I'm going with my 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.540
 drums boxes and texts I'm not new here 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.060
 although he arrived and I surprise you with something that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.670
 it sounds classic like the nintendo in this 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.680
 attacked with this I defend myself and I do so 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.610
 deluxe that many want to see me dead 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.850
 in hell 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.010
 but as long as he does not die in the rap attempt 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.320
 24/7 I represent I am spirit torment 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.540
 I try not to screw up so as not to say what 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.640
 I feel I think well what to say and so 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.800
 I never regret there is not something that 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.630
 fuck more than boredom I'm a 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.030
 headache that is always in 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.310
 movement I encourage hip hop culture 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.890
 with feeling I say it with my heart 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.020
 in the beating hand it is not convenient to talk 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.730
 nobody's bad with the micro open because 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.830
 here you record everything you can what 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.930
 listen to hundreds I'm an uncle 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.730
 animated at the same time that seriously what there is 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 is what you hear is crazy here there is no 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.950
 mystery this is my moment to create 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.310
 an empire rapping from the cradle to 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.310
 the cemetery 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.440
 do not 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 Y
