see<00:01:17.360> I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
see I

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.270 
see I
it<00:01:18.790> leads<00:01:19.060> me<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.450> believe<00:01:19.480> that<00:01:20.170> there<00:01:21.100> are<00:01:21.220> a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
it leads me to believe that there are a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.010 
it leads me to believe that there are a
number<00:01:21.310> of<00:01:21.700> things<00:01:21.910> that<00:01:22.060> have<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.420> be<00:01:22.450> done<00:01:22.750> to

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
number of things that have to be done to

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.110 
number of things that have to be done to
get<00:01:23.140> this<00:01:23.350> going<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:23.920> think<00:01:24.520> there's<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.850> problem

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
get this going I think there's a problem

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.190 
get this going I think there's a problem
with<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.420> software<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.940> chip<00:01:28.240> that

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
with the software in the chip that

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.410 
with the software in the chip that
handles<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.740> phone<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.310> think<00:01:31.000> there's<00:01:31.270> a

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
handles the phone I think there's a

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.910 
handles the phone I think there's a
problem<00:01:31.720> with<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.020> software<00:01:32.530> there<00:01:32.800> might<00:01:32.890> be

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
problem with the software there might be

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.740 
problem with the software there might be
it's<00:01:33.130> probably<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:33.670> software<00:01:34.090> on<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.510> phone

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
it's probably the software on the phone

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.530 
it's probably the software on the phone
itself<00:01:35.190> inside<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.580> know<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.850> memory<00:01:37.180> and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
itself inside you know the memory and

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.110 
itself inside you know the memory and
the<00:01:37.900> operating<00:01:38.470> system<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.190> there<00:01:39.820> may<00:01:39.940> be<00:01:39.970> a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
the operating system and there may be a

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.170 
the operating system and there may be a
problem<00:01:40.360> with<00:01:40.720> 18<00:01:41.170> th<00:01:41.470> 3g<00:01:41.830> which<00:01:42.700> may<00:01:42.880> not<00:01:43.060> be

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
problem with 18 th 3g which may not be

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.120 
problem with 18 th 3g which may not be
able<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.450> handle<00:01:43.570> where<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.710> are<00:01:44.860> standing

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
and I be able to handle below so it's a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.540 
and I be able to handle below so it's a
problem<00:01:49.900> but<00:01:50.530> there<00:01:50.860> are<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.040> lot<00:01:51.280> of<00:01:51.310> people
