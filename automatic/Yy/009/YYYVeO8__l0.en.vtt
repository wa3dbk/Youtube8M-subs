00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.300
 Alonzo girls Schiesser Max 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.130
 and I'm not alone today because I have a request or a booking 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.710
 Bid by Anne Sinclair means to make Wahle comment on Red 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.289
 Accordingly, we will comment on this money today times for two Hello 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.960
 People are there then that's what they want and thank you so much 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 Answer out 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.850
 yes, in the end, you just noticed me because I was a bit like that 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.150
 every now and then look what is there for new commentators and 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.280
 Black Ops got it out and then of course you immediately noticed 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.220
 Year also just tells a brief rainstorm about poets with mine 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.790
 People also get to know me a bit 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.580
 So I am Jawad Sitcom from near Frankfurt 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.940
 Ahmann and I like his table Zacher three weeks percent Gamper videos 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.629
 Starting with Coty will cost around 500 more time 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.870
 Kurt Beck and Thorsten is our view of the whole going to buy in one fell swoop 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.080
 but can out 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.200
 to have had good here at betterplace p 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.930
 and Jan Kaden 26 and yes in the Rain CII industry 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.939
 Uwe Bimek, so to speak, the game more than 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.010
 a very bad lawfulness 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.130
 Jakob Jung looking people from you here a FIFA all so Peters there is today 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.840
 no for especially with Celler Schott Garden 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.270
 for one reason 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.890
 because the man looks so far he's been there a lot of day a gameplay appeared there 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.280
 are quite a lot of soldiers are willing to learn has quite a bit of my opinion 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.940
 short 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.310
 Orbit Channel's also and a few others 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.780
 Gameplay videos with the shock not only from me 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.250
 and star 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.990
 that went pretty well renovate Wars Peter Schott Gallert and Valentin Wirz 2 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.480
 were very big so that is recognizable and now in the Jar Sandino Ribery 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.240
 weapons 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.140
 which I also gave good millers 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.380
 So it makes sense to make sense if you look at it 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.790
 that you're in the middle of Modern Warfare 2 the complete shock of winning 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.900
 Could have been embarrassing because of this 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.740
 can definitely do the same and then if we empty first weapon then 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.810
 was it at the same time on the second between can and then what exactly then 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 just as strong a weapon I say 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.500
 from the beach in the end the pass on racing games Nunner still has it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.050
 an extremely strong Lingen as Secondary and then nobody else looks 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.950
 what has crystallized for you so far from so hip 2011 class 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.950
 as you say you just like to take it with it is now right 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.939
 what did this happen to a lot of people like that acacia 70? 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.929
 Bug Tillich said it and pretty well especially if you have a fire 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.619
 Doctor takes for free advertising 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:42.189
 All this is for those who like to play offensively like a bit 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.119
 Wash it is definitely recommended 11 clock is it then 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:50.139
 Space Fire Japan must say the game providers in the basement Sion 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:55.499
 and now where should I have me is often something positive step downright 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.309
 so to speak, she just did not drag on bigelow he's got Melig over 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.869
 but as standard poors for you thus 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.659
 So in Mersin like most of all, I'm usually tall first or offline 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.710
 Percent and this most often save costs already by doing so 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.259
 me he that we are pretty fast minutes 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.539
 just by the fact that you show up on Christmas Eve and the 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.219
 They are super super before sole combination especially the muffler 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.289
 History it yes and Honda pulled the third goal when difficult for me too 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.529
 you want to find me the man but still has no effect and Opel 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.059
 Marton must do what appeals to me the most 9 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.309
 Marathon year marathon or bar which is quite good that Hayes hacker if ever 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:37.609
 not Hammerstein 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.029
 Marathon is year it is difficult as a third point because there is a lot of something 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.579
 Avionics Mirror Diesel bring this yes it is in which it means in German 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.129
 this protective mask hectic in the Bavarian it is exactly this brake 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.019
 those of gas masks or themselves like me too unfortunately 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.620
 not the german version so i can only use the indian terms 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.659
 would have to replace more solomo 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.810
 Bold of which he is so general should he have that here is a scene 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.659
 seen or acted hastily because they are better for the game into the game 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.399
 some people were on rainforest 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.999
 but so are Life's command once again softened to that 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.329
 ruling Hamas 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.719
 So Sandell Fi announced that they want to do something 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.989
 To what extent does she consider the percent year of Marko Kon 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.380
 the community manager Tears and writes on where in form as presented 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.620
 Ruth was a constant what it us project nor that stands with the knife 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.690
 Trailer Partners and what do you have to look like 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.400
 far as she really translates, van Zon already tells a lot about the past 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.479
 SK kills but where almost has to say they are faster than that 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:40.990
 now came 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.090
 I do not think so about Infinity Wars 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.700
 so that's true she is not talented for the other patches and for that 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:48.680
 he will not be anymore 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.340
 Namur was on the subject anyway excite the hired place that I am 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.620
 what's right Eisler screw up how he feels this but finally 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.479
 once the knife or even the percent 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.529
 it is called in German for comparisons car SCK SPOX cars jammed so that 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:07.569
 meets us car 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.669
 what do you have to the sports author with him somehow every three seconds 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.529
 I have the feeling that the people underestimated all hardliners witness 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.990
 and then it is always called in which you Sieker yield of the Union raised 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.029
 and then it goes boom and I'm gone 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.939
 I find 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.289
 I know that we have a nice idea 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.200
 in medicine even at the time of the yen I do not know 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.580
 yes that is has to say especially since there are still many Mappus I have 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.210
 read the shortcut just for this he went to Midtown Gezer jumped this 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.569
 Jump the women so carefully 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:40.740
 Close the 40th what it says for you, I'll say the most optimal Vormann 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.199
 it is not so what many may not know 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.099
 The door itself is no longer on top of each other since I joined 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.659
 my previous speaker on the 5th 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.319
 the CDA Löchtermann Harrier and then means opera or what do I know it is 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.439
 so he has to work himself 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:57.900
 Innauer especially liked the front for not always correct that the 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.910
 Opponent sees that was knows where to be 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.200
 Of course, this is the first time to take that pipeline 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.770
 Reconnaissance plane that massive 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.259
 yes, and what I underestimate because that is where it is 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.199
 Blackbox 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.169
 So the coffin lid chic 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.740
 Year is 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.150
 It may have been a bit like being your Ideas I'm on the 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.770
 Flood something can shoot with 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.919
 that is not only much better, yes 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.840
 the percent shows the complete opponent stops him as close to point in 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.589
 real time 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:29.679
 and when he talks about Kitzingen I mostly dogs these not stronger 

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:33.979
 because Super ladies Simmel show again at the end what I know very clearly 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:38.789
 a very good that i think i can give you 30% 30 two of yours 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:39.909
 Years exactly right 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:43.050
 Jan definitely played well around 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.340
 i definitely want to show the tool can come and um 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.629
 who will be cool 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.380
 My people think it's best to drop by a channel 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.850
 in Auschwitz and in reverse I would also like my pie Baba 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.879
 Romans look over the prelude 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.949
 and that's heads in, I'm doing exactly 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:04.330
 okay but then Mixa is "from my side hello and 2 8 percent to im 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.939
 last word, so to speak 

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.099
 yes what probably until the next bath Vöslau
