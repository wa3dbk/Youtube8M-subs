00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.960
 all as many of you have me 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.849
 asked what I was eating during the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.349
 day I thought that instead of me 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.240
 put in front of a pc to enumerate what 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.670
 who was my food day 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
 I was going to take you with me 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.330
 throughout the day to show you 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.369
 practice what I eat and I see in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.470
 a whole day at the we are 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.890
 Wednesday morning I prepared myself three 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.300
 sports it's 8 o'clock so before dello 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 sport I take a drink 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.489
 nutritional in the form of checks 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 like these which contains little 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.969
 calories but who will give me the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.149
 vitamins and the protein needed to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.789
 feel good about energy and for 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 do not be hungry so I will also 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.840
 carried with me a big bottle 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 of water with a tea-based drink that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.230
 will also give me energy when 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.300
 not bad to burn more calories 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.989
 here I give you an appointment after my 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.989
 sports session 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.840
 so here I am back from my session 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.850
 during which I drank 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.009
 my early bottle with tea so that 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.960
 must do about 650 mhz and the lines 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.280
 of water is frozen already filled for 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.110
 to be able to continue drinking water 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.119
 during my day I will try to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:36.229
 show you on mom that the result 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:39.579
 of my sport session we will see that I 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.579
 I trained two hours 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.400
 I took the 8 163 calories during 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.420
 this session 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.340
 so here is the moment that I prefer 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.100
 after massaged on the sport it's my 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.180
 recovery check so it is 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.580
 important when you play sports 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.560
 also eat well and a check 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.850
 is a form of liquid protein that is going 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.190
 could you just be able to 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.650
 rebuild your muscle that small to 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.200
 little will get stronger and so will you 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.690
 help burn more calories for me 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.150
 i love to dry that are really great 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.330
 good the mare prepare to the press I 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.600
 will show you his cold one- third of 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.370
 bananas the che converting strawberries I 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.650
 will mix all this added 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.230
 classes have remixed and I find you 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.470
 just after and that's the result 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.700
 a delicious home hic so he is 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.560
 advised when one does sport of 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.180
 take your home in the twenty 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.830
 minutes after exercise 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.880
 if possible this is the way he 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.730
 will be the most effective 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.830
 so I will continue to hydrate myself well 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.410
 bench all day there so it's 11 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.470
 hours i'm going to enjoy it's handle and I 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:57.580
 you find for the next meal we 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:03:00.040
 is small it is now 14:30 and I 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.660
 have just prepared my case so they 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.340
 have the body to eat regularly in 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.380
 day normally every three 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.450
 hours is why we prefer to be 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.209
 his five small meals rather than three 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.280
 big meals a day so I 'm going to you 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.280
 show what I prepared for my case 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.180
 so that each case should contain 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.540
 the protein so here you have a yacht 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.080
 0% then the ideal would be to have a 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.120
 yoghurt without fruits and mix oneself 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.800
 even the fruits in it but it's 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.590
 impossible to find here in the philippines 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.140
 so I do with what I have I got 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:46.660
 prepared a half lack and a hot tea 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.660
 in terms of the amount of water that 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.290
 close like this is actually I am 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.090
 in all day 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.090
 so I've already seen one this morning 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.010
 during my sports station and on the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.320
 remaining of the day until now 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.600
 we cash in I saw a second and 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.239
 the bottle count to 750 mhz and the 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.400
 liters so here I leave you I'll 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:16.400
 sample my inquiry and we end up 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.500
 just now it's 18 hours and 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.620
 while I prepare not see him I 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.330
 take my vegetable juice to the 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.800
 difference with the days I do not do 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.760
 of sport is that I also start 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.919
 in the morning by a vegetable juice and is 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.210
 also so often how do I do 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.950
 their borrowed pages of m 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.350
 but as today I was at sport 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.030
 in the morning I first took the drink 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.710
 nutritional that gives me more 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.390
 energy 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:47.030
 so I'm cooking j you 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:49.280

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.860
 with ginger and sweet potatoes which is 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.240
 cooking and I will continue to 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.970
 Cook the meal 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.200

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.200

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:16.850
 their ring we're going to eat 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:19.730
 so soup and press selah sue to 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.760

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.990
 superb 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:34.250
 my chicken is cooking and for 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:38.140
 that closely so I would just put you 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.140
 after a fault of rock not served 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.249
 here we finished the eat I 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.629
 you find in this last video 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:54.009
 to tell you about the water it is 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:55.090
 really very important to drink 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.069
 enough water 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.469
 so it is advisable to drink at 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:00.610
 minimum one and a half liters of water a day 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.379
 per person 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.330
 in fact to be more correct we 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:06.090
 should count one liter of water per 40 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.050
 kg of body weight 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.060
 personally I use the bottle 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.659
 that I showed you and so I drink 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.919
 nearly 8.3 a day now what 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.449
 you can do if you find that 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.849
 easier you can use the 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:22.090
 large glasses 250 milliliters and in 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.650
 drink one before and after each meal or 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.569
 then use the small bottles 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.159
 of 500 milliliters water you know that 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.439
 you must have one in the morning and in 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.710
 afternoon and evening 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:34.300
 so here for the day I hope 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.639

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.229
