compression<00:00:36.809> slows<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.260> down<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:39.860> found<00:00:40.860> a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
compression slows you down I found a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.729 
compression slows you down I found a
carburetor<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.690> fitted<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.649> when

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
carburetor that fitted this because when

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.400 
carburetor that fitted this because when
I<00:00:43.800> found<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.309> didn't<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> carburetor<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
it has a return spring because the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.420 
it has a return spring because the
