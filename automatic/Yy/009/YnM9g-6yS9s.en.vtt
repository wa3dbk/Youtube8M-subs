00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
steering wheel the dash pad does have a

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
steering wheel the dash pad does have a
headliner<00:00:49.269> which<00:00:49.510> is<00:00:49.629> surprising<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
headliner which is surprising and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.410 
headliner which is surprising and
overall<00:00:53.949> it's<00:00:54.129> got<00:00:54.280> pretty<00:00:54.609> decent<00:00:54.760> interior

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
in it the odometer says 91,000 122 so

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.850 
in it the odometer says 91,000 122 so
I'm<00:01:14.650> gonna<00:01:15.010> guess<00:01:15.930> 191<00:01:19.260> driver<00:01:20.260> side<00:01:20.590> meter

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
I'm gonna guess 191 driver side meter

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.660 
I'm gonna guess 191 driver side meter
off<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.430> put<00:01:21.580> on<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.820> other<00:01:21.940> car<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:24.400> all

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
doing some customization it - here's the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.690 
doing some customization it - here's the
hood

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
hood

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.680 
hood
that<00:04:31.700> was<00:04:31.820> on<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.000> 88<00:04:37.030> pretty<00:04:38.030> straight<00:04:38.420> hood

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
that was on the 88 pretty straight hood

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.600 
that was on the 88 pretty straight hood
except<00:04:39.170> they've<00:04:39.350> got<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> big<00:04:39.980> old<00:04:40.160> hole<00:04:40.340> in<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
except they've got a big old hole in the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.740 
except they've got a big old hole in the
center<00:04:40.910> of<00:04:40.940> it<00:04:42.640> which<00:04:43.640> is<00:04:43.850> probably<00:04:44.510> why<00:04:44.690> the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
center of it which is probably why the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.320 
center of it which is probably why the
motor<00:04:45.440> has<00:04:45.740> rust<00:04:46.070> in<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.400> they<00:04:46.790> probably<00:04:47.090> left

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
motor has rust in it they probably left

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.060 
motor has rust in it they probably left
it<00:04:47.540> uncovered<00:04:49.270> it's<00:04:50.270> got<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.530> pretty<00:04:51.530> big<00:04:51.800> being

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
it uncovered it's got a pretty big being

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.230 
it uncovered it's got a pretty big being
right<00:04:52.490> there<00:04:52.730> but<00:04:53.150> if<00:04:53.300> all<00:04:53.450> things<00:04:53.720> go<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.110> plan

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
right there but if all things go to plan
