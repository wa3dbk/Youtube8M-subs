as I wind down the days here at Aoife in

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.579 
as I wind down the days here at Aoife in
Berlin<00:00:02.879> 2014<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.720> wanted<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.049> bring<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.380> one

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
Berlin 2014 I wanted to bring you one

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.050 
Berlin 2014 I wanted to bring you one
that<00:00:04.740> you<00:00:04.859> guys<00:00:05.040> were<00:00:05.190> requesting<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:05.910> to

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
that you guys were requesting and to

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.960 
that you guys were requesting and to
look<00:00:06.180> at<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.480> Xperia<00:00:07.020> z3<00:00:07.319> versus<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.309> Xperia

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
look at the Xperia z3 versus the Xperia

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.589 
look at the Xperia z3 versus the Xperia
z2<00:00:13.460> now<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.519> will<00:00:14.790> obviously<00:00:15.000> start<00:00:15.420> with

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
z2 now we will obviously start with

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.109 
z2 now we will obviously start with
design<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.800> where<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.279> z3<00:00:17.580> has<00:00:17.940> its

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
design but that is where the z3 has its

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.570 
design but that is where the z3 has its
main<00:00:18.300> upgrades<00:00:18.840> over<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> Xperia<00:00:19.680> z2<00:00:19.890> as<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
main upgrades over the Xperia z2 as the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.160 
main upgrades over the Xperia z2 as the
list<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.240> bit<00:00:21.449> short<00:00:21.720> when<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> comes

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
list is a little bit short when it comes

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.330 
list is a little bit short when it comes
to<00:00:22.289> talking<00:00:22.410> about<00:00:22.800> what<00:00:22.949> has<00:00:23.070> really<00:00:23.250> changed

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to talking about what has really changed

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.609 
to talking about what has really changed
from<00:00:23.760> one<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.119> other<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.170> z3<00:00:25.380> as

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
from one to the other but the z3 as

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
from one to the other but the z3 as
design<00:00:25.920> does<00:00:26.189> bring<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.730> much<00:00:27.150> rounder<00:00:27.599> look

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
design does bring a much rounder look

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
design does bring a much rounder look
much<00:00:28.529> softer<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> sides<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
much softer on the sides and in the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.939 
much softer on the sides and in the
frame<00:00:30.179> mostly<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.260> does<00:00:31.470> give<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.679> less

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
frame mostly and that does give it less

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.580 
frame mostly and that does give it less
rigidity<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:33.059> found<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.809> Xperia<00:00:34.350> z2

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
rigidity as was found in the Xperia z2

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
rigidity as was found in the Xperia z2
though<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> wasn't<00:00:35.370> uncomfortable<00:00:36.090> by<00:00:36.390> any

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
though it wasn't uncomfortable by any

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
though it wasn't uncomfortable by any
means<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.620> even<00:00:38.040> better<00:00:38.219> now<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
means it just is even better now on the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
means it just is even better now on the
z3<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.140> still<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> ports<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
z3 you do get still the ports on the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.700 
z3 you do get still the ports on the
sides<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.790> after<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.809> design<00:00:43.079> mostly

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
sides and after that the design mostly

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500 
sides and after that the design mostly
stays<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> same<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.789> will<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
stays about the same we will have a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410 
stays about the same we will have a
better<00:00:45.809> look<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.890> front<00:00:47.850> facing<00:00:48.000> speakers

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
better look at the front facing speakers

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.910 
better look at the front facing speakers
here<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> little<00:00:49.469> bit<00:00:49.620> smaller

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
here as they are a little bit smaller

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
here as they are a little bit smaller
they're<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> way<00:00:50.789> flush<00:00:51.120> into<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
they're not all the way flush into the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.750 
they're not all the way flush into the
very<00:00:51.750> lines<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> phone<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.579> should

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
very lines of the phone and they should

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.220 
very lines of the phone and they should
still<00:00:53.969> provide<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> pretty<00:00:54.390> good<00:00:54.690> sound

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
still provide a pretty good sound

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
still provide a pretty good sound
performance<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
performance but from there it is a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.010 
performance but from there it is a
little<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:57.840> lighter<00:00:58.079> does<00:00:58.530> e3<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.039> 152<00:00:59.940> grams

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
little bit lighter does e3 is 152 grams

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.029 
little bit lighter does e3 is 152 grams
it's<00:01:01.020> something<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> will<00:01:01.649> feel<00:01:01.920> when

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it's something that you will feel when

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
it's something that you will feel when
you<00:01:02.160> compare<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.359> most<00:01:03.510> part<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you compare but for the most part the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
you compare but for the most part the
feel<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> weight<00:01:04.559> still<00:01:04.949> still<00:01:05.430> feels

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
feel and the weight still still feels

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.850 
feel and the weight still still feels
pretty<00:01:05.760> much<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.990> z3<00:01:07.170> underneath

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pretty much the same the z3 underneath

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.969 
pretty much the same the z3 underneath
the<00:01:08.010> surface<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.090> 1920<00:01:09.930> by<00:01:10.049> 1080<00:01:10.560> P

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the surface has that 1920 by 1080 P

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.280 
the surface has that 1920 by 1080 P

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
resolution screen at 5.2 inches which is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
resolution screen at 5.2 inches which is
largely<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> same<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:14.070> before<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.790> still

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
largely the same as before and still

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
largely the same as before and still
brings<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> same<00:01:15.840> great<00:01:16.200> performance<00:01:16.950> with

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
brings the same great performance with

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
brings the same great performance with
the<00:01:17.520> triluminos<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.240> x-reality<00:01:18.600> engine<00:01:19.259> but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the triluminos and x-reality engine but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.530 
the triluminos and x-reality engine but
also<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> viewing<00:01:20.700> angles<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.180> also<00:01:21.299> about

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
also the viewing angles are also about

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.880 
also the viewing angles are also about
the<00:01:21.689> same<00:01:21.900> which<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.409> already<00:01:22.650> been

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the same which they have already been

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.410 
the same which they have already been
improved<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> z2<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> continue<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> be

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
improved in the z2 and continue to be

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.780 
improved in the z2 and continue to be
just<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.780> good<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.080> z3<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.250> Snapdragon

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
just as good in the z3 the Snapdragon

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 
just as good in the z3 the Snapdragon
801<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.450> 2.5<00:01:28.110> gigahertz<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> get

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
801 now at 2.5 gigahertz is what you get

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160 
801 now at 2.5 gigahertz is what you get
here<00:01:29.369> along<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.640> 16<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.360> 32<00:01:30.720> gigabytes<00:01:31.079> of

storage and three gigabytes of RAM so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.149 
storage and three gigabytes of RAM so
you<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.439> pretty<00:01:34.710> much<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> same

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you will have pretty much the same

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800 
you will have pretty much the same
performance<00:01:35.400> package<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.420> already<00:01:36.659> knew

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
performance package but we already knew

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
Xperia line for quite a while so that's

Xperia line for quite a while so that's
just<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.540> closer<00:02:33.900> look<00:02:34.260> at<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> Sony<00:02:34.830> Xperia

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
just this closer look at the Sony Xperia

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.970 
just this closer look at the Sony Xperia
z3<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.790> compared<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> z2<00:02:36.870> yes<00:02:37.470> we<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:37.830> have

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
z3 one compared to the z2 yes we do have

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.710 
z3 one compared to the z2 yes we do have
a<00:02:38.040> 6-month<00:02:38.490> release<00:02:38.790> cycle<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.420> doesn't

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
a 6-month release cycle but that doesn't

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.060 
a 6-month release cycle but that doesn't
mean<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.170> aren't<00:02:40.350> some<00:02:40.560> enhancements

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
mean that there aren't some enhancements
