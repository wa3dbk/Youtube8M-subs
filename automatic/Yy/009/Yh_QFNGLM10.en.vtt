00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.719 
here's another here's another preset
that's<00:01:57.380> pretty<00:01:57.619> amazing<00:01:57.860> check<00:01:58.549> this<00:01:58.670> out

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
that's pretty amazing check this out

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:42.030 
that's pretty amazing check this out
just<00:02:01.729> like<00:02:01.849> a<00:02:01.880> delay<00:02:02.209> and<00:02:02.479> it's<00:02:02.780> rhythmic

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040

here's<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.099> thing<00:02:43.280> i<00:02:43.400> think<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.849> kind

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
here's the thing i think that that kind

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.759 
here's the thing i think that that kind
of<00:02:44.150> sets<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.540> apart<00:02:44.629> from<00:02:44.840> other<00:02:45.019> like<00:02:45.470> drum

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
of sets it apart from other like drum
