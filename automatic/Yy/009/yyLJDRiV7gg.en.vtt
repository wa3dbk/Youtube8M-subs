00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 you lose products from a pharmacy 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.310
 pedals are created in 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.340
 the friends that we were going to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.099
 to see some points that I want to try this 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.130
 I want to compare griswold 3 with gears of 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.079
 war george me be like beranguer 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.000
 georg mind software has a little 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.640
 more color is not noticed much by me 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.769
 weight capture does not show much 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 difference but good if you play it 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:41.070
 you obviously see the color tones are 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.480
 they see more as more clear more like 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.680
 with more light I do not know how to say it but 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.360
 well I also want to see some small 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.869
 details about some weapons for example 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 Ian yesterday is worth two things, that is, 

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:59.640
 ok so you ching on this other 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 ching that language but that is no no no 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 has the same power as in the stew 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.250
 war 2 in gears of war 3 in the software 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.549
 of one I do not know the truth is that it is worth 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.100
 pure mother this guy who practically 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.570
 you have to give three shots with one 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.759
 shotgun to be able to kill someone 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.009
 because if you do not kill him 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.450
 neither are there active then it's worth to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 pure mother 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.130
 and also the good lancer the throw east 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.380
 the difference the three software x 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.719
 balances does not hurt so much anymore 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.280
 down a whole team like I did not 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.170
 in the war 3 course 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.450
 right now you have to spend 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.800
 a bunch of bullets to be able to kill 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.580
 someone 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.790
 and this good also what they do not put 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.180
 as I do not know if you have noticed this 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.280
 but if not good, I tell you there is no 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.610
 retro lancer and in the game mode this 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 or watercress 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.250
 I really do not know why they did not put it and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.960
 good because it would be good forts ah 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.470
 but good as they saw the cropped 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.200
 and this is also this I suppose it has 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.619
 a little less power than in the stew 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.740
 guard 3 but hey it's still ego castrated 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.250
 chair because unlike the angel with 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.270
 a bullet you finish it you kill but good 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.910
 you also have to be very close 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.920
 because obviously if you do it as an average 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.830
 distance but obviously you do not do it 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.070
 nothing or you have to occupy your two 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.410
 shotgun bullets and well this would be in 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.330
 about weapons and how to know urban 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.250
 as we know or berrones as the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.870
 combination of horde versus beast this 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.420
 here obviously they have to be a lot 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.360
 Teamwork is how guard has 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.730
 that see many communications have you 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.790
 what to see has to balance well 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.330
 the plays the characters they choose 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.690
 to be able to have this a doctor 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.420
 this also have to which it crosses us 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.520
 the bullets to recover ammunition and 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.680
 well these two are very 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.530
 important in doctor and the one who recovers 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.800
 the ammunition because if not then if there is not 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.680
 like who there is not there is not much much 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.450
 control in the game and you can lose by 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.730
 get to lose the truth myself with some 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.470
 friends all the study we have when everything 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.720
 the day and we did not lose any at 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.010
 same that you gave us we distributed 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.170
 well the characters I forgive in this me 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.810
 as they speak as they will be they will realize in 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.510
 this in this this comparison first 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.319
 I chose 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:39.340
 edges to look like as if help 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.220
 the truth enough support your allies 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.000
 to be able to regenerate this their lives and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.420
 good also occupy another one another 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.010
 character for now yes that for 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.769
 more or less distinguish what benefits 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.629
 of you have when choosing a campus or more 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.000
 well what benefits does it have to choose 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.010
 OK your characters for this mode 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.689
 because as I repeat, this mode has 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.090
 to be teamwork if there's no 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.620
 Teamwork is nothing nothing 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.989
 they will not win 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.599
 let's say you can win but you're going to 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.489
 cost a lot of work is going to cost you 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.010
 a lot of work and good also has to 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.810
 see the time when you finish a round 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:25.389
 all that and well this the truth to me the 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.220
 the modality of the good movement 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.680
 of the characters I was made like the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.330
 english howard 2 no it's not like 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.870
 they painted that it was going to be faster than 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.370
 follow software 3 or that this one me in 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.870
 How much do I believe that in terms of 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.470
 mentions may be because nothing else 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.190
 pass 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.790
 well recovery but good obviously 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.790
 no longer you no longer bend down to pick it up if you 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.850
 it caused that they will kill you and pnv and it is not 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.460
 but good to me it made me pretty 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.250
 slow as to what I expected 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.350
 because they obviously painted us 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.770
 make faster than curse of war 3 yo 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.650
 I imagine that they were referring to how 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.770
 that the interaction was not going to be in 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.630
 regarding the mobility of the character but 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.240
 well those are my views I do not know 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.000
 what do you think this what differences 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:19.240
 notice of gears of war 3 gears of wars of 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.720
 George meant and well let's wait 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.250
 another one we go there to March 19 that 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.770
 the gears of war george men for 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.180
 to be able to give our criticism and good not 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.160
 he gave me later I do not know if they are 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.230
 aware of what the vip pass counts 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.840
 but if I'm not going to comment on the other 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.150
 video and well I think that this one I'm going to 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.650
 give some recommendations to buy it if 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.770
 or not until later 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.770
 bye 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.150
 m 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.189
 the heavy artillery 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.819
 Y 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.140
 I will not be 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.720
 do not 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.360
 good 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.419
 no no 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.650
 all right 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.300
