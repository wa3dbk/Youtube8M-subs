00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
I am in my school library I know exactly

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.640 
I am in my school library I know exactly
typed<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.810> just<00:00:27.140> thought<00:00:27.259> I'd<00:00:27.410> give<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:27.560> a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
typed so I just thought I'd give you a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.049 
typed so I just thought I'd give you a
little<00:00:27.769> update<00:00:27.949> I'm<00:00:28.550> Anita<00:00:28.880> and<00:00:29.060> say<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:31.059> that

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
little update I'm Anita and say and that

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.079 
little update I'm Anita and say and that
basically<00:00:32.419> means<00:00:32.540> that<00:00:32.839> I<00:00:33.019> am<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.500> junior<00:00:34.089> but

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.089 
basically means that I am a junior but

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:37.840 
basically means that I am a junior but
technically<00:00:35.960> in<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.440> u.s.<00:00:36.860> I'm<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.190> senior<00:00:37.610> but

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
technically in the u.s. I'm a senior but

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.430 
technically in the u.s. I'm a senior but
they<00:00:38.720> put<00:00:38.989> me<00:00:39.170> in<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.530> second<00:00:39.860> years<00:00:40.100> because

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
they put me in the second years because

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.299 
they put me in the second years because
the<00:00:42.440> third<00:00:42.770> years<00:00:43.100> are<00:00:43.430> all<00:00:43.699> studying<00:00:44.480> for<00:00:45.309> my

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
the third years are all studying for my

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.639 
the third years are all studying for my
god<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.760> big<00:00:46.969> university<00:00:47.809> tests<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.440> stuff

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
god the big university tests and stuff

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.439 
god the big university tests and stuff
so<00:00:49.520> they<00:00:49.699> thought<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:49.969> would<00:00:50.030> be<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.210> better

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
so they thought it would be a better

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.930 
so they thought it would be a better
experience<00:00:51.199> if<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.890> was<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.430> second<00:00:52.760> years

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
experience if I was in the second years

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.220 
experience if I was in the second years
so<00:00:53.629> that<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.289> why<00:00:54.440> there's<00:00:55.370> sometimes<00:00:56.230> school

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
so that is why there's sometimes school

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.910 
so that is why there's sometimes school
on<00:00:57.410> Saturdays<00:00:58.420> but<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.660> don't<00:00:59.870> go<00:01:00.019> physical<00:01:00.859> on

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
on Saturdays but I don't go physical on

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.349 
on Saturdays but I don't go physical on
Saturdays<00:01:01.370> because<00:01:01.699> they<00:01:01.820> didn't<00:01:02.030> give<00:01:02.210> me<00:01:02.329> a

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
Saturdays because they didn't give me a
