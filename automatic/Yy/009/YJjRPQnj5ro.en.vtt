00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.540 
freaking me out Chuck Waggin vol 2 this
was<00:00:15.809> another<00:00:16.049> interesting<00:00:16.590> choice<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.130> kind<00:00:17.520> of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
was another interesting choice I kind of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.550 
was another interesting choice I kind of
like<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.820> Dragon<00:00:18.270> Ball<00:00:18.480> Z<00:00:18.869> I'm<00:00:19.109> sure<00:00:19.320> like<00:00:19.470> I

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
like the Dragon Ball Z I'm sure like I

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.960 
like the Dragon Ball Z I'm sure like I
would<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> think<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.369> would<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.550> been<00:00:20.670> cool<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
would I think it would have been cool to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.179 
would I think it would have been cool to
see<00:00:21.150> like<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.660> figure<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> him<00:00:22.439> from<00:00:22.740> s<00:00:22.830> cultures

the<00:00:43.739> figure<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.410> followed

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the figure right there and it followed

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.400 
the figure right there and it followed
them<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.160> Twitter<00:00:47.489> again<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.660> back<00:00:48.899> here

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
them on Twitter again on the back here

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
them on Twitter again on the back here
at<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> another<00:00:50.129> picture<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> figure<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
at the another picture of the figure and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.619 
at the another picture of the figure and
I<00:00:52.110> guess<00:00:52.289> how<00:00:52.469> they<00:00:52.770> were<00:00:53.210> designing<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.449> or

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I guess how they were designing it or

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
I guess how they were designing it or
making<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> figure<00:00:55.260> right<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.100> more

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
making the figure right there and more

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.990

my<00:01:13.950> Super<00:01:14.189> Saiyan<00:01:14.369> Goku<00:01:14.490> review<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.540> they

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
my Super Saiyan Goku review is that they

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
my Super Saiyan Goku review is that they
come<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.770> two<00:01:17.009> pieces<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.670> come<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> few

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
come in two pieces or they come in a few

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.539 
come in two pieces or they come in a few
pieces<00:01:18.479> each<00:01:18.930> figure<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> Super

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
pieces each figure but but the Super

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.999 
pieces each figure but but the Super
Saiyan<00:01:20.670> Goku<00:01:20.880> he<00:01:21.600> came<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.020> half<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> had

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
Saiyan Goku he came in half and you had

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
Saiyan Goku he came in half and you had
to<00:01:23.130> put<00:01:23.310> his<00:01:23.430> bottom<00:01:23.729> piece<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.060> his<00:01:24.180> top<00:01:24.390> piece

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to put his bottom piece to his top piece

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
to put his bottom piece to his top piece
and<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.049> most<00:01:25.200> annoying<00:01:25.650> thing<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.130> had

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and it was the most annoying thing I had

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.760 
and it was the most annoying thing I had
to<00:01:26.430> possibly<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.659> difficult<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to possibly do it was so difficult it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.560 
to possibly do it was so difficult it
took<00:01:29.100> me<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> lot<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.729> strength<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> put<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
took me a lot of strength to put it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
took me a lot of strength to put it
together<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:31.979> wasn't<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.369> bad<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
together so this one wasn't as bad but

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.490 
together so this one wasn't as bad but
you<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:33.600> his<00:01:33.720> bottom<00:01:34.170> half<00:01:34.320> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you do have to put his bottom half to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.740 
you do have to put his bottom half to
his<00:01:34.590> top<00:01:34.770> half<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.189> well<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.150> gotta<00:01:36.329> have

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
his top half as well and you gotta have

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.539 
his top half as well and you gotta have
some<00:01:36.960> force<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.250> much<00:01:38.400> as
