maybe<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.900> me<00:03:02.080> but<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.800> kind<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.040> looked<00:03:03.190> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
maybe this is me but it kind of looked a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.380 
maybe this is me but it kind of looked a
little<00:03:03.370> bit<00:03:03.580> weird<00:03:03.820> but<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.120> was<00:03:04.209> still

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
little bit weird but it was still

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.030 
little bit weird but it was still
awesome<00:03:04.420> at<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.930> same<00:03:05.080> time<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.590> definitely

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
awesome at the same time and definitely

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.070 
awesome at the same time and definitely
second<00:03:06.670> half<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.000> chapter<00:03:07.450> I'm<00:03:07.630> not<00:03:07.840> least

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
second half of the chapter I'm not least

second half of the chapter I'm not least
the<00:03:08.230> first<00:03:08.440> half<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.800> chapter<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:09.220> was

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
the first half of the chapter it was

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.040 
the first half of the chapter it was
just<00:03:09.520> pretty<00:03:10.150> slow<00:03:10.330> in<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.540> beginning<00:03:10.900> but

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
just pretty slow in the beginning but

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.480 
just pretty slow in the beginning but
overall<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.740> really<00:03:12.070> good<00:03:12.250> chapter

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.150 
overall is a really good chapter
honestly<00:03:13.260> definitely<00:03:14.260> some<00:03:14.440> crazy<00:03:14.739> stuff<00:03:15.130> you

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
honestly definitely some crazy stuff you

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.070 
honestly definitely some crazy stuff you
know<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:15.670> Frankie<00:03:16.180> he's<00:03:16.360> trying<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.660> do<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> move

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080
