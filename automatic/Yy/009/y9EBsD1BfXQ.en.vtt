00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.940 

so<00:00:08.420> today<00:00:08.690> we're<00:00:08.900> going<00:00:08.990> to<00:00:09.080> look<00:00:09.290> at<00:00:09.440> what<00:00:09.830> it

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
so today we're going to look at what it

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.129 
so today we're going to look at what it
takes<00:00:10.190> to<00:00:10.400> get<00:00:10.520> a<00:00:10.580> good<00:00:10.880> stand<00:00:11.180> of<00:00:11.450> alfalfa<00:00:12.110> or

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
takes to get a good stand of alfalfa or

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.710 
takes to get a good stand of alfalfa or
grass<00:00:12.500> some<00:00:13.370> farmers<00:00:13.880> always<00:00:14.120> get<00:00:14.510> good

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:14.720 
grass some farmers always get good

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.540 
grass some farmers always get good
stands<00:00:15.080> and<00:00:15.440> some<00:00:15.650> farmers<00:00:16.099> have<00:00:16.279> more

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
stands and some farmers have more

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.640 
stands and some farmers have more
problems<00:00:16.880> getting<00:00:17.450> good<00:00:17.660> stands<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:18.290> what<00:00:18.500> are

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
problems getting good stands so what are

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.499 
problems getting good stands so what are
the<00:00:18.740> key<00:00:18.950> characteristics<00:00:19.880> that<00:00:20.029> they<00:00:20.240> have

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
the key characteristics that they have

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.140 
the key characteristics that they have
to<00:00:20.750> think<00:00:20.960> about<00:00:21.200> to<00:00:21.590> get<00:00:21.710> a<00:00:21.770> good<00:00:22.039> stand<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.970> be

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
to think about to get a good stand to be

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.029 
to think about to get a good stand to be
able<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.449> end<00:00:23.630> up<00:00:23.840> with<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.050> field<00:00:24.350> like<00:00:24.590> we<00:00:24.830> have

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
able to end up with a field like we have

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.210 
able to end up with a field like we have
behind<00:00:25.279> me<00:00:25.760> here<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.930> important<00:00:27.830> things<00:00:28.100> that

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
behind me here the important things that

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.310 
behind me here the important things that
we<00:00:28.430> have<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.880> think<00:00:29.060> about<00:00:29.420> are<00:00:29.660> first<00:00:29.900> having

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
we have to think about are first having

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.009 
we have to think about are first having
a<00:00:30.410> weed-free<00:00:30.680> stand<00:00:31.310> to<00:00:31.490> start<00:00:31.760> in<00:00:31.989> then<00:00:32.989> to

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:33.019 
a weed-free stand to start in then to

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.070 
a weed-free stand to start in then to
have<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.620> field<00:00:33.890> leveled<00:00:34.510> then<00:00:35.510> to<00:00:35.809> have<00:00:36.019> it

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
have the field leveled then to have it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.400 
have the field leveled then to have it
packed<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:37.309> we<00:00:37.489> have<00:00:37.730> soil<00:00:38.329> that<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.840> firm

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
packed so that we have soil that is firm

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.290 
packed so that we have soil that is firm
and<00:00:39.440> that<00:00:39.800> your<00:00:39.980> soul<00:00:40.219> doesn't<00:00:40.640> sink<00:00:40.880> in<00:00:41.059> more

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
and that your soul doesn't sink in more

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.569 
and that your soul doesn't sink in more
than<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.570> quarter<00:00:41.930> of<00:00:41.989> an<00:00:42.110> inch<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.500> then<00:00:43.340> to

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
than a quarter of an inch and then to

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.869 
than a quarter of an inch and then to
place<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.059> seed<00:00:44.360> at<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:44.660> proper<00:00:45.290> depth<00:00:45.670> as<00:00:46.670> we

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
place the seed at the proper depth as we

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.520 
place the seed at the proper depth as we
long<00:00:47.120> as<00:00:47.329> we<00:00:47.450> pay<00:00:47.690> attention<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:48.290> those

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
long as we pay attention to those

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.819 
long as we pay attention to those
factors<00:00:49.160> we<00:00:49.850> will<00:00:49.879> get<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.270> good<00:00:50.600> stand<00:00:50.960> most<00:00:51.559> of

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
factors we will get a good stand most of

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.889 
factors we will get a good stand most of
the<00:00:51.950> time

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.130 

the<00:00:57.860> first<00:00:58.579> important<00:00:59.180> thing<00:00:59.390> is<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.750> have<00:00:59.930> the

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
the first important thing is to have the

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.160 
the first important thing is to have the
field<00:01:00.440> tilled<00:01:00.829> well<00:01:01.100> as<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:02.270> see<00:01:02.540> behind<00:01:03.020> me

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
field tilled well as you see behind me

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.219 
field tilled well as you see behind me
here<00:01:03.620> we<00:01:03.769> want<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:04.460> have<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.909> weed-free<00:01:05.330> surface

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
here we want to have a weed-free surface

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.469 
here we want to have a weed-free surface
and<00:01:06.470> then<00:01:06.950> we<00:01:07.130> also<00:01:07.340> want<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.880> have<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.299> be

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
and then we also want to have it be

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.680 
and then we also want to have it be
reasonably<00:01:09.110> firm<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.580> sole<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.570> the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
reasonably firm so that the sole of the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.660 
reasonably firm so that the sole of the
shoe<00:01:11.720> does<00:01:12.259> not<00:01:12.470> sink<00:01:12.860> in<00:01:13.070> more<00:01:13.369> than<00:01:13.550> a

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
shoe does not sink in more than a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.050 
shoe does not sink in more than a
quarter<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.149> an<00:01:14.420> inch<00:01:15.220> if<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.490> soil<00:01:16.820> is<00:01:17.030> too

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
quarter of an inch if the soil is too

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.120 
quarter of an inch if the soil is too
loose<00:01:17.540> then<00:01:17.990> when<00:01:18.200> we<00:01:18.320> put<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.680> seed<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
loose then when we put the seed in the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.940 
loose then when we put the seed in the
soil<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:20.090> seed<00:01:20.330> does<00:01:20.630> not<00:01:20.840> have<00:01:21.110> good<00:01:21.350> contact

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
soil the seed does not have good contact

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.649 
soil the seed does not have good contact
with<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.220> soil<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.729> won't<00:01:22.970> take<00:01:23.210> up<00:01:23.420> water

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
with the soil and won't take up water

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.380 
with the soil and won't take up water
and<00:01:23.930> we<00:01:24.200> get<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> poor<00:01:24.710> stand<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:25.340> packing<00:01:26.270> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
and we get a poor stand so packing the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.249 
and we get a poor stand so packing the
soil<00:01:26.659> around<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.530> seed<00:01:27.830> is<00:01:28.190> crucial

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.899 

the<00:01:33.619> second<00:01:34.039> thing<00:01:34.219> that<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:34.460> want<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.759> pay

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
the second thing that we want to pay

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.029 
the second thing that we want to pay
attention<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.450> then<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.899> appropriate<00:01:36.560> seating

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
attention to then is appropriate seating

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.929 
attention to then is appropriate seating
depth<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:38.229> what<00:01:39.229> we<00:01:39.380> are<00:01:39.530> looking<00:01:39.950> at<00:01:40.159> is<00:01:40.700> that

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
depth and what we are looking at is that

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.380 
depth and what we are looking at is that
we<00:01:41.630> want<00:01:42.340> alfalfa<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.399> grasses<00:01:43.939> in<00:01:44.210> that

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
we want alfalfa and grasses in that

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.660 
we want alfalfa and grasses in that
quarter<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.049> half-inch<00:01:45.530> range<00:01:45.979> in<00:01:46.280> most<00:01:46.520> of

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
quarter to half-inch range in most of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.969 
quarter to half-inch range in most of
our<00:01:46.819> soils<00:01:47.030> we<00:01:47.780> can<00:01:47.899> go<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.049> little<00:01:48.140> bit<00:01:48.439> deeper

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
our soils we can go a little bit deeper

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.580 
our soils we can go a little bit deeper
in<00:01:49.130> sands<00:01:49.759> but<00:01:50.390> generally<00:01:50.990> we're<00:01:51.140> thinking<00:01:51.469> of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
in sands but generally we're thinking of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.010 
in sands but generally we're thinking of
a<00:01:51.679> quarter<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.189> half<00:01:52.429> an<00:01:52.610> inch<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:53.630> means

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
a quarter to half an inch this means

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.749 
a quarter to half an inch this means
that<00:01:54.229> we<00:01:54.350> should<00:01:54.380> see<00:01:54.829> some<00:01:55.100> seeds<00:01:55.399> on<00:01:55.579> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
that we should see some seeds on the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.539 
that we should see some seeds on the
surface<00:01:56.209> after<00:01:56.569> we're<00:01:56.750> done<00:01:56.929> if<00:01:57.530> we<00:01:57.799> we<00:01:58.369> should

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
surface after we're done if we we should

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.940 
surface after we're done if we we should
go<00:01:58.729> back<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.000> look<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.899> we<00:02:00.469> should<00:02:00.740> see

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
go back and look and we should see

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.550 
go back and look and we should see
approximately<00:02:01.450> four<00:02:02.450> or<00:02:02.600> five<00:02:02.810> seeds<00:02:03.259> per

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
approximately four or five seeds per

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.429 
approximately four or five seeds per
square<00:02:03.920> foot<00:02:04.280> on<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.390> surface<00:02:05.599> of<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.200> soil

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
square foot on the surface of the soil

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.919 
square foot on the surface of the soil
after<00:02:07.069> we've<00:02:07.220> seeded<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:07.819> we<00:02:08.000> do<00:02:08.179> not<00:02:08.390> see<00:02:08.720> any

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
after we've seeded if we do not see any

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.800 
after we've seeded if we do not see any
seeds<00:02:09.410> then<00:02:10.250> we<00:02:10.489> have<00:02:10.700> probably<00:02:11.269> put<00:02:11.599> all<00:02:11.780> of

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
seeds then we have probably put all of

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:41.839 
seeds then we have probably put all of
the<00:02:12.170> seed<00:02:12.440> too<00:02:12.769> deep

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.869 

so<00:02:42.849> here<00:02:43.599> is<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:44.200> stand<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.860> alfalfa<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.700> was

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
so here is a stand of alfalfa that was

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.600 
so here is a stand of alfalfa that was
seeded<00:02:46.299> about<00:02:46.599> three<00:02:46.959> weeks<00:02:47.200> ago<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:48.549> was

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
seeded about three weeks ago it was

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.660 
seeded about three weeks ago it was
seeded<00:02:49.239> at<00:02:49.480> about<00:02:49.840> 12<00:02:50.319> pounds<00:02:50.620> per<00:02:51.069> acre<00:02:51.099> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
seeded at about 12 pounds per acre and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.479 
seeded at about 12 pounds per acre and
as<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.420> can<00:02:52.599> see<00:02:52.659> there<00:02:53.290> is<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> plant<00:02:53.920> along

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
as you can see there is a plant along

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.150 
as you can see there is a plant along
here<00:02:54.879> coming<00:02:55.269> up<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.599> this<00:02:55.750> row<00:02:56.019> about<00:02:56.739> every

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
here coming up in this row about every

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.300 
here coming up in this row about every
inch<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.629> a<00:02:58.660> more<00:02:59.170> than<00:02:59.440> adequate<00:02:59.680> stand

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
inch that is a more than adequate stand

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.750 
inch that is a more than adequate stand
for<00:03:00.610> alfalfa<00:03:01.299> we<00:03:01.840> would<00:03:02.049> look<00:03:02.260> at<00:03:02.680> if<00:03:02.950> we<00:03:03.190> have

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
for alfalfa we would look at if we have

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.170 
for alfalfa we would look at if we have
about<00:03:04.269> 40<00:03:04.870> plants<00:03:05.140> per<00:03:05.530> square<00:03:05.860> foot<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.940> a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
about 40 plants per square foot that's a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.680 
about 40 plants per square foot that's a
good<00:03:07.390> stand<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.110> then<00:03:08.879> all<00:03:09.879> of<00:03:09.909> those<00:03:10.299> stands

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
good stand and then all of those stands

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.059 
good stand and then all of those stands
will<00:03:11.049> fit<00:03:11.470> thin<00:03:11.799> down<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.549> about<00:03:13.269> 30<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.900> 35

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
will fit thin down to about 30 to 35

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.860 
will fit thin down to about 30 to 35
plants<00:03:15.069> per<00:03:15.250> square<00:03:15.280> foot<00:03:15.910> at<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.390> end<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
plants per square foot at the end of the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.589 
plants per square foot at the end of the
seeding<00:03:17.260> year<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.769> here<00:03:18.010> here<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.879> spot

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
seeding year so here here is a spot

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.619 
seeding year so here here is a spot
where<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.260> seeding<00:03:20.620> rate<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:21.099> really

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
where the seeding rate is really

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.539 
where the seeding rate is really
unnecessarily<00:03:22.629> high<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.920> must<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.430> been

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
unnecessarily high this must have been

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.690 
unnecessarily high this must have been
about<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:24.910> 20<00:03:25.390> pound<00:03:25.599> seeding<00:03:26.140> rate<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:27.549> you

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
about a 20 pound seeding rate and if you

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.690 
about a 20 pound seeding rate and if you
look<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.660> see<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.170> there<00:03:29.410> are<00:03:29.620> three<00:03:30.519> to

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
look you can see that there are three to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.110 
look you can see that there are three to
four<00:03:30.940> plants<00:03:31.450> per<00:03:31.720> inch<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.319> roll<00:03:32.819> this<00:03:33.819> will

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
four plants per inch of roll this will

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.920 
four plants per inch of roll this will
give<00:03:34.900> us<00:03:35.040> way<00:03:36.040> more<00:03:36.069> plants<00:03:36.940> than<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.390> 30<00:03:37.720> to

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
give us way more plants than that 30 to

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.380 
give us way more plants than that 30 to
40<00:03:38.349> that<00:03:38.859> we<00:03:39.040> need<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.670> end<00:03:39.849> of<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.090> year

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
40 that we need for the end of the year

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.349 
40 that we need for the end of the year
so<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:41.590> stand<00:03:41.890> comes<00:03:42.220> up<00:03:42.430> now<00:03:42.609> it<00:03:42.910> looks<00:03:43.150> very

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
so this stand comes up now it looks very

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.690 
so this stand comes up now it looks very
good<00:03:43.510> but<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.560> fact<00:03:44.739> is<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> plants<00:03:45.579> are

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
good but the fact is the plants are

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.879 
good but the fact is the plants are
competing<00:03:46.269> against<00:03:46.690> each<00:03:46.810> other<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.319> the

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
competing against each other and the

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.250 
competing against each other and the
sand<00:03:48.190> will<00:03:48.430> gradually<00:03:48.910> thin<00:03:49.269> down<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.780> 30<00:03:50.049> to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
sand will gradually thin down to 30 to

00:03:50.260 --> 00:04:19.759 
sand will gradually thin down to 30 to
35<00:03:50.739> plants<00:03:51.250> by<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.430> end<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.910> seeding<00:03:52.269> year

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769
