hi<00:00:00.420> there<00:00:00.719> here's<00:00:01.410> an<00:00:01.589> art<00:00:01.829> idea<00:00:02.159> you<00:00:02.399> can<00:00:02.610> do

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hi there here's an art idea you can do

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.970 
hi there here's an art idea you can do
with<00:00:02.909> your<00:00:02.939> child<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.780> it's<00:00:04.290> using<00:00:04.770> their

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
with your child and it's using their

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.789 
with your child and it's using their
name<00:00:05.330> so<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.750> can<00:00:06.960> write<00:00:07.170> their<00:00:07.379> name<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
name so you can write their name on a

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.250 
name so you can write their name on a
piece<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.130> paper<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.570> some<00:00:09.840> printer<00:00:10.230> paper

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
piece of paper I have some printer paper

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.230 
piece of paper I have some printer paper
here<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.099> could<00:00:11.280> use<00:00:11.460> construction<00:00:12.000> paper

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
here you could use construction paper

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.600 
here you could use construction paper
you<00:00:12.750> could<00:00:12.929> put<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.290> on<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> colored<00:00:14.070> piece<00:00:14.400> of

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
you could put it on a colored piece of

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.510 
you could put it on a colored piece of
paper<00:00:14.820> any<00:00:15.630> kind<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:16.080> paper<00:00:16.139> will<00:00:16.619> work<00:00:16.890> make

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
paper any kind of paper will work make

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.480 
paper any kind of paper will work make
sure<00:00:17.550> when<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.180> write<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.720> out<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:19.380> easy<00:00:20.039> for

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
sure when you write it out it's easy for

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.300 
sure when you write it out it's easy for
them<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> read<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.289> may<00:00:22.560> need<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.100> be

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
them to read and it may need to be

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.460 
them to read and it may need to be
spaced<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.210> little<00:00:24.510> bit<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.260> all

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
spaced a little bit so it's not all

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.710 
spaced a little bit so it's not all
squished<00:00:25.920> together<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.550> big<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
squished together it's big like this and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.830 
squished together it's big like this and
it's<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.500> spaced<00:00:28.949> apart<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:30.210> what

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's kind of spaced apart because what

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.639 
it's kind of spaced apart because what
they're<00:00:31.080> they'll<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.369> use<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.820> glue<00:00:33.649> now

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
they're they'll do is use the glue now

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
they're they'll do is use the glue now
using<00:00:35.070> glue<00:00:35.340> works<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.880> their<00:00:36.030> small<00:00:36.360> motor

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
using glue works on their small motor

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
using glue works on their small motor
skills<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> works<00:00:37.680> those<00:00:37.950> muscles<00:00:38.489> in

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
skills and it works those muscles in

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.389 
skills and it works those muscles in
their<00:00:38.790> hands<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:40.170> writing<00:00:40.620> later<00:00:40.950> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
their hands for writing later and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
their hands for writing later and
they'll<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.780> glue<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.969> their<00:00:46.520> letters

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
they'll put some glue on their letters

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.439 
they'll put some glue on their letters
now<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.300> can<00:00:49.250> they<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.280> trace<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.210> letter

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
now they can they can trace the letter

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.389 
now they can they can trace the letter
like<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.230> they<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.559> use<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:53.250> bit

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
like that or they can use a little bit

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.540 
like that or they can use a little bit
of<00:00:53.430> glue<00:00:53.820> at<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> time<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.680> project<00:00:56.340> also

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
of glue at a time now this project also

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.150 
of glue at a time now this project also
works<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.210> controlling<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.680> glue<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:58.949> they

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
works on controlling the glue that they

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.569 
works on controlling the glue that they
put<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:01.949> three<00:01:02.399> year

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
put on so you know a two or three year

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
put on so you know a two or three year
old<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:03.059> probably<00:01:03.690> use<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.899> lot<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> glue<00:01:05.040> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
old will probably use a lot of glue so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.760 
old will probably use a lot of glue so
it<00:01:05.640> may<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.909> more<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> four-year-old<00:01:07.380> but

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it may be more for a four-year-old but

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.789 
it may be more for a four-year-old but
if<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.070> child<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> great<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:10.530> have

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
if your child can do it great just have

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
if your child can do it great just have
them<00:01:10.979> go<00:01:11.130> ahead<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> do<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.180> then<00:01:12.630> use

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
them go ahead and do that and then use

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.399 
them go ahead and do that and then use
some<00:01:13.350> small<00:01:14.000> objects<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.210> these<00:01:15.840> are<00:01:16.200> little

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
some small objects like these are little

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.200 
some small objects like these are little
pom-poms<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.930> could<00:01:19.229> use<00:01:19.500> um

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
pom-poms that I have you could use um

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.690 
pom-poms that I have you could use um
let's<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.420> well<00:01:21.689> rice<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.979> tiny<00:01:23.280> but

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
let's see well rice is really tiny but

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.179 
let's see well rice is really tiny but
you<00:01:24.360> know<00:01:24.509> use<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:25.290> things<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.890> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you know use little things like this

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
you know use little things like this
anything<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.090> find<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:27.630> kind

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
anything that you can find that's kind

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.039 
anything that you can find that's kind
of<00:01:28.020> little<00:01:28.320> feathers<00:01:28.829> would<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.340> too<00:01:29.579> big

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
of little feathers would be too big

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
of little feathers would be too big
maybe<00:01:31.049> some<00:01:31.439> kind<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.770> confetti<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.670> work

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
maybe some kind of confetti would work

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.690 
maybe some kind of confetti would work
too<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:34.020> something<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.560> they<00:01:34.829> can<00:01:35.130> pick<00:01:35.460> up

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
too but something that they can pick up

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.080 
too but something that they can pick up
and<00:01:36.060> put<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:38.070> they'll<00:01:38.310> put<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.670> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and put on and then they'll put it you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
and put on and then they'll put it you
know<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.780> put<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.170> however<00:01:40.590> they

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
know they can put it on however they

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.359 
know they can put it on however they
want<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.380> keep<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:44.070> can

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
want and then you know keep they can

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.340 
want and then you know keep they can
keep<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.210> close<00:01:45.479> together<00:01:45.869> but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
keep it kind of close together but

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.289 
keep it kind of close together but
however<00:01:46.619> they<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> fine<00:01:48.030> because

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
however they do it is fine because

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.389 
however they do it is fine because
that's<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.899> expression<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.590> themselves<00:01:50.130> how

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that's an expression of themselves how

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.160 
that's an expression of themselves how
they're<00:01:50.610> doing<00:01:50.820> something<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.659> whatever

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
they're doing something and whatever

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.710 
they're doing something and whatever
colors<00:01:53.009> they<00:01:53.310> want<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.670> put<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.570> they

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
colors they want to put on and then they

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
colors they want to put on and then they
can<00:01:54.930> keep<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> then<00:01:57.270> their<00:01:57.479> whole

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
can keep on going and then their whole
