00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
who got the killer initially and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.449

now<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.929> well<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:10.709> seems<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.340> little

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
now you have well which seems a little

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.339 
now you have well which seems a little
campy<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.239> my<00:02:12.390> opinion<00:02:12.690> when<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:12.959> watched<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.319> a

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
campy in my opinion when I watched as a

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.930 
campy in my opinion when I watched as a
little<00:02:13.560> worried<00:02:13.800> about<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.790> it

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
little worried about that because it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.790 
little worried about that because it
seems<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.180> someone<00:02:16.170> would<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.440> grab<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
seems like someone would just grab the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.229 
seems like someone would just grab the
flag<00:02:17.010> run<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.489> back<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.790> map<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.150> then

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
flag run to the back of the map and then

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.580 
flag run to the back of the map and then
keep<00:02:18.480> hold<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.959> back<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.290> map<00:02:19.440> but

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
keep hold of it the back of the map but

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.619 
keep hold of it the back of the map but
i<00:02:19.769> think<00:02:20.459> if<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:20.910> know<00:02:21.120> someone's<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.569> the

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
i think if you know someone's in the

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.300 
i think if you know someone's in the
back<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> map<00:02:22.080> with<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> little<00:02:22.620> flag

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
back of the map with a little flag

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.740 
back of the map with a little flag
symbol<00:02:23.700> above<00:02:23.790> their<00:02:24.060> head<00:02:24.239> then<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.540> can

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
symbol above their head then you can

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.360 
symbol above their head then you can
throw<00:02:25.050> some<00:02:25.290> texts<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.830> their<00:02:25.920> throw<00:02:26.130> noob

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
