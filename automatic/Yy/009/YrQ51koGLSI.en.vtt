00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.490
 so look 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:12.809
 this and here it is all wiring in the collection 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:16.850
 here are the outputs on distributor one build here 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.330
 he went to switch switch one 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.680
 ground switch 2 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.170
 mass but here I put the connector for 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.789
 ease of installation further 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:35.370
 the wire went here are the outputs of the coil 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:38.010
 red + white blue control so on 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.809
 coil how to connect without a difference 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.110
 call for perpetual coils there as not 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.410
 you will connect normally further 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.539
 here it means here it is the way out 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.190
 I specifically wrote a plus here and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.670
 signed here a move i give you this one 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.250
 thing you can't retreat was here 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 here you insert 2 dad connecting will start 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.830
 look here here connects plus with 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.530
 coils that are on your coil now 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.710
 and this one is right next to this 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.049
 tachometer 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.640
 tachometer circuit itself for here 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.920
 signed here is the output to the diodes not here they are 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.479
 the diodes themselves 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 I specifically made a split to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.070
 could be the case need if 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.390
 some elements with grief then another wiring 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.600
 blue disassemble just removed this connector and 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.340
 account is made 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.840
 necessarily that is according to the scheme 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.140
 scheme by the way son then you throw off 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 weight 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.009
 then went the wire too on the connector 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.579
 me 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.240
 for simplicity and here it is and pvc many with 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.030
 him sole tp ha ha 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.850
 she has her own cream mass 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.610
 how are you going to be here 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.610
 signed here he is an electric valve and 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.590
 choke us alex mean the whole thing i 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.690
 installed myself on the car checked 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.300
 I know everything wiring works fine 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.410
 the only thing the tachometer skill is to 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.630
 check whether the item is working or not i 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.390
 people did here one guys on 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.610
 she worked in her seven 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.070
 I'll put these things to check if 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.180
 tachometer work well dogs should do 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.420
 work but you have to check I had just 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.330
 there was no further 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.450
 distributor well this distributor is not yours 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.489
 by the distributor I just drives the spare I already 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.830
 Packed that someone put it here 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.150
 you put on a block in this one 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.489
 position that is, here they are 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:59.440
 ears of fastening of a cover here it is a head 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:02.200
 so crankshaft while putting vmt 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.500
 I will sew marks at the same time 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.770
 first or fourth ignition without 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.560
 the difference is the main tagging crankshaft and here 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.799
 hall sensor any either 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.959
 this hall sensor is either here without 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.680
 the differences 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.540
 then here is a curtain but it is collected 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.709
 problem does not go so she just states 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:33.310
 as a sample here it is spinning clockwise 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:36.610
 arrow so you put the sensor curtain so 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.269
 So that the sensor was the end of the disconnection, that is 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.209
 in vmt 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.049
 so that the sensor opens to 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.830
 already went on 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.530
 disconnection here this is his position and 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.110
 connect the plant if the motor is not 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.810
 start up the first time then just 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:04:00.640
 swap coils here and control 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:04.680
 everything is simple and fine all schemes i 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.680
 You strip off the network
