00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
am simply just blending out the edges

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.790 
am simply just blending out the edges
and<00:02:55.280> when<00:02:55.970> i'm<00:02:56.150> blending<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.959> with<00:02:56.989> my<00:02:57.349> fingers

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
and when i'm blending it with my fingers

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.110 
and when i'm blending it with my fingers
I'm<00:02:58.390> alternating<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.420> fingers<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.410> I'm<00:03:01.120> using

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
I'm alternating the fingers so I'm using

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.250 
I'm alternating the fingers so I'm using
one<00:03:02.690> finger<00:03:03.200> for<00:03:03.909> the<00:03:04.909> highlighting<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.750> then

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
one finger for the highlighting and then

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.100 
one finger for the highlighting and then
another<00:03:06.769> finger<00:03:07.220> for<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.610> contouring<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.989> I'm

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
another finger for the contouring so I'm

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.869 
another finger for the contouring so I'm
not<00:03:09.170> mixing<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.689> sheets<00:03:11.689> together<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:13.370> want

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
not mixing the sheets together you want

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.750 
not mixing the sheets together you want
to<00:03:14.030> separate<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:15.590> highlighting<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:16.640> the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
to separate the highlighting and the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.679 
to separate the highlighting and the
contouring<00:03:17.329> when<00:03:18.200> you're<00:03:18.319> Brett<00:03:18.620> blending<00:03:19.689> so

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
contouring when you're Brett blending so

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.300 
contouring when you're Brett blending so
as<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.870> can<00:03:21.170> see<00:03:21.409> the<00:03:21.560> highlighting<00:03:22.129> and

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
as you can see the highlighting and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.710 
as you can see the highlighting and
contouring<00:03:22.540> shades<00:03:24.610> actually<00:03:25.610> give<00:03:26.030> warmth

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
contouring shades actually give warmth

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.309 
contouring shades actually give warmth
and<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:28.370> finish<00:03:28.610> into<00:03:29.180> your<00:03:29.299> face<00:03:29.629> and<00:03:30.110> that's

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
and to finish into your face and that's

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.500 
and to finish into your face and that's
really<00:03:30.440> important<00:03:31.129> because<00:03:31.329> even<00:03:32.329> when

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
really important because even when

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.009 
really important because even when
you're<00:03:32.659> not<00:03:32.690> wearing<00:03:33.140> makeup<00:03:33.970> your<00:03:34.970> skin<00:03:35.750> has

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
you're not wearing makeup your skin has

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.250 
you're not wearing makeup your skin has
different<00:03:36.560> shades<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.189> tones<00:03:37.629> so<00:03:38.629> doing<00:03:39.079> this

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260

concealer and I really like this powder

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.290 
concealer and I really like this powder

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
because it's very finely milled so it

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.369 
because it's very finely milled so it
doesn't<00:05:23.749> accentuate<00:05:24.199> lines<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:29.139> I'm<00:05:30.139> just
