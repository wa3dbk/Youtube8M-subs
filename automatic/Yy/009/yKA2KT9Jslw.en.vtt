and<00:00:34.489> elegance<00:00:34.940> in<00:00:35.420> this<00:00:35.510> one<00:00:36.610> I'm<00:00:37.610> using<00:00:38.050> part

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
and elegance in this one I'm using part

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.950 
and elegance in this one I'm using part
of<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.309> wood<00:00:40.309> used<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:40.640> be<00:00:40.730> spatula<00:00:41.360> as<00:00:41.750> you

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
of the wood used to be spatula as you

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.790 
of the wood used to be spatula as you
see<00:00:42.170> I<00:00:42.440> found<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.430> easier<00:00:44.120> to<00:00:44.420> use<00:00:44.629> just<00:00:45.620> the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
see I found it easier to use just the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.770 
see I found it easier to use just the
tip<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.370> spatula<00:00:47.059> I<00:00:47.090> have<00:00:47.300> more<00:00:47.480> control

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
tip of the spatula I have more control

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.290 
tip of the spatula I have more control
when<00:00:48.650> you're<00:00:48.770> working<00:00:49.160> on<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.370> small<00:00:49.970> area

when you're working on a small area
cameras<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.470> I'm<00:00:52.190> using<00:00:52.400> edge<00:00:52.790> of<00:00:53.150> the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
cameras and I'm using edge of the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.060 
cameras and I'm using edge of the
spatula<00:00:54.670> creating<00:00:55.960> flowers<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:57.829> case

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
spatula creating flowers in this case

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.290 
spatula creating flowers in this case
will<00:00:58.250> be<00:00:58.600> roses<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.050> some<00:01:00.290> other<00:01:01.300> imaginative

and<00:01:22.470> once<00:01:23.470> again<00:01:23.590> I'm<00:01:24.070> outlining<00:01:24.820> right<00:01:25.090> now

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and once again I'm outlining right now

contrast<00:01:39.720> usually<00:01:40.720> an<00:01:41.049> outline<00:01:41.439> will

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
contrast usually an outline will

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.969 
contrast usually an outline will
highlight<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.240> area<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.530> want<00:01:44.770> two

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
highlight the area that you want two

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.789 
highlight the area that you want two
people<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:46.330> focus<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:46.899> when<00:01:47.200> reviewing<00:01:47.679> your

people to focus on when reviewing your
painting<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.659> case<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.110> flowers<00:01:50.470> and

painting in this case the flowers and
the<00:01:50.740> maze

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.800 

it<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.549> very<00:01:55.729> important<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.450> remember

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
it is very important to remember

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.520 
it is very important to remember
whenever<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.680> are<00:01:57.830> painting<00:01:58.520> any<00:01:59.180> any<00:02:00.170> themes

any subjects it doesn't really matter

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.310 
any subjects it doesn't really matter
you<00:02:04.220> got<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.090> remember<00:02:05.299> what's<00:02:05.930> really

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
you got to remember what's really

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.480 
you got to remember what's really
important<00:02:06.920> in<00:02:07.430> your<00:02:07.759> design<00:02:08.709> is<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.250> way<00:02:10.429> you

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
important in your design is the way you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.150 
important in your design is the way you
use<00:02:10.700> negative<00:02:11.360> space<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.200> negative<00:02:12.860> negative

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
use negative space the negative negative

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.150 
use negative space the negative negative
space<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.870> area<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:17.890> outside<00:02:18.890> of

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
space is the area that is outside of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.250 
space is the area that is outside of
your<00:02:19.280> main<00:02:19.489> subject<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.180> this<00:02:20.300> case<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.050> area

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
your main subject in this case the area

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.620 
your main subject in this case the area
that<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.069> outside<00:02:22.819> of<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.090> vase<00:02:23.239> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
that is the outside of the vase and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.130 
that is the outside of the vase and
flowers<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:25.570> equivalently<00:02:26.570> important

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
flowers is equivalently important

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.160 
flowers is equivalently important
equally<00:02:27.800> important<00:02:28.280> as<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:29.150> flowers<00:02:29.959> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
equally important as the flowers and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.020 
equally important as the flowers and
waste<00:02:30.350> itself<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.420> will<00:02:32.690> see<00:02:32.930> how<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.500> will

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
waste itself so you will see how I will

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.000 
waste itself so you will see how I will
fill<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.209> space<00:02:35.480> up<00:02:35.810> with<00:02:36.709> interesting

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
fill the space up with interesting

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.050 
fill the space up with interesting
designs<00:02:38.410> I'm<00:02:39.410> gonna<00:02:39.709> use<00:02:39.890> my<00:02:40.100> special<00:02:40.730> again

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
designs I'm gonna use my special again

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.550 
designs I'm gonna use my special again
for<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.720> one<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:43.989> will<00:02:44.989> add<00:02:45.230> some

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
for that one and I will add some

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.370 
for that one and I will add some
elements<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.150> as<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.170> see<00:02:48.350> right

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
elements into it and as you see right

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.680 
elements into it and as you see right
now<00:02:48.680> I'm<00:02:48.920> still<00:02:49.430> using<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:50.030> bottle<00:02:50.390> mixed

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
now I'm still using the bottle mixed

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.800 
now I'm still using the bottle mixed
with<00:02:50.810> white<00:02:51.380> paint<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.920> water<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.850> added<00:02:53.780> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
with white paint and water and I added a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.860 
with white paint and water and I added a
little<00:02:54.080> bit<00:02:54.170> more<00:02:54.459> white<00:02:55.459> contrast<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
little bit more white contrast on the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.000 
little bit more white contrast on the
flowers<00:02:58.450> now<00:02:59.450> let's<00:03:00.049> use<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.410> feather<00:03:00.680> and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
flowers now let's use the feather and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.740 
flowers now let's use the feather and
the<00:03:01.489> feather<00:03:01.760> will<00:03:02.030> be<00:03:02.060> used<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.630> create<00:03:03.019> and

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the feather will be used to create and

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.830 
the feather will be used to create and
leave<00:03:05.750> all<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.230> flowers<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.329> some<00:03:08.329> other<00:03:08.540> and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
leave all the flowers and some other and

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.120 
leave all the flowers and some other and
just<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.440> know<00:03:10.570> designs<00:03:11.570> on<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.410> ways<00:03:12.590> itself

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
just you know designs on the ways itself

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.050 
just you know designs on the ways itself
give<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.549> little<00:03:13.790> structure<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:16.700> don't

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
give a little structure and you don't

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.850 
give a little structure and you don't
have<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.269> use<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.750> feather<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.560> can<00:03:18.709> use

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860

to be very easy to handle and easy to

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.080 
to be very easy to handle and easy to
manipulate<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:27.049> because<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.500> light<00:03:27.769> and

and I just like to use it so I'm just
gonna<00:03:36.770> continue<00:03:37.000> building<00:03:38.000> more<00:03:38.390> structure

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
gonna continue building more structure

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.589 
gonna continue building more structure
on<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.470> B's<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.989> have<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.770> little<00:03:43.160> bit<00:03:43.280> of

three-dimensional shape to it and

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.740 
three-dimensional shape to it and
scribbles<00:03:49.700> each<00:03:49.849> column<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:52.430> also<00:03:53.030> outside<00:03:53.390> I

out from the painting give some

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.550 
out from the painting give some
something<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.330> focus<00:05:01.930> on

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
something to focus on

something to focus on
when<00:05:03.040> you're<00:05:03.160> viewing<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.520> painting

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:33.469 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:38.149 

the<00:05:34.469> similar<00:05:34.800> way<00:05:35.009> I<00:05:35.310> will<00:05:35.610> add<00:05:36.199> white<00:05:37.199> paint

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.879 
the similar way I will add white paint
and<00:05:38.550> smudge<00:05:39.300> it<00:05:39.539> on<00:05:39.719> top<00:05:40.469> of<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.740> flowers<00:05:41.159> and

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
and smudge it on top of the flowers and

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.969 
and smudge it on top of the flowers and
this<00:05:43.889> will<00:05:44.270> make<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.419> flowers<00:05:45.620> so<00:05:46.620> much<00:05:46.650> more

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
this will make the flowers so much more

00:05:46.979 --> 00:06:05.590 
this will make the flowers so much more
interesting<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.729> observe
