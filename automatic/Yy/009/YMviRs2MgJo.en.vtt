00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.660
 Ulsan Young-Hee 10 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.380
 Today, in the right hand, about the expansion 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.789
 Let me think. 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.750
 Particularly in this regard, 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.779
 It's very important. 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.909
 Next year we will pay a fine of 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.599
 Because I can raise it. 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.479
 Let's take a seat and we'll have a favor 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.479
 For example, 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.290
 It is applied to all prime periods of 25 minute hand extension 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.610
 Well, Dr. and his faith 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.600
 Regardless of that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.300
 It is 4km. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.590
 So I can do anything for example. 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.820
 But once you do not have any tax and calligraphy 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.600
 Let's listen. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.170
 Within 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.520
 We are not 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.690
 Our successor 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.020
 4 times 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.100
 Let's try the five o'clock. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 Four major ledgers 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.460
 We can get here. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 Then the primary expansion is 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.820
 It's a hanok. 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.820
 So, 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 bad 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.159
 Sound already 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.260
 Much larger 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.060
 It looks like a factory. 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.540
 Not only the bridge 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.540
 In fact, you can also extend octaves 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.370
 Aha 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.509
 One by one 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.509
 Blow a hit 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.499
 But. 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.499
 It's an extension of entertainment. 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.609
 Be sure to aim for language 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.849
 You do not have to live your life. 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.290
 That we can raise it to platypus 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.049
 However, many of you 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.980
 There seems to be a tendency to try to solve some 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.469
 Because it's already wider 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.819
 I'll make a mistake 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.959
 Because I did not practice hunter expansion 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.040
 Because it is a song 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.239
 In that country there is the discomfort and fear 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.469
 Because I think 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.649
 I can not do it with confidence. 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.519
 But if you can not conquer this part 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.909
 Effectively in the church 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.150
 I can not play congregation 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.179
 In the lead, 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:09.119
 Please try it. So that you can see the movie in a simple way. 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.909
 I'll do it. 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.079
 We once again placed 80th in each other, 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.079
 time 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 Do not 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.509
 I will upload the facts of the movie to the popular area. 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.509
 Grand National Party 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.089
 movie 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:45.290
 Unrighteousness 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 Nature love 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.750
 The media 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.519
 Are you clear? 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.519
 I got up with another strike. 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.009
 North Korea probably 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.559
 But 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:00.559
 It was today. 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:02.999
 how much 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.139
 For example, 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.480
 There is a saying 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.259
 Diversified 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.259
 And I can feel the volume going on. 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.619
 So I can expand on all Samsung. 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.810
 When we approve the anomaly, 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.779
 In the fall 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:28.389
 If we can do the ring here we are the other 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 Much better with that song 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.830
 I can enjoy the effect. 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.879
 In the midst of singing hymns 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.370
 A different kind of accompaniment 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.790
 I agree with myself about their own 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.210
 Because of 4-6 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.150
 Much to sing hymns 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.819
 Heart 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.819
 Whether it occurs 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:54.499
 Hey Sector 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.499
 It is very heavy and the accompanist role is 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.129
 It's a role that moves the 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.440
 result It is basic 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.169
 More importantly, 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.740
 Let the facial expressions 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.540
 I want to call the acid that I am calling more hard and cheerfully 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.279
 doing 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.449
 Heart 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.039
 This is the report through the piano. 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.309
 So this extension I'm talking about today 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:24.610
 It's very important. 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.780
 You need Lee Hyun-seung. 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.400
 I could understand quickly 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.020
 Sony does not want to 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.020
 It is bound to become the rice cake of the picture 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.599
 When you do this, 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.439
 Erim Eduard Damage Organic Good 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.930
 You were surprised about 2bp 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.539
 These people 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.900
 If you expand as much as possible 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.069
 Widening the area to give a billion pounds 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:59.069
 For example 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.119
 In this case, there is not much space 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.639
 more No need to reduce the mound much Gesture only 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.639
 You must take it. For example, 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:17.960
 Today 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.960
 However, when Hanhwa comes up, 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:24.289
 Grand National Party 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:27.289
 One by one 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.250
 Because there is a space that can do much more 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.050
 Industry 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.099
 Even if you do a lot of work 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.119
 I'd like uc 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.119
 In the future, 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.800
 I do not think so. 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.020
 One day called Nahana 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.430
 However, 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.830
 World pots 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.970
 Have you ever given a cultural asset? 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:07.529
 Because one of the spaces is more gorgeous 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.260
 Now that I'm talking about expanding 25 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:17.099
 Ah, I told you before, but it's hard. 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.259
 You have to practice 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:21.259
 And since this space utilization uses extensions 

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:25.249
 It is to become sympathy. Now the next time 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.449
 How to use space 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.040
 Can this make sense of the next time? 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.439
 For example, 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:37.439
 I will always stop me in my heart 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:39.369
 The central bank 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:41.909
 Could it be much more varied 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:43.289
 At one's time 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:46.189
 Let us think about space utilization. 

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:49.719
 I'll do it. Today's of your right hand extended of ride 

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.240
 Unwanted extensions 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.419
 Definitely try once practice 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:56.240
 Try to make it yours 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.930
 Thank you.
