loop here she seemed she got off on an
angle<00:05:02.000> right<00:05:02.120> there<00:05:02.419> right<00:05:02.720> shoulder<00:05:03.020> was

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
angle right there right shoulder was

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.870 
angle right there right shoulder was
down<00:05:03.380> she<00:05:03.620> just<00:05:03.650> kept<00:05:04.039> that<00:05:04.220> same<00:05:04.430> angle<00:05:04.820> all

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
down she just kept that same angle all

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.850 
down she just kept that same angle all
the<00:05:04.970> way<00:05:05.090> through<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.110> cannot<00:05:06.410> you

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
the way through and you cannot you

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.830 
the way through and you cannot you
cannot<00:05:06.949> hold<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.400> edge<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.729> that<00:05:07.760> oh<00:05:08.120> yeah

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
cannot hold the edge like that oh yeah

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.360 
cannot hold the edge like that oh yeah
and<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.110> think<00:05:09.169> although<00:05:09.560> rod<00:05:09.889> you<00:05:10.010> brought<00:05:10.220> up

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
and I think although rod you brought up

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.490 
and I think although rod you brought up
a<00:05:10.460> good<00:05:10.639> point<00:05:10.699> of<00:05:11.180> artistically<00:05:12.139> is<00:05:12.260> this<00:05:12.470> a

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
a good point of artistically is this a

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.469 
a good point of artistically is this a
superior<00:05:13.070> program<00:05:13.520> ins<00:05:13.760> ackles<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.270> thought

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
superior program ins ackles I thought

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.360 
superior program ins ackles I thought
they<00:05:14.600> were<00:05:14.660> both<00:05:14.900> packed<00:05:15.260> full<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.590> plain

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
they were both packed full of plain

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.610 
they were both packed full of plain
Crosscut's<00:05:16.970> not<00:05:17.240> much<00:05:17.479> originality<00:05:18.020> very

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
Crosscut's not much originality very

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.670 
Crosscut's not much originality very
little<00:05:18.979> footwork<00:05:19.840> so<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.990> becomes<00:05:21.229> a<00:05:21.380> triple

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
little footwork so it becomes a triple

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.360 
little footwork so it becomes a triple
jump<00:05:21.889> contest<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.960> in<00:05:24.169> my<00:05:24.349> mind<00:05:24.560> that's<00:05:25.190> what

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
jump contest and in my mind that's what

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.700 
jump contest and in my mind that's what

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
look like first place marks in fact she

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.589 
look like first place marks in fact she

I<00:05:42.600> think<00:05:43.140> presentation<00:05:43.800> will<00:05:43.950> be<00:05:44.070> more<00:05:44.250> than

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
I think presentation will be more than

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:52.280 
I think presentation will be more than
enough<00:05:46.490> 5054<00:05:47.490> and<00:05:49.550> Leticia<00:05:50.550> boo<00:05:50.970> bear<00:05:51.240> is<00:05:52.230> in
