00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.379
 Teacher you and a lot of battle and good 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.110
 to the new 11th edition of my 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.740
 a selection of the top 5 best moments 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.570
 battlefield 4 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.970
 if you missed previous issues 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.680
 can see it in the description on 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.900
 first place last week was 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.940
 video from bambino sniper he jumped out 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.430
 fighter from the air shot 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.920
 sniper on the ground i tried you doing 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.640
 something similar but somehow not wondered 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.829
 in fifth place today bf4 beta fall and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 he shoots from the middle distance 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.420
 infantry on the map is a road for someone 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.859
 pretty funny videos because he doesn't 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.309
 such a good shooter 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:47.819
 but he gets in a mine and explodes right away 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.489
 four enemies very cool very lucky 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:52.800
 such ibiza and not necessary in the battlefield I 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.499
 so far in fourth place this week 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.499
 Baiji mod seems to be correct but 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.690
 I'm not sure Badji mod plays on mode 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.920
 assault and if you ever played on 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.379
 this mode with twenty four 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.990
 players on the silk road think you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.960
 you understand what it means but I'm still 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.719
 I will explain each team has a tank and 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.250
 those lucky ones who can capture 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:20.520
 tank become immortal gods yes 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 you become a robot guy 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.289
 wets his infantry in overheating 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.670
 a machine gun how can i be on his 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.740
 I would probably already be dead on the spot 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.229
 a tank appears on the hill but its not 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.299
 cares too much without problems 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.079
 helps his team break through 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.590
 next he comes to my next 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.960
 who and here he and his partner will have to 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.560
 try and see how many people 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.020
 he killed before the arrival of another tank and here 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.939
 he notices a ray that comes from the bottles 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.369
 there sniper sat down he use 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.119
 some device and does not suspect that 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.520
 from the back already drove it so in perfect 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.340
 his positions don't get machine guns but 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.499
 still he has to die here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.810
 guys are trying to blow it out of your mouth because 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:12.360
 he has all the songs specifically 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.640
 here others are also trying to insert him 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.430
 stick in the wheels hiding behind the yurt and here 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 He also gently pulls up and start 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 sweep 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.910
 knocks them and he doesnâ€™t care 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.100
 oil and of course forgetting the camping 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.989
 sniper dies too what the hell is he 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.150
 do business sitting in some device 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.130
 probably wrote to nicholas cage on twitter 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.500
 but after several tank shots he 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.209
 stops this business after a small 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.370
 repair baiji jumps back into 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.769
 the tank continues to sweep and kills more 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.209
 several enemies zayuzat but still tank 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.570
 killed by a rocket 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.630
 He made more than 20 Kills cool while the 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.090
 third place we have Rene you have already seen 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.100
 this guy in the previous release but this 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.440
 much cooler 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.900
 it accelerates on a tank pulls up 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.280
 steep hill 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.100
 flies up and blows up a fighter Lord 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.340
