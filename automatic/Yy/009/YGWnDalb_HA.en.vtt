00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.140 
which is wonderful and the last thing
I'll<00:00:52.380> note<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.830> one<00:00:53.700> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.880> things<00:00:54.060> that

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
I'll note is that one of the things that

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.960 
I'll note is that one of the things that
helps<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.750> faster<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.070> because<00:00:56.730> I

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
helps it go faster is that because I
