00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:25.389
 A Good Day - with Brother David Steindl-Rast 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.272
 Do you think this is one more day in your life? 

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.913
 No, it's not another day 

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:38.321
 it's the only day you're given 

00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:42.877
 is today. 

00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:48.053
 It has been given to you, it is a gift. 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.211
 It is the only gift you have at this time 

00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:58.311
 and the only appropriate response is gratitude. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 If you do nothing more than cultivate that response 

00:01:13.597 --> 00:01:17.484
 to the gift that this unrepeatable day represents, 

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:27.256
 you will learn to respond as if it were the first and the last day of your life, 

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:33.296
 and so you have taken advantage of your day very well. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.590
 Start by opening your eyes, 

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.330
 and surprising you that you have eyes that you can open. 

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:48.130
 Be amazed at the incredible display of colors that are constantly offered to us, 

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:52.920
 and that is given to us so that we enjoy it. 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:55.850
 Look to the sky 

00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:59.680
 very rarely do we look at the sky, 

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:06.010
 very rarely do we notice how different minute by minute it is, 

00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:09.100
 with clouds coming and going. 

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:11.740
 We only think about the weather, 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.670
 and the climate we do not look at its many nuances 

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:21.110
 We are only interested if there is good weather or bad weather. 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.000
 Today's climate is unique 

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:31.800
 and probably never repeat itself in the same way. 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.190
 The formation of clouds today 

00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:38.400
 never again will it be repeated as it is at this moment. 

00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:43.490
 Open your eyes and look at all those things. 

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:48.630
 Look at the faces of the people you meet. 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:57.150
 Each of them has an incredible story behind her face 

00:02:57.618 --> 00:03:02.870
 a story that we will never fully know. 

00:03:03.858 --> 00:03:08.210
 Not only his own stories, but also those of his ancestors. 

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:13.640
 We all have a story that comes from far away. 

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:17.260
 And at this precise moment, today, 

00:03:18.012 --> 00:03:20.680
 all those people with whom you are, 

00:03:21.102 --> 00:03:23.390
 all that life that is passed down through generations 

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.940
 and that comes from so many parts of the world, 

00:03:27.516 --> 00:03:30.030
 it flows and it meets you, 

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:39.970
 like a torrent of water that gives life, only if you open your heart and drink from it. 

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:50.340
 Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization offers us. 

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:55.370
 You activate a key, and you have electric light; 

00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:59.580
 you open a tap, and you have hot and cold water, 

00:04:01.388 --> 00:04:03.440
 and drinking water, 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.340
 something that millions and millions in the world can never experience. 

00:04:11.276 --> 00:04:15.800
 These are just some of the innumerable gifts 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.900
 to which you can open your heart. 

00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:24.720
 I hope you can open your heart to all these blessings 

00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:28.560
 and let them flow through you, 

00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:32.090
 so that everyone you meet today 

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:35.240
 be blessed by you, 

00:04:36.928 --> 00:04:40.030
 just with your look, 

00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:42.680
 with your smile, 

00:04:44.313 --> 00:04:46.600
 with your contact, 

00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:51.310
 with only your presence. 

00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:58.750
 Let gratitude spill in blessings around you. 

00:05:01.464 --> 00:05:08.960
 Then this will really be a good day.
