00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.180
 and then guys look for ways to transition 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.190
 it was one more video of that person for more 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.320
 a video much more than is possible 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.970
 this time and with three modes not 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.280
 usually I bring three super bikes 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.080
 look like but they only know three super bikes 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.540
 different superlatives then 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.890
 first mote dynamite dynamic lights 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.710
 bringing from English to Portuguese 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.419
 would be in the dynamics in case he adds 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.070
 some things like day care did not have 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.719
 but it 's something they could 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.120
 work and it would look really good then 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.920
 is anything we have in case the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.660
 torch and august nani 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.180
 I think only those two items that have light 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.430
 own a daycare so the dog to 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.860
 put on hand to 5 k 9 hours on foot 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.950
 it will give you a small line with your 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.320
 current situation as it becomes so 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.149
 same thing you put on the floor it goes 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.090
 give the same thing then let me get it 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.680
 here and the silver and walking and also goes 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.660
 lighting wherever you are I find 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.909
 which was very useful even just that 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.579
 so it modified it very heavy then 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.500
 have where you very insecure android 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:13.070
 it's very weak I do not recommend this 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.290
 mole pro mod that would be before would 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.020
 theoretical model that would also be another motorcycle 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.420
 pellet that is of oz morrison principle 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.760
 the tree would be the first mini crash 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.920
 would be trees with minerals each is a 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.110
 Very cool hate I believe in the series 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.540
 of the patient that tcm day care 15 death 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.490
 because he is very good so much so that the 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.030
 ore tree that is very cute 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.920
 huh 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.990
 everyone told me here but the ore with 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.729
 The tree and gave this block was very 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.680
 cute right so now I will start 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.600
 for the diamond euphoria right? 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.100
 so kind to give me tell ore 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.299
 so it's very cool, right? 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.280
 I'm going to pick up the tree too. 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.750
 gold in step to and also tree of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.850
 which only have these prisons for 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.140
 while but the creator of the template he 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.280
 promised that he will have new updates 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.110
 huh 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.600
 and to get people to do these 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.610
 areas you basically need 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.549
 series is always normal 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.909
 oak and also such a diamond one 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.220
 gold or iron in case if it is to be done 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.079
 some been doing some diary you 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.390
 handle not make another diamond and 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.500
 and then you get 8 of each 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.150
 and do not 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.890
 I'm going to return that just the game-training 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.620
 creative think it's much easier and such 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.420
 and beauty so here we have all three 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.120
 Growing trees it is also simple 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.190
 already seems straightforward and such but it is then we 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.440
 even oak beauty 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.630
 here we have three trees in case you have to 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.850
 Mud lover of gold and the change of 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.160
 iron and it shows everything in Portuguese 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.010
 then it is very good right I'll get here 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.570
 a little bit of the only way to grow 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.970
 these trees if I'm not mistaken and do not 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.670
 mistake would be with the bone powder itself 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.459
 but also do can or if you just pick 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.680
 here and pick up flights and then sue him 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.050
 right guys we will reap what you sow the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.130
 first iron tree then you 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.239
 plant her like a tree 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.620
 normal and such 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.480
 only she's playing sometimes 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.630
 depending on what if she is not in china 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.239
 she does not appear then takemori de fela 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.130
 super normal then and there's something else that 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.180
 I realize that you've been broken with a 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.400
 ax and such 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.570
 the diamond rock dp also a pickup and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.890
 diamond right 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.600
 when it was broken with an ax it is 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.580
 It's very time-consuming, and when are you going? 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.530
 break with the pickaxe and such is very 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.650
 higher then it is very similar to the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.350
 pc is the same or do not 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.930
 More grove is more ore than 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.489
 own tree, right? 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.130
 here is also gold and also doing 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.040
 here 's a diamond love that has more 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.840
 beautiful then break that you can also 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.690
 to think that I was born but I did 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.430
 ebo goal right beauty catch here too and 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.620
 also enjoy that catch that gold 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.720
 and now I make the ores the crash of 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.420
 minerals is also very easy and 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.489
 if I'm not mistaken for each block 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.720
 not for every 1 ores episode until 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.780
 then for each miner returned to 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.570
 need 44 diamond woods 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.350
 so doing here one would make that size 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.470
 said 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.360
 but I think it pays off a lot because 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.519
 step a touch on the beauty brake 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.860
 So, if each one does, there will be a 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.640
 a wood in the case I think it understands 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.230
 huh 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.120
 so you plan that it costs one 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.600
 diamond and eight modules from there when you 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.640
 Harvest here ends up giving more wood 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.470
 than that thing then this guy like that 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.110
 It pays off and you must have 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.030
 understood then a diamond plus eight 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.720
 oak that will equal a diamond 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.150
 and a wood comes down tom 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.890
 which makes up for a little more 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.020
 next module that only in creative 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.000
 pass pro creative and tals and beauty 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.240
 then the last way that would only be death 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.580
 of the minimum mobile mode would be more or 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.260
 less a thousand real estate is so expensive this way 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.050
 that he is also on the test as he is 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.730
 starting now they move do not cover 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.930
 much of it because it is a way of being 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.280
 involved not 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.620
 so you can see that you already have the 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.780
 creative inventory then and at 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.110
 the less I found myself in the inventory 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.640
 then you can see that the 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.100
 difference of Spanish here today can 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.280
 drink creeper and also respond creeper 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.750
 normal then is the difference and such but is 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.270
 here we have the cliper zinho that 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.640
 need the clippers where they had a little 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.100
 different such a zÃ© so let's go here 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.720
 the furniture in the case only has four 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.470
 but they are also four but very good 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.690
 so the kiss palm clipperton clinton is 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.010
 tripod on top of the line and got very 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.419
 really cute, right? 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.919
 You can talk when you want and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.020
 also make a great heartburn that I drank 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.460
 clipper that they can more where he 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.650
 I was a little smaller and so 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.690
 and hit this debate in pen and 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.190
 raining so they can only 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.550
 explosion coming from them is a bit smaller 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.110
 it is also that between nec is like a boy 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.120
 It was also very cool, too. 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.150
 and I also think it was fine, 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.669
 and cool the last one left nothing 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.590
 would be the skeleton that also catch fire from 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.080
 day then I'll pass you over to the 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.020
 At night, this beauty. 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.180
 so I guess I did not go any more, right, okay? 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.850
 then let him quiet will do here is 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.620
 so without the bow nÃ© personal you liked it 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.240
 Let me know, it's very important for 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.180
 disclosure of the channel also in the video such 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.100
 six works until the next video if sc e 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.870
 also comment and basses and even those that 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.290
 they are all but you 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.510
 find 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.510
 and this is the brazil has a video went
