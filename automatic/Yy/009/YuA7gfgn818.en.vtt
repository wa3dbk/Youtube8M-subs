very<00:01:49.810> hard<00:01:49.930> on<00:01:50.200> your<00:01:50.350> hair<00:01:50.560> so<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:52.210> looking

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
very hard on your hair so but looking

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.030 
very hard on your hair so but looking
back<00:01:52.570> on<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.870> I<00:01:53.020> think<00:01:53.080> straight<00:01:53.560> because<00:01:53.740> it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
back on it I think straight because it's

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.580 
back on it I think straight because it's
that<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.610> such<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.880> character<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.410> don't

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
that is such a character and I don't

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.950 
that is such a character and I don't
look<00:01:56.770> like<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:56.950> in<00:01:57.190> my<00:01:57.250> life<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.910> know

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
look like that in my life you know

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.690 
look like that in my life you know
I<00:01:59.020> went<00:01:59.680> in<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.830> try<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.070> get<00:02:00.220> another<00:02:00.310> job

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
I went in to try and get another job

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.039 
I went in to try and get another job
looking<00:02:00.970> like<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.540> would<00:02:01.780> be<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.900> lot

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
looking like that it would be a lot

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.520 
looking like that it would be a lot
harder<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:03.490> be<00:02:03.610> separated<00:02:04.360> from<00:02:04.540> from<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
harder to be separated from from the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.880 
harder to be separated from from the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
me it was much more it was similar to

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.890 
me it was much more it was similar to
the<00:02:53.709> replicants<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.430> Blade<00:02:54.640> Runner<00:02:54.850> more<00:02:55.660> so

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
the replicants and Blade Runner more so

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.020 
the replicants and Blade Runner more so
than<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.320> terminator<00:02:56.800> terminator<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.910> know

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
than the terminator terminator you know

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.080 
than the terminator terminator you know
we<00:02:58.630> didn't<00:02:58.959> want<00:02:59.110> her<00:02:59.260> robotic<00:02:59.800> at<00:02:59.890> all<00:03:00.090> but

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
we didn't want her robotic at all but

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.970 
we didn't want her robotic at all but
because<00:03:01.420> my<00:03:01.660> character<00:03:02.080> was<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.470> Google

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
because my character was the Google

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.590 
because my character was the Google
Cylon<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.670> we<00:03:03.790> knew<00:03:03.970> up<00:03:04.120> from<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.420> very

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
Cylon that we knew up from the very

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.890 
Cylon that we knew up from the very
beginning

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.470

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
also worked with the other six is where

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.710 
also worked with the other six is where
you<00:03:46.769> know<00:03:46.890> she<00:03:46.950> was<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:48.060> she'd<00:03:48.390> study

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
you know she was just and she'd study

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.399

people<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:49.590> his<00:03:49.709> eye<00:03:49.890> contact<00:03:50.629> and<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:52.110> me<00:03:52.290> it

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
people know his eye contact and to me it

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.319 
people know his eye contact and to me it
was<00:03:52.439> like<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.709> processing<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:54.090> she's

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
was like a processing and she's

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.360 
was like a processing and she's
processing<00:03:54.629> she's<00:03:55.409> thinking<00:03:55.799> things<00:03:56.159> through

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
processing she's thinking things through

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.059 
processing she's thinking things through
and<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.870> was<00:03:57.989> very<00:03:58.079> important<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:58.680> me<00:03:58.890> to

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
and so it was very important for me to

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.640 
and so it was very important for me to
have<00:03:59.159> my<00:03:59.459> contact<00:04:00.090> maybe<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.989> little<00:04:01.200> bit<00:04:01.379> more

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
have my contact maybe a little bit more

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.830 
have my contact maybe a little bit more
so<00:04:01.860> than<00:04:02.069> a<00:04:02.129> human<00:04:02.519> would<00:04:02.700> because<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:03.750> makes

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
so than a human would because it makes

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.059 
so than a human would because it makes
me<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.019> little<00:04:04.170> uneasy<00:04:04.319> if<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:04.769> just<00:04:04.920> keep

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
me a little uneasy if we just keep

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.979

much more from a human perspective the

off<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.230> ship<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:52.530> I<00:05:52.800> know<00:05:52.860> if<00:05:53.040> the<00:05:53.100> fans

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
off the ship and I know if the fans

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.270 
off the ship and I know if the fans
how'd<00:05:54.480> she<00:05:54.660> get<00:05:54.750> off<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.020> ship<00:05:55.260> when<00:05:55.890> you<00:05:55.980> see

that's what it means is it'll fill in

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.110 
that's what it means is it'll fill in
things<00:06:00.780> where<00:06:01.230> you'll<00:06:01.380> go<00:06:01.530> oh<00:06:01.910> how<00:06:02.910> did<00:06:03.090> that
