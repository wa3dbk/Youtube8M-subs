 and today this video is going to be pretty 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.370
 short but important enough because 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.440
 I will tell you everything that will happen 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.940

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.820

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 beginning of the video 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 at first I could do like that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 little dots with my finger on my 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 ipad that allowed me to show you 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 a little more detail what I wanted 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.120
 show you and I managed to connect 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.699
 lighter my ipad and i'm finally going 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 able to film the entire screen 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.460
 from my ipad remove those fucking from 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.020
 black bands they want on the side 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.640
 but all in all, to tell you 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.280
 that I am going to have you prepared for you 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 a full out and that it's very very 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 very long time I did not attack 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.950
 as we could see from 3700 trophy 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.110
 finally even 3795 I know I'm the fart 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 but I love that I in 2009 without a trophy 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.970
 and I just got a little time 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 a pure and a little forgiveness a little 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.000
 bows of my friend but I do not know anymore 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.560
 who knows and so besides I wanted to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 tell you several things in this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 video is a very important video 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.409
 it's a video where I'll tell you a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.940
 little everything that will happen during the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.930
 month 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.630
 and if we attack him what are they 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.800
 thought guys that's not what 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.330
 what you think about it but me it is the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.920
 kind of village that I love attacked 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.710
 because he's a bit open so he goes 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.690
 to go necessarily all right there are thirty 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.680
 was to take I want to say 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.150
 why not why not 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.300
 so what can we do is 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.950
 start by breaking this lightning there and I 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.830
 will talk to you during the attack 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.550
 as you can see my two heroes 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.400
 so hop 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.920
 I hope I did well so 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.420
 always started by sending the castle 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.670
 clans first for you never know 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.130
 if there are mega bombs the serp been 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.690
 with the pure and I do not know what is it 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.580
 that I have to say the word mashed or want 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.560
 to say the fucking word I do not like it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.489
 with peoples who sees there well 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.150
 obviously that's what I meant 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.550
 with small markets and suddenly 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.170
 so here is so suddenly this 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.920
 video she's super important because 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.450
 it's a video 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.709
 so wait, what are we going to do 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.810
 we're going to send the king now 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.620
 you see for who knows well that's what 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.110
 I wanted to do so now we can 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.180
 send all the waters there bullshit 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.170
 that I did but you see a little that 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.660
 it's been a long time since I have 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.459
 attacked anyway I sent all but 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.540
 all my troops are in the same place 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.100
 to say that if they had a mega good end 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.910
 it was totally finished for me but 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.910
 good it's not a big deal 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.870
 it's a little bit of going here take a 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.110
 little fuck you I have one more 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.340
 fifth it will help you and so the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.600
 blow you see that it's very very 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.790
 for a very long time that I have not done any 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.380
 two videos and it makes me very happy 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.530
 to be able to find you 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.610
 since the time and so the coup here I 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.540
 want to say something important but 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.640
 I do not know how to cross, we do not say it 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.730
 so this video is made 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.320
 to tell you that from here in the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.560

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.730
 I'm going to shoot very soon know 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.079
 that in the video so that would be a 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.530
 very particular video because in 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.380
 the faq video will have the answer to the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.930
 contest for the ipad winner 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.120
 by the way it's a ipad mini 32 gigas 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.200
 to wifi that I will make you win 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.250
 besides could see a little the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.570
 massacre the town hall he fell 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.310
 already for a little while pity that 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.019
 I sent my king a little too much 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.880
 early but it does not matter that it's the 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.470
 not attacking since 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.900
 very very long ben it gives that 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.680
 here's the 50% are done easily so 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.510
 it makes me twenty trophies 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.500
 so suddenly to tell you that in the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.990
 description of this video 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.450

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.220
 questions I will answer to all without any 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.230
 taboo like last time I feel 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.730
 murray is in the city this video has 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.260
 defeated will be a pretty special video 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.940
 because as I wanted to say in the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.870
 video faq 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.580
 I will give the winner of the contest 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.030
 50 thousand subscribers hairston cards from 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.370

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.530
 so I would give I will win I 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.240
 will give the winner but be careful there is 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.169
 a particularity to this contest is to 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.000
 to say that the winner of the ipad if that 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.640
 I'm interested in managing him squarely 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.290
 give the ipad by hand for 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.630
 to be able to film and why not 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.160
 record the video faq ie 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.690
 that he will ask me the questions and I 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.580
 I will answer we film spleen or the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.120
 two where I will film me myself it depends 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.440
 of the person how does she feel so 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.960
 suddenly this is managed to give the ipad in 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.340
 clean hand if she wants it the winner 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.150

 sorry forgiveness Tuesday, August 12, 2014 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.400
 between noon and 2 pm so between noon 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.740
 and 14h try to check your boxes 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.290
 receiving youtube or facebook or twitter 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.940
 it depends on where the draw was 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:02.350
 did that 68% easily down that was 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.490
 a good little attack it was very 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.390
 long time I had not attack that 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.160
 is super fun 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.419
 and what I want to note is that the kind 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.860
 no, but I do not know why you 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.000
 ask to stop increasing here's I 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.240
 never want to notice that the heater 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.860
 plan as it was done at the same time 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.270

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.350
 turn to two or three videos per 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.550

 the courses end of September for 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.660
 those who ask the question is this 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.700

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.670
 customer relations negotiations

 I will try to turn two or even 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.570
 three videos a week but the only 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.980
 thing that slows me down is the time of 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.350
 youtube driver that's all the time 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.460
 extremely long that is to say that I do not 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.110
 do not know why since the last 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.910

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.150
 finally I do not know how to finally say 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.430
 plug my computer into boxing to be able to 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.680

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.650

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.630
 do not know why 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.120
 so that's it I'm going to try to 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.290
 turn at this rate of video you 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.280
