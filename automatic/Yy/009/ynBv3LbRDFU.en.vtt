previous<00:00:03.000> fail<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:04.589> beat<00:00:05.009> it<00:00:05.130> I've<00:00:05.220> never<00:00:05.250> done

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
previous fail to beat it I've never done

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.590 
previous fail to beat it I've never done
this<00:00:05.609> before<00:00:05.790> I<00:00:06.000> think<00:00:06.180> you've<00:00:06.330> encountered

me when I like being I feel a bit ill or
something<00:00:08.910> because<00:00:09.809> I've<00:00:10.019> decided<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.469> you

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
something because I've decided that you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.950 
something because I've decided that you
know<00:00:11.190> instead<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.519> moving<00:00:11.730> on<00:00:12.059> down<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> coast

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
know instead of moving on down the coast

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.299 
know instead of moving on down the coast
and<00:00:13.139> find<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.349> new<00:00:13.469> spot<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.920> normally<00:00:14.190> do

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
and find a new spot like a normally do

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
and find a new spot like a normally do
I've<00:00:14.490> come<00:00:14.969> back<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.360> try<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> fix<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.990> fail

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
I've come back and try to fix this fail

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.230 
I've come back and try to fix this fail
because<00:00:17.190> last<00:00:17.609> time<00:00:17.730> if<00:00:18.029> they'll

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
because last time if they'll

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.820 
because last time if they'll
cataclysmically<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.320> there<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
cataclysmically and there was just a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.080 
cataclysmically and there was just a
massive<00:00:20.130> explosion<00:00:20.449> it's<00:00:21.449> grim<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:22.350> yeah

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
massive explosion it's grim but yeah

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.540 
massive explosion it's grim but yeah
this<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:25.170> don't<00:00:25.500> know<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:26.039> sort<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> like<00:00:26.369> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
this is I don't know it's sort of like a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
we just got fired the first time between

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.490 
we just got fired the first time between
fired<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:41.149> plugging<00:00:42.149> guts<00:00:42.390> everywhere<00:00:42.540> but

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
fired so plugging guts everywhere but

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.229 
fired so plugging guts everywhere but
yea<00:00:44.809> once<00:00:45.809> again<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.469> lever<00:00:47.030> activates<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
yea once again this lever activates the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.290 
yea once again this lever activates the
charge<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.350> lever<00:00:49.559> i<00:00:49.649> chose<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> shot

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
charge and this lever i chose the shot

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.970 
charge and this lever i chose the shot
the<00:00:51.300> cataclysmic<00:00:51.719> failure<00:00:52.020> last<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.590> was<00:00:52.890> I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the cataclysmic failure last time was I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
the cataclysmic failure last time was I
pulled<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.309> lever<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> mistake<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pulled that lever for a mistake and it

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
pulled that lever for a mistake and it
activated<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.280> those<00:00:56.370> charges<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:56.910> well

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
activated one of those charges as well

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.639 
activated one of those charges as well
and<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> entire<00:00:58.109> cannon<00:00:58.559> got

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and just the entire cannon got

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
and just the entire cannon got
annihilated<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.489> destroyed<00:00:59.760> half<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> ocean

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
annihilated and destroyed half the ocean

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
annihilated and destroyed half the ocean
with<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.629> well<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.930> yeah<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.100> wasn't<00:01:02.309> very

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
with it as well so yeah that wasn't very

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
with it as well so yeah that wasn't very
good<00:01:02.579> fun<00:01:02.820> yeah<00:01:03.480> we're<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.930> test<00:01:04.379> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
good fun yeah we're just gonna test this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.179 
good fun yeah we're just gonna test this
thing<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.309> yeah<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:06.770> shot<00:01:07.770> yeah

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
thing now so yeah here you go shot yeah

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.109 
thing now so yeah here you go shot yeah
it's<00:01:08.610> activated<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:11.760> sort<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
it's activated right and then it sort of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.780 
it's activated right and then it sort of
put<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> Matt<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> scatter<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> I'm

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
put to Matt like a scatter so I'm

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
put to Matt like a scatter so I'm
probably<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> call<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> my<00:01:16.490> just

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
probably going to call this my just

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.999 
probably going to call this my just
gonna<00:01:17.610> call<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> scattergun<00:01:18.330> really<00:01:22.009> it's

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
gonna call the scattergun really it's

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.469 
gonna call the scattergun really it's
not<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.880> different<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.450> normal

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
not really very different from a normal

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
not really very different from a normal
camera<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.409> wider<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.189> few<00:01:26.430> systems

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
camera it's just wider and a few systems

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429 
camera it's just wider and a few systems
being<00:01:27.000> changed<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.570> sort<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> compensate

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
being changed to sort of compensate

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.230 
being changed to sort of compensate
because<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.950> quite<00:01:29.250> an<00:01:29.369> awkward<00:01:29.729> mechanism

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
because it's quite an awkward mechanism

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.690 
because it's quite an awkward mechanism
to<00:01:30.270> her<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.439> activate<00:01:32.159> really<00:01:34.520> other<00:01:35.520> than

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
to her to activate really other than

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.950 
to her to activate really other than
that<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:35.939> really<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.780> tell

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that I don't really know what to tell

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.440 
that I don't really know what to tell
you<00:01:37.790> it's<00:01:38.790> not<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.420> changed<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.020> so

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
you it's not really changed at all so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.499 
you it's not really changed at all so
yeah<00:01:43.399> that's<00:01:44.399> basically<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.000> I'm<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
yeah that's basically it I'm going to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.749 
yeah that's basically it I'm going to
modify<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> side<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.890> keep<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.310> redstone

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
modify the side to keep this redstone

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.060 
modify the side to keep this redstone
wire<00:01:48.270> away<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.110> cuz<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.829> pull

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
wire away from that one cuz if you pull

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.280 
wire away from that one cuz if you pull
that<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.570> then<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.869> actuated

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that one then it just actuated

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
that one then it just actuated
everything<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
everything and just the it's

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
everything and just the it's
cataclysmically<00:01:54.840> bad<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.860> yeah<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.219> has

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
cataclysmically bad so yeah this has

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.569 
cataclysmically bad so yeah this has
been<00:01:56.460> alessio<00:01:56.909> showing<00:01:57.570> off<00:01:57.689> my<00:01:57.899> scatter<00:01:58.200> gun
