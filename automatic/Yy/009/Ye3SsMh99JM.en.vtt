day<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.400> actually<00:03:33.730> did<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.390> review<00:03:34.569> on<00:03:34.989> the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
day I actually did a review on the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.020 
day I actually did a review on the
plushies<00:03:35.920> which<00:03:36.280> are<00:03:36.519> much<00:03:37.209> much<00:03:37.540> larger<00:03:37.810> I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
plushies which are much much larger I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.839 
plushies which are much much larger I
think<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.209> one<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.480> about<00:03:41.099> 7<00:03:42.099> or<00:03:42.159> 8<00:03:42.220> inches

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
think this one is about 7 or 8 inches

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.140 
think this one is about 7 or 8 inches
and<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.840> about<00:03:44.349> 3<00:03:44.680> inches<00:03:45.000> isn't<00:03:46.000> this

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
and this is about 3 inches isn't this

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.089 
and this is about 3 inches isn't this
