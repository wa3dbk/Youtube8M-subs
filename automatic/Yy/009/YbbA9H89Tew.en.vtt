00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
well the full-sized aircraft had

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
well the full-sized aircraft had
contra-rotating<00:00:55.410> propellers<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:57.120> thought

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
contra-rotating propellers and I thought

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.549 
contra-rotating propellers and I thought
that<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.719> interesting<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that it would be interesting to see if I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200 
that it would be interesting to see if I
could<00:00:58.620> duplicate<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> model<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
could duplicate that on the model so the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
could duplicate that on the model so the
back<00:01:00.449> three<00:01:00.899> blades<00:01:01.469> spin<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.160> they're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
back three blades spin and then they're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.249 
back three blades spin and then they're
powered<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.329> ones<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> front<00:01:03.989> are

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
freewheeling or is it the other way

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.639
