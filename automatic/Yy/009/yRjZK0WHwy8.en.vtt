00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the sides to the center line just same

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.209 
the sides to the center line just same
with<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> other<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:37.129> and<00:00:38.719> now<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.710> fold<00:00:40.980> this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
take these corners and fold them to the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.010 
take these corners and fold them to the
center<00:01:02.039> let<00:01:02.910> me<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.180> draw<00:01:04.040> see<00:01:06.740> can<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.770> know

center let me just draw see can you know
you<00:01:10.040> want<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> fold<00:01:11.430> these<00:01:12.060> corners<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you want to fold these corners on to the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:23.999 
you want to fold these corners on to the
center<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> paper<00:01:14.189> airplane<00:01:17.360> do<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> same

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
little bit shorter

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.660 
little bit shorter
just<00:01:39.590> cut<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.580> size<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:41.179> want<00:01:41.390> it

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
just cut it the size that you want it

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.469 
just cut it the size that you want it
put<00:01:43.670> about<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:44.119> much<00:01:44.179> off<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.140> now<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:47.299> want

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
put about that much off and now you want

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.529 
put about that much off and now you want
to<00:01:47.539> take<00:01:47.720> these<00:01:48.619> corners<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.520> fold<00:01:50.000> them<00:01:50.149> on

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
to take these corners and fold them on

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.899 
to take these corners and fold them on
to<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.110> center<00:01:51.560> right<00:01:54.549> so<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.700> you'll<00:01:55.850> have

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
to the center right so that you'll have

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.770 
to the center right so that you'll have
this<00:01:57.850> now<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.770> want<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.039> fold<00:02:01.250> these<00:02:02.149> sides<00:02:02.450> to

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
this now you want to fold these sides to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:16.880 
this now you want to fold these sides to
the<00:02:02.869> center<00:02:03.110> line<00:02:10.720> this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.130 

so<00:02:17.890> you'll<00:02:18.040> have<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.820> now<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.570> flip<00:02:20.110> it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
so you'll have this and now you flip it

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.020 
so you'll have this and now you flip it
over<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.830> you<00:02:21.190> should<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.460> this

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
over it you should have this

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.570 
over it you should have this
and<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.110> take<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.500> tip<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.900> tip<00:02:26.580> see

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and you take this tip see that tip see

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.090 
and you take this tip see that tip see
the<00:02:27.700> tip<00:02:27.940> right<00:02:28.150> there

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
the tip right there

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.770 
the tip right there
you<00:02:30.100> take<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.550> tip<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.150> fold<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.540> down

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
you take that tip and you fold it down

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.200 
you take that tip and you fold it down
just<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.470> little<00:02:32.500> bit<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.830> this<00:02:36.100> turn<00:02:37.060> it

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
just a little bit like this turn it

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.740 
just a little bit like this turn it
around<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.750> do<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:37.960> same<00:02:38.230> thing<00:02:39.720> make<00:02:40.720> sure

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
around and do the same thing make sure

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.560 
around and do the same thing make sure
that<00:02:40.990> it's<00:02:41.200> kind<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.680> equal<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.150> flip<00:02:43.420> it

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
that it's kind of equal now you flip it

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.260 
that it's kind of equal now you flip it
over<00:02:43.630> say<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.880> you're

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
over say that you have this and you're

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.670 
over say that you have this and you're
pretty<00:02:46.450> much<00:02:46.570> done<00:02:46.840> you<00:02:46.990> just<00:02:47.200> want<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.440> add<00:02:47.650> a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
pretty much done you just want to add a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.910 
pretty much done you just want to add a
curve<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:50.580> take<00:02:52.740> these<00:02:53.740> edges<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
curve so you just take these edges and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.230 
curve so you just take these edges and
curve<00:02:56.920> them<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:58.510> get<00:02:58.690> creative<00:02:58.990> with<00:02:59.560> them

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
curve them just get creative with them

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.920 
curve them just get creative with them
curve<00:03:01.240> them<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.760> do<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.360> same<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.600> the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
curve them and do the same with the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:13.100 
curve them and do the same with the
other<00:03:05.140> one<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:12.010> will<00:03:12.160> have

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
other one so that you will have

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.450 
other one so that you will have
something<00:03:14.110> like<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:15.990> now<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.890> completed

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
something like this now it's completed

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.930 
something like this now it's completed
now<00:03:19.230> you<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.470> add<00:03:20.770> a<00:03:20.800> design<00:03:21.310> with<00:03:22.060> um<00:03:23.940> with

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
now you can add a design with um with

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.790 
now you can add a design with um with
the<00:03:25.180> pencil<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:28.450> could<00:03:28.600> even<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:29.290> tricks

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
the pencil and you could even do tricks

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.590 
the pencil and you could even do tricks
like<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.370> ollie<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:31.000> stuff<00:03:33.240> but<00:03:34.240> not<00:03:34.390> that
