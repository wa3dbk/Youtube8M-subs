00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 the country is in crisis and the situation 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.870
 economy seems to be more and more 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.300
 complicated 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 the Brazilian squeezes as he can to 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.650
 able to pay the bills and maintain a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.369
 acceptable life 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.050
 It seems a lie but I was thinking of 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.900
 difficulty that the inventor saw 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.060
 opportunity and with some years of 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.820
 research has been able to develop 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.019
 project that can help a lot of people 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.080
 save money 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.290
 the idea seems a bit absurd has 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.739
 people who see it as a utopia but it is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.600
 already spread throughout Brazil in the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.930
 days when gasoline costs around 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.329
 of 3 reais and forty cents a liter 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.219
 have you ever imagined being able to supply your 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.770
 car with water 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.760
 Have you heard of a moving car? 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.420
 the water 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.940
 I saw it through video natanna na 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.140
 internet has already been mine 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 only if it's nightclub, right? 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.200
 or it could be an electric battery, right? 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.630
 battery but not as fuel 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.780
 agostinho with gucci was are buying 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.780
 It's excellent partnership, then. 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.570
 the car fueled with water stopped 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.990
 It is a dream and it is closer than 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.360
 imagine here in umuarama for example already 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.119
 has a vehicle running with the new 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.880
 system and we went to check it out 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.830
 how this equipment just 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.350
 people stopping a lot of people asking 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.990
 works even with what you can give a 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.810
 explanation paradigm and jonata implemented the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.350
 device in your car two weeks ago and 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.330
 according to he already noticed the difference 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.350
 on this trip he was walking average 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.530
 some 350 km with a tank I walked almost 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.020
 530 kilometers without needing to hit c 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.270
 so I already felt a good difference in it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.340
 the nuclear physicist responsible for 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.190
 which appears to be the solution to 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.759
 many problems said that the equipment 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.250
 is the result of five years of research and 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.620
 explained the principle of the idea 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.920
 you have created an equipment that he 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.320
 can remove hydrogen from water and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.470
 this hydrogen that makes the car sling 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.989
 this is exactly the case with water 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.610
 distilled and elan with them will 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.829
 increasing it is a product that will not 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.060
 give over heating it will put 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:33.340
 along with the distilled water and he and he 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.470
 making the electronica within our 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:41.799
 Hydrogen reactor equipment 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.989
 Can you get hydrogen ugh and 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.570
 this hydrogen is directly injected 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.480
 inside the engine along with the air and 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.040
 to bring a gigantic economy July 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.070
 ensures that the appliance can be 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.820
 installed in any car and depending on 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:02.890
 can reach 35% of economy in the city 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.540
 and 63% on the highway according to the engine 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.120
 and the regulation 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.670
 What I realized most was the acceleration 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.569
 when it accelerates it responds more 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.030
 fast 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.030
 than usual he responds before 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.280
 besides collaborating with the pocket 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.820
 the contraption promises to do the engine well and 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.330
 still collaborate with the environment only 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.080
 of it being an equipment that already reduces 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.860
 pollution and 70-90% of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.350
 carbon 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.830
 this is proven in the test this change 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.630
 on the planet would be installed equipment 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.930
 in each of the vehicles that pollute 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.870
 atmosphere to achieve a reduction of 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.020
 pollution and 70-90 percent 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.360
 the appliance is patented and installed and 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.100
 regulated is around three thousand and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.620
 eight hundred reais 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.660
 according to the manufacturer a thousand of them already 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.920
 were sold between brazil and angola 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:10.220
 United States and other countries and the boy 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.200
 not satisfied, he says that the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.560
 project is in constant 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.680
 transformations and for the near future 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.570
 The idea is to use ordinary water as fuel 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.510
 and it has to be a fuel of the future 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.180
 people will be more and more year 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.570
 hydrogen as fuel for their 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.620
 vehicles and stop buying the 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.240
 Gasoline Gasoline is download a day and a 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.370
 day we do not have in our case 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.620
 fully powered by water and we will be able to 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.390
 see if it any water source 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.090
 we are developing to be able to 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.880
 use mineral water even on tap 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.340
 so you do not have to be a vice-mate and think 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.130
 that soon in less than a year this 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.990
 product will already be available to the 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.320
 all the Brazilian people are also out 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.320
 of the agenda
