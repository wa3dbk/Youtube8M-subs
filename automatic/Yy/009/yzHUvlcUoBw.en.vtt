00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
turn to mush like some of the other
cheaper<00:01:09.720> pedals<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:11.189> pedal<00:01:11.490> itself<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
cheaper pedals do the pedal itself is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
cheaper pedals do the pedal itself is
very<00:01:12.210> simple<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.930> only<00:01:13.049> has<00:01:13.260> three<00:01:13.590> knobs<00:01:13.799> on

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
very simple it only has three knobs on

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
very simple it only has three knobs on
it<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> gain<00:01:14.909> knob<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it so you have a gain knob you have a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
it so you have a gain knob you have a
tone<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> volume<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.700> need

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
tone in a volume and that's all you need

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.749 
tone in a volume and that's all you need
the<00:01:18.509> sweep<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.159> individual<00:01:20.159> knobs<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the sweep on the individual knobs is

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.940 
the sweep on the individual knobs is
plenty<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.750> able<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> range

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
plenty to be able to get it to the range

they don't nice smooth sweep to them the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.490 
they don't nice smooth sweep to them the
switch<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.250> solid<00:01:35.759> no<00:01:36.420> rattling<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.350> don't

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.130 
hear any noise which is a comforting the
only<00:01:41.250> disadvantage<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.960> not

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
only disadvantage and if you it's not

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.710 
only disadvantage and if you it's not
really<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> disadvantage<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.850> pedal<00:01:45.210> does

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
really a disadvantage but the pedal does

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.170 
really a disadvantage but the pedal does
not<00:01:45.930> take<00:01:46.290> batteries<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:48.030> too

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
not take batteries because it's just too

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
not take batteries because it's just too
small<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.920> use<00:01:50.040> batteries<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
small so if you like to use batteries in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.179

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.130 
pedal for me it's not an issue at all
because<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.350> prefer<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.250> constant<00:02:00.140> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
because I prefer to have constant you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.039 
because I prefer to have constant you
know<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.340> constant<00:02:02.340> flow<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.700> voltage<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.899> my

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
know a constant flow of voltage to my

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.350 
know a constant flow of voltage to my
pedals<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
pedals so the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.109 
pedals so the
turn<00:02:05.630> into<00:02:05.900> mush<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.650> change<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.670> tone<00:02:07.880> while

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
turn into mush and change the tone while

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.540 
turn into mush and change the tone while
you're<00:02:08.270> playing<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.590> always<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.009> case<00:02:10.130> as

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you're playing as is always the case as

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.060 
you're playing as is always the case as
a<00:02:10.580> but<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.120> batteries<00:02:11.480> run<00:02:11.660> run<00:02:12.170> dry<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.860> I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
a but the batteries run run dry so I

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.180 
a but the batteries run run dry so I
prefer<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:14.260> consistent<00:02:15.260> voltage

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
prefer to have consistent voltage

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.570 
prefer to have consistent voltage
pointing<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.700> my<00:02:16.820> pedals<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.950> really<00:02:19.280> does

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
pointing to my pedals and it really does

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.860 
pointing to my pedals and it really does
sound<00:02:19.880> great<00:02:20.120> so

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
sound great so

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.320 
sound great so
oh<00:02:20.900> yeah<00:02:21.800> no<00:02:21.980> more<00:02:22.160> thing<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.550> because<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
oh yeah no more thing the because the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.180 
oh yeah no more thing the because the
knob<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.720> clear<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.290> they<00:02:24.710> put<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> LED

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
knob is clear and they put the LED

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.340 
knob is clear and they put the LED
almost<00:02:25.820> underneath<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.420> knob<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:27.110> gives<00:02:27.290> you

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
almost underneath the knob it gives you

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.020 
almost underneath the knob it gives you
a<00:02:27.380> really<00:02:27.620> cool<00:02:27.860> effect<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.400> knob<00:02:28.550> lights<00:02:28.850> up

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
a really cool effect that knob lights up

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.230 
a really cool effect that knob lights up
you<00:02:29.390> know<00:02:29.480> something<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:30.020> little<00:02:30.290> different<00:02:31.240> so

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
you know something a little different so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.110 
you know something a little different so
