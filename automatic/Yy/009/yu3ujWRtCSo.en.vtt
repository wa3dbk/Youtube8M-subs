that<00:06:08.009> we<00:06:08.340> can<00:06:08.610> get<00:06:08.820> something<00:06:09.120> out<00:06:09.389> of<00:06:09.419> it

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889

that we can get something out of it
however<00:06:10.889> for<00:06:11.310> me<00:06:11.699> it's<00:06:12.000> more<00:06:12.419> about<00:06:12.659> the

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
however for me it's more about the

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.480 
however for me it's more about the
passion<00:06:13.169> is<00:06:13.530> more<00:06:13.740> about<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.039> love<00:06:14.250> of

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
passion is more about the love of

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.370 
passion is more about the love of
designing<00:06:15.030> having<00:06:15.479> having<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:16.050> opportunity
