40 little second you last Oh tree well
that's<00:00:22.020> my<00:00:22.199> point<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.590> view<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.769> made<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> same

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
that's my point of view I made the same

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.029 
that's my point of view I made the same
strategy<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.060> i<00:00:24.420> did<00:00:24.630> before<00:00:25.070> yesterday<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
strategy as i did before yesterday and

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.120 
strategy as i did before yesterday and
he<00:00:29.039> changed<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.550> today<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.779> i<00:00:31.320> didn't<00:00:32.040> expect

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
he changed up today so i didn't expect

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.229 
he changed up today so i didn't expect
that<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.820> he<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.630> walked<00:00:34.590> over<00:00:34.739> me<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that and he just walked over me so you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.330 
that and he just walked over me so you
could<00:00:36.390> say<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.680> fact<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.129> never

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
could say that the fact that you never

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.420 
could say that the fact that you never
scout<00:00:38.730> had<00:00:39.390> an<00:00:39.510> impact<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> match<00:00:40.430> not

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
scout had an impact on the match not

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.630 
scout had an impact on the match not
really<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:43.170> changed<00:00:43.920> his<00:00:43.950> rally<00:00:44.250> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
really because he changed his rally in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
really because he changed his rally in
the<00:00:44.850> middle<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> game<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:46.079> i<00:00:46.320> would

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
because it's I don't think it gives you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.110 
because it's I don't think it gives you
any<00:00:59.609> good<00:01:00.480> information<00:01:01.170> like<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.000> only
