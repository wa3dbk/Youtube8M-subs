00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.400 
here I'd really like to have a large one
for<00:00:43.789> my<00:00:44.030> lathe<00:00:44.270> instead<00:00:44.719> of<00:00:44.809> using<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.170> keyed

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
for my lathe instead of using the keyed

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.979 
for my lathe instead of using the keyed
like<00:00:45.680> Jacobs<00:00:46.250> but<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:46.910> just<00:00:47.180> can't<00:00:47.420> justify<00:00:47.780> the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
like Jacobs but I just can't justify the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.799 
like Jacobs but I just can't justify the
cost<00:00:48.609> and<00:00:49.609> then<00:00:49.789> it<00:00:49.940> has<00:00:50.090> this<00:00:50.359> sensitive

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
cost and then it has this sensitive

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.180 
cost and then it has this sensitive

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
your drill press and you see this finger

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.700 
your drill press and you see this finger
wheel<00:01:51.890> here<00:01:52.160> spins<00:01:52.640> on<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.090> bearing<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.200> as<00:01:54.380> your

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
wheel here spins on a bearing so as your

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.330 
wheel here spins on a bearing so as your
as<00:01:55.240> its<00:01:56.240> spinning<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:57.470> reach<00:01:57.680> up<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.190> can

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
as its spinning you reach up and you can

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.640 
as its spinning you reach up and you can
you<00:01:58.580> get<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.730> real<00:01:59.000> good<00:01:59.030> tactile<00:01:59.780> feel<00:02:00.080> so<00:02:00.410> it

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
you get a real good tactile feel so it

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.650 
you get a real good tactile feel so it
helps<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.310> minimizing<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.120> breakage<00:02:02.540> of

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
helps and minimizing the breakage of
