be<00:00:44.960> top<00:00:45.200> 10<00:00:45.710> top<00:00:46.010> 5<00:00:46.390> from<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.720> great<00:00:48.410> top<00:00:48.650> three

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
be top 10 top 5 from a great top three

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.130 
be top 10 top 5 from a great top three
absolutely<00:00:50.540> that<00:00:50.750> would<00:00:50.780> be<00:00:50.900> and<00:00:51.530> be<00:00:51.830> perfect

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
absolutely that would be and be perfect

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.690 
absolutely that would be and be perfect
having<00:00:54.140> never<00:00:54.260> done<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.740> Giro<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.310> Couture<00:00:55.610> I

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
having never done the Giro and Couture I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.940 
having never done the Giro and Couture I
have<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.120> be<00:00:56.270> aware<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.290> it's<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.770> difficult

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
have to be aware that it's a difficult

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.500 
have to be aware that it's a difficult
thing<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.430> do<00:00:58.700> in<00:00:58.880> somebody<00:00:59.180> have<00:00:59.270> never

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
thing to do in somebody have never

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.040 
thing to do in somebody have never
experienced<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:01.270> will<00:01:02.270> come<00:01:02.450> into<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.810> Giro

as<00:01:03.290> fit<00:01:03.650> as<00:01:03.680> we<00:01:03.980> can<00:01:04.159> possibly<00:01:04.189> be<00:01:04.759> so<00:01:05.600> you

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
as fit as we can possibly be so you

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.070 
as fit as we can possibly be so you
don't<00:01:05.780> want<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:05.960> kill<00:01:06.110> yourself<00:01:06.259> I<00:01:07.869> think<00:01:08.869> I

think there are other riders that are

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.550 
think there are other riders that are
perhaps<00:01:12.530> more<00:01:12.950> more<00:01:13.430> motivated<00:01:14.030> than<00:01:14.470> some<00:01:15.470> of

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
perhaps more more motivated than some of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.310
