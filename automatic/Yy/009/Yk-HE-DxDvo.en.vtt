00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.410
 and muscle congestion is a process 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.690
 that takes place due to the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.180
 Redistribution of blood in the body 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.100
 to favor the arrival of oxygen and 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.870
 maintain the energy system in 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.680
 functioning in the muscles that are 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.780
 use like this if we're working the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.210
 biceps the rest of the organs do not 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.520
 they need more blood flow through 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.770
 so this is directed towards the muscles 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.770
 worked to favor its proper 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.570
 work oxygenate the and then collaborate 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.719
 in the elimination of products from 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.030
 scrap as we can see the congestion 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.479
 muscle is a fundamental process for 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.489
 our muscles muscle congestion 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.829
 it is a necessary process for the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.049
 muscles grow and develop but 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.510
 Of course, not always 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:53.670
 congestion there will be hypertrophy since it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.589
 it needs a good stimulus that pushes 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.649
 to the muscle to adapt for later 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.870
 grow that is to say it requires a 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.789
 adequate training that asks for a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.640
 correct muscle response for the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.980
 growth once we have a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 correct training congestion 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.690
 muscular is necessary to favors 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.700
 and development by nourishing muscles and 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.490
 contribute to your repair process 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.800
 which enables the growth 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 remarkable appearance of swollen muscles 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.200
 when we just trained and up to 30 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 minutes later it is due to congestion 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 of blood flow in our muscles 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.820
 that is why this circumstantial change must 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.560
 be present in any process of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.310
 muscle development for us to see 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.620
 after a real growth the reality 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 shows that muscle congestion by 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.910
 concentrate the bloodstream with your 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.670
 oxygen nutrients and water in an area 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.950
 Muscle helps growth without 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.130
 However, this is not essential nor 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.410
 enough to achieve hypertrophy as 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.750
 you know hypertrophy requires before 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.210
 all of a good training that generates 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.369
 stress and muscle damage as well as a 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.250
 adequate period of rest and good 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.770
 diet so that the recovery of origin 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.979
 to larger volume muscles capable of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.840
 support a greater effort and while the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.850
 congestion that can cause 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.130
 realization of super series or series 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.720
 multiple in a muscle group 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.240
 now with this process of hypertrophy 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.880
 we can also generate enough damage 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.400
 in a muscle to later produce 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.960
 anabolism and growth without it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 congest blood in the area 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.150
 affected is to say without swelling the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.750
 muscle cells because of the type of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.670
 work likewise there may be congestion 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.550
 muscular due to good training 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.650
 but if we do not rest properly or 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.660
 we accompany with good diet the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.750
 congestion is not enough to 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.520
 produce congestion hypertrophy 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.010
 muscle generates a good feeling 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.200
 while we train intensely and from 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.180
 sure speaks of the great effort we have 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.980
 done but if you want to grow it is not 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.050
 essential that your muscles are 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.210
 congest during work or 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.180
 It should not be the only thing you're looking for 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.730
 -To hypertrophy remember the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.860
 Muscle congestion helps to grow but 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.340
 it is not enough or essential for 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.340
 achieve it
