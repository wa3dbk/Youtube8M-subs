00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.700
 practically 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.930
 carbohydrate intake of carbohydrates completely illuminated 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.330
 in this way using particular abate appeals especially 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.649
 tell all kinds of proteins

 they were therefore two mechanisms 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 which are called ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.710
 gluconeogenesis to the formation of glucose by beauty in june 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.260
 let's say the moscolari 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.999
 the new and therefore particles of thing 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:14.229
 micaela ketogenesi here is a production process of the so-called bodies 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.379
