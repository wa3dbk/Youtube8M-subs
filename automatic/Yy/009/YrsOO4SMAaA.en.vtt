00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
this tutorial I'll be showing you how to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.850 
this tutorial I'll be showing you how to
how<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.580> make<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.000> shape<00:00:12.240> how<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.049> cut<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.650> stack

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
how I make the shape how I cut and stack

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.000 
how I make the shape how I cut and stack
the<00:00:14.610> foam<00:00:15.120> boards<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.260> spray<00:00:16.529> foam<00:00:16.740> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the foam boards and you spray foam and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.800 
the foam boards and you spray foam and
carved<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.900> carve<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> foam<00:00:19.640> so<00:00:20.689> basically<00:00:21.689> I

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
carved the carve the foam so basically I

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.890 
carved the carve the foam so basically I
just<00:00:22.230> use<00:00:22.789> photos<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:24.060> printouts<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
just use photos or printouts of the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.830 
just use photos or printouts of the
splash<00:00:25.140> page<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.340> go<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.510> model

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
splash page or I go to the model

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080 
splash page or I go to the model
websites<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> can<00:00:29.429> get<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> good<00:00:29.910> angle

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
websites so that I can get a good angle

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.840 
websites so that I can get a good angle
of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.219> weapon<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.850> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
of the weapon so here I have it and the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.580 
of the weapon so here I have it and the
first<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.420> drew<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> thought<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> was<00:00:37.260> okay

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
first one I drew I thought it was okay

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.860 
first one I drew I thought it was okay
but<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.920> ended<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.340> cutting<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
but I ended up cutting it up and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.060 
but I ended up cutting it up and
reshaping<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.469> sometimes<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.800> trial

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
reshaping it so sometimes it's a trial

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.299 
reshaping it so sometimes it's a trial
and<00:00:44.280> error<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.840> still<00:00:45.840> ended<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.230> using<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.190> one

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and error I still ended up using the one

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160 
and error I still ended up using the one
that<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> cut<00:00:47.730> up<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> stacked<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.020> I

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that I cut up so when I stacked it I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
that I cut up so when I stacked it I
just<00:00:49.230> put<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.610> between<00:00:50.820> anyways

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
just put that one in between anyways

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.139 
just put that one in between anyways
just<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.050> waste<00:00:52.140> any<00:00:52.410> foam<00:00:52.590> board

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
just so I don't waste any foam board

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.939 
just so I don't waste any foam board
once<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.329> glue<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> forms<00:00:55.170> foam<00:00:55.590> boards

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
once you glue all the forms foam boards

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
once you glue all the forms foam boards
together<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:57.239> use<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> great<00:01:00.149> stuff<00:01:00.420> gap

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
together you use a the great stuff gap

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
together you use a the great stuff gap
filler<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.800> home<00:01:01.829> hardware

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
filler that you can get at home hardware

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.780 
filler that you can get at home hardware
stores<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.799> spray<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> onto<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
stores and you can spray it onto the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.359 
stores and you can spray it onto the
foam<00:01:05.970> board<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.710> did<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> basement

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
foam board so I did it in the basement

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.240 
foam board so I did it in the basement
that<00:01:08.640> slide<00:01:08.820> still<00:01:09.090> dark<00:01:09.330> um<00:01:09.740> sorry<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that slide still dark um sorry for the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.370 
that slide still dark um sorry for the
video<00:01:11.369> quality<00:01:11.810> hopefully<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.110> still

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
video quality hopefully you can still

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.670 
video quality hopefully you can still
understand<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:14.159> I'm<00:01:14.310> doing<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.200> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
understand what I'm doing so this is a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.679 
understand what I'm doing so this is a
step<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> didn't<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.939> ribbon<00:01:18.270> cosplay

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
step I didn't do with the ribbon cosplay

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.210 
step I didn't do with the ribbon cosplay
because<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.049> felt<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.350> didn't<00:01:19.560> need<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.070> with

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
because I felt I didn't need it but with

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.120 
because I felt I didn't need it but with
this<00:01:20.340> since<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.060> um<00:01:21.470> since<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> has<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> lot<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this since it's um since it has a lot of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420 
this since it's um since it has a lot of
pointed<00:01:23.909> areas<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.659> felt<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.189> spray<00:01:26.400> foam

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
pointed areas I felt that the spray foam

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
pointed areas I felt that the spray foam
was<00:01:26.759> necessary<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.560> stack<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
was necessary because if you stack the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
was necessary because if you stack the
foam<00:01:29.250> board<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.790> would<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.090> been<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> waste

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
foam board it would have been a waste

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749 
foam board it would have been a waste
and<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> lot<00:01:31.829> easier<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and it's just a lot easier with the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.200 
and it's just a lot easier with the
spray<00:01:33.479> foam<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.060> me

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
spray foam so here you can see me

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
spray foam so here you can see me
spraying<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.439> expands<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> lot<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
spraying it on and it expands a lot and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
spraying it on and it expands a lot and
it<00:01:38.460> comes<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.729> pretty<00:01:38.850> fast<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:40.009> it's<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.100> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it comes out pretty fast so it's not a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.560 
it comes out pretty fast so it's not a
big<00:01:41.340> deal<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> spill<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.540> just

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
big deal if you spill it you can just

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
big deal if you spill it you can just
cut<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> off<00:01:43.140> anyways<00:01:45.799> it's<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:47.250> sticky<00:01:47.490> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
cut it off anyways it's really sticky so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.990 
cut it off anyways it's really sticky so
don't<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.600> their<00:01:48.720> hands<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.490> try<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> do

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
don't get out on their hands I try to do

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.929 
don't get out on their hands I try to do
half<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.320> weapon<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.820> other

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
half of the weapon and then the other

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
half of the weapon and then the other
half<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.630> basically<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.890> you're<00:01:56.070> done<00:01:56.250> doing

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
half so basically when you're done doing

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.709 
half so basically when you're done doing
one<00:01:56.670> half<00:01:57.229> wait<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.590> dry<00:01:58.799> at<00:01:59.009> least<00:01:59.719> 30

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
one half wait for it to dry at least 30

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:09.460 
one half wait for it to dry at least 30
minutes

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.130 

you

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.640 

if<00:02:17.650> anything<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:18.960> touch<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:19.990> to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
if anything you can just touch it to

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.130 
if anything you can just touch it to
make<00:02:20.800> sure<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.250> dry<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:22.450> after<00:02:22.930> 30

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
make sure that is dry so after 30

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.790 
make sure that is dry so after 30
minutes

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
minutes

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.480 
minutes
I<00:02:24.640> checked<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.830> can<00:02:27.010> tell<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.340> it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
I checked here and you can tell that it

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.190 
I checked here and you can tell that it
wasn't<00:02:27.640> ready<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.150> be<00:02:28.270> turned<00:02:28.420> over<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.080> do

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
wasn't ready to be turned over and to do

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.380 
wasn't ready to be turned over and to do
the<00:02:29.320> other<00:02:29.440> side<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.700> reason<00:02:30.820> why<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.120> rush

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the other side the reason why I rush

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.990 
the other side the reason why I rush
this<00:02:31.600> is<00:02:31.660> because<00:02:32.110> I'm<00:02:32.260> not<00:02:32.380> sure<00:02:32.650> how<00:02:33.010> this

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
this is because I'm not sure how this

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.640 
this is because I'm not sure how this
very<00:02:34.270> phone<00:02:34.450> would<00:02:34.600> work<00:02:34.630> afterwards<00:02:35.260> because

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
very phone would work afterwards because

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.770 
very phone would work afterwards because
it's<00:02:35.800> supposed<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.040> be<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.220> one-time<00:02:36.580> use<00:02:36.790> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
it's supposed to be a one-time use so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.570 
it's supposed to be a one-time use so
once<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.560> harder<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.130> turn<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.460> over

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
once it's harder you can turn it over

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.630 
once it's harder you can turn it over
and<00:02:39.760> spray<00:02:40.390> from<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.630> other<00:02:40.780> side<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> here

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
and spray from the other side so here

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.180 
and spray from the other side so here
you<00:02:42.760> can<00:02:42.910> see<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.630> had<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.830> buy<00:02:45.160> another

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
you can see that I had to buy another

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.730 
you can see that I had to buy another
spray<00:02:45.790> foam<00:02:46.000> because<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.720> wasn't<00:02:47.140> enough<00:02:47.410> and

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
spray foam because it wasn't enough and

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.910 
spray foam because it wasn't enough and
I<00:02:48.370> still<00:02:48.760> needed<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.780> be<00:02:49.900> more<00:02:50.200> pointed<00:02:50.620> at

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
I still needed it to be more pointed at

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.370 
I still needed it to be more pointed at
the<00:02:51.010> top<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:52.000> I<00:02:52.060> added<00:02:52.300> more<00:02:52.630> one<00:02:52.990> side<00:02:53.170> took

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
the top so I added more one side took

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.060 
the top so I added more one side took
half<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.770> first<00:02:54.010> time<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:56.020> this<00:02:56.680> was<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
half the first time so this was the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.830 
half the first time so this was the
first<00:02:57.220> time<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.640> carved<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.209> just<00:02:58.450> did<00:02:58.600> one

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
first time that I carved I just did one

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.520 
first time that I carved I just did one
layer<00:02:59.050> because<00:02:59.560> um<00:03:00.840> once<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:01.959> did<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.380> Lee

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
layer because um once I did the one Lee

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.330 
layer because um once I did the one Lee
I<00:03:02.560> realized<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.310> wasn't<00:03:03.459> tall<00:03:03.880> enough

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
I realized that it wasn't tall enough

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.830 
I realized that it wasn't tall enough
see<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.520> really<00:03:06.880> easy<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.209> carve<00:03:07.510> with<00:03:07.690> an

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
see it's really easy to carve with an

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.480 
see it's really easy to carve with an
exacto<00:03:08.380> knife<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:10.860> you'll<00:03:11.860> have<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> lot

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
exacto knife and you'll have like a lot

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.680 
exacto knife and you'll have like a lot
of<00:03:12.520> bubbles<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:14.820> that's<00:03:15.820> why<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.090> would<00:03:16.480> do<00:03:16.570> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
of bubbles so that's why I would do the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.840 
of bubbles so that's why I would do the
paper<00:03:16.870> mache<00:03:17.380> after<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:18.070> step<00:03:18.370> which<00:03:18.670> I'll

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
paper mache after this step which I'll

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.060 
paper mache after this step which I'll
show<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.120> another<00:03:19.209> video<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:23.230> this<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.739> when<00:03:24.040> I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
show in another video so this is when I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.780 
show in another video so this is when I
spray<00:03:24.400> foam<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.760> second<00:03:25.120> time<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:26.440> was

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
spray foam the second time and it was

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.060 
spray foam the second time and it was
high<00:03:27.790> enough<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.780> was<00:03:29.260> able<00:03:29.380> to<00:03:29.530> cut<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
high enough that I was able to cut the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.650 
high enough that I was able to cut the
exact<00:03:30.310> shape<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.610> wanted<00:03:32.880> when<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.910> cut<00:03:34.510> this

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
exact shape I wanted when you cut this

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.060 
exact shape I wanted when you cut this
way<00:03:34.870> foam<00:03:35.110> it's<00:03:35.410> really<00:03:35.709> messy<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:37.320> if<00:03:38.320> you're

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
way foam it's really messy so if you're

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.890 
way foam it's really messy so if you're
really<00:03:39.430> worried<00:03:39.880> about<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.360> being<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.750> your

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
really worried about it being on your

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.930 
really worried about it being on your
carpet<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.470> suggest<00:03:41.830> putting<00:03:41.980> some<00:03:42.310> paper<00:03:42.670> down

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
carpet I suggest putting some paper down

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.660 
carpet I suggest putting some paper down
so<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.300> can<00:03:43.540> throw<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.750> all<00:03:43.900> out<00:03:43.930> at<00:03:44.320> once

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
so you can throw it all out at once

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.979 
so you can throw it all out at once
because<00:03:45.670> keeping<00:03:46.390> track<00:03:46.570> of<00:03:46.600> all<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
because keeping track of all the

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.130 
because keeping track of all the
carvings<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.560> really<00:03:48.040> difficult<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.840> once<00:03:50.019> it

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
carvings is really difficult so once it

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.930 
carvings is really difficult so once it
again<00:03:50.350> you'll<00:03:50.830> see<00:03:51.190> me<00:03:51.340> referring<00:03:51.760> back<00:03:51.880> to

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
again you'll see me referring back to

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.960 
again you'll see me referring back to
the<00:03:52.209> images<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.989> make<00:03:53.110> sure<00:03:53.320> it's<00:03:54.220> exactly<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
the images to make sure it's exactly the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.070 
the images to make sure it's exactly the
way<00:03:55.000> it's<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.019> game<00:03:56.170> model<00:03:56.910> if<00:03:58.080> anything

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
way it's in the game model if anything

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.770 
way it's in the game model if anything
you<00:03:59.320> can<00:03:59.500> glue<00:03:59.739> the<00:04:00.430> spray<00:04:00.670> foam<00:04:00.880> back<00:04:01.180> on<00:04:01.450> if

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
you can glue the spray foam back on if

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.740 
you can glue the spray foam back on if
you<00:04:01.900> make<00:04:02.050> a<00:04:02.080> mistake<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:03.239> never<00:04:04.239> have<00:04:04.450> trouble

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
you make a mistake I never have trouble

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.430 
you make a mistake I never have trouble
with<00:04:04.840> that<00:04:06.120> so<00:04:07.120> basically<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.810> want<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.170> spray

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
with that so basically you want to spray

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.890 
with that so basically you want to spray
foam<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:09.190> shape<00:04:09.850> as<00:04:10.090> close<00:04:10.720> as<00:04:10.870> possible

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
foam the shape as close as possible

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.620 
foam the shape as close as possible
because<00:04:11.590> once<00:04:12.580> you<00:04:12.760> add<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:12.940> paper<00:04:13.180> mache<00:04:13.600> and

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
because once you add the paper mache and

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.900 
because once you add the paper mache and
the<00:04:13.870> fast<00:04:14.080> machine<00:04:14.440> you<00:04:14.530> want<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.040> be<00:04:15.220> you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
the fast machine you want it to be you

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.159 
the fast machine you want it to be you
still<00:04:16.150> want<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.510> be<00:04:16.600> light<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.900> don't<00:04:16.989> want

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
still want it to be light you don't want

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.759 
still want it to be light you don't want
it<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.380> be<00:04:17.500> heavy<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:20.229> fast<00:04:20.440> Munchie

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
it to be heavy and the the fast Munchie

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.890 
it to be heavy and the the fast Munchie
is<00:04:20.919> what<00:04:21.130> makes<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.549> heavy<00:04:21.729> so<00:04:22.090> I'm<00:04:22.330> trying<00:04:22.630> as

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
is what makes it heavy so I'm trying as

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.810 
is what makes it heavy so I'm trying as
much<00:04:23.229> as<00:04:23.380> possible<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.919> get<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> exact<00:04:24.640> shape

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
much as possible to get the exact shape

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.290 
much as possible to get the exact shape
that<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.000> want<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:26.229> fast<00:04:26.440> mache<00:04:26.890> will<00:04:27.300> make

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
that I want and the fast mache will make

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.970 
that I want and the fast mache will make
it<00:04:28.510> more<00:04:28.630> durable<00:04:28.840> and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
it more durable and

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.520 
it more durable and
mooo<00:04:30.130> there<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:31.450> give<00:04:31.660> it<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:31.930> nice<00:04:32.200> appearance

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
mooo there and give it a nice appearance

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.040 
mooo there and give it a nice appearance
so<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.730> just<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.330> spray<00:04:34.540> foam<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.840> just

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
so this is just the spray foam is just

00:04:35.050 --> 00:05:02.730 
so this is just the spray foam is just
to<00:04:35.200> create<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.620> shape

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.500 

so<00:05:03.400> here's<00:05:03.700> the<00:05:03.880> final<00:05:05.430> weapon<00:05:06.430> after<00:05:07.060> the

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
so here's the final weapon after the

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.650 
so here's the final weapon after the
carving<00:05:07.960> is<00:05:08.080> done<00:05:08.290> this<00:05:08.980> is<00:05:09.160> exactly<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:10.510> way

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
carving is done this is exactly the way

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.930 
carving is done this is exactly the way
I<00:05:10.690> want<00:05:11.110> it<00:05:11.320> realistically<00:05:12.070> by<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.490> end<00:05:12.670> of<00:05:12.790> it

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
I want it realistically by the end of it

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.210 
I want it realistically by the end of it
just<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.960> holes<00:05:14.170> covered<00:05:14.590> and<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.070> more

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
just the holes covered and it more

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.400 
just the holes covered and it more
smooth<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:16.360> as<00:05:16.450> you<00:05:16.570> can<00:05:16.690> see<00:05:16.750> everything<00:05:17.260> is

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
smooth so as you can see everything is

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.850 
smooth so as you can see everything is
as<00:05:17.650> is<00:05:18.280> or<00:05:18.640> should<00:05:19.120> be<00:05:19.180> axes<00:05:19.660> as<00:05:19.900> closest<00:05:20.740> to

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
as is or should be axes as closest to

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.710 
as is or should be axes as closest to
the<00:05:20.950> final<00:05:21.250> as<00:05:21.340> possible<00:05:22.980> anyways<00:05:23.980> I<00:05:24.450> hope<00:05:25.450> you
