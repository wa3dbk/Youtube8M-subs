 from sugar mastic proceed for 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.400
 making orchids we will 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.230
 use sugar mastic for 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.220
 making flowers how to make 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 look on our channel cry made white 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 purple and yellow also dry paint 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 Plum color felling for orchids 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.540
 phalaenopsis 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.730
 print tape tape and wire number 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.710
 24 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.629
 To begin with, we use pliers to separate 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.629
 a wire into five equal parts 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:52.370
 then roll out very thinly and with 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:55.890
 by cutting, we make the lower petal and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.230
 yellow mastic make 2 small balls 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.640
 very small stamens do 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 one ball which is a little bigger 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.430
 get us 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.250
 dress up on a wire form a stamen and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.250
 with the help of a knife give it shape 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.369
 dividing it conditionally into two parts 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.470
 petal a little roll by 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.520
 round metal tool and 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 share the tail of the lower petal 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:41.119
 cheat it on a toothpick attach 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.119
 he has the shape of our orchid 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:52.159
 little yellow glue on the bottom 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.610
 petal and dry it in a plastic spoon 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.890
 make side lobes small 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 amount of white mastic we put on 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.020
 wire and very thin roll out with 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.829
 by cutting side lobes 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.470
 we give the petal form and remove the excess 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.470
 mastic 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.330
 using the imprint we give the petal 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.740
 texture 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.680
 dry petal exactly the same in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.380
 plastic spoons of such petals we have 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.500
 should be 2 next 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.100
 in the same way we make the lower bowls 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.500
 leaves for our orchid 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.150
 thin roll out shape with 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.720
 using cutting and texture using 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.320
 the impression is exactly the same two lower chisel and 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.500
 sepal dry 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.350
 plastic spoon and just like 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.459
 previous petals make the top 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.360
 sepal he us one we attach a wagon with 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.959
 using cutting, we make an impression 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.570
 and leave to dry all the petals in 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.650
 half an hour later half an hour later and 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.100
 the petals are dry we can paint them 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.740
 paint dry paint color sri lego 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:15.489
 we paint movements from a wire down 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:22.700
 distributing our dry paint over 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:24.160
 the petal is further collected we collect our 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.920
 orchids 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.730
 We connect to the bottom with the lower lobe 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:37.900
 we twist with tape 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.900
 then fasten the upper sepal 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.820
 in the same way we connect all this with 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.519
 tape tapes 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:51.519
 fix and wind it tightly on 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 procrastination 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:04:00.890
 then fasten lower quieter leaves 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.170
 fasten them at once two exactly the same 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.439
 can two together with groups to attach and 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.489
 side lobes attach them 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:14.650
 last thing we fix well 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:18.139
 delays using tape 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.160
 straighten our petals if needed 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:27.070
 slightly bend the wire and our 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.070
 Phalaenopsis orchid flower ready
