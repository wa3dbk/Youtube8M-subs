all right guys this is a response to a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.710 
all right guys this is a response to a
viewer<00:00:02.220> who<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.550> watching<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.030> third<00:00:03.270> step<00:00:03.600> of

my<00:00:03.899> 4x4<00:00:04.589> Rubik's<00:00:04.770> Cube<00:00:05.250> tutorial<00:00:05.790> which<00:00:06.210> goes

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
my 4x4 Rubik's Cube tutorial which goes

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.629 
my 4x4 Rubik's Cube tutorial which goes
over<00:00:06.750> how<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.960> solve<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.529> remaining<00:00:07.950> parity

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
over how to solve the remaining parity

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.990 
over how to solve the remaining parity
cases<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> 4x4<00:00:09.960> cube<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:11.190> if<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.759> look<00:00:11.910> at

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
cases in the 4x4 cube so if you look at

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.450 
cases in the 4x4 cube so if you look at
the<00:00:12.090> 4x4<00:00:12.599> cube<00:00:12.809> i'm<00:00:12.929> holding<00:00:13.230> here<00:00:13.259> these<00:00:14.099> two

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the 4x4 cube i'm holding here these two

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.150 
the 4x4 cube i'm holding here these two
pieces<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.480> basically<00:00:15.839> been<00:00:16.139> switched<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
pieces have basically been switched the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.560 
pieces have basically been switched the
orange<00:00:17.490> edge<00:00:17.699> piece<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.270> blue<00:00:18.539> side

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
orange edge piece is on the blue side

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.230 
orange edge piece is on the blue side
and<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.740> blued<00:00:19.980> edge<00:00:20.160> piece<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and the blued edge piece is on the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.540 
and the blued edge piece is on the
orange<00:00:21.660> side<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> look<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> remaining

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
orange side if you look at the remaining

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.670 
orange side if you look at the remaining
two<00:00:23.789> sides<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.420> complete<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
two sides they are complete this is a

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.890 
two sides they are complete this is a
case<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.279> will<00:00:26.519> never<00:00:26.730> see<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> 3x3

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
case which you will never see in a 3x3

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.250 
case which you will never see in a 3x3
cube<00:00:28.429> what<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.849> see<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.449> 3x3<00:00:31.050> cube

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
cube what you do see in a 3x3 cube

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.830 
cube what you do see in a 3x3 cube
however<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.489> look<00:00:32.730> at<00:00:32.850> my<00:00:32.969> seventh<00:00:33.510> step

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
however if you look at my seventh step

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.130 
however if you look at my seventh step
of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.530> 3x3<00:00:34.860> tutorial<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.540> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
of the 3x3 tutorial is that you have you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
of the 3x3 tutorial is that you have you
can<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.530> frequently<00:00:38.370> actually<00:00:38.579> get<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.210> solid

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
can you frequently actually get a solid

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.229 
can you frequently actually get a solid
side<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.800> three<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.280> proper<00:00:42.030> edge

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
side and you get three in proper edge

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.889 
side and you get three in proper edge
pieces<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> top<00:00:43.350> layer<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.719> want

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
pieces on the top layer so what we want

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.420 
pieces on the top layer so what we want
to<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.289> want<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> basically<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.280> so

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to do is we want to basically get it so

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
to do is we want to basically get it so
that<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.700> looks<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> 3x3<00:00:48.840> cube<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that it looks like a 3x3 cube in the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.340 
that it looks like a 3x3 cube in the
seventh<00:00:50.309> step<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.899> three

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
seventh step so we want to get three

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.700 
seventh step so we want to get three
incorrect<00:00:53.660> three<00:00:54.660> incorrect<00:00:55.110> edge<00:00:55.379> pieces

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
incorrect three incorrect edge pieces

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
incorrect three incorrect edge pieces
instead<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> two<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> we

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
instead of two so what we do is we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.310 
instead of two so what we do is we
basically<00:00:58.500> hold<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.629> completed<00:01:00.629> side<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
basically hold a completed side on the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.990 
basically hold a completed side on the
right<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.770> after<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.489> we're<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
right because after this we're going to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.329 
right because after this we're going to
be<00:01:03.120> able<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.449> perform<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.930> Allan<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
be able to perform the Allan and in the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.280 
be able to perform the Allan and in the
Allan<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> hold<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.780> completed

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
Allan you have to hold the completed

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
Allan you have to hold the completed
side<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.330> doesn't<00:01:09.510> really

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
side on the right now it doesn't really

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
side on the right now it doesn't really
matter<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.500> hold<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> left<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
matter you can hold it on the left and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.980 
matter you can hold it on the left and
then<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.640> could<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> reverse<00:01:12.270> Allan<00:01:12.869> if

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
then you could do the reverse Allan if

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
then you could do the reverse Allan if
you<00:01:13.110> wanted<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:14.010> since<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.369> taught<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you wanted to but since I taught the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.390 
you wanted to but since I taught the
regular<00:01:15.360> Allan<00:01:15.750> I'm<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> go<00:01:17.100> over

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
regular Allan I'm just going to go over

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
regular Allan I'm just going to go over
how<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.170> use

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
how to to get it so that you can use

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.920 
how to to get it so that you can use
that<00:01:19.590> move<00:01:19.890> instead<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.360> basically<00:01:21.689> want

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that move instead so you basically want

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
that move instead so you basically want
to<00:01:22.110> hold<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.619> completed<00:01:23.189> side<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.240> right<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
to hold a completed side on the right it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
to hold a completed side on the right it
doesn't<00:01:24.780> matter<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.320> completed<00:01:25.740> side<00:01:26.070> what

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
doesn't matter which completed side what

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.070 
doesn't matter which completed side what
we're<00:01:27.090> basically<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.720> doing<00:01:27.900> is

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
we're basically going to be doing is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830 
we're basically going to be doing is
performing<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> same<00:01:28.950> algorithm<00:01:29.640> first<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
performing the same algorithm first that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
performing the same algorithm first that
I<00:01:30.869> use<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> third<00:01:31.890> step<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.400> basically

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I use in the third step to basically

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.749 
I use in the third step to basically
switch<00:01:33.090> these<00:01:33.509> two<00:01:33.540> edge<00:01:34.140> pieces<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.799> top<00:01:35.040> two

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
switch these two edge pieces the top two

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.690 
switch these two edge pieces the top two
opposite<00:01:36.450> edge<00:01:36.600> pieces<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> will

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
opposite edge pieces so what that will

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
opposite edge pieces so what that will
do<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.659> bring<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.170> piece<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:41.130> which

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
do is it will bring the piece here which

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
do is it will bring the piece here which
is<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> orange<00:01:42.030> piece<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:43.049> bring<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> on

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
is the orange piece it will bring it on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.319 
is the orange piece it will bring it on
to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> green<00:01:43.979> side<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.610> we'll<00:01:45.090> bring<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to the green side and we'll bring that

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.899 
to the green side and we'll bring that
green<00:01:45.810> piece<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> blue<00:01:47.280> side<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
green piece on to the blue side so we

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
green piece on to the blue side so we
will<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.380> we're<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.799> three

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
will have we're going to have three

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
will have we're going to have three
incorrect<00:01:51.000> edge<00:01:51.210> pieces<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.840> let's<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:52.170> ahead

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
incorrect edge pieces so let's go ahead

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.170 
incorrect edge pieces so let's go ahead
and<00:01:52.470> perform<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.950> move<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.820> hold<00:01:54.090> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and perform that move so hold that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.240 
and perform that move so hold that
completed<00:01:55.079> side<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.500> right<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.070> do

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
completed side on the right and you do

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
completed side on the right and you do
inside<00:01:56.790> right<00:01:57.420> face<00:01:58.009> 180<00:01:59.009> degrees<00:01:59.600> up<00:02:00.600> face

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
inside right face 180 degrees up face

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
inside right face 180 degrees up face
180<00:02:01.649> degrees<00:02:02.659> inside<00:02:03.659> right<00:02:04.079> face<00:02:05.119> 180

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
180 degrees inside right face 180

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.389 
180 degrees inside right face 180
degrees<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:07.049> face<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.649> 180<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
degrees just this face is going 180 so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.589 
degrees just this face is going 180 so
you<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> remember<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.090> turn<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.390> one

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
you have to remember to turn this one

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.500 
you have to remember to turn this one
back<00:02:10.129> both<00:02:11.129> up<00:02:11.640> faces<00:02:12.530> 180<00:02:13.530> degrees

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
back both up faces 180 degrees

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.699 
back both up faces 180 degrees
inside<00:02:15.510> right<00:02:15.930> face<00:02:16.700> 180<00:02:17.700> degrees<00:02:18.409> both<00:02:19.409> up

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
inside right face 180 degrees both up

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.850 
inside right face 180 degrees both up
faces<00:02:20.310> 180<00:02:20.909> degrees<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.510> then<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> up

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
faces 180 degrees and then just the up

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.280 
faces 180 degrees and then just the up
face<00:02:23.129> 180<00:02:23.790> degrees<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:24.750> look<00:02:25.110> at<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
face 180 degrees now you look at the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.619 
face 180 degrees now you look at the
cube<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.709> you'll<00:02:25.829> see<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.159> there<00:02:26.340> are<00:02:26.629> three

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
cube and you'll see that there are three

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.099 
cube and you'll see that there are three
incorrect<00:02:28.379> edge<00:02:28.620> pieces<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.659> we're<00:02:30.930> going

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
incorrect edge pieces so now we're going

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.360 
incorrect edge pieces so now we're going
to<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.409> is<00:02:31.650> we're<00:02:31.829> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.069> hold<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
to do is we're going to hold the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.369 
to do is we're going to hold the
completed<00:02:32.819> side<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.269> right<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.260> if

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
completed side on the right and then if

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.550 
completed side on the right and then if
you<00:02:34.470> look<00:02:34.590> at<00:02:34.739> the<00:02:34.829> three<00:02:35.040> edge<00:02:35.159> pieces<00:02:36.560> what

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
you look at the three edge pieces what

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.920 
you look at the three edge pieces what
the<00:02:37.680> Allen<00:02:38.099> does<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.819> makes<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.569> edge

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the Allen does is it makes the edge

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.800 
the Allen does is it makes the edge
pieces<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> three<00:02:40.920> edge<00:02:41.129> pieces<00:02:41.489> go<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.689> a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
pieces the three edge pieces go in a

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.960 
pieces the three edge pieces go in a
counterclockwise<00:02:43.170> direction<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:44.760> one

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
counterclockwise direction so this one

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.210 
counterclockwise direction so this one
is<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.299> go<00:02:45.480> here<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.590> piece<00:02:46.889> is<00:02:47.069> going

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
is going to go here this piece is going

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.069 
is going to go here this piece is going
to<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.450> piece<00:02:48.629> is<00:02:48.659> going<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:48.989> go

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
to go here and this piece is going to go

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.869 
to go here and this piece is going to go
here<00:02:49.379> meaning<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> green<00:02:50.280> piece<00:02:50.519> is<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.819> to

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
here meaning the green piece is going to

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.789 
here meaning the green piece is going to
go<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.209> green<00:02:51.389> side<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:52.139> orange<00:02:52.440> piece<00:02:52.650> is

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
go on the green side the orange piece is

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.440 
go on the green side the orange piece is
going<00:02:52.889> to<00:02:52.950> go<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.250> orange<00:02:53.489> side<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
blue onto the blue side so we hold that

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.220 
blue onto the blue side so we hold that
completed<00:02:57.389> side<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.659> the<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.139> we

completed side on the right and we

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.220 
completed side on the right and we
perform<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.739> Allen<00:02:59.069> which<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.609> left<00:03:00.230> 180

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the left face is going to go 180 so if

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.520 
the left face is going to go 180 so if
you<00:03:29.879> followed<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.419> procedure<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:31.169> should

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
you followed that procedure you should

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.280 
you followed that procedure you should
end<00:03:31.829> up<00:03:32.159> with<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.760> final<00:03:33.590> complete<00:03:34.590> cube

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
end up with a final complete cube

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.750 
end up with a final complete cube
alright<00:03:37.290> guys<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.709> hopefully<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.430> helped

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
alright guys so hopefully that helped

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.059 
alright guys so hopefully that helped
out<00:03:38.879> a<00:03:38.909> little<00:03:39.150> bit<00:03:39.650> basically<00:03:40.650> what<00:03:40.799> we<00:03:40.919> did

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
out a little bit basically what we did

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.979 
out a little bit basically what we did
is<00:03:41.129> that<00:03:41.400> since<00:03:41.790> we<00:03:41.940> had<00:03:42.090> these<00:03:42.329> two<00:03:42.750> edges

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
is that since we had these two edges

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.589 
is that since we had these two edges
which<00:03:43.409> were<00:03:43.590> incomplete<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:45.209> just<00:03:45.449> basically

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
which were incomplete we just basically

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.080 
which were incomplete we just basically
switched<00:03:46.290> these<00:03:46.680> two<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.220> that<00:03:47.340> we<00:03:47.489> had<00:03:47.669> three

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
switched these two so that we had three
