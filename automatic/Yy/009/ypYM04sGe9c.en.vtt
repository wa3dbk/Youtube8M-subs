these<00:00:08.290> wheels<00:00:08.650> are<00:00:09.300> 75<00:00:10.300> millimeters<00:00:10.930> tall

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
these wheels are 75 millimeters tall

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.800 
these wheels are 75 millimeters tall
with<00:00:11.470> a<00:00:12.300> 45<00:00:13.300> millimeter<00:00:14.230> contact<00:00:15.010> patch<00:00:15.810> with

with a 45 millimeter contact patch with
these<00:00:16.990> wheels<00:00:17.290> I've<00:00:18.100> written<00:00:18.310> these<00:00:18.550> for

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
these wheels I've written these for

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.080 
these wheels I've written these for
couple<00:00:19.960> months<00:00:20.200> now<00:00:20.260> but<00:00:20.650> only<00:00:20.980> really<00:00:21.670> on<00:00:21.850> and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
couple months now but only really on and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.910 
couple months now but only really on and
off<00:00:23.039> when<00:00:24.039> they<00:00:24.250> are<00:00:24.280> new<00:00:24.640> out<00:00:24.940> of<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.330> box

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
off when they are new out of the box

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.050 
off when they are new out of the box
they<00:00:26.920> are<00:00:27.390> relatively<00:00:28.390> smooth<00:00:29.100> but<00:00:30.100> they

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
they are relatively smooth but they

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.509 
they are relatively smooth but they
could<00:00:31.390> be<00:00:31.420> smoother<00:00:32.020> but<00:00:32.429> considering<00:00:33.429> it's

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
could be smoother but considering it's

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:35.009 
could be smoother but considering it's
coming<00:00:33.760> straight<00:00:33.909> from<00:00:34.269> the<00:00:34.390> box<00:00:34.600> and<00:00:34.839> it's

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
coming straight from the box and it's

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.410 
coming straight from the box and it's
not<00:00:35.170> really<00:00:35.530> fully<00:00:35.829> broken<00:00:36.129> and<00:00:36.519> there's<00:00:37.329> not

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
not really fully broken and there's not

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.849 
not really fully broken and there's not
really<00:00:37.539> much<00:00:37.719> that<00:00:37.960> you<00:00:38.079> can<00:00:38.229> do<00:00:38.819> but<00:00:40.859> with

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
really much that you can do but with

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.270 
really much that you can do but with
these<00:00:42.479> when<00:00:43.479> they<00:00:43.690> are<00:00:43.899> around<00:00:44.379> 75

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
these when they are around 75

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.349 
these when they are around 75
millimeters<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.659> like<00:00:46.839> around<00:00:47.620> 72

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
millimeters to like around 72

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.939 
millimeters to like around 72
they<00:00:49.359> really<00:00:50.350> don't<00:00:50.620> slide<00:00:51.129> all<00:00:51.429> that<00:00:51.609> good

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
they really don't slide all that good

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.039 
they really don't slide all that good
I'm<00:00:53.949> not<00:00:54.370> too<00:00:54.609> sure<00:00:54.879> why<00:00:55.120> but<00:00:55.479> probably<00:00:55.809> just

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
I'm not too sure why but probably just

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.469 
I'm not too sure why but probably just
because<00:00:56.199> it<00:00:56.350> has<00:00:56.469> a<00:00:56.579> decent<00:00:57.579> urethane<00:00:58.239> depth

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
because it has a decent urethane depth

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.419 
because it has a decent urethane depth
because<00:00:58.719> it<00:00:58.870> is<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.019> larger<00:00:59.649> wheel<00:00:59.859> and<00:01:00.190> it<00:01:00.280> is

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
because it is a larger wheel and it is

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.539 
because it is a larger wheel and it is
wider<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:02.440> once<00:01:02.799> you<00:01:03.010> get<00:01:03.159> them<00:01:03.339> down<00:01:03.489> to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
wider but once you get them down to

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.319 
wider but once you get them down to
around<00:01:03.909> like<00:01:04.210> 71<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.500> under<00:01:06.369> they<00:01:06.729> get<00:01:06.939> pretty

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
around like 71 and under they get pretty

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.770 
around like 71 and under they get pretty
smooth<00:01:08.009> with<00:01:09.009> me<00:01:09.250> I<00:01:09.430> am<00:01:09.549> a<00:01:09.700> heavier<00:01:10.090> rider<00:01:10.360> I'm

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
smooth with me I am a heavier rider I'm

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.510 
smooth with me I am a heavier rider I'm
around<00:01:11.700> 195<00:01:12.700> pounds<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:14.170> get<00:01:15.130> more<00:01:15.340> weight

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
around 195 pounds so I get more weight

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.719 
around 195 pounds so I get more weight
onto<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.939> wheels<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.680> also<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.340> fact<00:01:18.549> that<00:01:18.640> I

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
onto the wheels and also the fact that I

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.719 
onto the wheels and also the fact that I
am<00:01:18.789> riding<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.420> top<00:01:19.899> mount<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.439> second<00:01:21.159> I'm<00:01:21.280> super

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
am riding a top mount a second I'm super

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.599 
am riding a top mount a second I'm super
shaka<00:01:22.350> where<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.950> get<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> lot<00:01:24.280> of<00:01:24.340> leverage

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
shaka where you get a lot of leverage

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.330 
shaka where you get a lot of leverage
over<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.270> wheels<00:01:25.479> which<00:01:25.930> makes<00:01:26.740> them<00:01:26.979> slide

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
over the wheels which makes them slide

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.929 
over the wheels which makes them slide
smoother<00:01:28.469> with<00:01:29.469> these<00:01:29.740> wheels<00:01:30.070> they<00:01:30.460> tend<00:01:30.850> to

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
smoother with these wheels they tend to

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.889 
smoother with these wheels they tend to
kill<00:01:31.329> speed<00:01:32.640> relatively<00:01:33.640> fast<00:01:33.939> because<00:01:34.509> they

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
kill speed relatively fast because they

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.060 
kill speed relatively fast because they
are<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.350> pretty<00:01:35.859> rebound<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.729> urethane<00:01:37.090> but<00:01:37.750> also

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
are a pretty rebound a urethane but also

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.959 
are a pretty rebound a urethane but also
they<00:01:39.070> are<00:01:39.100> wider<00:01:39.549> and<00:01:40.289> they<00:01:41.289> are<00:01:41.439> a<00:01:41.469> da<00:01:41.859> but<00:01:42.789> the

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
they are wider and they are a da but the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.270 
they are wider and they are a da but the
durometer<00:01:43.570> doesn't<00:01:43.960> really<00:01:44.649> matter<00:01:44.950> all<00:01:45.249> that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
durometer doesn't really matter all that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.020 
durometer doesn't really matter all that
much<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.880> when<00:01:49.659> these<00:01:49.899> wheels<00:01:50.320> are

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
much but when these wheels are

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.789 
much but when these wheels are
relatively<00:01:52.030> new<00:01:52.299> they<00:01:52.570> don't<00:01:52.869> slide<00:01:53.469> very

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
relatively new they don't slide very

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.880 
relatively new they don't slide very
good<00:01:54.039> at<00:01:54.219> like<00:01:55.179> a<00:01:55.420> low<00:01:55.689> angle<00:01:55.960> approach<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
good at like a low angle approach the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.459 
good at like a low angle approach the
only<00:01:57.130> slide<00:01:57.429> smooth<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:58.149> if<00:01:58.420> you<00:01:58.569> are<00:01:58.719> blasting

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
only slide smooth is if you are blasting

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.309 
only slide smooth is if you are blasting
90<00:02:00.030> where<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.689> don't<00:02:01.929> want<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.109> do<00:02:02.170> that

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
90 where you don't want to do that

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.800 
90 where you don't want to do that
because<00:02:02.469> your<00:02:02.679> wheels<00:02:02.920> will<00:02:03.399> flat<00:02:04.179> spot<00:02:04.509> and

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
because your wheels will flat spot and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.530 
because your wheels will flat spot and
Auroville<00:02:05.439> which<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.189> not<00:02:06.429> good

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
Auroville which is not good

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.560 
Auroville which is not good
but<00:02:08.050> as<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.530> said<00:02:08.590> once<00:02:08.979> they<00:02:09.070> get<00:02:09.190> smaller<00:02:10.090> they

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
but as I said once they get smaller they

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.810 
but as I said once they get smaller they
are<00:02:11.220> pretty<00:02:12.220> sweet

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
are pretty sweet

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.010 
are pretty sweet
I<00:02:14.160> was<00:02:15.160> well<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:15.910> use<00:02:16.150> these<00:02:16.330> for<00:02:16.630> mainly

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
I was well I use these for mainly

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.830 
I was well I use these for mainly
pushing<00:02:17.560> around<00:02:17.680> or<00:02:18.280> doing<00:02:18.820> higher<00:02:19.390> speed<00:02:19.810> for

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
pushing around or doing higher speed for

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.830 
pushing around or doing higher speed for
your<00:02:20.200> ID<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:20.620> because<00:02:21.010> they're<00:02:21.970> fast<00:02:22.330> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
your ID just because they're fast and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.080 
your ID just because they're fast and
they<00:02:23.170> kill<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.800> lot<00:02:24.340> of<00:02:24.370> speed<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:27.850> them

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
they kill a lot of speed but with them

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.660 
they kill a lot of speed but with them
when<00:02:28.810> they<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:28.990> come<00:02:29.620> they<00:02:29.890> tend<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.280> cone<00:02:30.640> a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
when they do come they tend to cone a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.290 
when they do come they tend to cone a
decent<00:02:31.240> amount<00:02:31.330> because<00:02:32.200> they<00:02:32.650> are<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:33.300> wide

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
decent amount because they are a wide

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.840 
decent amount because they are a wide
wheel<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:35.020> they<00:02:35.110> are<00:02:35.290> offset<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.040> they're

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
wheel and they are offset and they're

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.670 
wheel and they are offset and they're
also<00:02:37.000> tall<00:02:37.510> too<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:39.130> gives<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:40.680> for

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
also tall too so it gives more for

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.010 
also tall too so it gives more for
coning<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:44.470> also<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.890> these<00:02:45.040> wheels<00:02:46.020> it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
coning but also with these wheels it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.630 
coning but also with these wheels it
really<00:02:47.320> isn't<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.530> problem<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.100> I<00:02:48.220> do<00:02:48.340> have

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
really isn't a problem but I do have

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.920 
really isn't a problem but I do have
very<00:02:48.880> slight<00:02:49.510> chunking<00:02:50.230> but<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:52.780> probably

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
very slight chunking but that's probably

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.290 
very slight chunking but that's probably
because<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.440> slid<00:02:54.160> into<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.730> rough<00:02:55.060> patch

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
because I slid into like a rough patch

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.510 
because I slid into like a rough patch
or<00:02:55.540> something<00:02:55.780> like<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:55.900> where<00:02:56.290> wheels<00:02:57.190> can

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
or something like that where wheels can

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.650 
or something like that where wheels can
just<00:02:57.670> chunk<00:02:58.000> so<00:03:00.150> also<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:02.290> darienne's<00:03:03.660> they

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
just chunk so also with darienne's they

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.560 
just chunk so also with darienne's they
are<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.190> better<00:03:06.790> all-around<00:03:07.150> the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
are one of the better all-around the

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.110 
are one of the better all-around the
wheels<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.140> can<00:03:08.320> have<00:03:08.530> because<00:03:09.120> I've

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
wheels that you can have because I've

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.199 
wheels that you can have because I've
bombed<00:03:10.540> on<00:03:10.810> them<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.320> push<00:03:11.620> around<00:03:11.800> on<00:03:12.280> them<00:03:12.550> for

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
bombed on them I push around on them for

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.990 
bombed on them I push around on them for
free<00:03:13.480> ride<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.020> all<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.400> they<00:03:15.850> are<00:03:15.970> a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
free ride and all that so they are a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.060 
free ride and all that so they are a
very<00:03:16.150> good<00:03:16.630> general<00:03:17.050> purpose<00:03:17.110> wheel<00:03:17.680> for

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
very good general purpose wheel for

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.520 
very good general purpose wheel for
someone<00:03:18.760> who's<00:03:18.910> getting<00:03:19.330> in<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.570> sliding<00:03:20.170> or

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
just getting into skating there are

where<00:03:29.470> they<00:03:29.739> are<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.130> little<00:03:30.640> bit<00:03:30.850> more

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
where they are a little bit more

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.630 
where they are a little bit more
expensive<00:03:31.420> than<00:03:31.930> some<00:03:32.170> other<00:03:32.680> wheels<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.340> a

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
expensive than some other wheels like a

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.710 
expensive than some other wheels like a
BEC<00:03:34.360> Elevens<00:03:34.870> where<00:03:35.230> those<00:03:35.530> are<00:03:36.209> like<00:03:37.209> around

BEC Elevens where those are like around
thirty<00:03:38.410> five<00:03:38.530> end<00:03:38.950> up<00:03:39.130> other<00:03:39.850> than<00:03:39.880> the

thirty five end up other than the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.220 
thirty five end up other than the
flashbacks<00:03:41.100> but<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.420> do<00:03:43.420> highly<00:03:44.200> recommend

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
flashbacks but I do highly recommend

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.370 
flashbacks but I do highly recommend
these<00:03:44.769> for<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:46.510> general-purpose<00:03:46.930> wheel

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
these for a general-purpose wheel

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.890 
these for a general-purpose wheel
because<00:03:47.590> they<00:03:47.800> will<00:03:48.010> do<00:03:48.280> anything

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
because they will do anything

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.310 
because they will do anything
I've<00:03:50.200> hit<00:03:50.500> decent<00:03:51.250> speeds<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.700> them<00:03:52.320> they

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
I've hit decent speeds on them they

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.440 
I've hit decent speeds on them they
slide<00:03:53.650> decently<00:03:54.519> far<00:03:55.590> they<00:03:56.590> were<00:03:56.910> slower<00:03:57.910> than

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
slide decently far they were slower than

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.690 
slide decently far they were slower than
a<00:03:58.660> lot<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:58.959> other<00:03:59.200> wheels<00:03:59.560> really<00:04:00.459> because

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
a lot of other wheels really because

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.850 
a lot of other wheels really because
they<00:04:00.820> have<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.030> higher<00:04:01.450> rebound<00:04:02.019> urethane<00:04:02.530> so

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
they have a higher rebound urethane so

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.410 
they have a higher rebound urethane so
it<00:04:03.400> likes<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.640> hold<00:04:03.940> on

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
it likes to hold on

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.460 
it likes to hold on
and<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.940> stuff<00:04:07.180> no<00:04:07.360> dragging<00:04:07.750> them<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:07.989> is<00:04:08.200> a

and the stuff no dragging them on is a
