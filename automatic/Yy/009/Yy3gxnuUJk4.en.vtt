00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.869 

in<00:00:00.570> order<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> make<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.170> myofibril<00:00:01.530> we<00:00:02.460> have<00:00:02.700> to

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
in order to make a myofibril we have to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.720 
in order to make a myofibril we have to
have<00:00:03.090> thick<00:00:03.510> filaments<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.370> thin<00:00:05.370> filaments

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
have thick filaments and thin filaments

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.540 
have thick filaments and thin filaments
and<00:00:06.240> thin<00:00:06.509> filaments<00:00:06.810> have<00:00:07.319> some<00:00:07.830> more<00:00:08.130> weird

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
and thin filaments have some more weird

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.970 
and thin filaments have some more weird
stuff<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:09.090> on<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.780> we're<00:00:10.050> not<00:00:10.260> just<00:00:10.740> dealing

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
stuff going on so we're not just dealing

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.430 
stuff going on so we're not just dealing
with<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> single<00:00:11.730> protein<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.660> thin<00:00:12.900> filaments

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
with a single protein in thin filaments

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
with a single protein in thin filaments
but<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.219> want<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> remind<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.420> we're

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
but I just want to remind you that we're

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.890 
but I just want to remind you that we're
still<00:00:16.470> just<00:00:16.500> stacking<00:00:17.279> up<00:00:17.730> some<00:00:18.060> proteins<00:00:18.539> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
still just stacking up some proteins and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.599 
still just stacking up some proteins and
the<00:00:19.439> whole<00:00:19.560> purpose<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.130> put<00:00:20.490> them

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
the whole purpose is to put them

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.259 
the whole purpose is to put them
together<00:00:20.789> into<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.240> myofibril<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.230> remember

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
together into a myofibril and remember

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.140 
together into a myofibril and remember
myofibrils<00:00:24.269> filled<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.820> myofiber<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
myofibrils filled up a myofiber the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.070 
myofibrils filled up a myofiber the
muscle<00:00:27.599> cell<00:00:27.840> itself<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.609> let's<00:00:30.000> look<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
muscle cell itself so let's look at the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.490 
muscle cell itself so let's look at the
parts<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.489> actin<00:00:33.030> molecule<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.870> mean<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
parts of the actin molecule I mean the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.360 
parts of the actin molecule I mean the
the<00:00:34.860> thin<00:00:35.130> filament<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:39.379> really<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:41.100> thin

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the thin filament and really the thin

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.330 
the thin filament and really the thin
filament<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.410> mostly<00:00:43.410> actin<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.190> we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
filament is mostly actin and so if we

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.279 
filament is mostly actin and so if we
were<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> look<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:48.440> actin<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:51.480> actually<00:00:52.050> kind

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
were to look at actin it actually kind

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.420 
were to look at actin it actually kind
of<00:00:52.320> looks<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.870> makes<00:00:55.430> its

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
of looks like this and it makes its

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.560 
of looks like this and it makes its
gonna<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> sad<00:00:57.120> effort<00:00:58.399> it<00:00:59.399> winds<00:01:00.210> there's

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
gonna be a sad effort it winds there's

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.049 
gonna be a sad effort it winds there's
actually<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.289> two<00:01:01.590> strands<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.370> actin<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
actually like two strands of actin and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.100 
actually like two strands of actin and
they<00:01:03.149> wind<00:01:03.510> around<00:01:04.140> each<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:05.869> okay<00:01:06.869> that's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
they wind around each other okay that's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.850 
they wind around each other okay that's
not<00:01:07.229> too<00:01:07.740> bad<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.110> how<00:01:10.260> I'm<00:01:10.439> trying

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
not too bad can you see how I'm trying

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.390 
not too bad can you see how I'm trying
to<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:11.430> form<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> double<00:01:12.689> helix

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
to make them form like a double helix

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.249 
to make them form like a double helix
mm-hmm<00:01:14.490> fancy<00:01:14.970> maybe<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.840> better<00:01:15.960> make<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.979> go

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
mm-hmm fancy maybe I better make it go

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.109 
mm-hmm fancy maybe I better make it go
there<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.939> it's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
there so that you can see that it's

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.640 
there so that you can see that it's
happening<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.869> whoa<00:01:23.210> like<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
happening all the way whoa like that

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.370 
happening all the way whoa like that
those<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.680> actin<00:01:26.250> molecules<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.380> they're

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
those are actin molecules and they're

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.310 
those are actin molecules and they're
just<00:01:28.500> proteins<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:30.689> whole<00:01:30.900> thing<00:01:31.170> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
just proteins and this whole thing that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.149 
just proteins and this whole thing that
I'm<00:01:31.439> about<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> build<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:33.090> thin<00:01:33.659> filament

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
I'm about to build is a thin filament

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.819 
I'm about to build is a thin filament
actin<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:37.350> color<00:01:37.560> did<00:01:37.710> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
actin what do you think what color did I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
actin what do you think what color did I
make<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.220> myosin<00:01:38.960> blue<00:01:40.549> guess<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:41.939> Acton's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
make my myosin blue guess what Acton's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.480 
make my myosin blue guess what Acton's
have<00:01:43.340> true<00:01:44.340> story<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:46.250> a<00:01:49.490> myosin

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
have true story they all have a myosin

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
have true story they all have a myosin
binding<00:01:50.880> site<00:01:55.820> okay<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.240> draw<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.630> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
binding site okay so I can draw this on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.499 
binding site okay so I can draw this on
every<00:01:58.320> single<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.829> these<00:01:58.950> guys<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.509> you

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
every single one of these guys and you

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.090 
every single one of these guys and you
agree<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> dude<00:02:01.469> if<00:02:01.649> we're<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.950> have

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
agree that dude if we're going to have

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.819 
agree that dude if we're going to have
filaments<00:02:02.939> we<00:02:03.719> better<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.200> them<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.500> able<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
filaments we better have them be able to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.359 
filaments we better have them be able to
stick<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.250> each<00:02:05.369> other<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.140> it's<00:02:07.140> true<00:02:07.439> actin

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
stick to each other and it's true actin

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.699 
stick to each other and it's true actin
and<00:02:08.520> myosin<00:02:08.780> when<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> moon<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> stars

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and myosin when the moon and the stars

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.210 
and myosin when the moon and the stars
align<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.390> send<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.720> message

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
align and you send the message

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.150 
align and you send the message
job<00:02:13.990> they<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:16.580> attach<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.150> each<00:02:17.240> other<00:02:18.160> all

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
job they can attach to each other all

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.660 
job they can attach to each other all
right<00:02:19.480> there's<00:02:20.480> something<00:02:20.600> else<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:22.640> is

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
right there's something else there is

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.790 
right there's something else there is
another<00:02:23.270> molecule<00:02:23.510> called<00:02:24.490> tropomyosin<00:02:25.630> and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
another molecule called tropomyosin and

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
another molecule called tropomyosin and
I'm<00:02:27.800> afraid<00:02:28.040> I'm<00:02:28.250> gonna<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> make

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to make

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.150 
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to make
tropomyosin<00:02:29.410> green<00:02:31.420> tropomyosin<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:33.260> another

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
tropomyosin green tropomyosin is another

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.910 
tropomyosin green tropomyosin is another
friendly<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.090> what<00:02:36.080> have<00:02:36.410> i<00:02:36.560> drawn

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
friendly and what have i drawn

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:46.080 
friendly and what have i drawn
tropomyosin<00:02:37.460> doing<00:02:40.600> if<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:42.170> were<00:02:43.270> whoa<00:02:44.270> oh

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
tropomyosin doing if you were whoa oh

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.920 
tropomyosin doing if you were whoa oh
geez<00:02:48.520> I'm<00:02:49.520> not<00:02:49.760> sure<00:02:49.970> what<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:50.240> happened<00:02:50.810> in

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
geez I'm not sure what just happened in

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.410 
geez I'm not sure what just happened in
this<00:02:51.080> area<00:02:51.470> but<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.280> bottom<00:02:52.610> line<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:53.240> what

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
this area but the bottom line is what

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.050 
this area but the bottom line is what
I'm<00:02:53.480> going<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.630> tell<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:54.430> Tropo<00:02:55.430> myosin

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.800 

blocks<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:03.500> myosin<00:03:04.130> binding<00:03:04.640> sites<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.240> actin

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
blocks the myosin binding sites on actin

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.830 
blocks the myosin binding sites on actin
did<00:03:06.740> I<00:03:06.860> draw<00:03:07.100> that<00:03:07.280> for<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:07.670> well<00:03:07.850> enough<00:03:08.120> are

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
did I draw that for you well enough are

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.810 
did I draw that for you well enough are
you<00:03:08.960> cool<00:03:09.260> with<00:03:09.320> that<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:10.460> tropomyosin

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
you cool with that the tropomyosin

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.970 
you cool with that the tropomyosin
blocks<00:03:11.660> those<00:03:12.050> binding<00:03:12.530> sites

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
blocks those binding sites

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.450 
blocks those binding sites
so<00:03:13.430> when<00:03:13.670> tropomyosin<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.840> in<00:03:15.050> place<00:03:15.410> can<00:03:16.400> you

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
so when tropomyosin is in place can you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.170 
so when tropomyosin is in place can you
have<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.790> muscle<00:03:17.180> contraction<00:03:18.489> no<00:03:19.489> no<00:03:19.670> no<00:03:19.850> you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
have a muscle contraction no no no you

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.420 
have a muscle contraction no no no you
cannot<00:03:20.420> because<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.590> binding<00:03:21.920> sites<00:03:22.250> are

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
cannot because the binding sites are

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.090 
cannot because the binding sites are
blocked<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.930> guess<00:03:24.230> what<00:03:24.500> we<00:03:24.680> have<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:24.920> bring

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
blocked so guess what we have to bring

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.500 
blocked so guess what we have to bring
in<00:03:25.220> somebody<00:03:25.430> else<00:03:25.700> we<00:03:25.850> have<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.090> bring<00:03:26.330> in<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
in somebody else we have to bring in a

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.530 
in somebody else we have to bring in a
gatekeeper<00:03:27.050> and<00:03:27.670> that<00:03:28.670> would<00:03:28.850> be<00:03:28.970> this<00:03:29.239> guy

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
gatekeeper and that would be this guy

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.610 
gatekeeper and that would be this guy
and<00:03:31.030> this<00:03:32.030> guy<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:32.300> called<00:03:32.750> troponin<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
and this guy is called troponin and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.300 
and this guy is called troponin and
troponin<00:03:36.620> just<00:03:37.340> another<00:03:37.550> protein<00:03:38.000> and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
troponin just another protein and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.199 
troponin just another protein and
troponin<00:03:40.310> job<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:42.530> very<00:03:42.739> cool<00:03:42.980> oh<00:03:43.310> so

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
troponin job this is very cool oh so

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:54.150 
troponin job this is very cool oh so
cool<00:03:44.590> troponin<00:03:45.790> holds<00:03:47.530> tropomyosin<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:52.280> place

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
cool troponin holds tropomyosin in place

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.080 
cool troponin holds tropomyosin in place
right

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
right

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.890 
right
what's<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:57.900> place<00:03:58.940> blocking<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.239> myosin

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
what's in place blocking the myosin

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.330 
what's in place blocking the myosin
binding<00:04:01.319> sites<00:04:02.209> okay<00:04:03.590> are<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.800> seeing<00:04:05.160> are

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
binding sites okay are you seeing are

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.190 
binding sites okay are you seeing are
you<00:04:05.459> getting<00:04:05.730> kind<00:04:05.880> of<00:04:06.000> like<00:04:06.180> oh<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.480> bet<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.140> can

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
you getting kind of like oh I bet I can

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.520 
you getting kind of like oh I bet I can
predict<00:04:07.770> what's<00:04:08.010> going<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.430> happen<00:04:09.290> I'm<00:04:10.290> gonna

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
predict what's going to happen I'm gonna

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.650 
predict what's going to happen I'm gonna
make<00:04:10.739> I'm<00:04:11.010> gonna<00:04:11.220> make<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.940> plot<00:04:12.270> get<00:04:12.720> thicker

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
make I'm gonna make the plot get thicker

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.430 
make I'm gonna make the plot get thicker
because<00:04:15.660> look<00:04:16.790> troponin<00:04:17.790> has<00:04:18.419> its<00:04:19.049> own

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
because look troponin has its own

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.310 
because look troponin has its own
binding<00:04:20.280> site<00:04:20.600> what<00:04:22.340> yeah<00:04:23.600> it<00:04:24.600> has

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
binding site what yeah it has

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.010 
binding site what yeah it has
I<00:04:25.490> mean<00:04:26.490> troponin<00:04:26.790> did<00:04:27.060> I<00:04:27.120> say<00:04:27.300> troponin<00:04:27.690> I

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
I mean troponin did I say troponin I

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.610 
I mean troponin did I say troponin I
hope<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.010> did<00:04:29.720> troponin<00:04:30.720> has<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:32.150> calcium

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
hope I did troponin has a calcium

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.600 
hope I did troponin has a calcium
binding<00:04:34.620> site<00:04:36.410> did<00:04:37.410> I<00:04:37.500> already<00:04:37.740> tell<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.220> or

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
binding site did I already tell you or

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.440 
binding site did I already tell you or
am<00:04:39.419> I<00:04:39.510> just<00:04:39.540> imagining<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:41.700> calcium<00:04:42.270> is

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
am I just imagining it the calcium is

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.590 
am I just imagining it the calcium is
stored<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.470> sarcoplasmic<00:04:44.280> reticulum<00:04:45.180> of

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.090 
stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of
the<00:04:46.020> muscle<00:04:46.470> cell<00:04:46.500> oh<00:04:48.320> so<00:04:49.320> here's<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.680> deal

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
the muscle cell oh so here's the deal

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.890 
the muscle cell oh so here's the deal
if<00:04:50.970> calcium<00:04:51.590> binds<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:53.460> troponin<00:04:53.729> at<00:04:54.690> the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
if calcium binds to troponin at the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.379 
if calcium binds to troponin at the
calcium<00:04:55.320> binding<00:04:55.590> site<00:04:56.150> troponin<00:04:57.150> I'll

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
calcium binding site troponin I'll

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.350 
calcium binding site troponin I'll
change<00:04:57.690> shape<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.320> if<00:04:59.220> troponin<00:04:59.669> changes

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
change shape and if troponin changes

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.520 
change shape and if troponin changes
shape<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:01.380> can<00:05:01.710> no<00:05:01.830> longer<00:05:01.860> hold<00:05:02.430> tropomyosin

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
shape it can no longer hold tropomyosin

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.370 
shape it can no longer hold tropomyosin
in<00:05:04.640> position<00:05:05.640> to<00:05:05.820> cover<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.630> myosin<00:05:07.050> binding

that<00:05:43.200> through<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.620> microscope<00:05:44.310> you<00:05:44.580> see

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
that through a microscope you see

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.529 
that through a microscope you see
stripes

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
stripes

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.170 
stripes
that's<00:05:46.320> how<00:05:46.380> organized<00:05:46.830> they<00:05:46.860> are<00:05:47.310> they're

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
that's how organized they are they're

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.390 
that's how organized they are they're
like<00:05:48.210> towing<00:05:48.630> that<00:05:48.780> line<00:05:49.310> it's<00:05:50.310> really

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
like towing that line it's really

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.969 
like towing that line it's really
important<00:05:51.060> for<00:05:51.150> their<00:05:51.300> function<00:05:51.750> so<00:05:52.500> they<00:05:52.680> tow

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
important for their function so they tow

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.279 
important for their function so they tow
the<00:05:53.250> line<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.970> that's<00:05:54.840> what<00:05:55.050> we're<00:05:55.139> going<00:05:55.229> to

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
the line and that's what we're going to

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:57.200 
the line and that's what we're going to
talk<00:05:55.440> about<00:05:55.590> next<00:05:56.010> how<00:05:56.220> are<00:05:56.430> they<00:05:56.550> organized

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
talk about next how are they organized

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.710 
talk about next how are they organized
into<00:05:57.840> this<00:05:57.990> myofibril<00:05:58.770> and<00:05:59.270> the<00:06:00.270> fact<00:06:00.479> is

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
into this myofibril and the fact is

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.240 
into this myofibril and the fact is
they're<00:06:00.900> organized<00:06:01.320> into<00:06:01.650> something<00:06:02.010> called

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
they're organized into something called

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.760 
they're organized into something called
a<00:06:02.400> sarcomere<00:06:03.030> let's<00:06:03.630> talk<00:06:03.870> about<00:06:03.990> sarcomeres

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
a sarcomere let's talk about sarcomeres

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.669 
a sarcomere let's talk about sarcomeres
next<00:06:05.370> kay
