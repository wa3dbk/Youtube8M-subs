00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 a project that I did not expect 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.420
 true 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 or by the head 50 thousand things but less 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.970
 this and I was made 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.460
 well no bad idea bad idea we are not 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.800
 talk with managers and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.110
 practicing then there arose 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 many ideas and then we come to the 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.779
 conclusion that it was not wrong and gives all the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 bad idea they were a project and I live with the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.449
 time and seeing people like how 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 outside accept those two qualities let's 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.940
 to call him like that together with what 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.610
 could really arise can you give yourself a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.130
 good a good project 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.980
 so that this is much of the riva the 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.350
 close with the grim reaper and even with the parc 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.450
 what is the purpose of the reaper 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.450
 black now against the grim 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.240
 well, good 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.790
 I believe that 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.930
 is so clear and so palpable that what 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.980
 I tell you, it does not come out, it's not something 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 extra let's call it that 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.030
 we know that I am the opposite side of the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.400
 reaper many think it is a copy 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.260
 for me the area copy of his mask his 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.409
 picture your fighting style is totally 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:26.130
 very different very different 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.640
 I think the hard part is for me because I 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.250
 I have to implement I have to 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.110
 and convince with a very different style 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.610
 not dance 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.350
 do not carry we look like one of a 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.750
 image that has charisma because it has 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.310
 charisma let's see them I recognize it here 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.180
 is to work here is to start from scratch 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.660
 then for me if you touch me if you touch me 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.060
 chop stones and more than stone and I say 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.730
 I do not come to take advantage either I do not want 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.180
 that comes out of me 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.150
 the character of Kim Kim gave life to this 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.040
 character the concerns what 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.530
 happened what he faced in the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.160
 way and here I am I want to reiterate 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.960
 one thing that as everything happens does not come out 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.430
 a character of saleh the character vice 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.360
 in the future we know that it faces 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.610
 Nippon and loses brother here is different 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.470
 here is very very different 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.080
 here the public puts us and the public 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.020
 takes us here is not what I say in 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.880
 what the Lord says here the best judge 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.100
 which under solar and to take 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.720
 final decisions is the public 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.430
 undoubtedly quite a challenge 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.800
 pretty big people compare you 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.470
 even with the parca and with the apart that 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.850
 I believe mainly is what is a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.740
 pebble in the shoe a pressure to 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.160
 the black grim reaper to achieve its objective 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:50.730
 in the triple yes yes yes definitely 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.240
 is correct as you mention it but I 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.700
 I am quiet the park 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.570
 it's a totally different style totally 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.300
 different bodies very different the grim 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.340
 not to mention think 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.170
 we are like a heads up with three 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.440
 fingers each finger is very different each 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.230
 finger is fundamental every finger aside 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.530
 can do and do and mention 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.610
 a lot of things done about everything but 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.800
 Well in my case 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.920
 I do not care or I parc of the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.200
 reaper not care what entails of 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.510
 tomorrow what people want what 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.220
 wait for the black part finally a 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.420
 message for the grim reaper that what 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.600
 expects pair of tomorrow 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.600
 crash 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.319
 I think since December 12 that 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.810
 is this reality that you did not think 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.829
 what was going to happen, day after day 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.500
 we are facing each other, we are hurt 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.720
 even 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.900
 there have been times we have hurt 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.540

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.060
