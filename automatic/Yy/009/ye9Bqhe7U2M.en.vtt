00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:10.140
 welcome to unboxing the inner 4039 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.580
 k this is the next component in 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.320
 a new gaming pc last video 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.530
 louis mainboard 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.200
 i said yes in this video now 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.880
 but I still have the cdu coming 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:34.950
 not said which and now 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 westerwelle 1 4039 k socket 20 11 6 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.700
 So first, trade to the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.680
 promotion cores total solid from 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.930
 The new cpu is supposed to pack this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 yes 1 4030 kite and no 2030 the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.040
 packaging here so looks like yes 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.030
 usually not but a bit 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:03.750
 broken but it actually works 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.960
 There is nothing like a security man here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 it says on it 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 in matters 4930 3.4 heart that is me 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 believe 39 12 mb l3-cache and 20 of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.760
 Overall , then needed 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.810
 top performance 130 or so at once 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.310
 I do not even know you can see 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.350
 I usually have cdu but already 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.950
 which also installs you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.030
 show together with the new mainboard 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.909
 I could yes of course again not 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.870
 dismantled the thing to install 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:50.530
 this one actually 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:55.930
 because the cdu has 538 yes me 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.210
 so have it around 45,000 again 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.020
 amazon ordered them yourself 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:12.340
 accounted 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:16.510
 this carton cardboard is not protected 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.670
 I do not have that in the manual of 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.390
 the processor that was also times 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.950
 taped there is a tape and that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.950
 Again, no idea why 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.750
 behind this is it the stickers 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.860
 of course the same will show by the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:41.640
 buyers and here but that his 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.209
 Bees here you have the cdu trainer 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.209
 no more in it 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:56.470
 the mainboard installed in my pc 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:05.799
 mainboard asus rampage ii extreme plus 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:08.790
 memory courses 824 soon 1866 march 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.790
 costs 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.790
 even now I still have the apple 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.280
 for niemeyer yes in there as cpu cooler keeps 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.170
 even relatively early so actually notice 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.819
 almost nothing is the problem we are 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.989
 not going to install normally now 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.810
 So edgewise would be so fit 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.450
 purely 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.019
 That's why I have to put those in such a tree of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.019
 from the bottom up 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:44.340
 provide the air flow from the bottom up 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.900
 with the band so air from the bottom to 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.840
 go upstairs because otherwise you will not leave me 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.220
 does not fit so pure violates 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.790
 namely the heatpipes in the cows 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.790
 may on the mainboard 1 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:21.919
 Of course I have two more users 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.919
 built-in 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.090
 and that was actually the next one 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.440
 month is a graphic artist I will now 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.979
 of course not yet revealed what 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.690
 that is for one but then it will be 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:40.130
 we see now I have my gt 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.349
 66 30 is thereafter coach of elia as 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.160
 I have my first game right away 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.599
 downloaded 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.419
 that did not take long that 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:53.240
 audio system I looked at a 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:54.979
 Straight has only 100 mb down to me 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.349
 loaded that tried first 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.610
 I had something like that in the menu 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:07.030
 I believe 5,000 1 5 thousand but only on 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.030
 beginning with a menu 1000 2008 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.340
 my pc 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.639
 going 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:24.640
 and there is a lot of noise in MÃ¼nster 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:29.400
 now pretty much the same place this time 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.360
 has the graphics card and then the month 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.060
 I'll probably be the one already 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.880
 first battlefield 4 the place upload 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:44.920
 if I have not yet and then the man 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.750
 after the month the rest so what 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.820
 I have mouse and keyboard now 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.490
 but already something new 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:56.850
 tool blessing and what i definitely 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.550
 needs monitor 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.090
 that builds me in any case, well, me 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.920
 two more hdds and clean and then 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.530
 It's good that way if it's always me 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.860
 still the achievement ranges from the graphic 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.860
 here 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.970
 Then I was a second suit 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.790
 same thing again in again 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.000
 but I probably do not see anything 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.020
 do not need it anyway , but least of all 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.020
 until then bye
