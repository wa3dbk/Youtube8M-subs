came<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.709> know<00:02:57.739> how<00:02:58.010> its<00:02:58.219> configured<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
came to know how its configured and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.990 
came to know how its configured and
we've<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:01.010> know<00:03:01.040> we're<00:03:01.280> starting<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.790> piece

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
we've you know we're starting to piece

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.289 
we've you know we're starting to piece
together<00:03:02.180> how<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:02.569> possibly<00:03:03.079> came<00:03:03.379> about

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
together how it possibly came about

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.369 
together how it possibly came about
basically<00:03:05.299> because<00:03:05.719> of<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.959> Voyager<00:03:06.349> mission

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
basically because of the Voyager mission

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.089 
basically because of the Voyager mission
Voyager<00:03:07.310> mission<00:03:07.669> gave<00:03:07.879> us<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.389> perspective<00:03:09.319> on

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
Voyager mission gave us a perspective on

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.039 
Voyager mission gave us a perspective on
things<00:03:10.430> that<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:11.329> know<00:03:11.450> we<00:03:11.569> just<00:03:11.780> didn't<00:03:12.019> have

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
things that you know we just didn't have

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.860 
things that you know we just didn't have
before<00:03:14.739> by<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.799> 1990s<00:03:16.599> pioneer<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
before by the 1990s pioneer and the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
Voyager probes reached the outer limits

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.159
