00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.649
 very good of all you are castrated and in 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.419
 Today I bring you fogh and a 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.910
 application with which we can take and 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.190
 take 3d pictures with any 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.040
 device does not even need cameras 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.820
 doubles like the case of m8 or any 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.449
 kind of strange sensor as we see in the 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 Users score from 4.1 well 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.470
 which is an application that I quite like 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.900
 we open the application if we go to 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.630
 configuration we will be able to customize 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.899
 a little bit everything that is the application 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.260
 for example sensitivity background of 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.449
 screen exposure time resolution 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.789
 size et cetera etcetera me in principle 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.530
 I'll leave it by default and we'll 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.679
 make a test so you can see 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.019
 how it works once we open the subject of 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:53.289
 the photo comes out in the center of the 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:56.589
 screen a circle with which we are going to 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.789
 have to point to the desired object and 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.900
 Well, we're going to have to make a small 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:04.710
 rotation keeping 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.660
 the well-marked object in the center 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.540
 while we better do the score 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.150
 it will be greater because I have to tell you that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.160
 when you do a photograph in the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.790
 application automatically because it puts you 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.640
 a score how you do it 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.729
 made and the quality of this 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.040
 we give him here we do the rotation and 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 we are automatically processed and given 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.550
 the image between the d 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.790
 let's do a test so that what 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.790
 see 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.770
 Let's see how it was written 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.929
 analyzing and processing image 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.429
 to see what point doing expose and then 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.070
 I'm going to show you an example that 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.549
 comes by default in the application to 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.289
 that you can see a well-made photograph 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.009
 how well we can look good 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:01.819
 they give us three stars and as we see 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:05.179
 us by rotating the terminal as it 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:07.549
 we see the image this effect of three 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.500
 dimensions the truth is that it is very 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.830
 well the image is also free as 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.940
 I said and let's see here an example 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.350
 it's really spectacular 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.760
 of an image of a girl in a fountain 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.990
 and the truth is that the army is 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.990
 really got
