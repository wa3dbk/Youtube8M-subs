00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
first got this knife was that the knife

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
made in China and I felt it was a slight

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
made in China and I felt it was a slight
mismatch<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> felt<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> knife<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.309> a

little<00:00:38.670> bit<00:00:38.760> big<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.360> sheath<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.770> was

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
little bit big for the sheath and I was

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.190 
little bit big for the sheath and I was
afraid<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.309> catch<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.120> velcro<00:00:42.329> catch<00:00:42.719> would

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
afraid this catch the velcro catch would

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.430 
afraid this catch the velcro catch would
not<00:00:43.379> hold<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.969> however<00:00:44.969> having<00:00:45.510> used<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.350> a

did Bend slightly one of the serrations

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.159 
did Bend slightly one of the serrations
and<00:04:55.370> I'll<00:04:55.460> try<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:55.880> get<00:04:56.030> them<00:04:56.120> close-up<00:04:57.080> of

so<00:04:57.620> in<00:04:57.740> my<00:04:57.860> opinion<00:04:57.979> you<00:04:58.340> shouldn't<00:04:58.850> use<00:04:59.120> a

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
so in my opinion you shouldn't use a

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.630 
so in my opinion you shouldn't use a
knife<00:04:59.510> beyond<00:04:59.930> what<00:05:00.169> it's<00:05:00.350> designed<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.490> be

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
of the serrations something that can be

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.090 
of the serrations something that can be
fixed<00:05:19.910> with<00:05:20.060> no<00:05:20.300> problem<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.530> did<00:05:21.740> crash

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:02.890 
and come down on your finger and you
don't<00:06:01.400> want<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.759> scary<00:06:02.120> sharp<00:06:02.449> knife<00:06:02.659> like<00:06:02.690> this

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
don't want a scary sharp knife like this

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.680 
don't want a scary sharp knife like this
coming<00:06:03.409> down<00:06:03.530> on<00:06:03.680> your<00:06:03.800> finger<00:06:04.129> and<00:06:04.389> you<00:06:05.389> can't

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
coming down on your finger and you can't

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.830 
coming down on your finger and you can't
open<00:06:05.810> it<00:06:05.990> one-handed<00:06:06.379> but<00:06:06.740> it<00:06:06.860> is<00:06:06.979> difficult

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
open it one-handed but it is difficult

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.499 
open it one-handed but it is difficult
so<00:06:08.840> it<00:06:08.960> is<00:06:09.080> a<00:06:09.110> two-handed<00:06:09.919> knife<00:06:10.240> and<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:11.330> like

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:11.509 
so it is a two-handed knife and I like

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.029 
so it is a two-handed knife and I like
this<00:06:11.659> little<00:06:11.720> catch<00:06:12.229> point<00:06:12.500> that<00:06:12.740> it<00:06:12.860> has

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
this little catch point that it has

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.520 
this little catch point that it has
where<00:06:13.370> it<00:06:13.460> rests<00:06:13.940> if<00:06:14.810> you<00:06:14.960> close<00:06:15.169> it<00:06:15.380> properly

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
where it rests if you close it properly

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.309 
where it rests if you close it properly
so<00:06:15.860> my<00:06:16.039> overall<00:06:16.659> impression<00:06:17.659> and<00:06:17.810> conclusion

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319
