 I am the sonja and today we do 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.170
 most popular recipes new filming 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.699
 of course in a new quality of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 Picture and sound and five years ago there were 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.640
 the roast pork and I want that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.760
 Show you again today and one 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 pork with dark beer sauce i 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.040
 hope you have fun while having fun 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.710
 watch and imitate for ours 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.239
 Classics you need a big piece 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 beautiful pig shoulder 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.550
 with a great flock but the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.149
 do not cut the butcher's part 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.840
 to let 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.329
 then I still worried about it 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.489
 garlic and an onion for one 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.300
 good taste of the sauce you need 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.430
 then no carrots and celery for 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 I have prepared for myself 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.640
 caraway laurel leaf salt pepper and zum 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.549
 fry you need a little oil the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.409
 sauce is made from poultry stock and 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.570
 malt beer must first be the vegetables 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.570
 be prepared celery and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.070
 I have washed pure and then it will be 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.729
 roughly cut 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.329
 heat the oil in a pan and then 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.380
 my meat from all sides meat 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.540
 sear 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.750
 I give my cut vegetables now 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.110
 in the roaster and load this too briefly 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.110
 sweat 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.830
 I use this on my poultry ago 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.280
 and then I put the meat with the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.060
 black in the liquid and now 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.909
 The whole thing comes in the oven at 130 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.729
 just an hour 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.580
 the division is now white now cut 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.950
 I do not take them too deep and one 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.050
 then it will mean 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.050
 roast pork with salt and pepper 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.390
 bay leaf and cumin give to 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.510
 then my malt beer is added and then 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.480
 I put my roast pork on that 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.080
 vegetable namely with the recessed upward 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.269
 so that I get a nice crust 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.170
 my guessed now was another 90 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.450
 minutes at 160 degrees in the oven and now 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.750
 I have to make my pants to 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.570
 I pass my vegetables through 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.150
 sieve in a pot the gravy I leave 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.570
 then boil it up with something in the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.850
 cold water stirred food starch 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.160
 of course use it again with salt 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.530
 and pepper and then I can think so 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.390
 roast also on cut and with 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.320
 serve the sauce 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.320
 Enjoy your meal 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.069
 more hunger on meat then i can 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.740
 offer you my hungarian goulash 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.450
 or a lamb curry sauce until the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.450
 next time in december
