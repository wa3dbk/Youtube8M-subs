00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
something really nice in in the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.469 
something really nice in in the
backcountry<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:36.770> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> board<00:01:38.130> again

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
backcountry to have on the board again

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.200 
backcountry to have on the board again
we<00:01:39.479> use<00:01:39.960> our<00:01:40.229> flat<00:01:40.680> directional<00:01:41.640> shape<00:01:41.850> here

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
we use our flat directional shape here

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.480 
we use our flat directional shape here
which<00:01:42.600> means<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> very<00:01:43.409> long<00:01:43.649> flat

which means you have a very long flat
shape<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> back<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> early<00:01:46.500> rise

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
shape in the back and then a early rise

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.200 
shape in the back and then a early rise
rocker<00:01:46.979> nose<00:01:47.250> which<00:01:47.490> gives<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> lot<00:01:48.180> of
