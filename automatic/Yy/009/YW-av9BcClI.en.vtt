 lighting I want to share with 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.369
 you a cake that I made from frozen 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.029
 one more I'm very happy with the 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:16.400
 result the modeling to elisa pardon 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:19.039
 elsa elsa 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.140
 I 've already done it in sugar paste 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.610
 previously if you want to know 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.940
 how models and figures 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.470
 enough sugar please see in the 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.820
 information box below I'm going to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.780
 leave many links 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.149
 how to make standing figures sitting 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.199
 and I'm also going to leave useful links that 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.899
 can be used to cover a 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.329
 cake to fill a cake not that 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.129
 surely you already know it but 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.519
 for those who do not know it can serve 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.810
 I told them that this figure is the 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.050
 fondant 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.910
 they are very let's say they are not difficult to 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.320
 are easy to do when 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.190
 you grasp the technique them 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.020
 I recommend a lot of videos from one of 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.050
 a man that I made standing up the same 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.490
 technique is also used for women 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.320
 they just have to vary let's say a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.670
 little bit the structure of the body towards 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.730
 it a little thinner more concurríamos 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.160
 like a waist much narrower than 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.930
 with the man with the correct novice and 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.910
 good those little things that are going to be the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.650
 difference between man and woman and then 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.650
 and the decoration of the factions of the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.570
 face the hair and dress everything 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.750
 other is the same all carry two sticks 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.550
 in the legs a stick that goes from the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.680
 part of the hip towards the neck and that 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.860
 also holds the head in total three 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.600
 sticks and nothing else and the sticks remember 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.450
 that come up at the base of the cake 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.940
 so that the figure is firm and does not 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.760
 move 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.260
 transport and then good that nothing else 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.360
 Now I'm going to show you how to show 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.230
 as much as this one that remained and above them 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.630
 I'm going to leave the link of how to model a 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.180
 of the faces in sugar paste can 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.160
 use silicone molds or moles 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.570
 receive their own hands I will leave 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.000
 those links also down so that 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 you have narrowed and that's good 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.470
 everything right now I'm going to show you the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.110
 thing and then explain a little bit how 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.240
 is that I did it and well I'm going to give them 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.130
 more unpublished now this is 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.410
 elsa and this is her friend hello 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.520
 then as you see the sã is 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.010
 modeled with my hands I have not used 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.160
 molds here I wanted to get that expression 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.170
 of a very sweet smile and at the same 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.110
 time and he does not feel like he has the sha 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.849
 it has a very long braid and the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:51.140
 I did with if they are fixed I have their legs 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.720
 down no no that's not one there you see the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.989
 another truth there you see the other is not a 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.900
 figure that is made in a rigid cone 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.750
 and already the truth simulating a long skirt 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.060
 but I've really worked with her 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.010
 legs in and then I made her her 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.590
 dress and good all the decoration that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.900
 you are watching now is a cake 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.850
 very tall is about 15 centimeters 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.490
 high and all the decoration they see 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.040
 you down is from 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.980
 of saplings of those typical stars 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.129
 of 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.890
 then of disappointment behind what 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:34.220
 some species of platforms like ice 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.770
 like thin thin ice blocks 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.980
 to simulate also that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.460
 Well, the snow castles that it has 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.880
 frozen in the movie or has it 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:51.180
 only one stick that goes from the base 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.280
 of the cake towards the neck and all 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.280
 the others is fondant to place the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.370
 hands so stay firm simply 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.610
 I dried the long arms first 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.050
 and then he introduced a small stick 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.390
 in each arm so that they fit 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.510
 insured because if not by the weight if 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.030
 only hit them they were going to slide 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.180
 they were going to fall 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.280
 what else nothing good figures the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.100
 trees and these stars were made 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.650
 a day before these blocks of ice 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.830
 they were done about three days before to 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.290
 that remain firm and every time they went 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.030
 drying up let's say every eight hours I was going 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.690
 turning over to dry by both 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.389
 sides and then remain firm and then 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.750
 Do not bend and stay well 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.480
 straight or dry and dry 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.800
 and then nothing else this is frozen from 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.890
 profile this your I'm your profile from the back 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.930
 and it looks good there it looks good profile is 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.780
 a dress a little open and you 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.790
 they fix here back 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.500
 and another dress model that is with the 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.160
 open back 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.770
 is with that back open and 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.850
 and then it's another model if you 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.460
 they fix my videos that I've made 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.260
 previous from frozen I made up 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.390
 now three production cakes 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.360
 is that all three have dresses 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.920
 different good celestial but with 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.690
 different cuts because to make them 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.510
 a little different too and not always 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.850
 same and good that's all I hope that 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.590
 serve them to use the idea of 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.770
 inspiration and good I do not know that you 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.020
 they make many things better than these and 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.730
