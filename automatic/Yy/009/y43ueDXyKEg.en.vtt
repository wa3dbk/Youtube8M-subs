00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.580 
a some type of kickflip flip trick
rather<00:03:28.250> or<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.609> hold<00:03:29.120> because<00:03:29.810> there's<00:03:30.440> not

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
rather or a hold because there's not

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.140 
rather or a hold because there's not
that<00:03:30.650> much<00:03:30.919> time<00:03:31.190> here<00:03:31.370> actually<00:03:31.549> for<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.910> trick

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
that much time here actually for a trick

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.050 
that much time here actually for a trick
so<00:03:32.989> that's<00:03:33.260> how<00:03:33.379> you<00:03:33.440> do<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.760> that's<00:03:34.760> where<00:03:34.940> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
so that's how you do it that's where the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.509 
so that's how you do it that's where the
sixteen<00:03:35.450> set<00:03:36.079> staircase<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.280> now<00:03:37.400> we're

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
sixteen set staircase is so now we're

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.819 
sixteen set staircase is so now we're
going<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.669> grind<00:03:37.879> three<00:03:38.239> escalators<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.049> to

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
going to grind three escalators and to

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.129 
going to grind three escalators and to
do<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:41.060> first<00:03:41.090> escalators<00:03:41.720> right<00:03:41.900> here

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
do that the first escalators right here

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.689 
do that the first escalators right here
you<00:03:42.349> actually<00:03:42.709> have<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:42.859> go<00:03:42.949> down<00:03:43.220> them<00:03:43.459> for

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
you actually have to go down them for

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:44.890 
you actually have to go down them for
some<00:03:43.849> reason<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.209> don't<00:03:44.389> know<00:03:44.510> why<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.690> was

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
some reason I don't know why I was

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.150 
some reason I don't know why I was
having<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.139> lot<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.319> trouble<00:03:45.680> when<00:03:45.799> I<00:03:45.889> was<00:03:45.919> going

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
having a lot of trouble when I was going

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.710 
having a lot of trouble when I was going
up<00:03:46.340> them<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:46.910> have<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.090> go<00:03:47.150> all<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.359> way<00:03:47.540> from

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
up them you have to go all the way from

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.849 
up them you have to go all the way from
the<00:03:47.810> top<00:03:47.959> all<00:03:48.199> the<00:03:48.260> way<00:03:48.379> down<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.769> bottom

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
the top all the way down to the bottom

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.740 
the top all the way down to the bottom
that's<00:03:49.250> one<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.730> can<00:03:49.879> use<00:03:50.000> any<00:03:50.239> grind<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.629> can

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that's one you can use any grind you can

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.509 
that's one you can use any grind you can
use<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.870> nose<00:03:51.079> grind<00:03:51.349> a<00:03:51.530> nose<00:03:51.680> bluntslide<00:03:52.040> a

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
use a nose grind a nose bluntslide a

nose slide of tail slide any slide any

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.390 
nose slide of tail slide any slide any
grind<00:03:56.480> with<00:03:56.959> Y<00:03:57.169> will<00:03:57.410> work<00:03:57.590> even<00:03:57.949> a<00:03:58.040> special

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
grind with Y will work even a special

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.729 
grind with Y will work even a special
slide<00:03:58.639> so<00:03:59.329> your<00:03:59.540> second<00:03:59.900> escalator<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.470> right

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
slide so your second escalator is right

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.039 
slide so your second escalator is right
here<00:04:01.129> and<00:04:01.250> for<00:04:02.120> some<00:04:02.329> reason<00:04:02.359> again<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.870> was

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
here and for some reason again I was

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.900 
here and for some reason again I was
having<00:04:03.260> trouble<00:04:03.349> going<00:04:03.650> up<00:04:03.919> it<00:04:04.069> so<00:04:04.400> I'm<00:04:04.760> just

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
having trouble going up it so I'm just

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.129 
having trouble going up it so I'm just
going<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.239> go<00:04:05.299> down<00:04:05.449> it<00:04:05.599> from<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.840> very<00:04:06.019> top

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
going to go down it from the very top

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.020 
going to go down it from the very top
that's<00:04:06.889> your<00:04:07.069> second<00:04:07.430> one<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.699> your<00:04:07.790> third

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
that's your second one and your third

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.119 
that's your second one and your third
one<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.419> huge<00:04:08.750> escalator<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.349> you<00:04:09.709> use<00:04:10.099> a

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
one is the huge escalator that you use a

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.819 
one is the huge escalator that you use a
lot<00:04:10.519> for<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.060> bigger<00:04:11.359> tricks<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:11.989> you'll<00:04:12.650> see

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
lot for the bigger tricks and you'll see

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.530 
lot for the bigger tricks and you'll see
me<00:04:12.949> just<00:04:12.980> grind<00:04:13.849> from<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:14.120> top<00:04:14.299> to<00:04:14.419> the<00:04:14.510> bottom

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
me just grind from the top to the bottom

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.550 
me just grind from the top to the bottom
and<00:04:15.130> unlock<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.609> goal<00:04:17.139> pretty<00:04:18.139> easy<00:04:18.320> if<00:04:18.470> you

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
and unlock this goal pretty easy if you

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.259 
and unlock this goal pretty easy if you
ask<00:04:18.590> me<00:04:18.859> because<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:19.639> are<00:04:19.669> able<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.000> do<00:04:20.120> any

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
ask me because you are able to do any

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.680 
ask me because you are able to do any
any<00:04:20.630> uh<00:04:21.130> grind<00:04:22.130> really<00:04:22.390> now<00:04:23.390> we're<00:04:23.539> going<00:04:23.630> to

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
any uh grind really now we're going to

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.000 
any uh grind really now we're going to
shatter<00:04:23.930> five<00:04:24.200> directories<00:04:24.620> they're<00:04:24.770> kind<00:04:24.950> of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
shatter five directories they're kind of

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.409 
shatter five directories they're kind of
littered<00:04:25.250> across<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.669> map<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.120> we're<00:04:26.330> going

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
littered across the map so we're going

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.159 
littered across the map so we're going
to<00:04:26.479> go<00:04:26.570> up

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
to go up

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.830 
to go up
for<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.770> first<00:04:27.979> one<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.340> we<00:04:29.120> do<00:04:29.360> have<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.750> go

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
for the first one and we do have to go

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.480 
for the first one and we do have to go
through<00:04:30.110> this<00:04:30.259> section<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.860> map<00:04:31.100> or<00:04:31.310> else

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
through this section of the map or else

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.210 
through this section of the map or else
we<00:04:31.940> won't<00:04:32.150> get<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.690> second<00:04:33.139> one<00:04:33.169> which<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:33.949> up

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
we won't get the second one which is up

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.010 
we won't get the second one which is up
there<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.850> can<00:04:35.090> go<00:04:35.240> around<00:04:35.360> and<00:04:35.870> up<00:04:35.990> the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
there you can go around and up the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.870 
there you can go around and up the
staircase<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:36.590> grab<00:04:36.949> it<00:04:37.160> but<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.550> does<00:04:37.669> take<00:04:37.850> a

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
staircase to grab it but it does take a

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.580 
staircase to grab it but it does take a
little<00:04:38.030> bit<00:04:38.210> more<00:04:38.389> time<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:38.870> now<00:04:39.350> we're<00:04:39.500> going

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
little bit more time so now we're going

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.590 
little bit more time so now we're going
for<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.860> third<00:04:40.070> one<00:04:40.250> which<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.520> located<00:04:41.060> right

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
for the third one which is located right

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.860 
for the third one which is located right
here<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.400> left<00:04:43.610> hand<00:04:43.729> side<00:04:44.000> we're<00:04:44.780> going

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
here to the left hand side we're going

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.590 
here to the left hand side we're going
down<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.289> escalator<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:46.150> onto<00:04:47.150> the<00:04:47.270> ledge

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
down the escalator and onto the ledge

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.930 
down the escalator and onto the ledge
where<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.080> tea<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.470> skate<00:04:48.830> was<00:04:49.070> to<00:04:49.400> grab<00:04:49.669> the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
where the tea and skate was to grab the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.980 
where the tea and skate was to grab the
next<00:04:50.150> one<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:52.090> there<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:53.180> go<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:53.570> then<00:04:53.840> once

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
next one and there you go and then once

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.499 
next one and there you go and then once
we<00:04:54.199> go<00:04:54.320> outside<00:04:54.550> we're<00:04:55.550> going<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.729> grab<00:04:56.000> the

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
we go outside we're going to grab the

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.990 
we go outside we're going to grab the
last<00:04:57.139> and<00:04:57.500> final<00:04:57.830> one<00:04:57.919> right<00:04:58.340> in<00:04:58.490> plain<00:04:58.759> sight

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
last and final one right in plain sight
