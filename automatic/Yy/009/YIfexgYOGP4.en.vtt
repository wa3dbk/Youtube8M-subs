there<00:00:34.600> we<00:00:35.600> are<00:00:35.660> going<00:00:35.810> to<00:00:35.930> fly<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.440> we<00:00:36.590> are

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
there we are going to fly it and we are

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.730 
there we are going to fly it and we are
going<00:00:36.860> to<00:00:36.950> test<00:00:37.220> the<00:00:37.520> FY<00:00:38.390> 21<00:00:38.870> ap<00:00:39.260> if<00:00:39.470> it<00:00:39.620> is

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
going to test the FY 21 ap if it is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.920 
going to test the FY 21 ap if it is
working<00:00:39.950> very<00:00:40.190> well<00:00:40.490> today<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.450> here<00:00:41.630> we<00:00:41.780> go

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
working very well today so here we go

00:00:41.930 --> 00:01:05.399 
working very well today so here we go
not<00:00:42.290> oh<00:00:42.530> no<00:00:43.100> long-range<00:00:43.850> flights<00:00:44.120> today

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.679 

and<00:01:05.829> the<00:01:05.979> moment<00:01:06.310> we<00:01:06.490> are<00:01:06.610> flying<00:01:06.850> without<00:01:07.390> any

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
and the moment we are flying without any

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.219 
and the moment we are flying without any
stabilization<00:01:08.649> turn<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:10.119> once<00:01:10.719> I<00:01:10.899> climb

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
stabilization turn on and once I climb

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.440 
stabilization turn on and once I climb
up<00:01:11.259> I<00:01:11.619> will<00:01:11.799> turn<00:01:12.009> on<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.340> stabilization<00:01:13.210> and

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
up I will turn on the stabilization and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.270 
up I will turn on the stabilization and
see<00:01:13.840> how<00:01:14.170> it<00:01:14.500> will<00:01:14.770> behave<00:01:14.979> okay<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.439> we<00:01:17.740> make<00:01:18.009> a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
see how it will behave okay so we make a

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.400 
see how it will behave okay so we make a
turn

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.070 

and<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.680> turn<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:26.980> the<00:01:27.280> stabilization<00:01:28.090> now

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.700 

so<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.800> plane<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.100> behaving<00:01:32.670> awesome

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.510 

and<00:01:39.010> it's<00:01:39.280> turning<00:01:39.670> very<00:01:39.970> slow<00:01:40.450> let's<00:01:40.990> see<00:01:41.520> if

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and it's turning very slow let's see if

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:51.810 
and it's turning very slow let's see if
we<00:01:42.790> can<00:01:43.000> try<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.380> auto<00:01:44.380> return<00:01:45.340> home

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.410 

and<00:01:52.820> now<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:53.450> are<00:01:53.720> trying<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.229> come<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.680> home<00:01:55.420> at

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
and now we are trying to come to home at

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.770 
and now we are trying to come to home at
the<00:01:56.630> same<00:01:56.870> time<00:01:57.170> it's<00:01:57.380> losing<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.890> altitude

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.140 

well<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:03.590> maintaining<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.250> altitude<00:02:04.670> now

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.910 

and<00:02:07.410> successfully<00:02:08.410> coming<00:02:08.710> back<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.979> home

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.070 

now<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.070> will<00:02:14.160> circle<00:02:14.580> around<00:02:14.640> here<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.900> there

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
now it will circle around here so there

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.230 
now it will circle around here so there
is<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> little<00:02:16.380> deviation<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.370> considers<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
is a little deviation it considers the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.020 
is a little deviation it considers the
home<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.570> there<00:02:19.070> or<00:02:20.070> maybe<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:20.640> turn

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
home is there or maybe it's just turn

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.060 
home is there or maybe it's just turn
around<00:02:21.210> for<00:02:21.420> circling<00:02:21.960> oh<00:02:22.080> yeah<00:02:22.440> sorry

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
around for circling oh yeah sorry

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.590 
around for circling oh yeah sorry
by<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.000> turned<00:02:24.180> around<00:02:24.270> for

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
by that it just turned around for

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.620 
by that it just turned around for
circling<00:02:25.050> now<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.260> plane<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.620> circling

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
circling now the plane is circling

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.950 
circling now the plane is circling
because<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> has<00:02:27.960> reached<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.800> home<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.730> uh<00:02:29.960> FY

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
because it has reached to home so uh FY

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.290 
because it has reached to home so uh FY
21<00:02:31.440> AP<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> lifesaver<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.790> plane<00:02:33.030> saver

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
21 AP is a lifesaver and a plane saver

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.570 
21 AP is a lifesaver and a plane saver
and<00:02:33.570> it's<00:02:33.690> working<00:02:33.870> successful<00:02:34.590> right<00:02:35.340> now

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
and it's working successful right now

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.280 
and it's working successful right now
I'm<00:02:35.760> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> put<00:02:36.270> on<00:02:36.300> my<00:02:36.420> goggles<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.200> I'm

I'm going to put on my goggles and I'm
gonna<00:02:37.440> go<00:02:37.680> far<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.400> two<00:02:38.610> kilometers<00:02:39.180> Qinling

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
gonna go far like two kilometers Qinling

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.080 
gonna go far like two kilometers Qinling
is<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:39.990> on<00:02:40.230> at<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> moment<00:02:40.740> so<00:02:40.950> I'm<00:02:41.850> just

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
is not on at the moment so I'm just

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.660 
is not on at the moment so I'm just
gonna<00:02:42.270> fly<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.930> little<00:02:43.110> farther<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.800> time

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:03:00.890 

just<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.910> get<00:02:48.120> used<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.900> new<00:02:48.960> OSD

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.650 

and<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.620> play<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:02.040> step<00:03:02.340> lies<00:03:02.580> itself

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
and the play that step lies itself

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.250 
and the play that step lies itself
all<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.260> need<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.650> do<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:05.950> just<00:03:06.130> make<00:03:06.310> turns

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.660 

and<00:03:10.310> 500<00:03:11.310> feet<00:03:11.580> at<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.940> moment<00:03:13.310> John<00:03:14.310> you're

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
and 500 feet at the moment John you're

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.250 
and 500 feet at the moment John you're
going<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.970> lose<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.300> point<00:03:15.540> now<00:03:15.750> because<00:03:16.050> I'm

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
going to lose the point now because I'm

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.490 
going to lose the point now because I'm
going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> climb<00:03:16.830> up<00:03:17.040> real<00:03:17.760> high<00:03:18.320> touch<00:03:19.320> the
