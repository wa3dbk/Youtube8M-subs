00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.779
 my name is anda battleship this is another 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.309
 a series of reviews of mods for the game could 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.500
 In this series we will see a mod which 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.929
 allows us to change the weather and for example 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 now now it's raining outside 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.330
 thunder or rather thunderstorm and everything is tightened so 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.710
 go the fog and let's write down and 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.070
 we'll stop here too 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.560
 go 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.369
 leaving again the rain go, he 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.070
 stops these but for example we can remove 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.910
 our threat of rain here he goes on his 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.780
 We see all these drops and so on can 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.030
 run away from him going here all the rain 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 does not go and in general it is pretty 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 interesting and also we can do on 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 on the street we will snow a little bit and here on 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 it was snowing in the street now after some 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.640
 time he goes from heaven again he is already 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 started with the choir be stronger stronger 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 go and at a pace he will 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 lean heavily as you see him 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.710
 more and more from 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.659
 some time there will be a lot of it 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.689
 let's remove the snow and put 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.140
 for example a multiple bloody moon is 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.150
 phenomenon 20 does exist 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.159
 boy this day some holiday 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.920
 celebrate or what is well in general here's a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.240
 we see the legal boom all reddish 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.770
 for some reason here I do not see but on 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.530
 some cards we see a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.310
 really the moon and how are you now 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.930
 hear it seems strange sounds a little 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.869
 removing 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.079
 Separately, we can put a thunderstorm, but 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.240
 us a little all reason and there and and from time 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.450
 time we have created a variety of what 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.229
 on a different sound and are associated with a thunderstorm 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.759
 also we can edit 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.380
 in every way the parameters for example make here 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:05.219
 so change but actually change the pace and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.200
 so on in general, everything is fine 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.650
 edit and but for example bloody well 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.780
 Let's do 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.090
 we can tickrate edit i honestly 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.450
 I do not know what is but in my opinion something 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.960
 the sounds of snow are connected snow I will not 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.750
 do well let's say rain and we can 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.140
 more rain to make it ti the Intensive 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.540
 from intensively promoted yourself decrease from 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.900
 rain much less we raise it 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.620
 much more tickrate again what are you 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.200
 don't know what we are again 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.110
 run and rain and of course not 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.550
 because we are in the building and the last 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.820
 the thing that is pretty strong to me 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.320
 like this earthquake parameters 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.200
 I will not edit it yet, but let's 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.190
 its just turn on first publishes 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.050
 different sounds everything shakes 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.210
 here so you heart let's for example 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.500
 Akim here a couple of boxes and see what 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:07.310
 will be with them so second 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.110
 waiting for a strong push for some reason they do not 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.770
 shaking on you no they already 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.680
 it is necessary to break that no more solid 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:24.160
 brick he also bounces on us at all 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.160
 parties here well how would this earthquake 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.680
 all we bounce and shakes i don't 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.080
 I know people honestly did not try 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.590
 that will be full of nothing, too, do not need 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:42.340
 to happen but in general, that's all 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.340
 done so now i will turn off 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.520
 post-processing by the way all this is in 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.170
 auto wiring well after you 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.830
 set this modification you to 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.640
 the internet will be a new section editor yet 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.530
 I donâ€™t understand such blocks at all for what 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.410
 they are intended but they are clearly 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.290
 edit no i understand not 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.580
 edited our weather and so on then 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.200
 there is they add mist and wind and 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.000
 sun which way will it shine 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.060
 time now she sits in the tourist 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.299
 and if we move it will change 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.299
 direction the fog as you see appeared 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.720
 and clouds 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.060
