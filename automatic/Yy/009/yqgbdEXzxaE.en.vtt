 violent radical groups and 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.320

 buses full of undocumented people that 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.839
 they come from the state of texas but the other 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 extreme the street is literally 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.399
 blocked because the groups 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.199
 anti-immigrants do not want them 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.069
 tremendous chaos 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 the singer lupillo rivera arrived and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.670
 bravely faced against the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.220
 block of racists in repeated 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 occasions were on the edge of falling 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.670
 hits 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.260

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.990
 face to defend the cause of the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.210
 undocumented and even more by children 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.950
 they had to go back and take them to 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.109
 another safer site since the block 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.569
 racist was adamantly opposed to the fact that 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.329
