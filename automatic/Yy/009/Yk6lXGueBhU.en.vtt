you couldn't use paper and just you know

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.470 
you couldn't use paper and just you know
roll<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.250> kind<00:04:08.820> of<00:04:08.880> cut<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.300> look<00:04:09.420> like

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
roll it and kind of cut it to look like

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.790 
roll it and kind of cut it to look like
a<00:04:09.660> candle<00:04:10.490> tape<00:04:11.490> some<00:04:11.760> string<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.210> their<00:04:12.800> tape

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
a candle tape some string on their tape

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.980

it<00:04:13.980> or<00:04:14.160> attack<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.210> your<00:04:15.330> ceiling<00:04:15.690> and<00:04:15.900> I

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
it or attack it to your ceiling and I

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.199 
it or attack it to your ceiling and I
