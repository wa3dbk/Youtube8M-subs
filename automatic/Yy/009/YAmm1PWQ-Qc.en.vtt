to a 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan so a few

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.680 
to a 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan so a few
tools<00:00:33.620> that<00:00:33.920> we<00:00:34.010> need<00:00:34.220> obviously<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.300> freon

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
tools that we need obviously the freon

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.500 
tools that we need obviously the freon
and<00:00:35.900> I<00:00:36.500> just<00:00:36.710> got<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.010> from<00:00:37.190> autozone<00:00:37.760> the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
and I just got this from autozone the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.640 
and I just got this from autozone the
cheapest<00:00:38.900> one<00:00:39.220> should<00:00:40.220> do<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.460> job<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:44.620> so<00:00:45.620> I

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
cheapest one should do the job and so I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.740 
cheapest one should do the job and so I
got<00:00:45.830> that<00:00:45.980> freon<00:00:46.490> and<00:00:46.880> then<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.330> have<00:00:47.570> my<00:00:49.750> my

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
got that freon and then I have my my

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.390 
got that freon and then I have my my
gauge<00:00:50.990> here<00:00:51.320> which<00:00:51.590> is<00:00:51.770> actually<00:00:52.190> going<00:00:52.310> to

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
gauge here which is actually going to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.560 
gauge here which is actually going to
also<00:00:52.700> as<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:54.110> shows<00:00:54.440> me<00:00:55.270> gauges<00:00:56.270> how<00:00:56.390> much

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
also as it shows me gauges how much

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.270 
also as it shows me gauges how much
freon<00:00:56.960> is<00:00:57.110> already<00:00:57.350> in<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.590> system<00:00:57.950> how<00:00:58.130> much

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
freon is already in the system how much

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.420 
freon is already in the system how much
I'm<00:00:58.400> going<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:58.580> put<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:59.800> you<00:01:00.800> use<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.130> tool<00:01:01.400> to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
I'm going to put in you use this tool to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.999 
I'm going to put in you use this tool to
put<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.300> freon<00:01:02.480> inside<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:04.250> fill<00:01:04.759> it<00:01:04.909> up<00:01:05.000> so

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
put the freon inside to fill it up so

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.099 
put the freon inside to fill it up so
come<00:01:07.009> on<00:01:07.100> over<00:01:07.250> here<00:01:07.340> buddy<00:01:07.780> all<00:01:08.780> right<00:01:08.840> so

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
come on over here buddy all right so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.300 
come on over here buddy all right so
let's<00:01:09.320> look<00:01:09.469> for<00:01:09.799> these<00:01:09.999> ports<00:01:11.649> I<00:01:12.649> think<00:01:13.219> I

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
let's look for these ports I think I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.849 
let's look for these ports I think I
found<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.670> high<00:01:13.820> port<00:01:14.499> right<00:01:15.499> up<00:01:15.619> here<00:01:15.799> is

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
found the high port right up here is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.469 
found the high port right up here is
going<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.009> be<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.249> high<00:01:16.369> port<00:01:16.729> which<00:01:17.210> we<00:01:17.359> don't

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
going to be the high port which we don't

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.989 
going to be the high port which we don't
want<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.749> connect<00:01:18.049> that<00:01:18.109> to<00:01:18.700> we<00:01:19.700> don't<00:01:19.819> want<00:01:19.939> to

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:19.999 
want to connect that to we don't want to

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.120 
want to connect that to we don't want to
connect<00:01:20.299> our<00:01:20.450> our<00:01:21.170> holes<00:01:21.469> come<00:01:21.770> in<00:01:21.859> from<00:01:22.009> the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
connect our our holes come in from the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.130 
connect our our holes come in from the
freon<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.579> down<00:01:23.329> here<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.569> going<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.719> be<00:01:23.840> low

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
freon to down here is going to be low

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.620 
freon to down here is going to be low
port<00:01:24.469> right<00:01:25.219> down<00:01:25.460> here<00:01:25.789> by<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:28.630> alternator

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
port right down here by the alternator

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.730 
port right down here by the alternator
and<00:01:31.299> when<00:01:32.299> you<00:01:32.389> go<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.539> plug<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.079> it's<00:01:33.590> only

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
and when you go to plug it in it's only

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.319 
and when you go to plug it in it's only
going<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.009> let<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:34.249> plug<00:01:34.490> into<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.850> low<00:01:35.030> port

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
going to let you plug into the low port

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.260 
going to let you plug into the low port
anyhow<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.369> should<00:01:37.369> be<00:01:37.460> pretty<00:01:37.700> easy<00:01:37.789> for<00:01:38.179> you

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
anyhow so should be pretty easy for you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.459 
anyhow so should be pretty easy for you
to<00:01:38.359> do<00:01:38.539> but<00:01:39.350> just<00:01:40.780> remember<00:01:41.780> we're<00:01:42.319> going<00:01:42.409> to

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
to do but just remember we're going to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.469 
to do but just remember we're going to
turn<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.799> car<00:01:43.009> on<00:01:43.039> then<00:01:43.939> we're<00:01:44.090> going<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.240> plug

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
turn the car on then we're going to plug

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.529 
turn the car on then we're going to plug
it<00:01:44.659> in<00:01:44.810> open<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.679> valve<00:01:45.979> for<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.340> freon<00:01:47.240> and

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
it in open the valve for the freon and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.260 
it in open the valve for the freon and
we<00:01:48.020> got<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.259> shake<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.560> freon<00:01:48.770> can<00:01:49.189> as<00:01:49.429> we're

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
we got to shake the freon can as we're

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.090 
we got to shake the freon can as we're
filling<00:01:51.259> up<00:01:52.959> so<00:01:53.959> we<00:01:54.049> got<00:01:54.200> our<00:01:54.319> low<00:01:54.530> port<00:01:54.859> right

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
filling up so we got our low port right

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.890 
filling up so we got our low port right
down<00:01:55.340> here

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
down here

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.469 
down here
that's<00:01:57.900> where<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.200> put<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> freon<00:01:58.680> end

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.239 

and<00:02:02.659> then<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:02.960> have<00:02:03.079> our<00:02:03.200> high<00:02:03.350> point<00:02:03.619> up<00:02:03.799> here

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
and then we have our high point up here

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:08.180 
and then we have our high point up here
we<00:02:05.520> don't<00:02:05.670> want<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.850> touch<00:02:05.939> up

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.910 

I'm<00:02:08.250> gonna<00:02:08.340> keep<00:02:08.550> checking<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.060> gauge

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:48.810 

open<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.730> up<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.330> let<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.110> freon<00:02:18.380> in

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.800 

alright<00:02:49.820> now<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.180> charge<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.600> system

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
alright now that I charge the system

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.030 
alright now that I charge the system
when<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.230> go<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.650> see<00:02:51.980> how<00:02:52.190> cool<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.790> air<00:02:52.970> is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
when I go and see how cool the air is

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.470
