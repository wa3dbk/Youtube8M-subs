00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello today another bmx from 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.820
 mongoose but how do you know interesting 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.440
 bike they have it only legion bmx 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.139
 all other models are rather strange 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.509
 you are now in my hands mangus cop this 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.379
 I think after more precisely before the legion he 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.379
 leave the line and 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.630
 that it is a little bit cheaper than the legion 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.189
 there he is now around 10 with kopecks 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.289
 worth discount 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.210
 but still it cost more there price 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.230
 flax officially cost 350 bucks 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.800
 that is, almost well now is not the course 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 14 thousand dollars will be what we are here for 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.710
 this money is more likely for this money 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.760
 have 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 us and here what 's x is the new frame 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.280
 sadly they boiled of course 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.340
 technologically tried more precisely should 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.110
 shorter technological they brought up 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:03.229
 nipple as it should not be set 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:05.700
 carriage steering cup made there 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.930
 curved jumper between upper 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.180
 feathers but that doesn't matter 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.000
 because he is heidi new and early or 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
 late one of these knots grunts 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.830
 which one will depend on which one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.159
 trick you will bet on geometry 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.240
 very similar to the region ie the angle 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.790
 steering column 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.549
 I think here is seventy four five il 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 74 so damn well mongoose whole 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.310
 sharpened fall long feathers given 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.400
 case Rostovka felt on the jumps to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.259
 25 but it is written that even on the upper tube 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 it is written that it is 20-25 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.250
 Do you know why it feels like 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.000
 be given now because the steering angle 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.140
 speakers such an un lengthens the bike in 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.899
 general for iron here everything is done 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.259
 as cheap as possible and I honestly do not 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.840
 I understand why such a big gap by 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.049
 to the technologies of this bike a copter from 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.759
 region as if the price difference okay 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.680
 not one step two steps when viewed 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.500
 on successful manufacturers and the difference 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.770
 linkages are just thorough if we are 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.730
 take conventional bmx sailing bmx 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.680
 producers they how do 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.170
 they take there the cheapest will have time all 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.540
 from shit the next specials become a half 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.010
 thousand rubles more honey already 2 3 tubes 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.750
 normal with the rest is shit 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.030
 the next alcohol is still two and a half thousand 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.069
 already almost all over 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.680
 the temple is a lively frame then many forks 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.840
 limping will come out like that all and so 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.730
 quietly quietly they do so 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.569
 so that for any money you can find 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.519
 the bike itself is exactly from this company 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.190
 mongoose turns out so legion cool 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.069
 everything else is shit inside the very same 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.530
 firms that is there is no point in taking a step lower 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.859
 it is necessary as money but 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.410
 there are not enough regions at all 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:57.310
 strange situation so that someone else on 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.170
 cutting say here is not integrated 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.019
 the steering column that is just for 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.870
 cups they are driven in gram as in 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.209
 antiquities the same casually welded 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.980
 fork pants are the easiest but by the way 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.590
 saying the level of welding in this ah uh 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.690
 offices you grew up to much better 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.169
 steel but the essence of the rods is not 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.590
 changed you so ordinary us 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:22.599
 simple stamped long handle 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.109
 brake quick brake nifiga not 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.419
 brakes cheap tires 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.630
 Well, by the way by the way could 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.940
 look good enough 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.010
 This is the combination of flames colors. 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.359
 it seems to me black and red 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:43.630
 plastic pedals turned out 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.880
 fpd I honestly did see for the first time and concepts 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.299
 I do not have what will happen to them during long 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.500
 operating robot ok asterisk 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.489
 steel 25 teeth chain is the simplest 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.329
 again as with frame c1 exactly the same 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:03.549
 rear hub driver 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:11.910
 apparently on the front balls the same 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:11.910
 the thing on the balls of autumn is hollow both for bada 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.220
 I can't even understand double now 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.070
 rim or not saddle saddle on the framework 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.700
 seatpost and steel shorter 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:31.500
 what a nightmare, well, ride and understandable 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.660
 it is possible due to the fact that everything is all in 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.640
 geometry plan more or less acceptable 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.310
 i.e. this is not stealth or some 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.770
 a bmx which is not just made of 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.810
 shit things as if not for man 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.570
 this one was designed 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:52.050
 but on materials saved everywhere and 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.730
 just let it to the maximum 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.310
 a little ride by the way the steering wheel and 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:00.980
 low and not too wide that 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.240
 branded chip mongoose Sgiach Whatever 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.050
 the wind blows probably again the sound will be 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 godova 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.990
 Well, let's take a little ride on it 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.060
 almost ride it 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.930
 buddhist 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.470
 and tilt 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.650
 to whom we are inclined we are all very 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.760
 How many rides normally 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.969
 appears spins normally 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.889
 that is, if 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:30.329
 class well no money at all you do not 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.329
 recognize in the puddles part 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.540
 no i can't say it 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.330
 and 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.070
 well and so on there is no need to take it but 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.730
 if you already took it you know what 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:48.120
 you can ride it two full 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.120
 total destruction 5 secrets 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.160
 I think stop 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.900
 problem of such bikes 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.460
 will open in the head of all engineers 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.960
 which 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.240
 a dozen to the top 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.280
 years old 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.020
 in the office 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.020
 generally do not listen to the street 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.280
 Is a few years decided on the farm 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.170
 become 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.389
 and so of course why should you spend 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.470
 some trials e here in taiwan 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.480
 part of the cities trying something 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.860
 from here do all this work which they 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.500
 essentially obliged to do 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.620
 they do they just earn 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:32.230
 money they already have all the stability 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.230
 and calm and they rivet 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.140
 since companies are large enough 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.920
 it's easier for them to cover the rejection losses there 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.050
 I do not know 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.680
 return the guarantee that so mink 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.960
 chat smoked 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.699
 everybody hold some serious 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.729
 upgrading break out in the body 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.669
 Here is an opinion on such companies as 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:57.009
 mongoose 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:59.340
 I want to thank enough 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:00.840
 you can even notice like 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.220
 so generally happened on something around 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.220
 bodies and what plan 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.230
 but as for the trick you can something mastered 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.230
 in sniffed 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.849
 young in the initial circles that's for sure 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.350
 survive but when it terrified go over 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.620
 very serious 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.620
 the main 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:38.770
 do this guys thank you for 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.180
 attention you mangus 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.180
 2014 all bye
