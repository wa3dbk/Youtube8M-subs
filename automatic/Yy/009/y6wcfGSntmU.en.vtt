 ana who must have five one against spain 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.830
 Australia might not be a problem 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.870

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:19.020
 themselves will be around goes 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 message is meant for per 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.029
 video card wondering how they put on ice 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.380
 the ball get slices of red itself 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.449
 prefers it in the sharper cell too 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.820
 properties that there was finishing as one 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.099
 crazy and here that poverty scores 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 now you get the total upside down now 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.270

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.550
 now you are calm then you want to sit says 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 Look, I am fat it this context the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.180
 fall 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.340
 this comes from the traction neat 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.590
 and with cutting biological spaces on one 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.570
 siphon beat the aesthetic municipality 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.100
 It also seems like you australia 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.110
 he wins what we talked about 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.090
 he slowly but surely lies down 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.780
 dutch team gets some grip on it 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.370
 duel 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.899
 and suddenly there is a call and I thought 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 or warm does not play variation here 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.170
 what this is the risks you but 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.809
 in the end it just gets the space 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.299
 to shoot and he passes the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.200
 goalkeeper brian and nephew yoga rightly so 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.890
 the ball being purified is killing 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.909
