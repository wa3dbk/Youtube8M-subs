of all their work I mean what do you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.330 
of all their work I mean what do you
know<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.840> makes<00:01:52.079> sense<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.470> progression<00:01:52.860> but

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
know that makes sense a progression but

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
know that makes sense a progression but
the<00:01:53.430> thing<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> love<00:01:53.909> about<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.270> band<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> that

the thing I love about this band is that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
the thing I love about this band is that
they're<00:01:54.899> consistent<00:01:55.560> they<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.100> never<00:01:56.369> put

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
they're consistent they have never put

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
they're consistent they have never put
out<00:01:57.000> anything<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> could<00:01:58.110> even<00:01:58.380> call

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
out anything that you could even call

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.280

remotely<00:01:59.490> bad<00:01:59.729> all<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.630> their<00:02:00.750> albums<00:02:00.869> are

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
remotely bad all of their albums are

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
against songs that were a little bit

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.290 
against songs that were a little bit
longer<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.949> little<00:04:40.009> bit<00:04:40.310> more<00:04:40.430> brooding<00:04:40.819> even<00:04:41.240> a
