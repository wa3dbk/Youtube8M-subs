00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
just been released and i'm about to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.640 
just been released and i'm about to

create my squad for ultimate team 12 and

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.900 
create my squad for ultimate team 12 and
the<00:00:10.650> first<00:00:10.889> thing<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.130> really<00:00:11.370> know<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.700> is

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the first thing I really know this is

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.850 
the first thing I really know this is
the<00:00:12.120> Texas<00:00:12.570> will<00:00:12.780> messed<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.259> which<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.620> think

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the Texas will messed up which I think

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.269 
the Texas will messed up which I think
was<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> glitch<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.540> EI<00:00:15.750> system<00:00:16.130> and<00:00:17.130> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
was a glitch on the EI system and I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.390 
was a glitch on the EI system and I
think<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.940> should<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.330> fixed<00:00:18.600> later<00:00:18.900> on<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> so

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
think it should be fixed later on and so

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.340 
think it should be fixed later on and so
let's<00:00:20.580> just<00:00:20.760> start<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.270> first<00:00:21.869> pack<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
let's just start with the first pack and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.400 
let's just start with the first pack and
see<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:26.570> what<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.900> hell<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
see what we get and we what the hell is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.950 
see what we get and we what the hell is
this<00:00:30.439> why<00:00:31.439> would<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> oh<00:00:32.420> all<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.690> right

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
this why would it oh all right right

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.130 
this why would it oh all right right
okay<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.760> think<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
okay so this just think this is just the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.139

I've<00:02:34.620> probably<00:02:35.069> go<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.880> Brazilian<00:02:36.390> squad

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
I've probably go with a Brazilian squad

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.039 
I've probably go with a Brazilian squad
again<00:02:36.959> with<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:38.299> then<00:02:39.299> probably<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:39.989> a

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
again with and then probably have like a

again with and then probably have like a
hybrid<00:02:40.349> squad<00:02:40.739> somewhere<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.459> between<00:02:41.670> just

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
hybrid squad somewhere in between just

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.809

to<00:02:42.330> mix<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.630> up<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.870> bit<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
to mix it up a bit and so that's the

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.780 
to mix it up a bit and so that's the
pack<00:02:45.000> openings<00:02:45.480> finished<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.019> guess<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.790> let's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790

overrule three and a half stars and a 39
chemistry<00:02:57.090> which<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.599> which<00:02:58.049> isn't<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.410> bad

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
chemistry which is which isn't that bad

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.979 
chemistry which is which isn't that bad
but<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:59.280> could<00:02:59.340> be<00:02:59.610> better<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.660> I'm<00:03:00.750> going<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
but it could be better so I'm going to

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.600 
but it could be better so I'm going to
