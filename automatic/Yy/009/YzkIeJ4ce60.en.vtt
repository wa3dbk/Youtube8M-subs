00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
that flat to the back and I'm using a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.290 
that flat to the back and I'm using a
pin<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.079> ahead<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.320> secure<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.950> there<00:00:41.489> so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
pin to go ahead and secure that there so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
pin to go ahead and secure that there so
I'll<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> worry<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:42.930> holding<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.620> down

I'll have to worry about holding it down

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:53.270 
I'll have to worry about holding it down
it<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.550> makes<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.910> easier<00:00:51.890> okay<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.190> I'm
