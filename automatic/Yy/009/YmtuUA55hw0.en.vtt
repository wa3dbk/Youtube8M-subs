here if you've never done it before

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.019 
here if you've never done it before
first<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.400> don't<00:00:23.460> take<00:00:23.670> you

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
first you don't take you

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.009 
first you don't take you
of<00:00:24.240> course<00:00:24.510> strip<00:00:24.750> your<00:00:24.900> wire<00:00:24.930> back<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:26.779> 1/4<00:00:27.779> of

an inch maybe not quite a quarter of an
inch<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.619> tell<00:00:31.859> how<00:00:32.340> much<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.730> need

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
inch but you can tell how much you need

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.190 
inch but you can tell how much you need
to<00:00:33.090> trim<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> back<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.410> fit<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> connector

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
to trim it back to fit the connector

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
to trim it back to fit the connector
with<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.730> hooking<00:00:38.730> side<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> connector

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
with the hooking side of the connector

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.080 
with the hooking side of the connector
up<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.559> brown<00:00:40.860> wire<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
up and the brown wire first because the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.180 
up and the brown wire first because the
way<00:00:42.210> these<00:00:42.420> things<00:00:42.480> lay<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.739> connectors

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
way these things lay into the connectors

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.880 
way these things lay into the connectors
you<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.489> your<00:00:45.050> connectors<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.350> crimped

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you want your connectors to be crimped

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.029 
you want your connectors to be crimped
with<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> brown<00:00:48.120> side<00:00:48.510> closest<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.410> just

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
with the brown side closest to you just

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
with the brown side closest to you just
like<00:00:50.190> I'm<00:00:50.340> doing<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> your<00:00:51.570> polarity

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
like I'm doing here so your polarity

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.569 
like I'm doing here so your polarity
won't<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.320> reversed<00:00:52.649> when<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> put<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.280> into

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
won't be reversed when you put it into

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.540 
won't be reversed when you put it into
the<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> housing<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the to the housing all right you want to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.930 
the to the housing all right you want to
put<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.360> there<00:00:57.629> hold<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.079> take<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> some

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
put that there hold it take you some

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.369 
put that there hold it take you some
small<00:00:59.940> set<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> pliers<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:02.930> just<00:01:03.930> pinch<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
small set of pliers and just pinch it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
small set of pliers and just pinch it
right<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.010> will<00:01:05.159> hold<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.299> can

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
right here so it will hold so you can

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.670 
right here so it will hold so you can
get<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> crimper<00:01:07.140> when<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
get in a crimper when you put in the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.789 
get in a crimper when you put in the
crimper<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.880> open<00:01:09.330> side<00:01:09.510> down<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
crimper with the open side down and the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.490 
crimper with the open side down and the
crimper<00:01:11.299> the<00:01:12.299> under<00:01:12.630> smallest<00:01:12.990> setting<00:01:13.320> here

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
crimper the under smallest setting here

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.249 
crimper the under smallest setting here
these<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> real<00:01:14.490> basic<00:01:14.970> crimper<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:16.200> do

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
these are a real basic crimper they do

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.190 
these are a real basic crimper they do
the<00:01:16.590> job<00:01:16.830> they're<00:01:17.070> inexpensive<00:01:17.869> just<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the job they're inexpensive just have to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.600 
the job they're inexpensive just have to
be<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.680> careful<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.490> there<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
be more careful put it in there and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.789 
be more careful put it in there and
crimp<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> stick<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.770> you

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
crimp it down like so get a stick so you

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.960 
crimp it down like so get a stick so you
have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.600> pop<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.869> unless<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.380> hand<00:01:28.970> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
have to pop it out unless your hand and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
have to pop it out unless your hand and
you<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> crimped<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.829> need<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> make

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you get it crimped but you need to make

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.149 
you get it crimped but you need to make
sure<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:34.020> around<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> insulation<00:01:35.070> but

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
sure that it's around the insulation but

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.429 
sure that it's around the insulation but
you<00:01:35.280> need<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> make<00:01:35.610> sure<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:37.049> on

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you need to make sure that it also is on

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
you need to make sure that it also is on
the<00:01:37.619> wire<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.759> tight<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.570> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the wire really good and tight so you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.749 
the wire really good and tight so you
might<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> take<00:01:40.200> your<00:01:40.259> pliers<00:01:40.759> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
might want to take your pliers the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
might want to take your pliers the
second<00:01:42.210> stage<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.110> squeeze<00:01:43.649> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
second stage there and just squeeze it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
second stage there and just squeeze it
down<00:01:43.890> good<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.340> wire<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.640> make<00:01:44.820> sure<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
down good on your wire to make sure you

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
down good on your wire to make sure you
have<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> good<00:01:46.320> connection<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
have a good connection and for the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.100 
have a good connection and for the
second<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.329> I've<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.689> another<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.020> here

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
second time I've got another one here

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.580 
second time I've got another one here
with<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.560> three<00:01:50.060> all<00:01:51.060> three<00:01:51.290> already<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
with all three all three already on it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.760 
with all three all three already on it
so<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:52.890> only<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:54.170> make<00:01:55.170> sure<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.590> these

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
so I'm only going make sure all these

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
so I'm only going make sure all these
wires<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.960> nice<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> tight<00:01:58.469> right<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:59.990> just

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
wires are nice and tight right here just

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.929 
wires are nice and tight right here just
so<00:02:01.140> we'll<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.500> any<00:02:01.619> connection<00:02:02.070> problems<00:02:02.549> on

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
so we'll have any connection problems on

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.040 
so we'll have any connection problems on
all<00:02:03.240> three

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.740 

and<00:02:08.050> since<00:02:08.260> this<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.650> a<00:02:08.760> male<00:02:09.760> pens<00:02:10.210> they<00:02:10.510> fit

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
and since this is a male pens they fit

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.950 
and since this is a male pens they fit
in<00:02:10.870> the<00:02:11.020> female<00:02:11.470> housing<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.540> you'll<00:02:13.720> take<00:02:13.900> a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
in the female housing so you'll take a

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.960 
in the female housing so you'll take a
male<00:02:14.350> housing<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:17.020> we'll<00:02:17.670> insert<00:02:18.670> these

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
male housing and we'll insert these

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.760 
male housing and we'll insert these
three<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.050> had<00:02:23.290> put

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
three just like so and if you had put

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.970 
three just like so and if you had put
the<00:02:23.890> wires<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:26.050> thing<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.560> wrong<00:02:26.740> way<00:02:26.920> you

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the wires in the thing the wrong way you

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.530 
the wires in the thing the wrong way you
would<00:02:27.130> have<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.370> twist<00:02:27.640> all<00:02:27.880> those<00:02:28.060> wires<00:02:28.330> so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
would have to twist all those wires so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.410 
would have to twist all those wires so
we'll<00:02:28.710> push<00:02:29.710> em<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:30.990> till<00:02:31.990> they<00:02:33.420> should

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
we'll push em in there till they should

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.390 
we'll push em in there till they should
snap<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:34.990> place<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:35.800> like<00:02:35.980> that

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
snap in place just like that

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.010 
snap in place just like that
all<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.820> them<00:02:36.910> snapped<00:02:37.210> in<00:02:37.360> place<00:02:37.390> tightly<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
all of them snapped in place tightly to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.950 
all of them snapped in place tightly to
make<00:02:38.200> sure<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.650> you're<00:02:39.510> all<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.570> little

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
make sure that you're all the little

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.330 
make sure that you're all the little
snaps<00:02:41.260> are<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.950> take<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
snaps are in and then you take the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.300 
snaps are in and then you take the
female<00:02:42.580> housing<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.270> goes<00:02:43.330> across<00:02:43.600> this

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
female housing that goes across this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.380 
female housing that goes across this
make<00:02:45.310> sure<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.550> put<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.820> on<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.030> right<00:02:46.180> way

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
make sure you put it on the right way

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.970 
make sure you put it on the right way
and<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.350> snaps<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.590> then<00:02:50.860> you

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
and it just snaps on like that then you

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.060 
and it just snaps on like that then you
have<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> female<00:02:52.260> connector<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:53.980> of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
have a female connector on that and of

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.350 
have a female connector on that and of
course<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.490> other<00:02:54.610> end<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:54.910> could<00:02:55.060> do<00:02:55.210> your

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
course the other end you could do your

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.870 
course the other end you could do your
male<00:02:55.600> connectors<00:02:56.200> these<00:02:56.520> here<00:02:57.520> are<00:02:57.640> for<00:02:57.820> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
male connectors these here are for the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.200 
male connectors these here are for the
males<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:59.070> that's<00:03:00.070> how<00:03:00.160> you<00:03:00.220> do<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.460> real

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
males and that's how you do it real

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.360 
males and that's how you do it real
simple
