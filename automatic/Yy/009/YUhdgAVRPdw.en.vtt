00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.039 

so<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> usually<00:00:15.119> do<00:00:15.419> is<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.570> start<00:00:15.929> with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
so what I usually do is just start with

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.839 
so what I usually do is just start with
a<00:00:16.139> single<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.529> probably<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.250> being

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
a single and probably just just being

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.210 
a single and probably just just being
able<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.060> hold<00:00:21.360> it<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.960> know<00:00:22.110> what<00:00:23.009> I<00:00:23.039> usually

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
able to hold it you know what I usually

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.769 
able to hold it you know what I usually
when<00:00:23.490> I'm<00:00:23.579> performing<00:00:23.699> if<00:00:24.239> I<00:00:24.360> have<00:00:24.509> really

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
when I'm performing if I have really

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.950 
when I'm performing if I have really
long<00:00:24.960> voice<00:00:25.849> well<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.180> for<00:00:27.509> a<00:00:27.570> short<00:00:27.810> word

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
long voice well that for a short word

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.249 
long voice well that for a short word
it's<00:00:28.110> quite<00:00:28.349> long<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.720> usually<00:00:30.720> move<00:00:31.050> up

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
it's quite long then I usually move up

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.340 
it's quite long then I usually move up
if<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.940> action<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.480> quick<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.930> move<00:00:34.140> up

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
if the action is really quick I move up

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.700 
if the action is really quick I move up
if<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> slow<00:00:35.489> action<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.000> move<00:00:36.180> bit<00:00:36.470> yeah<00:00:37.470> so

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
if it's a slow action I move bit yeah so

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.200 
if it's a slow action I move bit yeah so
it's<00:00:37.949> easier<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.339> handle<00:00:38.640> when<00:00:38.699> you<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.000> less

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
it's easier to handle when you have less

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.479 
it's easier to handle when you have less
string<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.350> when<00:00:40.470> you<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.890> longer<00:00:41.190> string

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
string and when you have a longer string

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.280 
string and when you have a longer string
it's<00:00:41.640> quite<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> house<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:42.930> harder<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's quite a house so it's harder to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.130 
it's quite a house so it's harder to
handle<00:00:43.440> both<00:00:44.100> fast<00:00:44.400> sections<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.719> usually<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
handle both fast sections so usually I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.750 
handle both fast sections so usually I
just<00:00:46.640> get<00:00:47.640> them<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> catch

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.960 

so<00:00:53.329> this<00:00:53.840> is<00:00:53.989> what<00:00:54.079> we<00:00:54.200> do<00:00:54.500> just<00:00:54.710> catch<00:00:54.980> bitch

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
so this is what we do just catch bitch

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.720 
so this is what we do just catch bitch
so<00:00:56.900> there's<00:00:57.140> hurt<00:00:57.500> hurt<00:00:57.800> in<00:00:57.980> two<00:00:58.160> swings<00:01:00.730> this

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
so there's hurt hurt in two swings this

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.950 
so there's hurt hurt in two swings this
is<00:01:01.850> one<00:01:02.090> on<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:02.360> either<00:01:02.930> side<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.440> your<00:01:03.590> hand

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
should already have sort of like this

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.420 
should already have sort of like this
knowledge<00:04:20.420> of<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.870> patterns<00:04:21.200> already<00:04:21.430> so

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
knowledge of the patterns already so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.130 
knowledge of the patterns already so
like<00:04:22.640> if<00:04:22.790> somebody<00:04:23.120> was<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.570> stand<00:04:23.870> here<00:04:24.110> and

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
do it like just show me that foot I'd

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.490 
do it like just show me that foot I'd
better<00:04:26.390> pick<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.660> up<00:04:26.720> straight<00:04:26.960> away<00:04:27.050> because

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
better pick it up straight away because

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.420 
better pick it up straight away because
of<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.610> type<00:04:28.790> of<00:04:28.820> actions<00:04:29.270> in<00:04:29.450> there<00:04:29.600> are

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
of that the type of actions in there are
