00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.560 

you

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.470 

okay<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.410> mana<00:00:34.620> base<00:00:34.859> it's<00:00:35.420> not<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
okay this is a the mana base it's not a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.930 
okay this is a the mana base it's not a
hundred<00:00:36.989> percent<00:00:37.170> optimal<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.339> the<00:00:38.579> most

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
hundred percent optimal because the most

hundred percent optimal because the most
let's<00:00:39.390> run<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:39.960> cabin<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.469> souls<00:00:40.680> but

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
let's run like for cabin or souls but

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.899 
let's run like for cabin or souls but
only<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> two<00:00:42.210> right<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.489> yeah<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
only get the two right now but yeah it

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.029 
only get the two right now but yeah it
says<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.359> a<00:00:45.449> pretty<00:00:46.079> decent<00:00:46.440> bass<00:00:46.589> it's<00:00:46.859> got

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
says it's a pretty decent bass it's got

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.420 
says it's a pretty decent bass it's got
the<00:00:47.219> 11<00:00:48.149> shocks<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:48.839> then<00:00:49.589> one<00:00:49.769> basic<00:00:50.159> force

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the 11 shocks and then one basic force

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.149 
the 11 shocks and then one basic force
in<00:00:50.729> the<00:00:50.940> two<00:00:51.269> caverns<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.049> gotta<00:00:52.350> turn<00:00:52.860> one

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
in the two caverns so you gotta turn one

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.479 
in the two caverns so you gotta turn one
on<00:00:53.449> taplin<00:00:54.589> ninety<00:00:55.589> percent<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.949> time<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.369> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
on taplin ninety percent of time if you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.789 
on taplin ninety percent of time if you
have<00:00:56.579> two<00:00:56.789> lands<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.299> your<00:00:57.420> hand<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.680> you

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
have two lands in your hand if not you

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.439 
have two lands in your hand if not you
should<00:00:58.829> probably<00:00:58.979> Mulligan<00:00:59.549> but<00:01:00.089> they<00:01:00.239> have

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
should probably Mulligan but they have

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.359 
should probably Mulligan but they have

play<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.070> champion<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
play you can have this champion the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060 
play you can have this champion the
parish<00:01:26.880> Moore's<00:01:27.780> elite<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.230> also<00:01:28.530> fine<00:01:28.770> amount

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
parish Moore's elite is also fine amount

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.370 
parish Moore's elite is also fine amount
of<00:01:29.160> three<00:01:29.370> of<00:01:29.400> those<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.940> through<00:01:30.720> experiment

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
of three of those and through experiment

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.920 
of three of those and through experiment
ones<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.070> pretty<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.330> region

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
ones which is pretty good the region

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.660 
ones which is pretty good the region
comes<00:01:34.230> in<00:01:34.380> handy<00:01:34.560> sometimes<00:01:35.160> because<00:01:35.490> then

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
comes in handy sometimes because then

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.820 
comes in handy sometimes because then
you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.960> least<00:01:37.080> one<00:01:37.290> guy<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.680> play

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
you can have at least one guy and play

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.410 
you can have at least one guy and play
through<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.070> wrath<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.700> might<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.970> plant<00:01:39.270> light

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
through a wrath it might be plant light

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940 
through a wrath it might be plant light
of<00:01:39.600> knowledge<00:01:39.690> hook<00:01:40.050> before<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:40.560> next<00:01:40.680> turn

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
of knowledge hook before the next turn

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.450 
of knowledge hook before the next turn
so<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.970> pretty<00:01:42.210> good<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:43.410> to<00:01:43.860> drop<00:01:44.100> squish

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so it's pretty good the to drop squish

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.830 
so it's pretty good the to drop squish
get<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.790> burning<00:01:45.030> tree<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.540> say<00:01:45.660> which

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
get your burning tree and say which

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
get your burning tree and say which
really<00:01:46.170> turns<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.680> deck<00:01:46.860> own<00:01:47.420> champion<00:01:48.420> into

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
really turns the deck own champion into

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
really turns the deck own champion into

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you know burning tree burning tree

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
you know burning tree burning tree
lightning<00:01:51.210> baller<00:01:52.070> hit<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:54.380> hit<00:01:55.380> 48<00:01:55.560> so

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
lightning baller hit for hit 48 so

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.100 
lightning baller hit for hit 48 so
that's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.970> not<00:01:57.360> uncommon<00:01:58.070> turn<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> hidden

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that's a not uncommon turn to so hidden

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.310 
that's a not uncommon turn to so hidden
for<00:02:01.820> even<00:02:02.820> seven<00:02:03.300> with<00:02:03.600> just<00:02:03.810> burning<00:02:04.170> tree

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
like the mauler it 47 is very easy

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.590 
like the mauler it 47 is very easy
actually<00:02:07.970> course<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> four<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.300> lightning

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
actually course the four of lightning

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.420 
actually course the four of lightning
baller<00:02:09.750> got<00:02:10.350> for<00:02:10.590> Hamlet<00:02:10.920> captain<00:02:11.280> because
