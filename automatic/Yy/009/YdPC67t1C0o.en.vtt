00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
ok guys the real problem with high bar

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.010 
ok guys the real problem with high bar
squats<00:00:02.159> for<00:00:02.429> powerful<00:00:03.090> thing<00:00:03.330> in<00:00:03.510> my<00:00:03.689> opinion

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
squats for powerful thing in my opinion

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.960 
squats for powerful thing in my opinion
does<00:00:04.470> not<00:00:04.680> have<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.100> do<00:00:05.250> with<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.580> fact<00:00:05.790> that

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
does not have to do with the fact that

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.049 
does not have to do with the fact that
it<00:00:06.660> makes<00:00:07.290> your<00:00:07.500> back<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.980> our<00:00:08.130> love<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.849> I

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
it makes your back of our love so I

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.610 
it makes your back of our love so I
think<00:00:09.420> kind<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.900> common<00:00:10.230> knowledge<00:00:10.349> is

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
think kind of the common knowledge is

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.990 
think kind of the common knowledge is
going<00:00:10.800> around<00:00:10.920> right<00:00:11.160> now<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.610> low<00:00:11.790> bar

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
going around right now is that low bar

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.430 
going around right now is that low bar
is<00:00:12.120> more<00:00:12.360> effective<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:12.809> powerlifting

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
is more effective for powerlifting

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.890 
is more effective for powerlifting
because<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.219> shortens<00:00:14.820> your<00:00:15.330> back<00:00:15.599> segment

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
because it shortens your back segment

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.720 
because it shortens your back segment
because<00:00:16.500> again<00:00:16.800> if<00:00:16.949> you're<00:00:17.070> carrying<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> bar

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
because again if you're carrying the bar

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.060 
because again if you're carrying the bar
up<00:00:17.940> here<00:00:17.970> versus<00:00:18.660> down<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.680> makes<00:00:19.920> your

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
up here versus down here it makes your

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.099 
up here versus down here it makes your
torso<00:00:20.340> relatively<00:00:21.029> shorter<00:00:21.390> which<00:00:21.840> means

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
torso relatively shorter which means

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.509 
torso relatively shorter which means
that<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> shorter<00:00:23.010> moment<00:00:23.400> arm

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
that you have a shorter moment arm

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.759 
that you have a shorter moment arm
between<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.300> hips<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.750> bar<00:00:24.990> meaning<00:00:25.680> you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
between the hips and the bar meaning you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.890 
between the hips and the bar meaning you
need<00:00:25.920> less<00:00:26.189> hip<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.789> work<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.420> complete<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
need less hip to work to complete the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.540 
need less hip to work to complete the
lift<00:00:28.080> however<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> problem<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.400> idea

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
lift however the problem with this idea

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.009 
lift however the problem with this idea
is<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.000> doesn't<00:00:30.300> account<00:00:30.539> for<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> fact

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
is that it doesn't account for the fact

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
is that it doesn't account for the fact
that<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> short<00:00:32.130> torso<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.759> have

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that if you have a short torso you have

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.870 
that if you have a short torso you have
to<00:00:33.059> lean<00:00:33.390> over<00:00:33.750> more<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.739> keep<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.370> bar<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
to lean over more to keep the bar and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.690 
to lean over more to keep the bar and
balance<00:00:36.329> after<00:00:37.050> all<00:00:37.620> who<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.219> known<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> have

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
balance after all who is known to have

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.760 
balance after all who is known to have
the<00:00:39.030> better<00:00:39.239> squat<00:00:39.840> through<00:00:40.140> their<00:00:40.260> body<00:00:40.410> type

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the better squat through their body type

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
the better squat through their body type
the<00:00:41.219> person<00:00:41.610> with<00:00:41.760> short<00:00:42.090> beamers<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.200> long

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the person with short beamers and a long

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830 
the person with short beamers and a long
torso<00:00:43.860> or<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> person<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> short<00:00:45.539> torso

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
torso or the person is the short torso

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
torso or the person is the short torso
in<00:00:46.230> Long<00:00:46.620> femurs<00:00:47.129> relatively<00:00:47.820> speaking<00:00:48.030> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
in Long femurs relatively speaking of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.270 
in Long femurs relatively speaking of
course<00:00:48.360> it's<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> person<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> long

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
course it's the person that has a long

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
course it's the person that has a long
torso<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.449> our<00:00:51.690> line<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> argumentation

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
torso so this our line of argumentation

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.139 
torso so this our line of argumentation
to<00:00:52.980> meet<00:00:53.190> doesn't<00:00:53.610> make<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> whole<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to meet doesn't make a whole lot of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.479 
to meet doesn't make a whole lot of
sense<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> real<00:00:55.500> reason<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> high<00:00:56.309> bar

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sense now the real reason the high bar

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.060 
sense now the real reason the high bar
squat<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> problem<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.750> powerlifting<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.559> my

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
squat is a problem in powerlifting in my

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.819 
squat is a problem in powerlifting in my
opinion<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.750> rack<00:01:01.109> position<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
opinion is because the rack position is

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.560 
opinion is because the rack position is
unstable<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.879> let<00:01:03.000> me<00:01:03.030> show<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.300> what<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.539> mean

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
unstable so let me show you what I mean

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.149 
unstable so let me show you what I mean
ok<00:01:04.140> guys<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> main<00:01:04.710> thing<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.920> want<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
ok guys so the main thing I want to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.320 
ok guys so the main thing I want to
demonstrate<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.909> high<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> our

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
demonstrate here with a high of our

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 
demonstrate here with a high of our
position<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.400> stay

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
position is that you have to stay

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
position is that you have to stay
upright<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> choice<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
upright it's not a choice you have to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 
upright it's not a choice you have to
because<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.360> hips<00:01:12.540> shoot

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930

from the side so you can see what I'm

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.350 
from the side so you can see what I'm
talking<00:01:52.320> about<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.399> Jack<00:01:53.610> maintain<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
talking about so Jack maintain and

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
talking about so Jack maintain and
upright<00:01:55.110> back<00:01:55.380> angle<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> bar

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
upright back angle so that the bar

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.870 
upright back angle so that the bar
position<00:01:57.060> doesn't<00:01:57.299> roll<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> see

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
position doesn't roll in you so you see

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.190 
position doesn't roll in you so you see
this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.240> basically<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> position<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
this is basically the position that you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.450 
this is basically the position that you
have<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.590> maintain<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> high<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.130> our<00:02:02.250> squat

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
have to maintain the high of our squat

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.819 
have to maintain the high of our squat
now<00:02:02.909> come<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.570> let<00:02:04.140> your<00:02:04.259> hips<00:02:04.380> shoot<00:02:04.619> back

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
now come up and let your hips shoot back

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.850 
now come up and let your hips shoot back
so<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.219> rolls<00:02:05.840> boom<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.680> this

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
so that it rolls boom and if this

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
so that it rolls boom and if this
position<00:02:08.340> gets<00:02:08.520> too<00:02:08.640> far<00:02:08.819> ahead<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
position gets too far ahead of you you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.740 
position gets too far ahead of you you
can't<00:02:09.899> finish<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.560> high<00:02:11.009> bar<00:02:11.190> squat<00:02:11.460> now<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.720> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
can't finish a high bar squat now with a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.160 
can't finish a high bar squat now with a
low<00:02:13.020> bar<00:02:13.230> rack<00:02:13.620> position<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:15.330> can<00:02:15.480> basically

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
low bar rack position you can basically

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.280 
low bar rack position you can basically
get<00:02:16.530> as<00:02:16.680> leaned<00:02:17.070> over<00:02:17.460> as<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.030> want<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.570> still

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
get as leaned over as you want and still

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.780 
get as leaned over as you want and still
finish<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.650> lip<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.400> going<00:02:20.460> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
finish the lip because it's not going to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.900 
finish the lip because it's not going to
roll<00:02:21.030> onto<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.720> neck<00:02:22.610> this<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:23.850> to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
roll onto your neck this is going to

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.940 
roll onto your neck this is going to
allow<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.330> use<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.840> hips<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.350> your<00:02:25.650> squat

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
allow you to use more hips in your squat

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.800 
allow you to use more hips in your squat
so<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:26.610> less<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.420> fact<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so it's less to do with the fact that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.380 
so it's less to do with the fact that
you<00:02:28.350> can't<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:29.550> you're<00:02:29.670> shortening<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
you can't that you're shortening the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.580 
you can't that you're shortening the
moment<00:02:30.690> arm<00:02:30.810> between<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.110> hips<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.440> bar

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
moment arm between the hips on the bar

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.110 
moment arm between the hips on the bar
and<00:02:31.740> more<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.430> with<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.610> fact<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.880> low

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and more to do with the fact that low

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.090 
and more to do with the fact that low
bar<00:02:33.300> actually<00:02:33.690> lets<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> use<00:02:34.170> more<00:02:34.470> hips<00:02:34.680> so

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
bar actually lets you use more hips so

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.890 
bar actually lets you use more hips so
shot<00:02:35.310> go<00:02:35.459> ahead<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.850> by<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.270> know<00:02:36.480> pretty

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
shot go ahead and get by you know pretty

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420 
shot go ahead and get by you know pretty
leaned<00:02:37.170> over<00:02:37.320> here<00:02:37.530> in<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.650> low<00:02:37.770> bar<00:02:37.950> position

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
leaned over here in the low bar position

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.480 
leaned over here in the low bar position
as<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.740> see<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> bar<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.220> not<00:02:41.310> going<00:02:41.430> to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
as you can see the bar is not going to

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.130 
as you can see the bar is not going to
go<00:02:41.550> anywhere<00:02:41.850> there<00:02:42.150> he<00:02:42.630> can<00:02:42.750> finish<00:02:42.989> this

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
go anywhere there he can finish this

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.390 
go anywhere there he can finish this
position<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:44.520> fine<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.860> that's<00:02:46.860> really<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
position just fine and that's really to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.650 
position just fine and that's really to
me<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.760> biggest<00:02:47.910> difference<00:02:48.150> between<00:02:48.570> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
me the biggest difference between the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.960 
me the biggest difference between the
high<00:02:48.810> bar<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.290> low<00:02:49.410> bar<00:02:49.590> squat<00:02:49.830> okay<00:02:50.790> guys

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
high bar and the low bar squat okay guys

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.180 
high bar and the low bar squat okay guys
the<00:02:51.510> other<00:02:51.690> thing<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> higher<00:02:52.440> spot<00:02:52.920> is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the other thing with a higher spot is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.150 
the other thing with a higher spot is
because<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.420> necessities<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.770> really

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
because it necessities this really

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.280 
because it necessities this really
upright<00:02:56.640> posture<00:02:56.940> there's<00:02:57.600> really<00:02:57.780> only<00:02:57.900> one

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
upright posture there's really only one

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.380 
upright posture there's really only one
way<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.950> make<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> happen<00:02:59.489> and<00:03:00.060> that's<00:03:00.209> with

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
way to make that happen and that's with

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.540 
way to make that happen and that's with
forward<00:03:00.959> knee<00:03:01.170> travel<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.770> just<00:03:02.160> made<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> video

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
forward knee travel I just made a video

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.680 
forward knee travel I just made a video

this<00:03:50.770> pattern<00:03:51.099> is<00:03:51.310> even<00:03:51.730> more<00:03:51.970> pronounced

this pattern is even more pronounced

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.330 
this pattern is even more pronounced
right<00:03:52.810> because<00:03:53.260> your<00:03:53.380> knees<00:03:53.530> have<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.800> go<00:03:53.860> even

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
right because your knees have to go even

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.610 
right because your knees have to go even
farther<00:03:54.670> forward<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.690> work<00:03:56.230> for<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.560> to

the<00:04:20.530> main<00:04:20.769> one<00:04:21.010> actually<00:04:21.489> has<00:04:21.519> to<00:04:21.760> do<00:04:21.850> with

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
the main one actually has to do with

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.300 
the main one actually has to do with
power<00:04:22.240> lifting<00:04:22.600> gear<00:04:22.810> because<00:04:23.320> again<00:04:24.070> if<00:04:24.220> you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
power lifting gear because again if you

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.280 
power lifting gear because again if you
think<00:04:24.520> about<00:04:24.639> when<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:25.570> have<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.930> bar<00:04:26.110> at<00:04:26.229> a

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
think about when you have the bar at a

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.810 
think about when you have the bar at a
higher<00:04:26.440> position<00:04:26.650> it's<00:04:27.130> making<00:04:27.310> your<00:04:27.580> torso

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
higher position it's making your torso

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.000 
higher position it's making your torso
longer<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:28.870> if<00:04:28.960> you're<00:04:29.050> squatting<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.889> the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
longer so if you're squatting to the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.400 
longer so if you're squatting to the
same<00:04:30.250> depth<00:04:30.700> as<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:31.660> would<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:32.020> low<00:04:32.200> bar

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410
