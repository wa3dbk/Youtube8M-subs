took me out in that first shot if I if I
waited<00:03:26.660> attain<00:03:26.959> do<00:03:27.079> it<00:03:27.170> longer<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:27.470> detonated

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
waited attain do it longer and detonated

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.250 
waited attain do it longer and detonated
it<00:03:28.280> would<00:03:28.579> have<00:03:28.670> some<00:03:29.000> kill<00:03:29.269> and<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:30.139> would

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
it would have some kill and that would

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.349 
it would have some kill and that would
be<00:03:30.380> awesome<00:03:30.650> to<00:03:30.980> finish<00:03:31.609> this<00:03:31.700> mission<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.060> 12
