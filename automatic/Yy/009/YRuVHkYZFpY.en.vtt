00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.700
 Y 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.110
 Y 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.910
 Antonio picked up the challenge of writing this 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.520
 book with great enthusiasm remember it with 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.570
 Much desire with huelva of my passions 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.250
 and interpreted the order perfectly 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.769
 that we did the audit therefore 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.500
 I have to thank Antonio for having 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.199
 elaborated the book with naturalness and with 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.019
 a stylistic skill like good 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.840
 madridista my illusion was always the being 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.950
 real Madrid partner 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.950
 and it was from my moments of leisure the reason 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.080
 most important of my existence I 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.110
 the fact of coming to football and of 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.810
 approach the south end was what most 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 I estimated but with a lot then I had to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.400
 my family and the real madrid 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.170
 thank the gonzález delivery invitation 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.150
 for being here at the first time 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.320
 collaborated in the presentation of a book 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.470
 and ask for it 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.520
 never make another book with the 100 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.520
 reasons to be from the barça 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.420
 chosen without motives 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.760
 and I'm thinking about the middle of the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.680
 madrid is designed for later 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.180
 for fans for the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.500
 fans for fans supporters and 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.840
 a little bit for the people who connect with 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 realmadrid that feel their values ​​and that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.220
 he also feels that kind of harassment that 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.220
 we are often involved 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.080
 of those who are not from Madrid who do not 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.030
 they always respect us and it seems that it is the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.560
 madridista today is one thing is something 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.270
 politically incorrect and sometimes 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.610
 we notice animosity even in machine 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.380
 I would say sometimes not justified not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.170
 because Madrid can finally 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.760
 enjoy all even if not to say 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.140
 something that direct can enjoy 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.050
 of Madrid because it has the values 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.660
 those of players and is doing things 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.980
 great in the field everything is had with 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.770
 we the items so dyed 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.560
 ironic humor is a very personal irony 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.290
 also that I commented before with 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.790
 jordi there are people who understand and people from 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.590
 chivalry that does not understand I speak of 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.990
 things like some particular hospitalization 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.510
 of what mou's finger meant in him 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.790
 the doctor of tito vilanova story because 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.230
 is Real Madrid is very important for 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.600
 knowing is a trump card is an ace in the sleeve 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.040
 to flirt in Barcelona also what 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.880
 against the book so I also think 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.190
 who tried to ask unesco to be equal 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.590
 that there are wonders of the seven wonder 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.870
 wonders are sure of them then that 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.040
 in May and a heritage has been declared 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.370
 immaterial of humanity because I 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.590
 I think that the borders of madrid surpass 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.520
 us year europe but I think that 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.320
 billions of children throughout the 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.760
 world smile when with madrid to 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.010
 it means a lot besides children 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.840
 in our area, I do not think it will prove 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.340
 that transmits and what it supposes goes a lot 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.020
 beyond the question is not said 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.640
 reasons to be from Madrid because there 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.990
 millions as Gerardo says the 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.880
 question is there is some reason for not 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.570
 hug her makes Real Madrid and the answer 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.570
 it is a resounding no 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.950
 i 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.780
 Y 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.640
 for parents 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.330
 they have a little 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.090
 what I really liked in the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:10.810
 retranscates that he uses antonio to 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.810
 write I think he's losing 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.250
 madrid the child of Madrid speak of 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.669
 it 's one thing that we have a bit 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.669
 forgotten 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.910
 this issue and this opportunity 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.910
 I thought good 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.330
 I here put 100 reasons that are the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.330
 that I consider
