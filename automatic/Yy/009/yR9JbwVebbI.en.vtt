00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
paint and again as you're working and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.370 
paint and again as you're working and
you<00:04:05.120> look<00:04:05.360> at<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.570> paint<00:04:05.870> you're<00:04:06.020> going<00:04:06.260> to

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
you look at the paint you're going to

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.810 
you look at the paint you're going to
see<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.650> lot<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:06.950> things<00:04:07.280> come<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.790> surface

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
see a lot of things come to the surface

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.020 
see a lot of things come to the surface
that<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.930> haven't<00:04:09.290> seen<00:04:09.500> before<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:10.970> think

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
that you haven't seen before and I think

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.870 
that you haven't seen before and I think
the<00:04:11.540> best<00:04:11.750> way<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.020> show<00:04:12.380> this<00:04:12.620> now<00:04:12.860> would<00:04:13.820> be

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
the best way to show this now would be

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.810 
the best way to show this now would be
to<00:04:14.000> probably<00:04:14.480> take<00:04:14.750> our<00:04:14.960> tape<00:04:15.230> off<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:16.640> can

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
to probably take our tape off you can

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.420 
to probably take our tape off you can
see<00:04:17.060> where<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:17.570> hairline<00:04:18.380> scratches<00:04:18.830> come<00:04:19.310> to

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
see where the hairline scratches come to

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.570 
see where the hairline scratches come to
an<00:04:19.549> abrupt<00:04:19.640> stop<00:04:21.070> we've<00:04:22.070> removed<00:04:22.370> a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
an abrupt stop we've removed a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.430 
an abrupt stop we've removed a
tremendous<00:04:23.210> number<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.570> hairline<00:04:24.020> scratches

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
tremendous number of hairline scratches

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.960 
tremendous number of hairline scratches
and<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.830> can<00:04:25.010> all<00:04:25.100> come<00:04:25.310> take<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> look<00:04:25.610> at<00:04:25.820> this

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
and you can all come take a look at this
