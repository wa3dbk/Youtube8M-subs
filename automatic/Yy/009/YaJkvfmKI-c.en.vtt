the<00:00:54.870> DC<00:00:55.199> booth<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.649> believe<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.460> there<00:00:56.579> was

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
in the costume as Batman

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.590 
in the costume as Batman
so<00:01:01.620> DC<00:01:01.949> proud<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.940> had<00:01:03.090> been<00:01:03.300> spotted

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so DC proud that had been spotted

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.880 
so DC proud that had been spotted
apparently<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.439> they<00:01:04.559> were<00:01:04.619> waiting

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
apparently that's what they were waiting

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460

pulling his lips and that's because with

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.530

looked at a lot of pictures of Ben
Affleck<00:02:26.640> slips<00:02:26.910> hairs<00:02:27.239> one<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.690> them<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.379> can

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410

see<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.830> real<00:02:29.010> life<00:02:29.190> they<00:02:29.610> go<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> little

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
see in real life they go out a little

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.509 
see in real life they go out a little
bit<00:02:30.510> now<00:02:30.989> by<00:02:31.170> pulling<00:02:31.620> them<00:02:31.799> in<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.250> it

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
bit now by pulling them in I think it

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.100 
bit now by pulling them in I think it
not<00:02:32.610> only<00:02:32.790> creates<00:02:33.150> this<00:02:33.269> feeling<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.720> anger

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
not only creates this feeling of anger

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.380 
not only creates this feeling of anger
and<00:02:34.769> also<00:02:35.099> anticipation<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.970> maybe<00:02:36.209> he's

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
and also anticipation like maybe he's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.880 
and also anticipation like maybe he's
gonna<00:02:36.540> say<00:02:36.780> something<00:02:37.260> at<00:02:37.349> any<00:02:37.440> minute

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
gonna say something at any minute

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.830 
gonna say something at any minute
he's<00:02:38.129> definitely<00:02:38.760> thinking<00:02:38.790> what's<00:02:39.330> going<00:02:39.660> on

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
he's definitely thinking what's going on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.339 
he's definitely thinking what's going on
but<00:02:40.829> also<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.280> an<00:02:41.400> older<00:02:41.910> look<00:02:42.180> when<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:43.200> get

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
but also it's an older look when you get

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.470 
but also it's an older look when you get
older<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.890> little<00:02:44.519> known<00:02:44.640> fact<00:02:44.670> sometimes

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
older a little known fact sometimes

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
older a little known fact sometimes
people<00:02:45.690> tend<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.349> lose<00:02:46.530> their<00:02:46.709> lips<00:02:46.950> they<00:02:47.280> they

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
people tend to lose their lips they they

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.759 
people tend to lose their lips they they
puff<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.299> little<00:02:48.540> bit<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.349> think<00:02:49.620> that's

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
puff a little bit and I think that's

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.250 
puff a little bit and I think that's
what<00:02:50.069> Ben<00:02:50.880> Affleck<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.329> playing<00:02:51.599> off<00:02:51.810> here<00:02:52.110> to

of course his chin is super distinctive

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.550 
of course his chin is super distinctive
and<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.299> lot<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.450> people<00:02:57.810> are<00:02:57.900> already<00:02:57.989> some

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
Miller's Batman and of course as we all

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.440 
Miller's Batman and of course as we all
know<00:03:28.769> Zack<00:03:29.190> Snyder<00:03:29.459> Adi<00:03:29.639> has<00:03:29.790> relationship

know Zack Snyder Adi has relationship
with<00:03:30.569> Frank<00:03:31.230> Miller<00:03:31.470> off<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.889> 300<00:03:32.400> movies

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
with Frank Miller off of the 300 movies

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
with Frank Miller off of the 300 movies
and<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.709> would<00:03:34.980> not<00:03:35.130> be<00:03:35.280> surprised<00:03:35.639> at<00:03:35.819> all

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
and so I would not be surprised at all

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.059 
and so I would not be surprised at all
as<00:03:36.299> we've<00:03:36.480> discussed<00:03:36.780> before<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:37.380> that's<00:03:37.829> the

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
as we've discussed before if that's the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.370 
as we've discussed before if that's the
model<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.489> he's<00:03:38.669> going<00:03:39.060> after<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:40.079> I<00:03:40.139> think

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
model that he's going after and I think

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.809

little<00:04:40.030> evil<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.930> think<00:04:41.170> that's<00:04:41.350> its<00:04:41.680> truth

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
little evil and I think that's its truth

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.200 
little evil and I think that's its truth
and<00:04:42.160> it's<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.340> direction<00:04:42.640> we<00:04:42.700> haven't<00:04:43.000> seen<00:04:43.120> the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
and it's a direction we haven't seen the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.150 
and it's a direction we haven't seen the
Caped<00:04:43.420> Crusader<00:04:43.810> going<00:04:44.290> much<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:44.980> chagrin

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
Caped Crusader going much to the chagrin

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.740 
Caped Crusader going much to the chagrin
of<00:04:45.400> all<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.850> actors<00:04:46.180> who<00:04:46.300> played<00:04:46.540> him<00:04:46.630> in<00:04:46.690> the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
of all the actors who played him in the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.360 
of all the actors who played him in the
past<00:04:47.020> because<00:04:47.350> they're<00:04:47.560> like<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:48.100> always

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
past because they're like you always

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.890 
past because they're like you always
focus<00:04:48.520> on<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.000> villains<00:04:49.330> what<00:04:49.510> about<00:04:49.690> some

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
focus on the villains what about some

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.870 
focus on the villains what about some
character<00:04:50.230> development<00:04:50.590> for<00:04:50.890> Batman<00:04:51.310> there's

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
character development for Batman there's

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.400 
character development for Batman there's
a<00:04:51.940> little<00:04:52.210> bit<00:04:52.330> for<00:04:52.510> Christian<00:04:52.840> Bale<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.200> even

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
a little bit for Christian Bale but even

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.720 
a little bit for Christian Bale but even
then<00:04:53.530> I<00:04:53.560> think<00:04:53.650> villains<00:04:54.070> ended<00:04:54.310> up<00:04:54.400> taking

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
then I think villains ended up taking

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.210 
then I think villains ended up taking
over<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:55.030> trilogy<00:04:55.480> so<00:04:56.110> we'll<00:04:56.620> see<00:04:56.860> because

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
over the trilogy so we'll see because

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.190 
over the trilogy so we'll see because
this<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:57.640> a<00:04:57.670> situation<00:04:58.270> where<00:04:58.420> it's<00:04:58.600> Batman

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
this is a situation where it's Batman

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.260 
this is a situation where it's Batman
fighting<00:04:59.500> another<00:04:59.770> hero<00:05:00.130> does<00:05:00.730> he<00:05:00.940> become<00:05:01.120> a

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
fighting another hero does he become a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.700 
fighting another hero does he become a
little<00:05:01.570> bit<00:05:01.690> of<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.870> villain<00:05:02.200> at<00:05:02.290> least<00:05:02.500> at

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
little bit of the villain at least at

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.860 
little bit of the villain at least at
first<00:05:03.010> that<00:05:03.280> could<00:05:03.400> be<00:05:03.520> a<00:05:03.550> great<00:05:03.880> side<00:05:04.450> effect

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
first that could be a great side effect

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.500 
first that could be a great side effect
of<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.410> Batman<00:05:05.800> V<00:05:05.980> Superman<00:05:06.460> movie<00:05:06.760> so<00:05:07.300> write
