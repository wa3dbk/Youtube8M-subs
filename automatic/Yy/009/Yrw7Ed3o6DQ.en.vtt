 for a week in a cellar in Germany 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.430

 we still have an abo action the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.350
 we all do not participate in the walk 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.820
 just because we think it's better there 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.510
 of getting done is just maybe 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.760
 the game of the year 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.290
 I say maybe because it 's his together 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.699
 I also look forward to the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.409
 game I have spent the past two years the 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.729
 game closely followed and you 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.470
 gels I see and read more about the game 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.939
 I only get excited about it 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.530
 the first time with any open 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.950
 world is calling 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.210
 3 playability is gigantic especially the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.439
 stories from different journalists 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.150
 who have played the game and just 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.500
 have experienced totally different things 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.480
 totally different things 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.250
 have experienced it speaks 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.030
 I am very excited about it, of course 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.500
 game that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.930
 imagine if it is very important to me 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.820
 it is the latest game from ideo kuji 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.020
 but for konami at all 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.030
 probably the last one with the beer 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.350
 what you have ever worked on and just 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.440
 the fact that you are just completely your own 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.030
 mother base can make things can swipe 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.620
 from other players doing that is actually 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.150
 also just a game in itself 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.680
 And you also have brand you'll be online 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.110
 what is being revived, well 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.550
 my head just explodes, this is impossible 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.120
 more error with a healthy fact look one 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.159
 gigantic to September 1, 2015 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.390
 is the very close I do not know 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.610
 exactly when this comes online 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.780
 a matter of something more or less 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.520
 than a week when you see it in the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.260
 managers 105 and 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.670
 anyway fucking looking forward to i have three 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.890
 hours of sam read I want you 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.090
 had to read good morning and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.830
 and to read your review I had 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.209
 once something like if sam already this way 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.159
 good winters aspires to all that 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.569
 games were completely gray and I was 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.980
 in my vita people with and without it 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.450
 opinion then it is samwell 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.310
 from my pip is also convinced 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.739
 facking epic 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.090
 I don't have all managers to do it myself 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.650
 just played a lot of respect for it 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.970
 keep your series long of which the t series 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.980
 trying to do something completely different 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.390
 but all games ever 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.430
 the first place of controls but I the 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.739
 cat see the story with setting the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.000
 game is so satirical so fucking 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.830
 insane it only can anyone can 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.269
 and it seems that this is real 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.620
 most bungee work just goes 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.340
 he goes cerium after goodbye 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.780
 say 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.519
 and this is his farewell letter to one of 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.470
 the most legendary game series of all 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.430
 times 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.709
 eduard makes me a little worried about it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.840
 and i found just in marion's 104 i found 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.280
 those very long cut scenes great game play 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.900
 you take it for granted I am not 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.760
 such a great couple from I did really 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.790
 setting spray dungeons for the poles 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.379
 cinematography topper that shit and I am 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.760
 seriously the forerunner with a kind 5 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.440
 proposes a huge amount of gameplay 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.879
 where people are happy with all its good 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.500
 game play but they didn't seem like my diet 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.840
 he didn't care for that shit set so me 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.489
 hope there is more to it at least 5 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.829
 as much story as the gameplay and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.660
 sit because that is now giving way with me one 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.519
 kind for five hefty go play but 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.410
 nonetheless, no matter how it is approved 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.849
 no matter how it works out, I have to end it 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.230
 I want to know how that series ends 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.859
 and I really can't wait until once per 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.959
 is your legend and so is the box 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.430
 learn from the initials 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.830
 is where you have the lever this mission 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.800
 yourself 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.550
 how and where 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.550
 palace on here 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.030
 and my ig is a detective and everything 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.030
 cookie 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 I make efforts 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.010
 3 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.840
 scarface but I did not have enough me 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.989
 how step got a lot of go down in history 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.989
 which and latin 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.419
 metal gear solid 5 actually i have the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.490
 series a bit given to part 2 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.199
 part 2 I didn't understand what was going on 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.169
 what was going on with the third series 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:39.130
 what happened to robots or something 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.800
 something with story or so I understood one 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.940
 no iota all morning i found one 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.070
 bit of a shame that it is completely on 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.790
 played an oil drilling platform and before 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.790
 the rest not so much 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.330
 so actually when i got three i have 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.400
 another chance given a small chance and 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.950
 I also stopped swimming free and am 4 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.260
 I was really cut it super fast 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.780
 actually you can say that i have one 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.479
 and be certain in the field of brand is 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.430
 will this but i have the idea it 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.710
 fifth part becomes totally different 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.110
 really an open world game 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.610
 there are quite a few of them 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.850
 I also have about fifteen hundred 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.500
 so play and a little thing is with me 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.800
 once he also starts dieting again 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.960
 then I also want to plow it all the way through 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.210
 and I want to collect all collectibles 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.979
 and all site girls and parents do 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:31.150
 oh no because that's my know more about 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.800
 complex co-compression of a 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.660
 obsessive compulsive 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.690
 compost just who do you have we have 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.490
 all to be his are we are 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.169
 and that goes with the open world 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.419
 very much so on one side of them 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.490
 dream under i know of samuel and here 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.110
 but what it played mini must be super 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.229
 enthusiastic that it is fantastic 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.720
 game being on the other hand it goes 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.400
 100 years of my life costs 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.280
 I just want to call him placement again 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.050
 like the white 3 then it goes 3000 years 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.700
 of my life costs I win ready there 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.099
 in front of 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.370
 mentally yes but not physically yet 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.320
 the time that is missing but it is somewhat fat 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.450
 that is with him that is beyond dispute 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.190
 this may be an expected item 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.389
 but actually it is completely 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.400
 no expectation because I just too 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:18.010
 Duurswold the fifth phantom pain already 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.740
 long and broadly played out in responsible 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.020
 at kona myself and I already know how as and 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.360
 who is or maybe who does not fit 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.460
 that should not say go tomorrow 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.530

 and if you maybe to my whole 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.130
 attitude and energy you have 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.610
 maybe an idea of ​​what you can do 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.760
 expect 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.010
 but you cannot miss this 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.719

 number so release the phantom pain 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:50.050
 maybe the last big triple 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:53.159
 game from konami who knows where the goal we are 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.159
