what<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.600> looking<00:00:39.900> for<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.670> good<00:00:41.670> spot<00:00:42.360> for

what I'm looking for is a good spot for

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.190 
what I'm looking for is a good spot for
to<00:00:43.200> put<00:00:43.380> something<00:00:47.270> that<00:00:48.270> would<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.480> used<00:00:48.840> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
to put something that would be used to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.070 
to put something that would be used to
kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.220> base<00:00:50.490> lighting<00:00:51.060> for<00:00:51.480> whatever

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
kind of the base lighting for whatever

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.290 
kind of the base lighting for whatever
object<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.860> composited<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> scene<00:00:55.280> then

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
object is composited into the scene then

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
object is composited into the scene then
probably<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.700> HDR<00:00:59.700> eyes<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
probably have to do the HDR eyes the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.880 
probably have to do the HDR eyes the
light<00:01:02.130> samples<00:01:02.640> because<00:01:03.480> those<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:04.020> going<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
light samples because those are going to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
light samples because those are going to
be<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.130> one<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.489> enabled<00:01:06.330> me<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
be the one that enabled me to get the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140 
be the one that enabled me to get the
shot<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.230> want<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.710> need<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> measure<00:01:08.790> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
shot that I want I need to measure and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
shot that I want I need to measure and
take<00:01:09.480> take<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.230> measurement<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.100> some

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
take take a measurement of some some

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760 
take take a measurement of some some
real-world<00:01:11.700> measurement<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.110> space<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
real-world measurement of the space so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.160 
real-world measurement of the space so
later<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:15.210> scale<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.660> in<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> computer

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
later I can scale it in the computer

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.670 
later I can scale it in the computer
actually<00:01:16.710> depth<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> field<00:01:20.990> hey<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.229> used<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
actually depth of field hey I used a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.859 
actually depth of field hey I used a
pyramid<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.640> example<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.210> time<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.720> takes

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
pyramid as an example the time it takes

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.990 
pyramid as an example the time it takes
to<00:01:25.050> create<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.440> are<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.130> very<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to create these are the very top is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
to create these are the very top is
taking<00:01:27.479> those<00:01:27.600> photos<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.440> there<00:01:28.650> are

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
taking those photos and then there are

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.580 
taking those photos and then there are
steps<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.250> building<00:01:29.729> hdri<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.869> high<00:01:31.290> dynamic

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
steps like building hdri a high dynamic

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.760 
steps like building hdri a high dynamic
range<00:01:31.979> image<00:01:32.759> or<00:01:33.150> creating<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> rough<00:01:34.259> 3d

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
