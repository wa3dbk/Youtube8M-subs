program that produces and also the
editor<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.730> very<00:00:32.759> strong<00:00:33.120> our

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
editor that I think is very strong our

interviews producer will already be

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.340 
interviews producer will already be
thinking<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.510> people<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.170> want

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
thinking about the people that we want

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
thinking about the people that we want
to<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.770> on<00:00:38.010> air<00:00:39.739> he<00:00:40.739> can't<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> day

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to get on air he can't do as the day

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
to get on air he can't do as the day
goes<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.870> often<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.469> rethink<00:00:44.219> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
goes on we often have to rethink that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.610 
goes on we often have to rethink that
but<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.329> idea<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.610> best<00:00:47.850> possible

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
but the idea is to get the best possible

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.700 
but the idea is to get the best possible

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
of breaking stories we're going to move

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
of breaking stories we're going to move
headlines<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.239> important<00:00:57.809> part<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
headlines are a really important part of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.840 
headlines are a really important part of
the<00:00:58.289> program<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.710> think<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.370> our<00:00:59.520> shop

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the program I think of them as our shop

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.560 
the program I think of them as our shop
window<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.750> find<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:02.180> we<00:01:03.180> really

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
window if we find out what we really

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719

want to get whoever's watching to stay
with<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:07.560> try<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.580> pictures

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
try and get that out of the way as early

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.630 
try and get that out of the way as early
as<00:01:34.110> possible<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:34.800> after<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.340> it's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
as possible but then after that it's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.840 
as possible but then after that it's
really<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.690> case<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.650> getting<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.370> head<00:01:38.610> down

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
really a case of getting my head down

going<00:01:39.660> through<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.230> script<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
going through all the script and it's a

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.850 
going through all the script and it's a
good<00:01:42.120> idea<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> actually<00:01:42.870> read<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.350> aloud<00:01:43.440> so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
good idea to actually read them aloud so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.230 
good idea to actually read them aloud so
you<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> sense<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.730> of<00:01:45.030> how<00:01:45.119> they

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you have a sense not just of how they

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.359 
you have a sense not just of how they
look<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.540> paper<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.140> also<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:47.010> they<00:01:47.220> actually

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
look on paper but also how they actually

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.570 
look on paper but also how they actually
will<00:01:47.760> sound<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.450> come<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.990> read<00:01:49.320> them

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
will sound when you come to read them

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.520

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
energy it can also be pretty tense I do

listeners well there are so many stories
that<00:02:12.000> bring<00:02:12.600> us<00:02:12.750> closer<00:02:13.350> together

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
that bring us closer together

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.110
