all<00:00:02.580> we<00:00:02.790> really<00:00:03.030> need<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.270> know<00:00:03.300> before

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:03.420 
all we really need to know before

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.599 
all we really need to know before
starting<00:00:04.200> is<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.649> there<00:00:04.800> are<00:00:04.950> two<00:00:05.130> types<00:00:05.430> of

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
starting is that there are two types of

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:06.980 
starting is that there are two types of
flash<00:00:05.850> file<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.420> were<00:00:06.479> likely<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.840> come

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
flash file that were likely to come

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.839 
flash file that were likely to come
across<00:00:07.170> when<00:00:07.439> we're<00:00:07.590> building<00:00:07.680> websites<00:00:08.280> and

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
across when we're building websites and

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.970 
across when we're building websites and
these<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.510> both<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.900> my<00:00:10.020> upsets<00:00:10.410> father<00:00:10.650> here

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
these are both in my upsets father here

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.200 
these are both in my upsets father here
we<00:00:11.640> have<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.060> dot<00:00:12.450> SWF<00:00:13.140> file<00:00:13.470> and<00:00:13.800> the<00:00:14.460> dot<00:00:14.790> FLV

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
we have the dot SWF file and the dot FLV

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.290 
we have the dot SWF file and the dot FLV
file<00:00:15.720> now<00:00:16.650> these<00:00:16.859> FLV<00:00:17.760> files<00:00:18.150> are

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
file now these FLV files are

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.779 
file now these FLV files are
specifically<00:00:18.869> flash<00:00:19.260> video<00:00:19.740> files<00:00:20.100> what<00:00:20.700> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
video sites and then pretty much all

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
video sites and then pretty much all
other<00:00:25.830> flash<00:00:26.130> files<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.850> be<00:00:26.910> dot

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
other flash files are going to be dot

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.590 
other flash files are going to be dot
SWF<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.310> dot<00:00:29.580> SWF<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.420> want

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
SWF and it's this dot SWF that we want

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.529 
SWF and it's this dot SWF that we want
to<00:00:30.660> add<00:00:30.960> into<00:00:31.830> our<00:00:31.859> super<00:00:32.340> Jam<00:00:32.520> index<00:00:32.940> page<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.529 --> 00:00:33.539 
to add into our super Jam index page and

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.439 
to add into our super Jam index page and
I've<00:00:33.780> left<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.140> space<00:00:34.499> here<00:00:34.969> in<00:00:35.969> order<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> do

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
I've left this space here in order to do

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.450 
I've left this space here in order to do
that<00:00:36.629> so<00:00:37.260> let's<00:00:37.499> make<00:00:37.649> sure<00:00:37.679> that<00:00:37.890> our<00:00:37.949> cursors

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
that so let's make sure that our cursors

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.189 
that so let's make sure that our cursors
clicked<00:00:38.789> and<00:00:38.969> we've<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.659> our<00:00:39.780> cursor

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
clicked and we've got our cursor

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.059 
clicked and we've got our cursor
flashing<00:00:40.440> inside<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:42.120> table<00:00:42.389> cell<00:00:42.949> and<00:00:43.949> then

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:44.069 
flashing inside this table cell and then

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:46.040 
flashing inside this table cell and then
what<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.309> want<00:00:44.429> to<00:00:44.519> do<00:00:44.609> is<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.120> come<00:00:45.359> up<00:00:45.389> to<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
what we want to do is to come up to the

common tab on the insert bar and just

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.119 
common tab on the insert bar and just
pull<00:00:48.659> down<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.929> flush<00:00:49.139> menu<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.039> the

logo which is the dot SWF I want to be

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.050 
logo which is the dot SWF I want to be
adding<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.389> so<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> say<00:01:04.379> okay<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
adding in so we say okay here we at this

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.000 
adding in so we say okay here we at this
dialog<00:01:06.480> box<00:01:06.720> pop-up<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.800> pretty

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
dialog box pop-up and this is pretty

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.150 
dialog box pop-up and this is pretty
much<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.190> same<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> alt<00:01:09.210> text<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.050> images

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
much the same as the alt text for images

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.260 
much the same as the alt text for images
what<00:01:11.160> we're<00:01:11.310> doing<00:01:11.550> is<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:11.880> adding

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
what we're doing is we're adding

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
what we're doing is we're adding
accessibility<00:01:13.110> for<00:01:13.890> visually<00:01:14.400> impaired

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
accessibility for visually impaired

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
accessibility for visually impaired
users<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.480> all<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.050> two

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
users so they all know what this two

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.310 
users so they all know what this two
animations<00:01:16.560> doing<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.370> so<00:01:18.240> essentially<00:01:18.720> Paul

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
animations doing and so essentially Paul

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.490 
animations doing and so essentially Paul
will<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:20.070> logo<00:01:20.730> animation<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
will say is logo animation and that

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.110 
will say is logo animation and that
should<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.770> fairly<00:01:22.950> self-explanatory

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
should be fairly self-explanatory

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.290 
should be fairly self-explanatory
let<00:01:25.110> me<00:01:25.170> say<00:01:25.320> ok<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.010> we<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.180> that

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
let me say ok and we can see that

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.150 
let me say ok and we can see that
Dreamweavers<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:27.870> automatically<00:01:28.650> inserted

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
Dreamweavers now automatically inserted

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.750 
Dreamweavers now automatically inserted
that<00:01:29.520> into<00:01:30.150> my<00:01:30.300> page<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:32.310> find<00:01:32.550> when

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
that into my page now if you find when

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.460 
that into my page now if you find when
Dreamweaver<00:01:33.240> inserts<00:01:33.570> an<00:01:33.690> object<00:01:34.050> but<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
Dreamweaver inserts an object but it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.870 
Dreamweaver inserts an object but it
breaks<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.890> your<00:01:35.010> tables<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.550> bit<00:01:35.760> like

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
breaks up your tables a little bit like

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.030 
breaks up your tables a little bit like
this<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> its<00:01:37.140> uncollapse<00:01:37.800> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
this all it is is its uncollapse the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.740 
this all it is is its uncollapse the
table<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.580> we'll<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.820> click<00:01:38.940> into<00:01:39.510> one<00:01:39.660> of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
table so we'll just click into one of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.900 
table so we'll just click into one of
the<00:01:39.810> other<00:01:39.840> table<00:01:40.290> cells<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.800> then<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.790> can

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
the other table cells and then if we can

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.520 
the other table cells and then if we can
find<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.300> little<00:01:42.420> line<00:01:42.690> between<00:01:43.110> them<00:01:43.230> just

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
find the little line between them just

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.780 
find the little line between them just
click<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.190> you'll<00:01:44.550> see<00:01:44.580> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
click on that and you'll see that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.820 
click on that and you'll see that
Dreamweaver<00:01:45.030> tree<00:01:45.540> collapses<00:01:46.080> all<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
cells

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.460

so<00:01:48.820> let's<00:01:49.090> click<00:01:49.300> on<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:49.600> flash<00:01:49.870> object<00:01:50.320> now

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
so let's click on this flash object now

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.850 
so let's click on this flash object now
and<00:01:51.040> look<00:01:51.250> down<00:01:51.400> at<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.640> property<00:01:51.970> inspector

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and look down at the property inspector

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860 
and look down at the property inspector
we<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:54.010> see<00:01:54.190> here<00:01:54.460> that<00:01:54.970> Dreamweavers

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
we can see here that Dreamweavers

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.900 
we can see here that Dreamweavers
already<00:01:56.260> put<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.010> width<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.880> height

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
already put the width and the height

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.900 
already put the width and the height
attributes<00:01:58.630> in<00:01:58.870> for<00:01:59.320> us<00:01:59.470> so<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.490> means<00:02:00.670> that

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
attributes in for us so that means that

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.090 
attributes in for us so that means that
during<00:02:01.030> me<00:02:01.210> was<00:02:01.330> able<00:02:01.480> to<00:02:01.630> auto<00:02:01.990> detect<00:02:02.590> the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
during me was able to auto detect the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.390 
during me was able to auto detect the
dimensions<00:02:03.670> for<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:03.940> dot<00:02:04.180> SWF<00:02:04.840> file<00:02:05.400> and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
dimensions for a dot SWF file and

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.380 
dimensions for a dot SWF file and
they've<00:02:06.520> also<00:02:06.670> got<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.970> couple<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.300> options

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
they've also got a couple of options

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.230 
they've also got a couple of options
down<00:02:07.780> here<00:02:07.810> we've<00:02:08.649> got<00:02:08.830> autoplay<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.790> loop

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
down here we've got autoplay and loop

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.120 
down here we've got autoplay and loop
and<00:02:10.479> they're<00:02:10.899> fairly<00:02:11.140> self-explanatory<00:02:11.470> if

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
and they're fairly self-explanatory if

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.580 
and they're fairly self-explanatory if
we<00:02:12.400> check<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.940> autoplay<00:02:13.540> box<00:02:13.900> but<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.440> means

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
we check the autoplay box but it means

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.250 
we check the autoplay box but it means
that<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.100> SWF<00:02:15.910> file<00:02:16.210> will<00:02:16.450> play<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:16.960> soon<00:02:17.110> as

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
that the SWF file will play as soon as

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.920 
that the SWF file will play as soon as
the<00:02:17.350> browser<00:02:17.590> opens<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.430> if<00:02:19.180> we<00:02:19.330> choose<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the browser opens and if we choose the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.950 
the browser opens and if we choose the
check<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.560> loop<00:02:20.800> box<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.640> means<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
check the loop box that means that the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.690 
check the loop box that means that the
Esther<00:02:23.410> earphone<00:02:23.770> constantly<00:02:24.400> repeats

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
Esther earphone constantly repeats

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.080 
Esther earphone constantly repeats
itself<00:02:25.000> every<00:02:25.150> time<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.570> finishes<00:02:25.690> playing

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
itself every time it finishes playing

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.570 
itself every time it finishes playing
now<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.660> possible<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.260> preview<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.950> SWF

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
now it is possible to preview this SWF

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.240 
now it is possible to preview this SWF
file<00:02:30.850> inside<00:02:31.660> Dreamweaver<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:32.950> need<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
file inside Dreamweaver but we need to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.270 
file inside Dreamweaver but we need to
use<00:02:33.460> this<00:02:33.640> play<00:02:33.940> button<00:02:34.210> down<00:02:34.480> here<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.130> what

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
use this play button down here and what

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.380 
use this play button down here and what
we<00:02:36.370> can<00:02:36.400> see<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.720> SWF<00:02:38.290> file<00:02:38.530> plays<00:02:38.800> through

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
we can see is the SWF file plays through

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.030 
we can see is the SWF file plays through
if<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.570> just<00:02:40.780> stop<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.260> you'll<00:02:41.680> see<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.920> goes

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
if I just stop that you'll see it goes

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.920 
if I just stop that you'll see it goes
back<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.520> placeholder<00:02:43.150> for<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> flash

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
back to the placeholder for the flash

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.090 
back to the placeholder for the flash
and<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:45.550> prefer<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.660> always<00:02:46.930> view<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.920> a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
and I prefer to always view this in a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.770 
and I prefer to always view this in a
browser<00:02:48.310> just<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.880> make<00:02:49.030> sure<00:02:49.060> that

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
browser just to make sure that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.510 
browser just to make sure that
everything's<00:02:50.110> lining<00:02:50.380> up<00:02:50.620> properly<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:51.190> let's

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
everything's lining up properly so let's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.100 
everything's lining up properly so let's
preview<00:02:51.760> that<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.239> Firefox

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.410 

and<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:58.100> can<00:02:58.250> see<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.730> played<00:02:59.030> straight

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
and we can see that that played straight

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.480 
and we can see that that played straight
away<00:02:59.750> because<00:03:00.080> we<00:03:00.200> have<00:03:00.350> autoplay<00:03:00.950> selected

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
away because we have autoplay selected

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.100 
away because we have autoplay selected
and<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:03.230> seems<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.650> playing<00:03:03.920> fine

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
and it seems to be playing fine

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.960 
and it seems to be playing fine
so<00:03:06.980> let's<00:03:07.160> jump<00:03:07.370> back<00:03:07.430> over<00:03:08.060> into<00:03:08.210> Dreamweaver

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
so let's jump back over into Dreamweaver

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.280 
so let's jump back over into Dreamweaver
now<00:03:10.970> if<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.150> want<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.360> insert<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.660> Flash<00:03:11.930> movie

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
now if you want to insert a Flash movie

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.920 
now if you want to insert a Flash movie
or<00:03:12.740> the<00:03:13.130> FLV<00:03:13.610> file<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.480> process<00:03:14.810> is

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
or the FLV file and the process is

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.300 
or the FLV file and the process is
slightly<00:03:15.200> different<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:15.740> it's<00:03:15.860> still<00:03:16.100> very

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
slightly different but it's still very

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.310 
slightly different but it's still very
easy<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:17.420> I'm<00:03:17.630> just<00:03:17.750> gonna<00:03:17.840> pull<00:03:18.110> up<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.290> new

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
easy so I'm just gonna pull up a new

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
blank page that I've created here

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.910 
blank page that I've created here
there's<00:03:20.240> absolutely<00:03:20.540> nothing<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.990> here<00:03:21.260> it's

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
there's absolutely nothing in here it's

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.730 
there's absolutely nothing in here it's
just<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.370> order<00:03:22.490> to<00:03:22.670> show<00:03:23.240> you<00:03:23.300> how<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.290> put

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740

to<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.950> SWF<00:03:28.580> file<00:03:28.910> so<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.510> not<00:03:29.630> gonna<00:03:29.720> fit

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
to the SWF file so it's not gonna fit

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.780 
to the SWF file so it's not gonna fit
inside<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.590> area<00:03:30.770> that<00:03:30.980> I've<00:03:31.100> left<00:03:31.340> here<00:03:31.640> so

now the thing is that I know that the
height<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:27.919> my<00:05:28.099> file<00:05:28.370> isn't<00:05:28.900> 337<00:05:29.900> but<00:05:30.710> what's

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:31.189 
height of my file isn't 337 but what's

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:32.890 
height of my file isn't 337 but what's
happened<00:05:31.520> is<00:05:31.639> Dreamweaver<00:05:32.300> has<00:05:32.330> actually

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
happened is Dreamweaver has actually

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.830 
happened is Dreamweaver has actually
added<00:05:33.499> an<00:05:33.710> additional<00:05:34.460> bit<00:05:34.699> of<00:05:34.849> space<00:05:35.180> onto

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
added an additional bit of space onto

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.989 
added an additional bit of space onto
the<00:05:36.139> bounding<00:05:36.529> box<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.949> give<00:05:37.249> us<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.460> total<00:05:37.639> size

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:37.999 
the bounding box to give us a total size

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.969 
the bounding box to give us a total size
including<00:05:38.479> this<00:05:38.870> player<00:05:39.169> skin<00:05:39.620> that<00:05:39.800> will<00:05:39.889> be

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
including this player skin that will be

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.029 
including this player skin that will be
shown<00:05:40.219> at<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.669> bottom<00:05:41.029> and<00:05:41.740> then<00:05:42.740> we<00:05:42.919> can

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
shown at the bottom and then we can

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.080 
shown at the bottom and then we can
decide<00:05:43.310> whether<00:05:43.490> we<00:05:43.639> want<00:05:43.759> this<00:05:43.909> to

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
decide whether we want this to

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.269 
decide whether we want this to
automatically<00:05:44.719> play<00:05:45.080> when<00:05:45.830> we<00:05:45.949> open<00:05:46.219> the

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:46.279 
automatically play when we open the

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.399 
automatically play when we open the
browser<00:05:46.430> window<00:05:46.909> and<00:05:47.090> more<00:05:47.990> importantly

browser window and more importantly

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.360

there's<00:05:48.620> an<00:05:48.680> option<00:05:48.889> down<00:05:49.009> here<00:05:49.069> at<00:05:49.310> the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
there's an option down here at the

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.800 
there's an option down here at the
bottom<00:05:49.490> where<00:05:49.819> we<00:05:49.909> can<00:05:50.060> prompt<00:05:50.360> users<00:05:50.659> to

bottom where we can prompt users to

download<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.439> Flash<00:05:51.650> Player<00:05:51.919> if<00:05:52.159> they

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
download the Flash Player if they

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.709 
download the Flash Player if they
haven't<00:05:52.909> got<00:05:52.999> it<00:05:53.120> installed<00:05:53.509> and<00:05:53.840> we<00:05:54.560> can<00:05:54.740> also

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
haven't got it installed and we can also

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.200 
haven't got it installed and we can also
create<00:05:56.719> our<00:05:56.749> own<00:05:57.249> personalized<00:05:58.249> message<00:05:58.669> that

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
create our own personalized message that

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.909 
create our own personalized message that
we<00:05:59.300> can<00:05:59.419> type<00:05:59.629> in<00:05:59.839> here<00:05:59.870> that<00:06:00.349> we<00:06:00.439> want<00:06:00.680> those

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
we can type in here that we want those

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.659 
we can type in here that we want those
non<00:06:01.490> Flash<00:06:02.080> users<00:06:03.080> to<00:06:03.289> see

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
non Flash users to see

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.879 
non Flash users to see
so<00:06:05.669> let's<00:06:05.939> hit<00:06:06.089> okay<00:06:06.419> and<00:06:06.599> let's<00:06:07.289> insert<00:06:07.499> this

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
so let's hit okay and let's insert this

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.070 
so let's hit okay and let's insert this
into<00:06:08.219> our<00:06:08.489> page

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.590 

so<00:06:13.080> we've<00:06:13.200> got<00:06:13.320> our<00:06:13.440> flash<00:06:13.710> placeholder

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
so we've got our flash placeholder

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.790 
so we've got our flash placeholder
inserted<00:06:15.600> into<00:06:15.810> our<00:06:15.840> blank<00:06:16.260> document<00:06:16.740> here

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
inserted into our blank document here

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.760 
inserted into our blank document here
and<00:06:17.780> unfortunately<00:06:18.780> we<00:06:18.900> don't<00:06:19.050> have<00:06:19.170> a<00:06:19.380> play

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
and unfortunately we don't have a play

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.430 
and unfortunately we don't have a play
button<00:06:19.800> with<00:06:20.280> the<00:06:20.400> FLV<00:06:21.000> files<00:06:21.450> there's<00:06:22.170> no<00:06:22.320> way

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
button with the FLV files there's no way

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.020 
button with the FLV files there's no way
of<00:06:22.560> previewing<00:06:23.040> these<00:06:23.190> inside<00:06:23.910> of

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
of previewing these inside of

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.760 
of previewing these inside of
Dreamweaver<00:06:24.150> we<00:06:24.630> can<00:06:24.780> only<00:06:24.930> preview<00:06:25.380> these<00:06:25.560> in

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
Dreamweaver we can only preview these in

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.710 
Dreamweaver we can only preview these in
a<00:06:25.830> browser<00:06:26.190> but<00:06:26.940> before<00:06:27.240> I<00:06:27.270> go<00:06:27.450> over<00:06:27.540> to<00:06:27.630> a

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
a browser but before I go over to a

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.270 
a browser but before I go over to a
browser<00:06:27.930> just<00:06:28.590> draw<00:06:28.740> your<00:06:28.860> attention<00:06:28.920> over

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
browser just draw your attention over

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.250 
browser just draw your attention over
here<00:06:29.400> into<00:06:29.640> the<00:06:29.760> files<00:06:30.030> panel<00:06:30.330> and<00:06:30.660> you'll<00:06:31.050> see

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
here into the files panel and you'll see

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.350 
here into the files panel and you'll see
that<00:06:31.470> we've<00:06:31.620> got<00:06:31.800> two<00:06:32.100> new<00:06:32.340> files<00:06:32.640> if<00:06:33.000> yours

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
that we've got two new files if yours

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.820 
that we've got two new files if yours
don't<00:06:33.570> appear<00:06:33.840> here<00:06:34.020> just<00:06:34.260> hit<00:06:34.380> the<00:06:34.500> refresh

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
don't appear here just hit the refresh

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.980 
don't appear here just hit the refresh
button<00:06:34.860> and<00:06:35.340> they'll<00:06:35.700> pop<00:06:35.970> up<00:06:36.000> and<00:06:36.420> what<00:06:36.840> we've

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
button and they'll pop up and what we've

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.640 
button and they'll pop up and what we've
got<00:06:37.170> is<00:06:37.350> two<00:06:37.680> SWF<00:06:38.640> files<00:06:39.080> so<00:06:40.080> these<00:06:40.200> are<00:06:40.350> also

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
got is two SWF files so these are also

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.950 
got is two SWF files so these are also
flash<00:06:40.920> files<00:06:41.250> but<00:06:41.490> they're<00:06:41.610> not<00:06:41.730> an<00:06:41.880> FLV<00:06:42.510> file

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
flash files but they're not an FLV file

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.200 
flash files but they're not an FLV file
they're<00:06:43.230> an<00:06:43.320> SWF<00:06:44.160> file<00:06:44.430> and<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:44.940> reason<00:06:45.180> for

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
they're an SWF file and the reason for

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.210 
they're an SWF file and the reason for
this<00:06:45.360> is<00:06:45.540> that<00:06:45.570> most<00:06:46.110> browsers<00:06:46.380> can't<00:06:46.890> play<00:06:47.190> a

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
this is that most browsers can't play a

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.030 
this is that most browsers can't play a
FLV<00:06:48.150> file<00:06:48.480> they<00:06:48.870> requires<00:06:49.230> some<00:06:49.620> kind<00:06:49.890> of

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
FLV file they requires some kind of

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.760 
FLV file they requires some kind of
interface<00:06:50.520> so<00:06:51.120> what<00:06:51.270> we've<00:06:51.420> created<00:06:51.630> by<00:06:52.230> using

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
interface so what we've created by using

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.770 
interface so what we've created by using
clear<00:06:53.160> skin<00:06:53.430> three<00:06:53.790> is<00:06:53.970> our<00:06:54.150> shuttle<00:06:54.600> bar

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
clear skin three is our shuttle bar

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.140 
clear skin three is our shuttle bar
essentially<00:06:55.410> our<00:06:55.500> control<00:06:55.890> bar<00:06:56.100> is<00:06:56.310> to<00:06:56.880> create

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
essentially our control bar is to create

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.170 
essentially our control bar is to create
an<00:06:57.240> SWF<00:06:57.480> file<00:06:57.960> of<00:06:58.110> that<00:06:58.140> and<00:06:58.740> also

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
an SWF file of that and also

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.300 
an SWF file of that and also
Dreamweavers<00:07:00.180> created<00:07:00.510> an<00:07:00.660> FLV<00:07:01.080> player<00:07:01.680> so<00:07:02.220> it

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
Dreamweavers created an FLV player so it

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.670 
Dreamweavers created an FLV player so it
will<00:07:02.400> be<00:07:02.520> able<00:07:02.610> to<00:07:02.760> play<00:07:03.000> the<00:07:03.150> FLV<00:07:03.600> through<00:07:04.500> the

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
will be able to play the FLV through the

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.280 
will be able to play the FLV through the
SWF<00:07:05.250> extension<00:07:05.850> inside<00:07:06.540> the<00:07:06.690> browser<00:07:06.900> window

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
SWF extension inside the browser window

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.200 
SWF extension inside the browser window
now<00:07:07.890> it<00:07:07.950> might<00:07:08.130> sound<00:07:08.340> complicated<00:07:08.670> but<00:07:09.000> it's

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
now it might sound complicated but it's

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.210 
now it might sound complicated but it's
a<00:07:09.300> lot<00:07:09.600> easier<00:07:09.960> getting<00:07:10.350> Dreamweaver<00:07:10.920> to

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
a lot easier getting Dreamweaver to

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.680 
a lot easier getting Dreamweaver to
write<00:07:11.400> this<00:07:11.550> for<00:07:11.790> you<00:07:11.910> than<00:07:12.090> trying<00:07:12.450> to<00:07:12.540> write

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
write this for you than trying to write

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.170 
write this for you than trying to write
it<00:07:12.720> yourself

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
it yourself

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.090 
it yourself
so<00:07:15.180> what<00:07:15.390> we<00:07:15.480> can<00:07:15.600> do<00:07:15.750> now<00:07:15.930> is<00:07:16.170> we<00:07:16.500> can<00:07:16.680> preview

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
so what we can do now is we can preview

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:24.640 
so what we can do now is we can preview
this<00:07:17.280> in<00:07:17.460> a<00:07:17.730> browser<00:07:17.760> window

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.670 

and<00:07:24.740> that<00:07:25.430> we<00:07:25.520> can<00:07:25.639> see<00:07:25.820> a<00:07:25.850> flash<00:07:26.570> FLV<00:07:27.139> movie

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
and that we can see a flash FLV movie

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.460 
and that we can see a flash FLV movie
playing<00:07:27.919> fine<00:07:28.190> and<00:07:28.520> this<00:07:28.880> is<00:07:29.030> our<00:07:29.210> control<00:07:30.110> bar

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
playing fine and this is our control bar

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.159 
playing fine and this is our control bar
that<00:07:30.680> we've<00:07:30.800> added<00:07:31.100> on<00:07:31.340> the<00:07:31.430> bottom<00:07:32.080> and<00:07:33.080> we

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:33.169 
that we've added on the bottom and we

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:35.170 
that we've added on the bottom and we
can<00:07:33.199> pause<00:07:33.530> the<00:07:33.710> movie<00:07:33.860> play<00:07:34.610> it<00:07:34.699> again<00:07:34.910> we<00:07:35.150> can

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180 
can pause the movie play it again we can

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.210 
can pause the movie play it again we can
also<00:07:35.419> shuttle<00:07:36.320> backwards<00:07:36.680> and<00:07:36.800> forwards<00:07:37.100> in

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220 
also shuttle backwards and forwards in

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.060 
also shuttle backwards and forwards in
the<00:07:37.310> movie<00:07:37.580> and<00:07:37.789> we<00:07:38.630> also<00:07:38.810> have<00:07:39.289> the<00:07:39.530> option<00:07:39.889> to

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.070 
the movie and we also have the option to

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.770 
the movie and we also have the option to
increase<00:07:40.940> and<00:07:41.150> decrease<00:07:41.180> the<00:07:41.570> volume

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
increase and decrease the volume

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.570 
increase and decrease the volume
obviously<00:07:42.139> there's<00:07:42.500> no<00:07:42.590> sound<00:07:42.860> on<00:07:43.070> this<00:07:43.220> movie

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.580 
obviously there's no sound on this movie

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.580 
obviously there's no sound on this movie
so<00:07:44.180> that's<00:07:44.780> not<00:07:44.990> going<00:07:45.110> to<00:07:45.169> have<00:07:45.320> any<00:07:45.440> effect

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.590 
so that's not going to have any effect

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.490 
so that's not going to have any effect
here<00:07:46.039> but<00:07:46.820> as<00:07:46.940> we<00:07:47.060> can<00:07:47.180> see<00:07:47.240> the<00:07:47.660> FLV<00:07:48.139> is

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:48.500 
here but as we can see the FLV is

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.200 
here but as we can see the FLV is
