00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.740
 greetings head from there I am chief and 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.910
 welcome to this new editorial and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.300
 today we will be talking about products 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.670
 derivatives 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 hervouet as everyone knows in the world 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.640
 wonderful manga and animation 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.289
 is in any other 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 field as soon as a series is successful 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.410
 it is found declined in number of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.849
 derivative products that comes under 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 several shapes or figurines of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.090
 cosplay poster collection that was 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.100
 accelerated and as every case this is this 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.930
 merchandising part is a component 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.879
 full and even essential to this 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.719
 what's called manga culture why 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.030
 I put quotation marks 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.710
 this component allows us to fans 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.480
 assault 20 consumer impulses 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.770
 primary drinking water is clear that in 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.180
 Africa and in many products 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 derivatives with the effigy of our heroes 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 favorite and there is absolutely nothing 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.829
 wrong in there after all in our 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.480
 middle in our universe we can not 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.800
 really pretend to be fans without owning 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.329
 a more or less large collection of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.190
 manga figure y post and other stuff 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.719
 it's a matter of street credibility 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.489
 to display ostentatiously 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.960
 passion can we really say fans 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.119
 of dragon ball without at least having a 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 little dragon ball figurine I love you 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 graulhet it's like me youtuber who 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.030
 cause to engage shows my modest 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.009
 manga collection of figurines from 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.080
 post to show my passion 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.520
 towards this magnificent medium is also 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.380
 advanced the kind of credibility 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.939
 vis-à-vis the subject that I treat imagine 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.920
 two minutes to youtuber manga who 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.990
 would not show any manga at home that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.770
 would not even have a single manga in his 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.030
 library 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.619
 you realize it will be absolutely 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.110
 ridiculous and absolutely not credible 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 is not it short the marks were in 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.259
 all genres have understood that the fan 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.670
 is a real gold mine plus the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.049
 license is operated more fans 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.549
 will buy and more fans will buy 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.840
 the more the license will be operated these 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.149
 recent years the exploitation of 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.470
 manga or animated licenses have evolved over 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.610
 the time when we were satisfied with toys 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.720
 figurines and the other thing 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.460
 today we are witnesses of 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.250
 the appearance of syria and manga derivatives 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.840
 from hit series to rabbits adventures 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.399
 of lee rock spin-off clerk of the universe 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.110
 of Naruto show permanent spin-off 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.759
 common wadi track dragon ball heroes 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.020
 who is a manga on an arcade game of 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.939
 dragon ball z trading cards 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.750
 so it's a product derived from a 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.430
 derived product 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.899
 assadi a balèze they are strong these 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 Japanese good there are also all the 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.050
 series more or less following and yugioh which 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.710
 does not go anywhere 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.910
 sell 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.950
 your gadgets and new maps to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.270
 fans but good if the spin-off that has 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.560
 full today to make a list of 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.820
 three kilometers but it's not 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.350
 exhaustive what I tell you not without 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.400
 fund it's not the subject finally it's the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.140
 subject but it's not the taboo subject 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.670
 be careful I do not criticize the fact of 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.050
 create spin off on be certain 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.460
 series put on the extended universe and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.840
 produce quality spin-offs that 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.520
 beyond giving back an offer 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.750
 really a plus to the universe of 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.740
 the original work as for example the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.540
 very good spin off the size of 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.010
 titans which leads me to the subject a little bit of 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.050
 the video but you had to see what 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.610
 it's marked in the title you're actually 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.530
 for more or less childish works 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.630
 and light as one piece naruto dragon 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.280
 ball outrageous and logical marketing 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.750
 and understandable according to their 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.010
 immense success their vocation to be 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.450
 very stupid public works regarding 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.980
 of chinguetti the origin it can pose a 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.480
 major problem because basic one is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.740
 well agree that snk is absolutely 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.700
 not a work whose vocation is to 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.200
 touching young and old 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.880
 you're talking about death of survival in a world 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.560
 relentless dark and apocalyptic 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.910
 these macabre brings you a questioning 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.320
 on the condition of being human in the face of 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.760
 nature and in power it's rich and 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.410
 dense and intelligent if this manga 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.210
 cardboard is because it is exciting 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.870
 creeping in intensity 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.070
 dramatic 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.750
 in short, a story that can touch 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.280
 a lot of world of itself by 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.470
 its many and indisputable quality 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.970
 its success is self-evident and we would have very 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.770
 well could be content with merchandising 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.990
 classic to quench our thirst for 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.990
 fans except that it was not just 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.370
 figurines not a pure pizza is more pure 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.740
 pu razors for salons 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.480
 pub hair removal for play cars 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.900
 in the children's menus it's a little 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.460
 limit 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.660
 even if you imagine you have two minutes of 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.250
 happy meal with game of toys 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.690
 thrones in see the scene where one is 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.710
 made there putelat that would be the one where 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.440
 still it would be weird 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.690
 good it is already abused but if it 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.370
 stop there it goes there are also both 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.020
 upcoming film adaptations 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.910
 and if I followed everything well two dramas 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.320
 for the tv of future spin off from mangas 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.820
 and animated for it starts to do 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.930
 many derivatives or series 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.760
 derivative at the same time for a manga 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.660
 as recent but good we could have been 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.940
 fan do with 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.710
 except that it went too much 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:01.200
 far away but look at that 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.200
 if I have time 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.189
 sweet salty such tension 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.719
 you've seen that's exactly where I want in 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.370
 come with this video is that at a 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.870
 moment we do not do too much with snk 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.639
 good after I do not doubt that the series 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.229
 will probably be very funny very 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.580
 nice to watch and it's all not 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.379
 the problem is because I put in 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.610
 cause what I question is it's 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.139
 take a rich work so his 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.999
 complex like snk and the 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.840
 overused so much to the marrow 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.879
 that it becomes a species 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.979
 of Japanese equivalent of this shit 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.749
 and when we get there we have to start 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.639
 to ask questions the products 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:14.349
 Derivatives regardless of gender are 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.120
 part of the universe of which 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.620
 they are drawn he participates greatly in 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.090
 the image that we have works by them 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.039
 are supposed to reflect these 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:26.800
 universe that we love so much and explain me 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:29.310
 how is this thing representative of 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.310
 this stuff 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.330
 good I know the anime is a parody ok 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.459
 I understood but there is an accumulation 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.469
 of absurd things vis-à-vis snk 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:39.969
 doubled during the rapid adaptation of 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.349
 spin off and all that becomes 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.969
 damaging to the original series 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.319
 you remember in my manga menu would 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.270
 that's the case I was asking this question 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.599
 is snk to heat or a phenomenon of 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.369
 fashion 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.689
 I concluded that only the durability of 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:51.129
 the saga in time to respond to 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.990
 this small question in 5 or 10 years 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.279
 snk is still adulated the yeah we 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.929
 can say that it is a great work 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:58.300
 manga and animation without the shadow 

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:59.529
 of a doubt but what there with this hype 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.749
 almost harassment vis-à-vis the 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:02.860
 license 7 naturalizations one in 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.209
 eat all the sauces 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.709
 will end up doing an overdose 

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:07.179
 and when you overdose a saga 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:08.649
 in general she falls quickly into 

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:09.759
 forgetfulness and for something like try 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:10.689
 because it would be really but then 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.339
 Too bad 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.360
 that's because right now it's a 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.949
 when it was trotting in my head 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.419
 to talk about it there and when I saw 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.949
 the cartoon that was going out giraud 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.779
 fucking asia must we must 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.129
 set two three things so that's it 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.990
 balances your opinion in the comments 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.849
 on this question there is what you 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.019
 do not think merchandising anything 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.419
 that we do around these camps did 

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:30.039
 not too much and may kill the universe in 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.689
 did that that's what I wanted to say it's 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.550
 to start the debate so balloon what 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:36.939
 you think about it and I break 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.689
 I'm going to watch TV because 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.689
 I went away
