 reception may but small sms I 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.860

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.840
 phone is called locating my iphone 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.700
 so every time I wandered 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.870
 where I go a little walk a little 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.420
 solo where I tell myself I'm going to buy some 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.590
 bread or what general is a general it 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.970
 walk but she but on arrival my 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.290
 soul locate very quickly because 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.810
 with her apps she knows where I 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.070
 am in real time what so suddenly 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.140
 she calls me he sends me a discharge 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.160
 which makes me take a little 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.300
 unloading my phone 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.159
 in general I get home quickly what yeah ggg 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.750
 what as implication to follow the 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.340
 sport I match engaged with you all 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.050
 just like that I favor it my 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.000
 matches and then to each goal is Belgian 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.960
 and the results live and I find 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.550
 it's rather practical 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.110
 I am for me it is but I have not 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.070
 I do not have this application for that matter 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.120
 do well to talk to me I will 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.430
 download immediately 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.810
 yeah I play a lot and I know what 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.680
 I do the most in the train all that 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.909
 I have a little game called 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.620
 labyrinth so I'm having fun 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.020
 here I am here I am my little one 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.620
 hoe with my little ball I'm doing 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.660
 what to throw in more reindeer 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 when dick rock yeah I 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.140
 the bfm application 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.090
 So here the case a little thing 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 goes to the world where in France or in 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.400
 before I get it directly zara frozen 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.140
 the application tears us off likes the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.730
 on this application so to see 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.080
 also to go faster in the 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.190
 European store and do some tracking 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.340
 on the phone etc this application 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.720
 it is rather practical is also me 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
 my favorite brand is philip laing and 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.170
 I am still disappointed to see that there is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.160
 no application of this mark 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.630
 besides full sir if you 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.680
 hear me 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.520
 it would be so much it would be time to do 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.140
 an application to the via ap ce fc have 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.930
 not hungry me I take a lot a lot 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.080
 the tgv 1 here we find a lot tgv 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.130
 so suddenly I use sncf trips 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.050
 here I am also using the application 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.670
 air france often when we have to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.710
 make cancellations flights or do 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.780
 changes or even just 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.830
 to take out his boarding pass himself 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.810
 find it quite practical the application 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.580
 air france I said there is a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.860
 application that I appreciate enormously 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.270
 it's booking that's what 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.400
 booking that simply serves to 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.990
 find hotels quickly once 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.150
 jetty to las vegas with my life there we are 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.459
 gone on a whim up on the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.350
 route 66 gt ap ap booking I support 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.959
 on it I found a room at 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.370
 venitian for nothing at all in addition to they 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.660
 make half price since it's often 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.130
 at the last moment so suddenly they 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.780
 give the rooms live so that's 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.230
 quite practical and I love this 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.660
 application 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.950
 I have an application called apps 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.700
 tv it's true I discovered that there is 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.430
 what a month and a half ago 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.230
 my friend who told me that a friend 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 told him about it and that's without speaking 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.260
 a lot on social networks and then 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.870
 I discovered this application where we 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.000
 can discover quite a lot of applications this 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.730
 that celebrities are using or even 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.810
 lambda people 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.550
 so here we can discover a lot 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.630
 applications and it opens us to 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.630
 new horizons it's pretty good
