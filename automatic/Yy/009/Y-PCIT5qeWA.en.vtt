00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.320
 Who has turned the clock 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.050
 Do you actually know that there is something in everything 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.050
 you are doing time passes 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.900
 for example while you listen to me or 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.060
 if you play something 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.760
 or if the pointer here on the 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.190
 Alarm clock continues to turn on the weather 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.010
 can you tell what time it is right now 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.200
 he shows the pointer himself and she 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.390
 what is happening 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 by the way, whoever can read the clock comes 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.130
 Also not too late for the birthday party 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.480
 with friends or at the doctor's appointment 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.489
 do you want to learn the clock? 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.149
 then click on the symbols one after the other 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.149
 at the edge of the picture 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.299
 parts of the clock 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.850
 which parts are important at one o'clock 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.070
 so you can read the time correctly 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.620
 can 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.110
 Many watches have a dial with 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:24.710
 the numbers 1 to 12 and two pointers 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.990
 one big and one small 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.390
 the hands of the clock always turn in 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.100
 the same direction 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.100
 this is called clockwise 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.200
 oh this is probably a mess 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.159
 devices 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.890
 look at the clock 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.840
 there is something missing 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.510
 Can you see the missing parts of the clock 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.610
 put back in the right spot 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.250
 brussels the clock together 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.250
 on the squares, you're ready to go 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.260
 and minutes 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.260
 Weigersdorf 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.170
 which pointer is probably faster and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.900
 Why 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.800
 big hand the clock shows the minutes 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.270
 on 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.430
 That's why it's called minute hand 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.930
 within an hour it runs 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.989
 once around the clock 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.510
 is he finished with 60 minutes 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.510
 past 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.780
 minute is much shorter than one 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780
 hour 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.800
 just like once hand washing or a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.350
 birthday serenade 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 the little hand of the clock shows the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.340
 hours 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.859
 he is traveling very slowly inside 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.840
 of an hour he only wanders off 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.079
 one number to the next 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.659
 an hour is about as long as to 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.099
 For example, a cake in the oven needs up 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.099
 he finished cooking 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.370
 Do you already know the full hours? 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.950
 dre on the small hand of the clock 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.120
 hour hand so far the right one 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.360
 time indicates what time it should be 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.520
 that tells you the box on the side 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.150
 if you have set the time 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.490
 then click ok to see if 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.060
 you do it right you have that really good 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.060
 made 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.430
 vettel hours 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.440
 you ask yourself a cake with the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.140
 time has to do 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.480
 Imagine the clock is a cake and 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.080
 death as this cake in four alike 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.080
 big pieces 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.810
 a piece of it is a quarter of an hour 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.720
 two pieces are half an hour and 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.590
 three pieces are three quarters of an hour 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.950
 four quarters so all the cake 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.130
 then correspond to a full hour 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.860
 not that hard or 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.520
 big pointer moved around a quarter 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.389
 So from 12 to 3 is a quarter 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.969
 hour passed 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.430
 after half an hour he gets up 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.889
 the 6th 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.410
 the minute hand points to the new ones 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.410
 then it's about three quarters of an hour 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.900
 before and after 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.830
 which means before and what means after 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.730
 at the time 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.490
 very important the minute hand so the 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.810
 big pointer helps us to do that 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.180
 understand 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.360
 when he's on the way from the twelve to 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.789
 the 6 is then it is after 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.639
 So he stands for example on the 3 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:10.150
 say quarter after 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.689
 he lies between the 6 and the 12 says 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.419
 one before 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.090
 So he shows for example on the 9 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.760
 then the quarter is over 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.470
 Incidentally, it does not matter where the 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.470
 small pointer is located 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.460
 look carefully which is the right one 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:40.910
 you 'll hear a question at the time 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.680
 only one clock shows the correct answer 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.060
 with one click you want the right one 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.000
 clock off 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.530
 the piece of cake can help you with this 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.530
 ready then it can start 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.000
 which clock shows quarter past four 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:05.810
 great that you did great which 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.810
 clock showing a quarter to four 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.680
 it's hardly better which clock shows half 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.680
 four
