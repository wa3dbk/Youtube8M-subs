00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.340

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.250
 I know if two weeks or so I got a 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.110

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.660

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.970
 I showed you that when she made the gesture 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.739
 to take the money from us because she was 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.589
 making the move that as if it 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.049
 I was not hanging and when we 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.260
 We went to the extra part of the courts 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:04.509
 as he looked 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.530

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:12.460

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.259
 it was like she went crazy and 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 hanged 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.060
 well then 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.640
 I got here the other day and I was 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.610
 making another video and suddenly he gave me 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 for looking up here at the fucking mannequin 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 this 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.920
 to the fucking mannequin this and set is the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.900
 A woman's mannequin looks at you edited 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.400

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.740
 but it's a woman because if it were a 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.570
 man we could say yes he could 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.229
 be one of the scientists for example 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.020
 the scientist is that he is in the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.369
 risk but not to be a woman only 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.610
 we know of a woman who would hang herself and 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.479
 she would be the ghost of buried and is 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.800

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.690

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.110

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.750

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.910

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.460

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.610
