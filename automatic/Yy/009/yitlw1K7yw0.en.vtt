00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the publishers or the developers they

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.029

getting<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.690> back<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:59.010> just

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
getting it back and then they can just

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
getting it back and then they can just
sell<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.789> pocket<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.750> money<00:01:00.989> you

this route because in the end it's
really<00:01:09.510> gonna<00:01:09.600> hurt<00:01:09.930> gamestop<00:01:10.619> profits<00:01:11.159> but

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have a feeling that if the next-gen

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.960 
have a feeling that if the next-gen
consoles<00:01:46.229> adopted<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.040> adopted<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
consoles adopted that adopted that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.639 
consoles adopted that adopted that
policy<00:01:48.420> or<00:01:48.540> adopted<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.990> kind<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
policy or adopted that kind of with that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.859 
policy or adopted that kind of with that
model<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.000> sixty<00:01:51.390> percent<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
model that that sixty percent of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.270 
model that that sixty percent of
consumers<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.130> bit

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
consumers that would be a little bit

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
consumers that would be a little bit
more<00:01:53.369> hesitant<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.909> purchase<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> next-gen

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
more hesitant to purchase the next-gen

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.399 
more hesitant to purchase the next-gen
consoles<00:01:55.200> would<00:01:55.890> drop<00:01:56.579> fairly<00:01:57.540> significantly

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
consoles would drop fairly significantly

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.020 
consoles would drop fairly significantly
so<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> would<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.340> interested<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.000> if

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so I would be interested to see if

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.780 
so I would be interested to see if
that's<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.780> way<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.590> future<00:02:02.040> consoles<00:02:02.549> go

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that's the way that future consoles go

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.600 
that's the way that future consoles go
it<00:02:03.030> may<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.540> hot<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.020> may<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.259> happen<00:02:04.680> for<00:02:05.430> the

it may not hot it may not happen for the

it may not hot it may not happen for the
PlayStation<00:02:06.149> 4<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> xbox<00:02:07.320> 720<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.979> might

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
PlayStation 4 or the xbox 720 it might

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
PlayStation 4 or the xbox 720 it might
be<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> one<00:02:08.729> right<00:02:09.330> after<00:02:09.509> that<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.140> what's

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
be the one right after that but what's

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.970 
be the one right after that but what's
so<00:02:10.500> great<00:02:10.739> about<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.099> model<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
so great about this model is that it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.220 
so great about this model is that it
just<00:02:12.310> go<00:02:12.519> towards<00:02:12.940> gamestop<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.690> goes<00:02:13.870> towards

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
just go towards gamestop it goes towards

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.170 
just go towards gamestop it goes towards
the<00:02:14.409> developers<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.220> publishers<00:02:15.730> which

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the developers and the publishers which

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.000 
the developers and the publishers which
is<00:02:16.299> one<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.569> reasons<00:02:16.870> why<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.709> many<00:02:17.890> people

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
is one of the reasons why so many people

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.850 
is one of the reasons why so many people
are<00:02:18.640> or<00:02:18.970> why<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.450> many<00:02:19.569> developers<00:02:20.080> are<00:02:20.319> upset

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
are or why so many developers are upset

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.289 
are or why so many developers are upset
with<00:02:20.890> use<00:02:21.159> games<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.580> because<00:02:21.849> they<00:02:21.970> don't<00:02:22.090> see

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
with use games is because they don't see

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.210 
with use games is because they don't see
any<00:02:22.510> of<00:02:22.599> that<00:02:22.810> profit<00:02:23.290> but<00:02:23.709> I'd<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.099> know

getting<00:03:02.530> more<00:03:02.890> servers<00:03:03.370> out<00:03:03.549> as<00:03:03.730> soon<00:03:03.849> as

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
getting more servers out as soon as

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.970 
getting more servers out as soon as
possible<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.629> in<00:03:05.049> I<00:03:05.349> think<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.680> three

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
possible and that in I think like three

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.740 
possible and that in I think like three
days<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.579> know<00:03:06.849> that<00:03:06.940> seems<00:03:07.180> kind<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.599> like<00:03:07.720> a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
days I know that seems kind of like a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.880 
days I know that seems kind of like a
long<00:03:07.959> time<00:03:08.200> when<00:03:08.379> you<00:03:08.440> would<00:03:08.500> have<00:03:08.620> hoped<00:03:08.769> that

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
long time when you would have hoped that

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.410 
long time when you would have hoped that
would<00:03:09.040> have<00:03:09.129> been<00:03:09.190> sooner<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:09.879> hopefully<00:03:10.239> in

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
would have been sooner but hopefully in

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.059 
would have been sooner but hopefully in
I<00:03:10.629> think<00:03:10.810> two<00:03:11.049> or<00:03:11.200> three<00:03:11.440> days<00:03:11.470> they're<00:03:11.980> going

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
I think two or three days they're going

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.009 
I think two or three days they're going
to<00:03:12.129> have<00:03:12.340> more<00:03:12.730> servers<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.540> hopefully<00:03:13.870> that's

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
to have more servers so hopefully that's

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.089 
to have more servers so hopefully that's
going<00:03:14.109> to<00:03:14.200> lighten<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.500> load<00:03:14.709> and<00:03:14.890> more

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
going to lighten the load and more

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.039 
going to lighten the load and more
people<00:03:15.250> can<00:03:15.400> get<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.609> on<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:16.329> also<00:03:16.510> some<00:03:16.870> good

thinking<00:04:32.360> well<00:04:32.750> this<00:04:32.780> must<00:04:33.320> be<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.800> next

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
thinking well this must be the next

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.890 
thinking well this must be the next
battlefield<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.820> I<00:04:34.970> kind<00:04:35.390> of<00:04:35.450> wanted<00:04:35.690> to

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
battlefield and I kind of wanted to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.480

suppress those rumors a little bit

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.220
