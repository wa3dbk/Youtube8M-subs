up so you're going to go ahead and can

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.210 
up so you're going to go ahead and can
do<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.480> see<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.380> already<00:02:30.560> messed<00:02:30.890> up<00:02:31.070> from

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
do this see it's already messed up from

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.490 
do this see it's already messed up from
the<00:02:31.370> time<00:02:31.580> before<00:02:31.930> alright<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.170> let's<00:02:33.350> go

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
the time before alright so let's go

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.100 
the time before alright so let's go
ahead<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.709> get<00:02:33.890> going<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.280> levels<00:02:34.780> now<00:02:35.780> if

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
ahead and get going with levels now if

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.770 
ahead and get going with levels now if
you<00:02:36.560> want<00:02:36.769> levels<00:02:37.220> they<00:02:37.760> are<00:02:38.000> pretty<00:02:38.540> much

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
you want levels they are pretty much

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.400 
you want levels they are pretty much
saturation<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.580> black<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.030> white<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:42.019> to

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
saturation but for black and white so to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.830 
saturation but for black and white so to
turn<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:42.890> photo<00:02:43.250> black<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.850> white<00:02:44.000> once<00:02:44.660> you

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
turn this photo black and white once you

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.910 
turn this photo black and white once you
do<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.019> right<00:02:45.200> click<00:02:45.560> go<00:02:45.910> down<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.150> colors<00:02:47.540> and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
do it right click go down to colors and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.449 
do it right click go down to colors and
then<00:02:48.920> go<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.280> desaturate<00:02:51.070> now<00:02:52.070> this<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.340> going

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
then go to desaturate now this is going

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.880 
then go to desaturate now this is going
to<00:02:52.579> turn<00:02:52.760> your<00:02:52.910> photo<00:02:53.209> black<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.810> white<00:02:53.959> now

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
to turn your photo black and white now

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.920 
to turn your photo black and white now
you<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.340> mess<00:02:55.579> with<00:02:55.850> three<00:02:56.420> options

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
you can mess with three options

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.710 
you can mess with three options
lightness<00:02:58.150> luminosity<00:02:59.150> or<00:02:59.920> average<00:03:01.360> now<00:03:02.360> it's

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
lightness luminosity or average now it's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.979 
lightness luminosity or average now it's
always<00:03:02.900> different<00:03:03.230> for<00:03:03.560> every<00:03:03.829> photo<00:03:04.130> so

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
always different for every photo so

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.240 
always different for every photo so
luminosity<00:03:05.989> looks<00:03:06.170> really<00:03:06.680> great<00:03:06.890> on<00:03:06.950> this

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
luminosity looks really great on this

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.520 
luminosity looks really great on this
photo<00:03:07.549> but<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.540> other<00:03:08.720> terms<00:03:08.989> if<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.410> was<00:03:09.500> a

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
photo but in other terms if it was a

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.460 
photo but in other terms if it was a
darker<00:03:09.980> photo<00:03:10.220> lightness<00:03:11.120> might<00:03:11.390> help<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.780> so

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
darker photo lightness might help it so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.410 
darker photo lightness might help it so
we're<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.190> go<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.820> ahead<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.239> use

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
we're going to go go ahead and use

we're going to go go ahead and use
luminosity<00:03:15.250> click<00:03:16.250> OK<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.790> now<00:03:17.890> right<00:03:18.890> click

go<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.910> colors<00:03:20.480> go<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.470> levels<00:03:22.780> now<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:24.530> is

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
go to colors go to levels now this is

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.280 
go to colors go to levels now this is
just<00:03:24.860> more<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.340> an<00:03:25.579> experimental<00:03:26.209> thing<00:03:26.660> you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
just more of an experimental thing you

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.039 
just more of an experimental thing you
can<00:03:27.470> go<00:03:27.620> ahead<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:27.980> turn<00:03:28.370> up<00:03:28.579> the<00:03:28.790> dark<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.930> the

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
can go ahead and turn up the dark to the

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.890 
can go ahead and turn up the dark to the
lighter<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.700> that<00:03:31.700> just<00:03:31.940> lightens<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.480> but

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
lighter and that just lightens it but

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.289 
lighter and that just lightens it but
that's<00:03:33.019> on<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.410> output<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.880> can<00:03:35.060> mess<00:03:35.269> around

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
that's on the output you can mess around

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.449 
that's on the output you can mess around
with<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.230> lightness<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.040> turns<00:03:37.280> it

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
with the lightness and this turns it

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.050 
with the lightness and this turns it
darker<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:39.250> this<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:40.430> where<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.700> real<00:03:40.850> magic

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
darker and this is where the real magic

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.259 
darker and this is where the real magic
happens<00:03:41.650> go<00:03:42.650> ahead<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.190> mess<00:03:43.370> around<00:03:43.400> with

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
happens go ahead and mess around with

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.790 
happens go ahead and mess around with
the<00:03:44.450> mediums<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.230> lights<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.400> darks<00:03:47.030> and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
the mediums the lights and the darks and

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.980 
the mediums the lights and the darks and
make<00:03:48.800> it<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.280> looks<00:03:49.459> really<00:03:49.970> nice

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
make it so it looks really nice

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.320 
make it so it looks really nice
usually<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.040> darker<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.520> photo<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.090> better

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
usually the darker the photo the better

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.790 
usually the darker the photo the better
it<00:03:53.540> turns<00:03:53.900> out<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:56.120> as<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.690> can<00:03:56.810> see<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.320> flower

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
it turns out so as you can see a flower

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.740 
it turns out so as you can see a flower
isn't<00:03:58.100> probably<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.820> greatest<00:03:59.090> thing<00:03:59.390> to

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
isn't probably the greatest thing to

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.810 
isn't probably the greatest thing to
turn<00:04:00.020> black<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.320> white<00:04:00.650> since<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.520> is<00:04:01.580> the

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
turn black and white since it is the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.960 
turn black and white since it is the
most<00:04:01.940> colorful<00:04:02.240> thing<00:04:02.900> ever<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:04.040> this<00:04:04.670> isn't

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
most colorful thing ever so this isn't

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.540 
most colorful thing ever so this isn't
really<00:04:05.030> great<00:04:06.020> but<00:04:06.440> it's<00:04:06.620> an<00:04:06.830> awesome<00:04:07.040> thing

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
really great but it's an awesome thing

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.570 
really great but it's an awesome thing
to<00:04:08.210> do<00:04:08.660> this<00:04:08.900> on<00:04:09.110> because<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.950> has<00:04:10.130> lots<00:04:10.430> of

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
to do this on because it has lots of

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.580 
to do this on because it has lots of
shadows<00:04:11.120> if<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.930> can<00:04:12.080> see<00:04:12.320> them<00:04:12.410> down<00:04:12.530> here

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
shadows if you can see them down here

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.000 
shadows if you can see them down here
then<00:04:13.490> all<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.790> tips<00:04:14.090> as<00:04:14.390> light<00:04:14.750> ends<00:04:15.500> from

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
then all the tips as light ends from

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.000 
then all the tips as light ends from
where<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.160> Sun<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.550> hitting<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.680> can

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
where the Sun is hitting it so you can

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.140 
where the Sun is hitting it so you can
go<00:04:19.160> ahead<00:04:19.370> hit<00:04:20.360> okay<00:04:20.920> there<00:04:21.920> you<00:04:21.950> go<00:04:22.100> you<00:04:22.940> can

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
go ahead hit okay there you go you can

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.270 
go ahead hit okay there you go you can
always<00:04:23.510> mess<00:04:24.110> with<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.380> levels<00:04:24.710> differently

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
always mess with the levels differently

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.360 
always mess with the levels differently
while<00:04:25.700> you're<00:04:26.000> doing<00:04:26.210> an<00:04:26.480> actual<00:04:26.780> photo<00:04:27.170> i<00:04:27.470> use

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
while you're doing an actual photo i use

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.690 
while you're doing an actual photo i use
the<00:04:28.910> levels<00:04:29.360> tool<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:30.050> enrich<00:04:30.530> my<00:04:30.860> photos<00:04:31.430> as

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
the levels tool to enrich my photos as

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.020 
the levels tool to enrich my photos as
in<00:04:32.510> if<00:04:32.750> something<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:33.860> faded<00:04:34.190> out<00:04:34.340> in<00:04:34.610> black

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
in if something is faded out in black

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.840 
in if something is faded out in black
and<00:04:35.240> white<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.600> use<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:35.990> levels<00:04:36.350> if<00:04:36.560> it's<00:04:37.280> faded

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
and white I use the levels if it's faded
