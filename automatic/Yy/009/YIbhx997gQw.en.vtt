00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
motor stuff so I was gonna take the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.710 
motor stuff so I was gonna take the
engine<00:01:47.679> out<00:01:48.009> via<00:01:48.250> LAN<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.670> 540<00:01:49.270> because<00:01:49.539> it's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
engine out via LAN the 540 because it's

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.080 
engine out via LAN the 540 because it's
out<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.049> VK<00:01:50.530> put<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.490> VK<00:01:51.819> then<00:01:52.060> I

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
out of the VK put it in the VK then I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.669 
out of the VK put it in the VK then I
have<00:01:52.240> another<00:01:52.329> 540<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.049> was<00:01:53.170> gonna<00:01:53.289> put<00:01:53.470> it<00:01:53.560> in

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
have another 540 I was gonna put it in

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.440 
have another 540 I was gonna put it in
here<00:01:53.829> because<00:01:54.009> there's<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.460> difference<00:01:55.270> in<00:01:55.360> the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
here because there's a difference in the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.169 
here because there's a difference in the
cranks<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:57.130> VK<00:01:57.490> crank<00:01:57.789> is<00:01:57.909> a<00:01:57.939> little

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
cranks and the the VK crank is a little

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.899 
cranks and the the VK crank is a little
longer<00:01:58.390> than<00:01:58.780> what<00:01:59.200> would<00:01:59.289> come<00:01:59.500> out<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.649> a<00:01:59.920> SRB

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
longer than what would come out of a SRB

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.690 
longer than what would come out of a SRB
or<00:02:01.119> an<00:02:01.240> XL<00:02:01.539> v<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.649> they'll<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.979> some<00:02:03.310> you

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
or an XL v and they'll have some you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.699 
or an XL v and they'll have some you
know<00:02:03.759> clutch<00:02:04.030> alignment<00:02:04.450> issues<00:02:04.720> with<00:02:05.020> land

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
know clutch alignment issues with land

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.029 
know clutch alignment issues with land
here<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:06.939> then<00:02:07.209> I<00:02:07.659> started<00:02:08.440> popping<00:02:08.860> things

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
here so then I started popping things

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.059 
here so then I started popping things

funny noise
it<00:03:07.840> doesn't<00:03:08.140> mean<00:03:08.370> push<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.520> throttle<00:03:09.880> and

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it doesn't mean push the throttle and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.640 
it doesn't mean push the throttle and
further<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.540> sort<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.750> means<00:03:10.900> maybe<00:03:11.110> back<00:03:11.440> off

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
further it sort of means maybe back off

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.120 
further it sort of means maybe back off
shut<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.160> down<00:03:13.350> wouldn't<00:03:14.350> maybe<00:03:14.650> create<00:03:15.010> as

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
shut it down wouldn't maybe create as

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.710 
shut it down wouldn't maybe create as
much<00:03:15.310> damage<00:03:17.520> right<00:03:18.550> you<00:03:19.030> don't<00:03:19.240> want<00:03:19.420> mislead

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720
