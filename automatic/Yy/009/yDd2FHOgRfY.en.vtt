 step of a clarified butter 1 with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.240
 the Indian dish that in India is called 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.310
 gui 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.410
 the great advantage of consuming less 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.510
 clarified butter is that it will not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.300
 clog our veins and arteries in 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.530

 in the present day the ingredients of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.660
 clarified butter 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.250
 besides the butter we will use 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.350
 containers a stainless steel pan 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.899
 for air to water 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.930
 a smaller one that fits into it 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.629
 little butter a wood brush a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 other container can be a pirante to 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.780
 place the foam and even more the filter 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.180
 with the holder and the hose that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.510
 will receive the butter clean 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.490
 here we already have 11 finally and here the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.430
 beginning of procedure 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.000
 you can work with 500 grams of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.520
 butter 250 grams of butter 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.130
 defeated or provenance 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.049
 we use regional because it has 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.869
 less ingredients less 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.170
 ingredient has the most 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.000
 healthy here is 250 grams of butter 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.760
 with salt will be cooked in a water bath 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.660
 for half an hour and in this half hour 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.870
 cooking will leave the impurities 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.280
 those fats that clog times and 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.590
 Vacations 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.990
 this is very important because a 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 catheterization for example I do not accuse 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.040
 certain type of fat is incredible 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.750
 by ultrasound 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.840
 the doctors came to a conclusion 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.330
 that the fat plate forming outside 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.030
 of the artery when it burst 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.520
 process is already irreversible and a 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.240
 simple bleaching of the butter will 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.959
 avoid these incidents of course you 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.750
 put butter in the small pan 250 or 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.620
 500 grams of butter in an amount 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.880
 that can withstand this figure 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.209
 for 30 minutes and while this will 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.410
 removing the foam that is the dirt that 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.800
 rises but beyond that which rises you still 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.450
 will filter on the paper filter in the 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.830
 coffee stand 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.080
 according to scholars it is more to save you 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.570
 consume butter than to sour in 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.910
 because the surveys are coming to 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.690
 finding that only one kid is missing 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.720
 in margarine exchange be plastic 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.030
 nobody passes plastic on bread actually 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.320
 After 30 minutes we'll filter 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.320
 this clarified butter 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:16.660
 found girÃ£o container off the bone 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:21.900
 which is already at the coffee filter point with 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.900
 support under a pyrex or the butter 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.980
 and it will be dripping this butter has 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.950
 some brands that stay away for the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.470
 this filtering happens and other 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.080
 happens faster 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.930
 looks butter saved the clarified 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:49.720
 butter gui and look what's left of it 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.660
 worth keeping in mind is how the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.190
 only more pure bottle butter 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:01.750
