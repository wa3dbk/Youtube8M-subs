Washington University Denisov Larry who
was<00:00:46.559> very<00:00:46.860> young<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.340> time<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.000> he's

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
was very young at that time and he's

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.479 
was very young at that time and he's
actually<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.780> very<00:00:49.440> renowned<00:00:49.829> name<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
actually a very renowned name at the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.580 
actually a very renowned name at the
Salk<00:00:50.730> l'institut<00:00:51.090> Institute<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.350> he<00:00:52.469> was

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
Salk l'institut Institute now and he was

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.060 
Salk l'institut Institute now and he was
transplanting<00:00:53.960> tissue<00:00:54.960> brain<00:00:55.620> tissue<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
transplanting tissue brain tissue in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
transplanting tissue brain tissue in
animals<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.969> was<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.329> intrigued<00:00:57.690> by<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
animals and I was just intrigued by that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.260 
animals and I was just intrigued by that
so<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.539> decided<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.590> med<00:01:01.829> school<00:01:02.270> to

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so I decided then to go to med school to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.250 
so I decided then to go to med school to
become<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> neurosurgeon

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
become a neurosurgeon

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560 
become a neurosurgeon
most<00:01:04.470> people<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:04.979> medicine<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.450> then

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
most people go into medicine and then

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
most people go into medicine and then
decide<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.680> their<00:01:07.830> third<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.040> fourth<00:01:08.310> year

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
decide in their third or fourth year

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.469 
decide in their third or fourth year
where<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> went<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
where they going to do but I went to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.060 
where they going to do but I went to
medical<00:01:09.630> school<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.110> become<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.409> neurosurgeon

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
medical school to become a neurosurgeon

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
medical school to become a neurosurgeon
based<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> experience<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.390> had<00:01:12.630> very

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
based on that experience I had very

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
based on that experience I had very
personal<00:01:13.680> experience<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> mentor<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
personal experience with a mentor at a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
personal experience with a mentor at a
very<00:01:15.630> young<00:01:15.750> age<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.310> led<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
very young age so that's what led me to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:26.109 
very young age so that's what led me to
go<00:01:18.150> into<00:01:18.299> neurosurgery<00:01:23.210> yeah<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> very

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
go into neurosurgery yeah that is a very

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.090 
go into neurosurgery yeah that is a very
it's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> very<00:01:27.240> personal<00:01:27.840> book<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.320> me<00:01:28.500> civil

it's a very personal book for me civil

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.310 
it's a very personal book for me civil
revascularization<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:30.420> an<00:01:30.540> area<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.140> has

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
revascularization it's an area that has

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.100 
revascularization it's an area that has
I've<00:01:31.680> always<00:01:32.100> been<00:01:32.220> interested<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.689> mentor

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
professor yeah sure girl in the late

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.679 
professor yeah sure girl in the late
1960s<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.320> Zurich<00:01:37.740> started<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.640> look<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:39.030> doing

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
1960s in Zurich started to look at doing

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.050 
1960s in Zurich started to look at doing
bypass<00:01:40.200> surgery<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> brain<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:41.939> we

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
bypass surgery to the brain at what we

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.690 
bypass surgery to the brain at what we
call<00:01:42.210> low<00:01:42.420> flow<00:01:42.659> bypass<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.009> became<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
call low flow bypass and that became a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.210 
call low flow bypass and that became a
whole<00:01:44.939> new<00:01:45.149> area<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.509> neurosurgery<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.350> then

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
whole new area in neurosurgery and then

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
whole new area in neurosurgery and then
in<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> last<00:01:47.970> 10<00:01:48.329> years<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.259> have

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
in the last 10 years or so we have

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
in the last 10 years or so we have
evolved<00:01:50.009> into<00:01:50.220> what's<00:01:50.399> called<00:01:50.460> high<00:01:50.759> flow

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
evolved into what's called high flow

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.359 
evolved into what's called high flow
bypass<00:01:51.720> while<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.229> use<00:01:52.439> large<00:01:52.710> vessels<00:01:53.189> from

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
bypass while we use large vessels from

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.340 
bypass while we use large vessels from
the<00:01:53.520> arm<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.909> leg<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.570> bring<00:01:54.780> blood<00:01:54.990> flow<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the arm or leg to bring blood flow to

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
the arm or leg to bring blood flow to
the<00:01:55.470> brain<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.340> there<00:01:56.490> are<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> number<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.820> us

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the brain and there are a number of us

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
the brain and there are a number of us

in the United States in Europe and Japan
who<00:01:59.189> work<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.850> work<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.140> yet<00:02:01.680> among<00:02:02.130> us

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
who work do this work and yet among us

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.980 
who work do this work and yet among us
those<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.700> us<00:02:02.939> who<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.659> realized

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
those of us who do this have realized

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.569 
those of us who do this have realized
there's<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.439> no<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.920> text<00:02:05.369> book<00:02:05.549> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
there's really no one text book that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.550 
there's really no one text book that
really<00:02:06.090> kind<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.390> covers<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.869> area<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.530> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
really kind of covers this area so I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.710 
really kind of covers this area so I
wanted<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> take<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.310> desk<00:02:08.640> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
wanted to take this desk on

wanted to take this desk on
and<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.680> my<00:02:10.830> colleagues<00:02:11.130> around<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.730> world

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
and all my colleagues around the world

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.310 
and all my colleagues around the world
who<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.450> kind<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> work<00:02:12.870> we're<00:02:13.110> very

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
supportive so it was a project we put

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.200 
supportive so it was a project we put
together<00:02:15.780> among<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.770> major<00:02:17.340> authorities<00:02:18.000> in

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
together among the major authorities in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.630 
together among the major authorities in
the<00:02:18.300> field<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:19.320> put<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.560> textbook<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.340> people

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the field to put a textbook that people

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.030 
the field to put a textbook that people
clinic<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.570> as<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> reference<00:02:22.290> textbook

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
clinic can use as a reference textbook

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.560 
clinic can use as a reference textbook
for<00:02:23.580> bypass<00:02:23.940> surgery

coming<00:03:50.820> out<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.600> next<00:03:52.100> winter<00:03:57.530> yeah<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.560> think

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
coming out this next winter yeah I think

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.100 
coming out this next winter yeah I think
it's<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.400> critical<00:03:59.610> a<00:04:00.180> nursery<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.959> very

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
it's so critical a nursery is a very

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.030 
it's so critical a nursery is a very
visual<00:04:01.500> field

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
visual field

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.710 
visual field
you<00:04:02.160> know<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.430> write<00:04:03.090> all<00:04:03.330> these<00:04:03.480> long

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
you know we write all these long

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.180 
you know we write all these long
chapters<00:04:04.170> it's<00:04:04.350> counting<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.769> procedure

kind<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.720> surgery<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.290> actually<00:04:27.680> see<00:04:27.920> done<00:04:28.400> is

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
kind of surgery to actually see done is

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.380 
kind of surgery to actually see done is
a<00:04:29.630> lot<00:04:30.050> easier<00:04:30.520> than<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.730> actually<00:04:32.060> just<00:04:32.210> read

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
a lot easier than to actually just read

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.000 
a lot easier than to actually just read
about<00:04:32.600> it<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.170> think<00:04:33.260> it's<00:04:33.530> yeah<00:04:33.710> it's<00:04:33.950> a

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
about it so I think it's yeah it's a

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
about it so I think it's yeah it's a
great<00:04:34.190> complement<00:04:35.120> to<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.330> textbook<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:40.030> can

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
great complement to the textbook I can
