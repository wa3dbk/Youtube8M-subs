00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
know about you but I remember ceiling

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.930 
know about you but I remember ceiling
fans<00:00:22.560> from<00:00:22.830> my<00:00:22.949> youth<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:23.520> are<00:00:23.610> these<00:00:23.730> kind

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
fans from my youth there are these kind

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.150 
fans from my youth there are these kind
of<00:00:23.970> big<00:00:24.210> oak<00:00:24.600> kind<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.320> ugly<00:00:25.440> things<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.070> were

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
of big oak kind of ugly things that were

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.950 
of big oak kind of ugly things that were
always<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.480> ceiling<00:00:27.779> they

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
always up in the and the ceiling they

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.779 
always up in the and the ceiling they
didn't<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.380> much<00:00:28.619> except<00:00:28.980> make<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> whole<00:00:29.550> bunch

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
didn't do much except make a whole bunch

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.580 
didn't do much except make a whole bunch
of<00:00:29.970> noise<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.320> they're

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
of noise but I think now they're

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.860 
of noise but I think now they're
actually<00:00:31.859> been<00:00:32.250> redefined<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.839> be

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
actually been redefined and there can be

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.660 
actually been redefined and there can be
and<00:00:34.260> should<00:00:34.289> be<00:00:34.559> part<00:00:35.039> of<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.309> overall

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and should be part of an overall

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
and should be part of an overall
sustainability<00:00:36.300> agenda<00:00:37.289> for<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.530> house<00:00:37.679> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
be Energy Star labeled also you can get

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.569 
be Energy Star labeled also you can get
an<00:00:57.389> additional<00:00:57.510> 0.5<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.709> a<00:00:58.949> point<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.339> for

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
an additional 0.5 of a point just for

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.340 
an additional 0.5 of a point just for
including<00:01:00.030> them<00:01:00.179> in<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.359> house<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.019> if<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.139> do

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
including them in the house so if you do

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
including them in the house so if you do
include<00:01:01.679> them<00:01:01.799> they<00:01:01.920> want<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.190> least<00:01:02.249> one<00:01:02.639> in

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
include them they want at least one in

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.219 
include them they want at least one in

the living room or family room and one

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.440 
the living room or family room and one
per<00:01:04.470> bedroom<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.910> got<00:01:06.120> us<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.270> thinking

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
per bedroom so that got us to thinking

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.050 
per bedroom so that got us to thinking
about<00:01:06.960> design<00:01:07.440> in<00:01:07.860> terms<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.490> ceiling<00:01:08.850> fan

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
about design in terms of the ceiling fan

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
about design in terms of the ceiling fan
location<00:01:09.690> because<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.860> do<00:01:11.160> a<00:01:11.430> little

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
location because you have to do a little

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
location because you have to do a little
bit<00:01:11.850> more<00:01:11.880> than<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.450> plunk<00:01:12.720> went<00:01:12.930> into<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
bit more than just plunk went into the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
bit more than just plunk went into the
into<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.740> room<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.370> a<00:01:14.400> bedroom<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
into the room so this is a bedroom and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
into the room so this is a bedroom and
this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.660> actually<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> our<00:01:16.230> projects

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this is actually one of our projects

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
this is actually one of our projects
this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.280> our<00:01:17.400> projects<00:01:17.730> and<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.910> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this is one of our projects and this is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.790 
this is one of our projects and this is
really<00:01:18.240> important<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.230> this<00:01:19.380> bedroom

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
really important because in this bedroom

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.650 
really important because in this bedroom
there<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.010> actually<00:01:20.340> two<00:01:20.670> operable<00:01:21.300> windows

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
there are actually two operable windows

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.780 
there are actually two operable windows
and<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.110> allows<00:01:22.470> cross<00:01:23.190> ventilation

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and that allows cross ventilation

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
and that allows cross ventilation
through<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> room<00:01:24.540> itself<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> fan

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
through the room itself and then the fan

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
through the room itself and then the fan
in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> middle<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.760> acts<00:01:27.300> to<00:01:27.570> power

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
in the middle actually acts to power

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.050 
in the middle actually acts to power
that<00:01:28.140> ventilation<00:01:28.620> so<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.670> good<00:01:30.030> enough

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that ventilation so it's not good enough

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
that ventilation so it's not good enough
just<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.780> fan<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> room<00:01:31.620> you've<00:01:31.920> got

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
just to have a fan in a room you've got

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.860 
just to have a fan in a room you've got
it<00:01:32.220> also<00:01:32.370> create<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> condition<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.750> air

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
it also create the condition for the air

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.200 
it also create the condition for the air
to<00:01:34.110> flow<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.620> of<00:01:35.310> course<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> an<00:01:35.940> example

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
to flow and of course this is an example

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
to flow and of course this is an example
this<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.510> for<00:01:36.780> modern<00:01:37.080> fan<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> a

this is for modern fan this is a
