00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.050
 she smiles she addresses that clumsy who spilled juices 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.260
 coffee fruit or other liquid on their keyboard 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.260
 how their aluminum keyboard 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.109
 per 100th for renÃ© of homes to disassemble and clean you will need 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.650
 guitar pick something 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.499
 it can be similar to Paris for as much 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:24.819
 a toothbrush 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.869
 a bomb 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.220
 and a little soapy water 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.940
 we simply do a lot of the key that glue for example 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.180
 seduced me the case here like a little bit it does not go back very well 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.170
 so we click on the top 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.930
 like these 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.780
 we are 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.790
 it is delicate enough 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.910
 the end of the first part 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.620
 and equity 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.080
 I show 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.030
 parties of high and equity 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.480
 mom to decrypt the part of the weight exit the pick in 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.640
 this vote is a plus 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 we see well 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 the parties will be ashamed where he had orange juice this was 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.250
 the upac prevented from going up the most strongly 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 then it is enough 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.760
 rub with hot soapy water 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.220
 scared there the orange juice are beaten all stupid 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.940
 with the glove box a little bit less 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.210
 a freedom to understand in 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.110
 we can go because a rubber protection for 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.340
 electrical circuits 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.830
 we have 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.850
 I have a little piece of worship 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.630
 people like it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 with the toothpick 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.210
 I think so 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.950
 he understands their task 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.950
 physically I am 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.760
 we can only wonder so much the touch 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.139
 or maybe from 6 to 10 am to 8 pm 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.139
 abbas 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.709
 it puts back well in the place 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.639
 he proposes many others follow 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.709
 and we strongly support 104 points 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.219
 and the operation 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.439
 the club works very well
