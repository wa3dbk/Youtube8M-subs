here and then the other end goes into

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.180 
here and then the other end goes into
the<00:01:10.610> USB<00:01:10.940> port<00:01:11.420> on<00:01:11.540> your<00:01:11.630> laptop<00:01:11.750> now<00:01:12.380> there<00:01:13.040> is

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
the USB port on your laptop now there is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.300 
the USB port on your laptop now there is
two<00:01:13.550> USB<00:01:14.420> connections<00:01:14.960> here<00:01:15.230> and<00:01:15.440> that<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.280> for

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
two USB connections here and that is for

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.580 
two USB connections here and that is for
if<00:01:16.850> your<00:01:17.030> laptop<00:01:17.299> doesn't<00:01:18.229> provide<00:01:18.530> enough

if your laptop doesn't provide enough

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.920 
if your laptop doesn't provide enough
power<00:01:19.189> for<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.729> unit<00:01:20.090> off<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.329> one<00:01:20.540> connection

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930

you<00:01:21.860> can<00:01:22.070> install<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.700> next<00:01:23.180> connection

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
you can install this next connection

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.990 
you can install this next connection
here<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:24.920> hopefully<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.640> will<00:01:25.700> give<00:01:25.880> you

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
here and hopefully that will give you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.649 
here and hopefully that will give you
enough<00:01:26.030> power<00:01:26.509> draw<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.470> use<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.979> DVD<00:01:28.340> writer

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
enough power draw to use the DVD writer

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.690 
enough power draw to use the DVD writer
now<00:01:29.659> there<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.140> an<00:01:30.380> LED<00:01:30.680> on<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.220> back<00:01:31.490> of<00:01:31.610> the

now there is an LED on the back of the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.460 
now there is an LED on the back of the
unit<00:01:31.820> just<00:01:32.810> here<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.579> this<00:01:34.579> glows<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.600> blue<00:01:36.079> if

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
unit just here and this glows in blue if

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.679 
unit just here and this glows in blue if
the<00:01:37.070> device<00:01:37.490> is<00:01:37.520> getting<00:01:37.970> enough<00:01:38.180> power<00:01:38.420> to

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
the device is getting enough power to

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.960 
the device is getting enough power to
work<00:01:38.869> if<00:01:39.409> there's<00:01:39.979> not<00:01:40.130> enough<00:01:40.369> power<00:01:40.579> going

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
work if there's not enough power going

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.149 
work if there's not enough power going
to<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.570> drive<00:01:41.899> then<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.259> glows<00:01:42.439> in<00:01:42.469> red<00:01:42.920> and

to the drive then it glows in red and

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.249 
to the drive then it glows in red and
it's<00:01:43.909> suggested<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.750> either<00:01:44.899> try<00:01:45.229> a

it's suggested that you either try a

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.100 
it's suggested that you either try a
different<00:01:45.500> USB<00:01:45.920> port<00:01:46.460> or<00:01:46.670> add<00:01:47.299> in<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.600> second

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
different USB port or add in that second

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.929 
different USB port or add in that second
connection<00:01:48.439> to<00:01:48.979> get<00:01:49.100> enough<00:01:49.369> power<00:01:49.610> to<00:01:49.729> the

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
connection to get enough power to the

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.080 
connection to get enough power to the
device<00:01:50.619> now<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:52.130> comes<00:01:52.369> with<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.640> little<00:01:52.850> stand
