demonstrate how to sew a flat piping

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.450 
demonstrate how to sew a flat piping
into<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> seam<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:28.619> will<00:00:28.830> turn<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> right

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
into a seam you will turn on the right

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.299 
into a seam you will turn on the right
side<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.300> fabric<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.920> strip

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
side of your fabric you get your strip

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.020 
side of your fabric you get your strip
of<00:00:32.899> piping<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.110> place<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.739> close<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> edge

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
of piping and place it close to the edge

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.389 
of piping and place it close to the edge
they<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.140> come<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.380> very<00:00:37.590> different<00:00:37.860> various

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
they all come in very different various

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.119 
they all come in very different various
widths<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> make<00:00:40.320> sure<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.920> it's

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
widths so I want to make sure that it's

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.610 
widths so I want to make sure that it's
along<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> seam<00:00:42.000> line<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.510> 1.5<00:00:43.410> centimeters

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
along the seam line of 1.5 centimeters

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.400 
along the seam line of 1.5 centimeters
or<00:00:44.129> 5/8<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> an<00:00:44.820> inch<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> right

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
or 5/8 of an inch and you get the right

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.479 
or 5/8 of an inch and you get the right
side<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.910> next<00:00:48.870> section<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> place<00:00:50.219> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
side of the next section and place that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.630 
side of the next section and place that
on<00:00:50.730> top<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.100> piping

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
on top so that you have the piping

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.590 
on top so that you have the piping
sandwiched<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.480> between<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.520> then<00:00:56.520> pin<00:00:57.120> into

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
sandwiched in between and then pin into

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.950 
sandwiched in between and then pin into
place<00:00:57.629> I<00:01:00.260> now<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.530> my<00:01:01.770> piping<00:01:02.719> pinned<00:01:03.719> into

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
place I now have my piping pinned into

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.690 
place I now have my piping pinned into
position<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> show<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.580> it
