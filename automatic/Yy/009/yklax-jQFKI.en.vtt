00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello friends in this video is going to 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.440
 show how 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.410
 and connect your computer 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.760
 wirelessly to your television not in 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.449
 hdmi quality through our 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.170
 Android device not clear that our 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.500
 Android device has to have 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.500
 hdmi output 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:34.960
 so in this case I have my galaxy 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:37.750
 no 3 can be any other phone or 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 tablet that has h in my case I what 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.520
 I have connected as you realize 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.520
 I adapt 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.770
 My television 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.880
 which is just 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.700
 and transmitting everything that happens 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.480
 in me 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.480
 android 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.480
 as you will see I have installed the program 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.030
 chip cast 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.460
 very easily they can get it in 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.830
 this case I have seen that they have eliminated 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.960
 of the google play I will put with a 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.970
 direct access here in the course of 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.560
 video as an annotation or in the part 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.509
 descriptive of the video so that they can 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.600
 download and right now I'm 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:28.020
 transmitting I can stop it 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.020
 the broadcast 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.350
 when you are the chip cast for 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.479
 start the transmission make this 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.479
 button here is not transmitting 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.080
 that's why I want 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.840
 not as it is transmitting directly 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.510
 through my cables 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.970
 then but if you realize that as 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.050
 they realize there's a chip warning kast 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.050
 which is activated 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.390
 then we go to our 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.390
 but loves 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.280
 How was it 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.280
 to these girls 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.890
 they can 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.800
 transmit a tab 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.800
 a guy that tab this tab here 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.290
 for this they download the chrome application 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.550
 which is for 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.080
 comcast 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.890
 and it will automatically recognize you 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.170
 so 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.170
 so good until no girls 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.630
 let's see what happens 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.260
 and it's showing up 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.130
 what about me 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.000
 computer 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.080
 I can put 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.080
 any tab 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.890
 and it's going to go 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.570
 transmitting directly 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.099
 to my computer 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.200
 they can also do streaming 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.200
 of the whole screen 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.890

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.390
