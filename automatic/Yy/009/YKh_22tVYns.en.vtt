so<00:04:27.389> you<00:04:27.479> use<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.750> good<00:04:28.020> sub<00:04:28.229> machine<00:04:28.500> gun<00:04:28.710> run

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
so you use a good sub machine gun run

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.300 
so you use a good sub machine gun run
around<00:04:29.250> with<00:04:29.490> extreme<00:04:29.789> calm<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:31.310> difficult

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
people close range and you get the kill

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.290 
people close range and you get the kill
so<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.100> highly<00:04:35.100> recommend<00:04:35.250> using<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.759> is<00:04:35.910> this
