00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.200 
out there earlier today downtown got up
to<00:04:48.960> 72<00:04:49.530> degrees<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:50.490> your<00:04:50.639> average<00:04:50.939> is<00:04:51.060> about

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.969 
to 72 degrees and your average is about
69<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.080> were<00:04:52.169> about<00:04:52.289> three<00:04:52.650> degrees<00:04:52.949> above

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
69 so you were about three degrees above

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.249 
69 so you were about three degrees above
