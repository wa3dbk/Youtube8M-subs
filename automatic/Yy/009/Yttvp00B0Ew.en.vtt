00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.869
 lawyers

 I have here the schedules a video was 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:22.050
 I want to make a 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.570
 distinction is for you between the concept 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 domicile and residence and housing 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.110
 housing housing a theme at a minimum 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.980
 curious that for those who do not study 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.320
 right 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.899
 a very important topic for those who do 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.030
 with a certain frequency is a 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.010
 matter Isabel charge contest 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.769
 and for those who are studying right to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.320
 within the trading heaven of the 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.530
 civil code and that the processes 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.609
 now collect on your tests in your 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.819
 assessments 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:57.059
 good and the importance of this destination 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:01:01.079
 domicile and residence housing is to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.609
 when even here a lawyer is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.820
 When are you going to propose an action? 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.630
 against an individual where you go 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 You will show the judge that you are the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.220
 place where it can be found right 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.260
 this great importance of domicile 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.240
 residence and housing 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.920
 ok let's try to understand the distinction 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.500
 We always understood housing. 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.980
 domicile residence as words 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.010
 synonyms because it marries people the place 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.940
 where we live in a concept 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.340
 religious concept there common sense 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.660
 is our home a place where we 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 mora is a sacred place a holy place o 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.730
 boy we rest as meetings 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.070
 family members including here in brazil have 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.740
 places where the body of a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.790
 sick dear that she only in the house where 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.510
 he lives 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.390
 nene, so she has this stamp in saint 1 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.000
 consecrated and that's why we used to 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.380
 make this mess but to the world of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.619
 right 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.080
 forgetting the question of religion 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.640
 what a difference people make is the concept 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.640
 of residence house home 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:26.820
 silvio venosa and does not even mention that the house is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.130
 when the granddaughter between the individual and the place 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.980
 relationship when there is a 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.680
 there relationship between the individual and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.080
 place but it's important we distinguish 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.050
 a little more and add 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.240
 this distinction that housing is a place 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.280
 where an individual has relationship 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.000
 with the location is not necessarily 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.840
 definitive 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.440
 I do not necessarily need to, right? 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.620
 resided or remain in your 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.400
 girlfriend he meets 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.010
 Okay, I'll try to explain to you, I 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.490

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.430

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.380
 here is the place for the student to pass 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.240
 my vacation for 30 days and it is not 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.670
 considered my residence is not 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.210
 considered my home because 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.230
 I do not intend to live 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.570
 definitely neoton one more study 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.740
 prolonged there than in my own 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.650
 residence 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.950
 Alright, we can already understand. 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.890
 that the residence residence in court 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.010
 both the dwelling is a place where the 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.209
 people have a certain relationship 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.640
 and Mom is not this relationship and more 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.360
 longer lasting where I intend to 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.459
 stay with a definite certainty 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.440
 This is where I plan to stay with the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.959
 period of time 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.600
 in a rally there in article 70 of the code 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:11.010
 civilian will not talk about my lord place 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.770
 where the natural person establishes his 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.170
 residence 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.420
 with a definite then I 'll grouper 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.960
 place when definitive 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.500
 that place where is my 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.460
 residence is my domicile 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:33.520
 good lawyers there we understand 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.840
 when domicile the city nÃ© 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.670
 where do you find yourself at the residence of 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.160
 already well when they arrived at 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.610
 qualify a person right 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:50.830
 So-di single wall having such Brazil 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.590
 there were residents on the street such right 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.990
 in the total number paulo neighborhood and two in the 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:02.170
 blood in case large field is 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:06.180
 tempting residence the house itself of 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.010
 county where the house is located rock 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.480
 okay 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.020
 why this distinction is important 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.810
 because when will propose an action the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.570
 Code of Civil Procedure provides that 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.990
 have been the places where actions should 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.020
 be the defendant's domicile or 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.600
 of the child, or where the fact happened 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.610
 the legal relationship then a series of 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.820
 extinction and we need to know where 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.440
 it is the domicile you are able to propose to 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.070
 propose action 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.320
 my body is correct as soon as the residence is 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.480
 Where are you going to deploy the person? 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.750
 the domicile is where the residence is 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.840
 where you will find it right 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.020
 then look good residence residence and 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.870
 domicile I am are different between 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.180
 but are also mainly linked to the 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.340
 residence is a place where the 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.510
 property establishment with death 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.100
 of the owner of the place where the 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.010
 my residence 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.169
