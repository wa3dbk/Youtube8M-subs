00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
going to put the husks right back into

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.740

corn<00:01:39.020> before<00:01:39.229> grilling<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.890> but<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.250> ends<00:01:40.549> up

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
corn before grilling it but that ends up

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.789 
corn before grilling it but that ends up
steaming<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.329> corn<00:01:41.600> instead<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.200> roasting<00:01:42.679> it

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
steaming the corn instead of roasting it

going to finish up this last one and

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.339 
going to finish up this last one and
then<00:01:49.009> we'll<00:01:49.159> head<00:01:49.310> out<00:01:49.399> to<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.580> grill<00:01:50.349> once

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
then we'll head out to the grill once

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.440 
then we'll head out to the grill once
the<00:01:51.500> fire<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:51.890> ready<00:01:52.099> you<00:01:52.369> can<00:01:52.520> place<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:53.179> corn

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
the fire is ready you can place the corn

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.200 
the fire is ready you can place the corn
directly<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> fire

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.570 

every<00:02:02.810> two<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.110> three<00:02:03.140> minutes<00:02:03.620> give<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.340> corn

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
every two to three minutes give the corn

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.240 
every two to three minutes give the corn
a<00:02:04.670> quarter<00:02:05.030> turn<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.860> let<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:06.950> cook<00:02:07.070> until

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
a quarter turn and let it cook until

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.750 
a quarter turn and let it cook until
it's<00:02:07.460> browned<00:02:07.700> on<00:02:07.820> all<00:02:08.030> sides<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.430> point

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
it's browned on all sides so this point
