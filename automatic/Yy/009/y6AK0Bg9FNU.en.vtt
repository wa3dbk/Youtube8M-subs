00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.830
 today we have how to choose a hood 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:13.080
 when I chose this video was not here 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:16.520
 Well, I think the video will be useful in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.060
 the first thing that you need to get around 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:28.710
 need to pay attention to the volume 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:31.019
 meter cubic hour exhaust means 450 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.440
 cubic hour meters generally recommend 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.200
 if the kitchen is from 9 to 12 square meters 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.050
 accept socket am2 3250 need dito2 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.070
 243 324 cubic meters was often 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 The excerpt worked as per the norms 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.730
 norms need to be in the kitchen 12 times 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:59.640
 now exchanged air 3 working 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.010
 at the same time , I have an income extractor company 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.500
 zirtal 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.500
 Italy price 150 dollars 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 two fans here and what I would like 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.130
 say 450 meters cubic hour is 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.710
 if the hood works without a pipe, that is 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.159
 sucks right here so 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.680
 every vita is calculated 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:33.960
 parameters that look like 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 by suction it will be exactly here without 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.579
 pipe and works without resistance then 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.040
 there is she will be able to suck and on the third 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.040
 speeds which by the way are very noisy 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 so I did therefore need to do 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.700
 hole wall and on the street there was a noise invented 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.860
 I made the ventilation so much easier but in 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.570
 Generally gray hood copes with 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:05.650
 by them 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:09.070
 tasks here have lights shine 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:13.090
 not bad just would like you to 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.030
 heard the sound the sound u generally for a person 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.470
 normal is considered a comfortable sound 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.470
 up to 41 xml 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.100
 Well, let's say a man more pisi greenhouse 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.209
 for example 1 speed 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.209
 you know 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.680
 half includes 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.680
 better seen so here is the second speed 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.340
 here 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.930
 so we are almost to the country 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:04.410
 enable use use 1 2 and 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.860
 this is generally enough 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.459
 probably all they want to say thank you 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.459
 for your attention 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.980
 goodbye
