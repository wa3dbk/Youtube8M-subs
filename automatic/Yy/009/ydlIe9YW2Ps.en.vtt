are<00:03:04.290> packed<00:03:04.530> full<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.800> vitamin<00:03:05.340> D<00:03:05.840> what<00:03:06.840> makes

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
are packed full of vitamin D what makes

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.020 
are packed full of vitamin D what makes
our<00:03:07.260> bones<00:03:07.530> strong<00:03:08.030> vitamin<00:03:09.030> D<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.850> our

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
our bones strong vitamin D so in our

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.430 
our bones strong vitamin D so in our
year<00:03:12.330> we<00:03:12.780> have<00:03:12.959> tiny<00:03:13.410> tiny<00:03:13.920> little<00:03:14.610> bones<00:03:15.440> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
year we have tiny tiny little bones so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.940 
year we have tiny tiny little bones so
what<00:03:17.250> happens<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:19.580> sound<00:03:20.580> is

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
what happens is that sound is

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.800 
what happens is that sound is
transmitted<00:03:22.970> from

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
transmitted from

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.030 
transmitted from
the<00:03:25.320> ear<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.000> brain<00:03:27.350> with<00:03:28.350> stronger<00:03:28.860> bones

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
the ear to the brain with stronger bones

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.610 
the ear to the brain with stronger bones
stronger<00:03:29.790> your<00:03:29.940> bones<00:03:30.210> are<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.570> your<00:03:30.720> ear<00:03:30.900> you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
stronger your bones are in your ear you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.750 
stronger your bones are in your ear you
get<00:03:31.770> better<00:03:31.980> sound<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:33.150> mushrooms<00:03:34.460> do<00:03:35.460> a<00:03:35.490> lot

health

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
health

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.990

now<00:05:16.310> our<00:05:16.790> bones<00:05:17.210> are<00:05:17.480> full<00:05:17.660> of<00:05:18.160> sodium<00:05:19.160> about

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
now our bones are full of sodium about

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.330 
now our bones are full of sodium about
23<00:05:20.540> percent

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
23 percent

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.210 
23 percent
so<00:05:22.340> is<00:05:22.550> rhubarb<00:05:23.630> but<00:05:24.470> what<00:05:24.590> happens<00:05:24.950> when<00:05:25.100> you
