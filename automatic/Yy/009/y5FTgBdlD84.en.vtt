and we also helped her learn how to walk
around<00:02:30.989> first<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.470> familiar<00:02:31.830> environments

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
around first in familiar environments

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.430 
around first in familiar environments
and<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.880> unfamiliar<00:02:33.870> environments<00:02:36.290> we<00:02:37.290> also

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
and then unfamiliar environments we also

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.290 
and then unfamiliar environments we also
focused<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.130> handling<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.850> was<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> big

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
focused on handling that was a big

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.240 
focused on handling that was a big
challenge<00:02:39.600> for<00:02:39.810> her<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.319> think<00:02:40.470> she<00:02:40.680> was<00:02:40.830> just

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
challenge for her I think she was just

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.759 
challenge for her I think she was just
terrified<00:02:41.580> by<00:02:41.970> touch<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.470> was<00:02:43.620> something

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
terrified by touch so that was something

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.400 
terrified by touch so that was something
we<00:02:43.890> had<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.190> focus<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.730> lot<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:44.940> with<00:02:45.330> her<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.900> we

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
we had to focus a lot on with her and we

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.890 
we had to focus a lot on with her and we
taught<00:02:46.620> her<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.980> very<00:02:47.519> cool<00:02:47.820> skill<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.690> taught

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
taught her a very cool skill we taught

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.600 
taught her a very cool skill we taught
her<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.170> actually<00:02:49.350> place<00:02:49.769> parts<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.280> her<00:02:50.430> body

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
her to actually place parts of her body

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.940 
her to actually place parts of her body
against<00:02:51.300> our<00:02:51.510> hands<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.590> she<00:02:52.830> was

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
against our hands so that she was

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.890 
against our hands so that she was
initiating<00:02:53.670> touch<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.480> we<00:02:54.630> gave<00:02:54.780> her<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
initiating touch and we gave her a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.020 
initiating touch and we gave her a
reward<00:02:55.319> for<00:02:55.470> doing<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:59.459> was<00:02:59.580> really<00:02:59.850> cool

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
reward for doing that it was really cool

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.820 
reward for doing that it was really cool
eventually<00:03:00.600> she<00:03:00.810> realized<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.650> felt

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
eventually she realized that it felt

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.370 
eventually she realized that it felt
good<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.250> she<00:03:03.239> discovered<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.930> penny<00:03:04.230> was
