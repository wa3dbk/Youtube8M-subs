00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.330
 hi friends from youtube today I wanted to upload 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.660
 a video a little tutorial for 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.250
 introduce logs to cure the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.370
 trunks to put in our fish tank 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.710
 well let's start to start 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:21.310
 saying that what the trunks 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.020
 recommended for a fish tank where more 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 that all of fruit can be like the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.920
 Apple 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.400
 Orange peach good here I have one 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.930
 which is a good fig and we start with the 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.980
 trunk and we said once we have 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.530
 directed the trunk that we want 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.120
 introduce what we started with a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.790
 knife we take care that you do not look 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 start peeling a bit the parts 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.840
 so that it is better to give a little 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.060
 the video I already have to each one uses only 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.550
 cleaning once I had cleaned 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.910
 all good what we are going to do is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.910
 Introduce 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.530
 to a hot water we now have the 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.920
 hot water and we had to introduce it 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.110
 we wait like half an hour good this 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.600
 we make it so that it starts to be removed 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.659
 the color because if we put it 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.240
 directly you may start to start 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.369
 has had our wax so that it does not 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.979
 it happens it 's good once we put it here 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.979
 and let's see the color come out 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.710
 and I also want to do some phases 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.030
 because many have some stones or 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.220
 questions and any stone can 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.950
 get to put it in general if it can be 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.430
 of some river or some gravel that wants 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.799
 put a stone in special 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.030
 we have a huge stone with some 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.070
 girls what we are going to do is 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.619
 simply put the hot water 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.220
 also so that it starts to be removed from 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.440
 the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.050
 is not needed in society and in 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.130
 species of some bacteria we started 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.069
 also to the hot good we hope 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.189
 about half an hour to go 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.969
 removing the color of the trunk fabric 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:16.469
 we can also do once 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:19.489
 After half an hour has passed, we take out what 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:22.319
 we started to clean a little more and good 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.400
 it depends how you go as you see your 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.620
 tree by its trunk so that if still 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.290
 is still pulling very much much 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.269
 Much dirt to a child a lot of water 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.969
 we can do this one or two or three 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.930
 times until the trunk is no longer 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:42.120
 float or also stop tennis 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.239
 well after he's past 30 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.510
 minutes to the minutes needed with the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.340
 trunk we started not what I did not say of 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.010
 that way and it's like this one gets to stay 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.520
 we can take it out and put it back 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.990
 on this side of the side that does not 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.880
 that did not enter the water, good, and that's 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.370
 I did it like three times already the trunk 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.420
 well I stay and we can also 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.970
 do with a brush they started to clean 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.600
 good as you want and here also 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:23.060
 the stones of my daughter and also what 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:25.970
 you can start carving well good good 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.280
 in this case the fig trunk because 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.670
 this 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.020
 It is very light and it floats and does not 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.530
 we are inside the center of the fish tank 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.530
 and so 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.410
 my mind I can not do it with something and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.930
 with a stone that something to make 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.569
 in this case in the trunk I say 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.180
 how does it come to have as a piercing 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.180
 make a simple close and touch 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.390
 I stay like a hook and good 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.260
 as you will see I have the platform filter 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.220
 and well we're going to 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.220
 Introduce 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.610
 let's imagine 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.209
 as I already have it there 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.799
 it's not a small adjustment and it's good 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.799
 simple there I was already hooked 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.800
 there I stayed the spotted spot there 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:41.220
 and well , we started it 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.500
 to cover good and we will introduce and 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.819
 the stones also that we already have 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.690
 cleaned that I have ready and we started 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.690
 to introduce it 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.790
 good as you will see we have already been 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.980
 finished we made the trunk also the 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.080
 good stones everyone has the taste 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.639
