00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
stuff so we're going to set those aside

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.830 
stuff so we're going to set those aside
and<00:03:17.700> let's<00:03:17.850> see<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.030> there's<00:03:18.390> anything<00:03:18.660> else

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
and let's see if there's anything else

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.070 
and let's see if there's anything else
up<00:03:19.110> nothing<00:03:19.470> else<00:03:19.620> on<00:03:20.550> here<00:03:20.820> we<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.690> little

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
up nothing else on here we have a little

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.580 
up nothing else on here we have a little
paper<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:22.980> really<00:03:23.490> know<00:03:23.610> what<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.590> it's

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
paper I really know what this is it's

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.870 
paper I really know what this is it's
probably<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.920> warranty<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.490> just<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.790> little

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
probably the warranty in just a little

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.970 
probably the warranty in just a little
bit<00:03:26.970> information<00:03:27.630> yet<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.830> set

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
bit information yet it's going to set

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.560 
bit information yet it's going to set
that<00:03:29.010> aside<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.610> here<00:03:30.090> are<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.270> headphones

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
that aside and here are the headphones

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.530 
that aside and here are the headphones
themself<00:03:31.200> there's<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.340> little<00:03:32.700> place<00:03:33.330> where

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
themself there's the little place where

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.140 
themself there's the little place where
the<00:03:33.630> headphone<00:03:33.930> sit<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.730> one<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.940> main
