what's<00:00:00.510> great<00:00:00.690> about<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.930> Mizuno<00:00:01.380> wedge<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.860> not

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
what's great about a Mizuno wedge is not

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.710 
what's great about a Mizuno wedge is not
only<00:00:02.580> does<00:00:02.669> it<00:00:02.700> have<00:00:02.850> all<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.120> precision<00:00:03.629> of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
only does it have all the precision of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.749 
only does it have all the precision of
our<00:00:03.840> NPI<00:00:04.200> art<00:00:04.589> all<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.830> craftsmanship<00:00:05.400> all

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
our NPI art all the craftsmanship all

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.610 
our NPI art all the craftsmanship all
the<00:00:05.879> look<00:00:06.089> but<00:00:06.509> it's<00:00:06.629> also<00:00:06.750> grain<00:00:07.080> flow<00:00:07.319> forged

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
the look but it's also grain flow forged

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.770 
the look but it's also grain flow forged
really<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.700> grain<00:00:08.910> flow<00:00:09.120> for<00:00:09.330> gene<00:00:09.480> does<00:00:09.630> is

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
really what grain flow for gene does is

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.390 
really what grain flow for gene does is
it<00:00:09.870> delivers<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.260> most<00:00:10.559> feel<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.160> most

much<00:00:26.039> fun<00:00:26.099> about<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.580> wedge<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.810> such<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
much fun about a wedge is it's a such a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.960 
much fun about a wedge is it's a such a
versatile<00:00:28.560> club<00:00:28.920> there's<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.369> much<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.760> on

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
versatile club there's so much going on

versatile club there's so much going on
with<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.320> about<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
with it you have to think about all the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.560 
with it you have to think about all the
different<00:00:32.340> shots<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.090> play<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
different shots that you play with the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020 
different shots that you play with the
wedge<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.100> straight<00:00:35.460> set

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
wedge it's not just for one straight set

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
wedge it's not just for one straight set
up<00:00:36.149> hit<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.660> specific<00:00:36.870> distance<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.770> wedge

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
up hit at this specific distance a wedge

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
up hit at this specific distance a wedge
is<00:00:38.430> something<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> work<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> full

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
is something that has to work on a full

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
is something that has to work on a full
shot<00:00:39.960> has<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.230> work<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> half<00:00:40.770> shot<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
work on a quarter shot so it's something

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
work on a quarter shot so it's something
that<00:00:43.379> takes<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.950> lot<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.190> thought<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.940> lot<00:00:45.120> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that takes a lot of thought and a lot of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.670 
that takes a lot of thought and a lot of
precision<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.020> sure<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.530> good

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
precision to make sure it's a good

precision to make sure it's a good
performing<00:00:47.190> wedge<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.690> really

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
performing wedge on this we really

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
performing wedge on this we really
wanted<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> make<00:00:49.350> everything<00:00:49.680> very<00:00:50.100> smooth

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
wanted to make everything very smooth

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.729 
wanted to make everything very smooth
very<00:00:51.030> traditional<00:00:51.539> very<00:00:51.750> clean<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.590> you'll

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
very traditional very clean so you'll

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.350 
very traditional very clean so you'll
see<00:00:52.860> there's<00:00:53.070> no<00:00:53.250> hard<00:00:53.550> edges<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> grind

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
see there's no hard edges on the grind

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.200 
see there's no hard edges on the grind
on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> sole<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:55.890> very<00:00:56.370> fluid<00:00:56.879> how

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
on the sole and it's very very fluid how

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.330 
on the sole and it's very very fluid how
it<00:00:57.360> flows<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> hosel<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:58.920> got<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> really

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
it flows into the hosel we got a really

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889 
it flows into the hosel we got a really
thin<00:00:59.730> section<00:01:00.120> on<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> hosel<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
thin section on the hosel which is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.990 
thin section on the hosel which is
really<00:01:01.199> helpful<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.609> through<00:01:02.640> heavy

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
really helpful for going through heavy

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
really helpful for going through heavy
rough<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.629> gonna<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.080> drag

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
rough you're not gonna get that drag

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.440 
rough you're not gonna get that drag
because<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.280> thin<00:01:05.549> section<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
because of that thin section it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
because of that thin section it's
something<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.110> wanted<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
something that we really just wanted to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.510 
something that we really just wanted to
smooth<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.189> give<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> really

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
smooth out and just give a really

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.850 
smooth out and just give a really

over<00:01:22.140> again<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.430> players<00:01:23.640> who

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
over again is there a lot of players who

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.539 
over again is there a lot of players who
the<00:01:24.180> hard<00:01:24.509> lines<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> sole<00:01:25.470> weren't<00:01:26.340> quite

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
the hard lines on the sole weren't quite

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.920 
the hard lines on the sole weren't quite
working<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> would<00:01:27.390> became<00:01:27.720> too

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
working for it would became too

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.870 
working for it would became too
aggressive<00:01:28.500> you'd<00:01:29.040> swing<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.790> would

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
aggressive you'd swing down it would

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.640 
aggressive you'd swing down it would
actually<00:01:30.030> cause<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> club<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> dig<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.439> so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
actually cause the club to dig a bit so

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.050 
actually cause the club to dig a bit so
with<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> tee<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.250> wedges<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.729> wanted<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
with the tee for wedges we wanted to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.340 
with the tee for wedges we wanted to
make<00:01:33.240> sure<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.780> wasn't<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> be

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
make sure that that wasn't going to be

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.899 
make sure that that wasn't going to be
an<00:01:34.439> issue<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.460> wanted<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> make<00:01:35.850> sure

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
an issue we really wanted to make sure

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.640 
an issue we really wanted to make sure
that<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.390> had<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> relief<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.560> need

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that it had all the relief that you need

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.950 
that it had all the relief that you need
to<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:38.490> playable<00:01:38.939> soul<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
to have a very playable soul but the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.120 
to have a very playable soul but the
same<00:01:40.110> time<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> didn't<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.740> any<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> those

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
same time it didn't have any of those

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100 
same time it didn't have any of those
hard<00:01:41.430> edges<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.000> make<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> wedge<00:01:42.869> too

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
hard edges that make the wedge too

that's where the bulk of the time is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.190 
that's where the bulk of the time is
spent<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.149> fun<00:02:03.360> time<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.990> time

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
that's spent here it was really

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
that's spent here it was really
interesting<00:02:06.240> when<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.689> when<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> USGA<00:02:07.590> and

-<00:02:13.370> what<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.880> perfect<00:02:14.240> groove<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.810> Mizuno

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
- what is the perfect groove and Mizuno

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.590 
- what is the perfect groove and Mizuno
was<00:02:15.410> no<00:02:15.770> different<00:02:16.190> we<00:02:16.610> did<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> ton<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.090> testing

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
was no different we did a ton of testing

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.050 
was no different we did a ton of testing
of<00:02:17.750> wide<00:02:17.990> shallow<00:02:18.410> narrow<00:02:18.950> deep<00:02:19.250> all<00:02:19.580> sorts<00:02:19.940> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
of wide shallow narrow deep all sorts of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.120 
of wide shallow narrow deep all sorts of
different<00:02:20.450> pitch<00:02:20.960> versus<00:02:21.470> depth<00:02:21.740> variations

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
different pitch versus depth variations

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.190 
different pitch versus depth variations
and<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:23.210> was<00:02:23.300> interesting<00:02:23.630> what<00:02:23.690> we<00:02:23.780> found<00:02:23.960> out

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
and it was interesting what we found out

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.070 
and it was interesting what we found out
on<00:02:24.530> full<00:02:24.890> shots<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.520> robotic<00:02:25.940> shots<00:02:26.210> we<00:02:26.810> found

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
on full shots and robotic shots we found

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.720 
on full shots and robotic shots we found
that<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.290> narrow<00:02:27.620> deep<00:02:27.950> groove<00:02:28.280> was<00:02:28.460> really

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
that a narrow deep groove was really

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.880 
that a narrow deep groove was really
beneficial<00:02:29.120> then<00:02:30.110> when<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.410> thought<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.740> was

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
beneficial then when we thought that was

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.080 
beneficial then when we thought that was
gonna<00:02:30.980> be<00:02:31.070> our<00:02:31.190> final<00:02:31.490> groove<00:02:31.670> we<00:02:31.820> actually

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
gonna be our final groove we actually

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.400 
gonna be our final groove we actually
took<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.330> out<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.480> our<00:02:32.720> players<00:02:32.990> out<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.320> the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
took it out to our players out of the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.770 
took it out to our players out of the
Tour<00:02:33.590> Championship<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.880> lot<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.210> them<00:02:35.390> they

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
Tour Championship and a lot of them they

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.660 
Tour Championship and a lot of them they
said<00:02:36.050> it<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.290> great<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.560> full<00:02:36.890> shots<00:02:37.160> but

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
said it was great on full shots but

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.740 
said it was great on full shots but
chipping<00:02:38.030> around<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.360> green<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.690> they

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
chipping around the green and they

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.330 
chipping around the green and they
actually<00:02:38.870> preferred<00:02:39.410> one<00:02:39.710> of<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.860> samples<00:02:40.220> we

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
actually preferred one of the samples we

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.940 
actually preferred one of the samples we
had<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.760> was<00:02:41.000> wider<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.900> shallower<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.770> we

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
had that was wider and shallower so we

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.370 
had that was wider and shallower so we
did<00:02:43.070> even<00:02:43.640> more<00:02:43.820> testing<00:02:44.450> let's<00:02:44.960> to<00:02:45.080> do<00:02:45.200> some

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
did even more testing let's to do some

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.230 
did even more testing let's to do some
high<00:02:45.560> speed<00:02:45.800> video<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.280> some<00:02:46.460> short<00:02:46.700> shots<00:02:46.970> and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
high speed video of some short shots and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.330 
high speed video of some short shots and
we<00:02:47.630> found<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.110> really<00:02:48.170> when<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.010> get<00:02:49.190> to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
we found that really when you get to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.560 
we found that really when you get to
more<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.670> partial<00:02:50.090> shot<00:02:50.240> more<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.540> a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
more of a partial shot more of a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.930 
more of a partial shot more of a
glancing<00:02:50.840> blow<00:02:51.110> with<00:02:51.860> more<00:02:52.130> loft<00:02:52.400> it's

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
glancing blow with more loft it's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.490 
glancing blow with more loft it's
actually<00:02:53.180> beneficial<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.810> have<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:54.200> wider

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
actually beneficial to have that wider

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.930 
actually beneficial to have that wider
shallower<00:02:55.010> groove<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:56.420> from<00:02:56.600> here<00:03:00.940> you're

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
shallower groove so from here you're

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.310 
shallower groove so from here you're
able<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.240> get<00:03:02.390> under<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> ball<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.170> hit<00:03:03.290> a

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
able to get under the ball and hit a

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.140 
able to get under the ball and hit a
shot<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:03.800> gonna<00:03:03.920> fly<00:03:04.130> up<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.580> grab<00:03:04.820> really

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
shot that's gonna fly up and grab really

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.970 
shot that's gonna fly up and grab really
quickly<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:06.170> was<00:03:06.260> pretty<00:03:06.410> good<00:03:06.590> wasn't<00:03:06.860> it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
quickly that was pretty good wasn't it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.090 
quickly that was pretty good wasn't it
I've<00:03:07.220> grabbed<00:03:07.490> nice<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.680> slot<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
I've grabbed nice so the slot in the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.520 
I've grabbed nice so the slot in the
back<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.580> wedge<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:11.150> um<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:12.080> allowed<00:03:12.350> us

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
back of the wedge it's um it allowed us

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.630 
back of the wedge it's um it allowed us
to<00:03:12.560> move<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.980> little<00:03:13.070> bit<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.340> weight<00:03:13.490> around

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
to move a little bit of weight around

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.030 
to move a little bit of weight around
you<00:03:14.420> know<00:03:14.540> on<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:15.110> wedge<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.560> don't<00:03:15.710> need<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.860> lot

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
you know on a wedge you don't need a lot

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.590 
you know on a wedge you don't need a lot
of<00:03:16.070> toe<00:03:16.310> heel<00:03:16.550> weighting<00:03:17.000> or<00:03:17.060> anything<00:03:17.239> so

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
of toe heel weighting or anything so

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.030 
of toe heel weighting or anything so
this<00:03:17.750> was<00:03:17.900> just<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:18.140> little<00:03:18.260> extra<00:03:18.590> place<00:03:18.830> where

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
this was just a little extra place where

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.740 
this was just a little extra place where
we<00:03:19.130> could<00:03:19.340> make<00:03:19.550> sure<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:20.030> we<00:03:20.390> took<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.600> little

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
we could make sure that we took a little

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.240 
we could make sure that we took a little
bit<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:20.989> mass<00:03:21.140> from<00:03:21.380> there<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.830> made<00:03:22.040> sure<00:03:22.070> we

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
bit of mass from there and made sure we

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.620 
bit of mass from there and made sure we
kept<00:03:22.520> as<00:03:22.640> much<00:03:22.670> thickness<00:03:23.209> as<00:03:23.300> we<00:03:23.450> could

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
kept as much thickness as we could

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.180 
kept as much thickness as we could
behind<00:03:23.959> impact<00:03:24.350> as<00:03:24.500> well<00:03:24.620> as<00:03:24.739> high<00:03:24.920> on<00:03:25.100> the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
behind impact as well as high on the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.070 
behind impact as well as high on the
blade<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.970> way<00:03:26.120> regardless<00:03:26.300> of<00:03:26.750> where<00:03:26.989> you

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
blade that way regardless of where you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.570 
blade that way regardless of where you
hit<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:27.290> ball<00:03:27.410> you're<00:03:28.040> still<00:03:28.220> gonna<00:03:28.370> get<00:03:28.520> that

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
hit the ball you're still gonna get that

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.580 
hit the ball you're still gonna get that
good<00:03:28.910> solid<00:03:29.150> feel<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:30.080> know<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.200> lot<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.380> wedges

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
good solid feel you know a lot of wedges

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.530 
good solid feel you know a lot of wedges
lately<00:03:31.220> I've<00:03:31.340> been<00:03:31.459> getting<00:03:31.580> too<00:03:31.910> thin<00:03:32.209> up<00:03:32.390> on

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
lately I've been getting too thin up on

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.780 
lately I've been getting too thin up on
the<00:03:32.630> top-line<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.440> what<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.010> causes<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.489> if

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
the top-line and what that causes is if

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.670 
the top-line and what that causes is if
you<00:03:35.209> know<00:03:35.330> when<00:03:35.480> you're<00:03:35.600> in<00:03:35.630> deep<00:03:35.870> grass<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.530> lot

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
you know when you're in deep grass a lot

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.930 
you know when you're in deep grass a lot
of<00:03:36.739> times<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.100> wedge<00:03:37.310> you'll<00:03:37.550> hit<00:03:37.670> high<00:03:37.910> on

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
of times on a wedge you'll hit high on

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.910 
of times on a wedge you'll hit high on
the<00:03:38.180> blade<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.870> when<00:03:39.050> you<00:03:39.110> do<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.709> just

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
the blade and when you do that it just

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.220 
the blade and when you do that it just
feels<00:03:40.250> terrible<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.880> goes<00:03:41.090> nowhere<00:03:41.390> so<00:03:42.080> by

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
feels terrible it goes nowhere so by

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.140 
feels terrible it goes nowhere so by
keeping<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.620> lot<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.769> mass<00:03:43.100> there<00:03:43.459> you're<00:03:43.880> able

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
keeping a lot of mass there you're able

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.479 
keeping a lot of mass there you're able
to<00:03:44.180> make<00:03:44.600> sure<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.050> good<00:03:45.650> solid<00:03:45.980> feel<00:03:46.160> as
