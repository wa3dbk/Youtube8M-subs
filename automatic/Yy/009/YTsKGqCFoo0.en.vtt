00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
from both teams here I believe it is

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
base that he'll have on the eastern side
you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:11.640> should<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:12.360> able<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.750> land

you know they should be able to land
some<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.530> decent<00:01:13.920> shots<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.939> some<00:01:15.150> of

some some decent shots on to some of
these<00:01:15.330> progressing<00:01:16.320> members<00:01:16.920> butting<00:01:17.310> their

these progressing members butting their

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.100 
these progressing members butting their
you<00:01:17.549> late<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.060> will<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.600> come<00:01:19.080> back

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you late they will have to come back

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.810 
you late they will have to come back
once<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> base<00:01:19.770> capture<00:01:19.979> starts<00:01:20.340> well<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> mean

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
once the base capture starts well I mean

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
once the base capture starts well I mean
they've<00:01:21.210> already<00:01:21.390> come<00:01:21.689> back<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.290> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
they've already come back as it is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.960 
they've already come back as it is
because<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:22.799> realize<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.400> think<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
because they realize I think we have to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.670 
because they realize I think we have to
defend<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.450> now<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.720> don't<00:01:25.110> understand<00:01:25.470> why

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
defend this now I don't understand why

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.370 
defend this now I don't understand why
they<00:01:25.890> would<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.130> systematically<00:01:27.140> go<00:01:28.140> for

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

yeah<00:02:53.799> I<00:02:53.829> believe<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.459> all<00:02:54.640> at<00:02:55.000> least<00:02:55.180> one<00:02:55.510> of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
yeah I believe the all at least one of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.080 
yeah I believe the all at least one of
the<00:02:55.780> pp<00:02:56.049> tanks<00:02:56.410> are<00:02:56.530> very<00:02:56.799> low<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.340> t1<00:02:57.819> has

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
the pp tanks are very low and the t1 has

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.880 
the pp tanks are very low and the t1 has
catch<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.750> baseborn<00:02:59.319> see<00:02:59.440> this<00:02:59.560> game<00:02:59.709> yeah

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
catch the baseborn see this game yeah

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.589 
catch the baseborn see this game yeah
exactly<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.400> don't<00:03:00.549> have<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:00.970> split<00:03:01.269> up<00:03:01.329> and

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
exactly so don't have to split up and

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.660 
exactly so don't have to split up and
see<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.049> playing<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.709> very<00:03:03.099> very<00:03:03.190> well

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
see this is playing that very very well

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.550 
see this is playing that very very well
so<00:03:03.970> solid<00:03:04.660> when<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.930> comes<00:03:05.109> to<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.349> actual

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
so solid when it comes to the actual

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.500 
so solid when it comes to the actual
confrontation<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.790> mind<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.209> it's<00:03:07.359> still

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
confrontation and mind you it's still

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.300 
confrontation and mind you it's still
going<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.660> be<00:03:07.720> tight<00:03:07.959> though<00:03:08.170> okay<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.739> one<00:03:09.099> of

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
going to be tight though okay and one of

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.920 
going to be tight though okay and one of
the<00:03:09.459> tier<00:03:09.700> eights<00:03:09.849> yeah<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.180> believe<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.630> was

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the tier eights yeah I believe that was

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.830 
the tier eights yeah I believe that was
a<00:03:11.139> neat<00:03:11.380> o<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.709> fall<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.760> PvP<00:03:13.299> side<00:03:13.569> so

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
a neat o to fall on the PvP side so

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.150 
a neat o to fall on the PvP side so
we're<00:03:13.989> coming<00:03:14.230> with<00:03:14.319> me<00:03:14.500> tied<00:03:14.709> up<00:03:14.739> slight

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
we're coming with me tied up slight

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.309 
we're coming with me tied up slight
advantage<00:03:15.419> actually<00:03:16.419> going<00:03:16.599> in<00:03:16.750> favor<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.079> him

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
advantage actually going in favor of him

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.039 
advantage actually going in favor of him
yeah<00:03:17.709> for<00:03:17.889> PvP<00:03:18.220> because<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.849> two<00:03:19.359> of<00:03:19.599> them<00:03:19.989> you

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
yeah for PvP because of two of them you

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.339 
yeah for PvP because of two of them you
know<00:03:20.139> wisely<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.130> Mesa<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:22.019> retreating<00:03:23.019> those

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
know wisely the Mesa is retreating those

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.319 
know wisely the Mesa is retreating those
he<00:03:23.560> needs<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:24.010> stay<00:03:24.220> alive<00:03:24.519> to<00:03:24.760> keep<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> edge

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
he needs to stay alive to keep the edge

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.720 
he needs to stay alive to keep the edge
on<00:03:25.540> actually<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.560> know<00:03:26.650> sort<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.280> retreat

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
and then come back to recapture the base

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.080 
and then come back to recapture the base
because<00:03:30.040> you're<00:03:30.220> still<00:03:30.400> like<00:03:30.549> six<00:03:30.790> minutes

left pretty much and the fact that Lisa
is<00:03:32.950> still<00:03:33.190> alive<00:03:33.430> might<00:03:33.790> turn<00:03:34.060> things<00:03:34.299> around

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
about a thousand so yeah pretty much

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.819

two shots away from dying like possibly
36<00:04:01.099> hours<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.640> day<00:04:01.819> so<00:04:01.879> yeah<00:04:02.180> at<00:04:02.390> least<00:04:02.569> we<00:04:02.720> shot

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
36 hours a day so yeah at least we shot

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.899 
36 hours a day so yeah at least we shot
but<00:04:03.620> at<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.890> same<00:04:04.099> time<00:04:04.340> like<00:04:04.579> yeah<00:04:04.730> because

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
but at the same time like yeah because

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.059 
but at the same time like yeah because
Nisa<00:04:05.269> is<00:04:05.480> still<00:04:05.690> alive<00:04:05.930> that's<00:04:06.319> a<00:04:06.560> deterrent

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
Nisa is still alive that's a deterrent

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.350 
Nisa is still alive that's a deterrent
as<00:04:07.220> well<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.549> mean<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:07.879> that<00:04:07.909> that's<00:04:08.239> a

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
as well I mean like that that's a

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.949 
as well I mean like that that's a
non-negligible<00:04:08.870> advantage<00:04:09.170> of<00:04:09.920> for<00:04:10.400> the

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
non-negligible advantage of for the

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.809 
non-negligible advantage of for the
insidious<00:04:11.959> side<00:04:12.290> so<00:04:12.620> if<00:04:12.829> they<00:04:12.980> negotiate<00:04:13.609> this

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
insidious side so if they negotiate this

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.339 
insidious side so if they negotiate this
to<00:04:14.000> perfection<00:04:14.510> they<00:04:14.629> might<00:04:14.840> still<00:04:15.109> turn<00:04:15.260> this

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
to perfection they might still turn this

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.009 
to perfection they might still turn this
around<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.010> for<00:04:16.910> some<00:04:17.150> reason<00:04:17.180> on<00:04:17.539> my<00:04:17.630> map<00:04:17.870> it

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
around and for some reason on my map it

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.620 
around and for some reason on my map it
shows<00:04:18.320> they're<00:04:18.590> like<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.769> third<00:04:19.130> tank<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.850> that

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
shows they're like a third tank on that

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.500 
shows they're like a third tank on that
said<00:04:20.840> that's<00:04:20.989> an<00:04:21.079> area<00:04:21.250> bug<00:04:22.250> ya<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:23.060> is<00:04:23.090> a<00:04:23.210> bug

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
said that's an area bug ya it is a bug

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.990 
said that's an area bug ya it is a bug
definitely<00:04:24.110> no<00:04:24.440> one<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.949> left<00:04:25.160> alive<00:04:25.639> like<00:04:25.910> you
