 hi hi friends with you again 877 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.509
 today I received such a parcel 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:15.809
 ordered on ebay that did not open 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.740
 in theory it should be some 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.520
 probably but i'm not sure but now 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.520
 we'll see 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:51.739
 before that he showed this 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:59.640
 boxes come 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:05.180
 martini sharpies choy saint 1928 most 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.960
 a sharp choice is actually such a design 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:14.670
 here is some information about 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:20.659
 maker of their shadow in finland here 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.110
 flag way further here 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:28.460
 here are some obscure languages already 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 last information to english 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.320
 written to press or made 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.200
 Finland since 1928 to establish from 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:49.619
 factories 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:51.490
 martini in general just like that but the story 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.729
 firms 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:06.250
 That means here, too, on the incomprehensible 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:09.759
 here nothing is revealed to the language 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:29.310
 here inside is still shocked shockproof 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:34.360
 a bag so here's a bit dusty 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.720
 This case is so small 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.590
 why is it hara pins here the most 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.100
 Of course you buy everything there did not pass 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.580
 the store, of course, is even cheaper 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:52.660
 Now the quality of the production here 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.970
 you can immediately see yes again some 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.890
 problems with focusing need to be very 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.880
 good patio that is seen driving 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.910
 some fight here are the tracks 1 2 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.910
 all this shows that the production defect 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.540
 here is written martini finland logo 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:28.410
 right here with such a soft plastic 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.210
 I can see how well he bend I realized 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.380
 on the belt can be mounted 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:38.640
 but I don't think it's such a good thing. 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:44.640
 mount yes because it needs a belt 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:49.410
 take off the dress to wear and actually 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:54.380
 look knife itself here he is here now 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:58.650
 some kind of here it is generally not clear 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.810
 see what a disaster is all here 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.800
 yourself 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.800
 yes here it is 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:18.150
 Frame mirror polished 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.859
 audi dollars in general is not processed now 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.120
 what video is it black with some 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:29.650
 spots but I do not know this is probably 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.300
 the model has long been true specifically so 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:38.430
 done that is i don't think that is 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.430
 here is the defect 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:52.879
 This is rubber This is plastic 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.879
 all the tires under the handle here such 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:05:01.099
 Beautiful wished type here such here 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.099
 visible surface 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.360
 Well that is it is a knife that's 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:16.450
 a series of all sorts of things could be mine which 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:20.270
 you have already shown a lesson on 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:23.410
 blades are almost identical in sight 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.020
 not much difference in the covers and in 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.740
 the handle here was a case and that 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.740
 there was a mount 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:58.300
 friend cuts sure 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.690
 turns 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.820
 that is, basically anything that's what this 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.590
 then just show what kind of knife this 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.940
 March 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:39.190
 if someone suddenly interested here and not 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.490
 think about buying that is how it is 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.430
