00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 my evening friends with you natasha for stone 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.870
 and i have 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.019
 evening and now i would like to again 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.469
 talk to you about the plan 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.590
 security and comfort plan 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.949
 security 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 this is when you are not worried about where you will find 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.800
 money tomorrow to pay bills for what 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.199
 buy money and kids shoes or not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 it doesn't bother you that something has come to you 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.640
 tapping in the car here it is 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.820
 fairly high degree of security 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.660
 after that we will want to move smoothly 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.210
 comfort 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.910
 but where do you actually start if 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.250
 vote for the fact that yes of course we are 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.760
 want to 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.340
 first you need to decide what 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.200
 income you have now and what size 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 passive income you need in order 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.989
 not to be afraid of losing your job and not 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.449
 afraid of losing your business then you 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.090
 should know your financial position then 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.699
 have find out how much money will give you 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.880
 in order to start your 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.260
 investment package 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.720
 need to try to take from the bank 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.909
 maximum amount of money for rent 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.610
 just for rent because for them we 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.260
 we will pay every month 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.480
 jar but 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.360
 very carefully pick up the object 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.100
 real estate for renting 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:30.460
 and after paying from this lease all 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.790
 necessary payments to the tax bank 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.970
 utilities you don't care 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.630
 will remain a decent income is it possible 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.670
 think you imagine yes 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.460
 Naturally when I picked up the object in 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.330
 Holland I was counting on that 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.700
 this delta 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.920
 then I already knew what to look for 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.740
 these are the objects already in germany we 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.600
 found the right ones when we arrived in 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.250
 Russia to many said no well what are you 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.540
 so it does not work well, let's take and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.570
 2-room apartment 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.670
 rent out if the apartment is a mortgage 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.250
 then we will transfer everything to the bank 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.320
 rental money it turned out 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.810
 wrong on the market 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.510
 a lot of very interesting 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.660
 properties that create 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.420
 here is this delta and to prove it 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.970
 there is a huge amount of success stories 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.640
 my students and I now know for sure that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.660
 there is such a property on the market which 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.360
 creates a very decent income next 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.700
 step is by buying this property to bring 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.010
 her to the mind that is to make her very 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.170
 highly demanded in the market what is 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.540
 demand in the market it means to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.670
 you line up people to 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.830
 rent this property from you 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.709
 what do you need them to line up to you 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.380
 what you need to know what these people want something 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.470
 there is a need to understand the trend very clearly 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.700
 the market at a certain point that is here 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.250
 for example if you start 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.530
 investing now you need to understand 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.570
 what is the trend in the market right now and 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.400
 then you need to know how this trend 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.870
 track because it changes 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.950
 almost every six months then you 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 need to know how very fast 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.680
 bring your property that state 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.180
 when she will answer all 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.879
 requirements of your potential 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.519
 tenants and at the same time need not 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.560
 spend a lot on repairs because 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.730
 that huge expenses for repairs can 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.400
 negate your efforts to create 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.640
 passive income well imagine you 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.650
 planned a small budget 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.810
 He spent his money you did not have you 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.090
 need to finish real estate about building 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.720
 idle there is no here on this we will not go 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 so you need to make repairs in record 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.890
 terms minimum investor repair 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.989
 This is a separate topic for conversation and 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.470
 keep the framework of your intended 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.799
 budget and then you need to agree with 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.099
 potential tenants and settle 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.010
 them in your apartment or in your studio or in 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.989
 your room is even more interesting if 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.510
 your commercial property and then 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.480
 you need to negotiate with a businessman 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.150
 which will shoot your commercial 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.010
 real estate in this too there are a few 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.889
 your tricks need to know 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.360
 negotiation technique and 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.210
 be sure to carefully draw up 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.130
 contract and check it well and have a lawyer 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.610
 when you have finally passed all these 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.020
 stages and settled tenants in this 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.490
 moment your property 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.919
 began to bring you the long-awaited income and 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.310
 from that moment she started already 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.520
 put your pocket money and that means you 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.940
 gradually began to turn into 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.260
 investors and after a while 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.450
 the number of your objects will become 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.300
 sufficient for your passive 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.180
 income from real estate covered 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.129
 your monthly expenses and then you 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.709
 get into the security zone 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.289
 about how to grow your investment 

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:10.929
 package and walk to the comfort zone 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.679
 worth talking then when you already 

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:17.169
 created a primary passive income 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:19.959
