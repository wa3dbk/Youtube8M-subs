00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970
 in this video tutorial I'll show you how 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.970
 write windows 7 on a regular blank 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.759
 9p in advise buying erase and therefore 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.289
 that so far there is no experience and this video will be for 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.140
 teapots so if anything goes on so 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.289
 so that the disc can be erased 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:29.090
 so i have been writing along with you taking 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.090
 I insert a disk into the disk drive 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.510
 further we will record through 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.129
 ultraiso program 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 i already have a windows 7 image you have 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.089
 there may I download under this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.510
 video posting only link to 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:02.110
 program because the family is very much 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.360
 weighs old and a download image means 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:11.170
 downloaded the image before the inserted disk 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:15.780
 open the ultraiso here to open 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.710
 what yellow folder will i be my way 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 I will look for my image 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.630
 and you're there its where we have there and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 vision 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:36.030
 I chose my image open here means 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.030
 she unpacked further what we do 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.710
 to whom how 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.100
 But it is not 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.100
 so this too 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.600
 also 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.099
 hike yes conducted on through naira because 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.400
 that this program is again a principle 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:22.959
 calculated that is, through a USB flash drive 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:31.950
 write well but I have to 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:35.769
 principle on equal let us through it yes 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.970
 Okay, then we will write one 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.970
 the program still can not do 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.319
 will have shorter 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.520
 I just now drive the question is pulled out 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.520
 connect it try so here 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:12.010
 then try as the drive 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.810
 reconnect now 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.760
 I got a drive I put 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:23.100
 disconnected opened again not 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.100
 ultraiso now the same image I opened my 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:32.170

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.780
 ultraiso this daddy is so yellow 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.880

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.630

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.930

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:23.199
 Now wait for the record as well, that's a record 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.740
 windows 7 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:32.680
 it ends here 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:34.479
 record ended waiting for the idea 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:40.240
