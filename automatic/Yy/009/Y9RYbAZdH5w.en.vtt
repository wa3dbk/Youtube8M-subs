00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you can see from the box there you can

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
you can see from the box there you can
set<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.170> shortcuts<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.890> either

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
set up little shortcuts you can either

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.289 
set up little shortcuts you can either
set<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.490> own<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.270> choose

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
set up your own one or you can choose

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.319 
set up your own one or you can choose
from<00:02:00.920> one<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.460> pre<00:02:02.670> ones<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.180> now<00:02:03.299> I

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
from one of the the pre ones and now I

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.090 
from one of the the pre ones and now I
just<00:02:03.479> use<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.350> right<00:02:04.530> handed<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.979> I'll<00:02:05.070> use

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
just use I'm right handed so I'll use

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.310 
just use I'm right handed so I'll use
the<00:02:05.369> right<00:02:05.549> command<00:02:05.850> key<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the right command key and I think that

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.830 
the right command key and I think that
works<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:08.069> well<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:09.569> when<00:02:09.720> you're

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
works really well and then when you're

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.050 
works really well and then when you're
