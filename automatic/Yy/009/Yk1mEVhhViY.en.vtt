 I did it with shift that helped me 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.370
 quite the idea and all that was mine but 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.920
 well I was telling him and we were going 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.350
 He told me everything about the wool and 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.120
 it was pretty good at the end and well there 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 the waterfall that vicens the middle leads 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.390
 some rooms that we have below 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.700
 each one to position to have 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.490
 our room and well let's 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.010
 teach today in the pixel art is worth 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.550
 is very very very currado as you see it is 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.640
 a wenger 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.350
 that is very but very cool is for 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.580
 those who do not know is a pokÃ©mon 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.450
 and if you think about it we are in the mayoral 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.619
 the xbox then here there is no way 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.540
 creative here not being able to fly here not 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.460
 you can do command or nothing here 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.670
 it's just everything by hand going up 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.130
 have bucket a bucket unhappiness lot and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.140
 all the time yes and you see that the equally 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.659
 is all the ground flattened or is that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.350
 He has brought us a lot of work and go 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.380
 me then why that as you see 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.710
 three colors I think they are 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.210
 then you have to think that to have it 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.509
 made with so few colors 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.060
 we carry colors but purple of that 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.670
 tone because it only takes that I hope that 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.310
 It takes a lot of work so good 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.340
 I guess we will upload more pixels than 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.800

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.099
