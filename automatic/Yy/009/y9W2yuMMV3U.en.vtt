00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 his need for points and Parisians and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.960
 the lyonnais tonight the entrance of the two 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.010
 teams on the gerland lawn for 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.010
 this lyon paris saint germain 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.800
 and there was much talk of the fans 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.160
 during the whole football club channel 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.200
 around them hervé mathoux we had a 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.060
 little distressed also his displacement of 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.240
 Parisian fans here at a gerland 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.890
 the baths a priori no problem 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.530
 in any case reported at the turn of gerland 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.720
 where in the streets of lyon face for 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.820
 the first point of this evening that in 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.580
 will have other oils will have nothing changed 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.879
 claude was a second tab are the 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.559
 languages I already speak he believes at will 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.780
 from body parts to paris 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.440
 saint-germain 10th minute 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.420
 mevlut erding I do not know who it is 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.360
 takes first post sea 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 exactly and that's the efficiency that has 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.150
 missed in paris saint germain face 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.189
 big this season 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.390
 what opportunities for the first 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.000
 post is still the most 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.380
 simple is kallstrom and govou who 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.119
 occupied the castrum area the pole 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.340
 govou the area he looks who's who 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.240
 will eventually stung her price there 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.680
 are taken they are more I have 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 the impression by the appeal of this land 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.310
 initially they are all obsessed with the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.920
 by English it's 50 to look at me 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.149
 not what happens in their backs and they 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.190
 are taken speed by the man 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.509
 one of the fit men and he is 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.850
 the man in the shape of paris saint-germain 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.600
 third goal in four games during 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.899
 both sides used abroad 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.899
 the forges 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.510
 kim him 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.400
 so we have more time 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.350
 in any case of all he does that of 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.350
 way to maternity haegen 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.540
 by the way anyway 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.000
 communication at the referee level 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.980
 christophe at first he has 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.610
 said we let play after 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.610
 a little weird 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.610
 keep to any contract just a 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.180
 very simple movement from 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.819
 gomis and three defenders for a single 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.819
 Lyon not enough to not precise 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.140
 enough duel boy who is strong 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's an obvious then 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.930
 Mr. Kalt at the Mas Dieu look at his 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.430
 assistant we really had 20 meters 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.320
 of race was what to know if there 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.240
 had in play the departure of gomis 8 on 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.470
 this situation well done there I think 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.090
 that it is under this situation their game 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.290
 right off the bat I think the life of 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.310
 touch has seen very well that they respond 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.310
 I beat body pearls 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.230
 watch this plot 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.360
 2 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.360
 here it's way too much Parisians 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.940
 and on a corner I have the impression 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.860
 is a little forgetfulness even when beyond 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.810
 of the Parisian defense mclean who 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.819
 supplie the umbrella alone in the second 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.610
 post a new feat two of theirs 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.230
 and that is not enough 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.640
 and n forget just oblivion 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.010
 name of the new year look not what's 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.840
 pass in his back and like to match 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.080
 to go it is bafé gomis who comes 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.080
 equalize 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.720
 in tenths 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.720
 this season in league 1 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.780
 there is time left on it remains 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.820
 time for an early reversal there has been 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.820
 three occasions a head up close 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.130
 2 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.140
 Warning 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.640
 we'll have to settle for the party 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.580
 and I do not know by what conquest they 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.140
 can leave the Lyonnais in all 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.840
 case progress towards the vendée challans said 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.580
 their march forward 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.660
 and like that even if a little bit of 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.460
 success and because I think that's 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.300
 balloon departure it is not distributed to 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.800
 alice toklas a good deviation so 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.110
 for one is edel is what a whole 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.110
 little bit advanced is to anticipate
