00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
and you do want to keep the application

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.699 
and you do want to keep the application
light<00:02:11.299> here<00:02:11.629> so<00:02:11.659> it<00:02:11.959> will<00:02:12.019> make<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.319> easier<00:02:12.650> to

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
light here so it will make it easier to

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.759 
light here so it will make it easier to
blend<00:02:12.920> away<00:02:13.220> at<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.610> end<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:14.810> taking<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
blend away at the end then taking the

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.949 
blend away at the end then taking the
Mac<00:02:15.920> 239<00:02:16.340> brush<00:02:16.640> looks<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.540> I'm<00:02:17.780> going

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
Mac 239 brush looks like that I'm going

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.710 
Mac 239 brush looks like that I'm going

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.800 
time that is what dark horse looks like
and<00:02:44.640> I'm<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.909> apply<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.689> outer

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.180 

and<00:03:00.569> then<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.900> come<00:03:01.080> back<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.500> blend<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
and then when you come back to blend it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.250 
and then when you come back to blend it
into<00:03:02.390> half-baked<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.780> want<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.020> tap<00:03:04.230> it

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
into half-baked you just want to tap it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.559 
into half-baked you just want to tap it
along<00:03:04.650> where<00:03:04.890> they<00:03:05.040> meet<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.640> eventually

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
along where they meet and eventually

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.440 
along where they meet and eventually
they'll<00:03:06.750> blend<00:03:07.020> back<00:03:07.170> together<00:03:07.620> just<00:03:08.040> so

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
they'll blend back together just so

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.120 
they'll blend back together just so
nicely<00:03:09.450> next<00:03:10.350> I'm<00:03:10.560> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.709> take<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:10.950> thing

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
nicely next I'm going to take this thing

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.390 
nicely next I'm going to take this thing
my<00:03:11.340> e30<00:03:11.910> pencil<00:03:12.030> brush<00:03:12.480> got<00:03:13.290> hair<00:03:13.590> on<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:14.040> go

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
my e30 pencil brush got hair on it go

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.449 
my e30 pencil brush got hair on it go
back<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:15.000> buck<00:03:15.600> that's<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:16.860> buck<00:03:17.160> looks

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
back with buck that's what buck looks

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.479 
back with buck that's what buck looks
like<00:03:18.530> I'm<00:03:19.530> going<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.739> take<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> little<00:03:20.160> bit<00:03:20.340> of

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
like I'm going to take a little bit of

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.840 
like I'm going to take a little bit of
this<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.970> go<00:03:21.209> along<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.569> edges<00:03:21.959> here<00:03:22.850> where

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
this and go along the edges here where

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.960 
this and go along the edges here where
everything<00:03:24.420> needs<00:03:24.450> naked<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.520> just<00:03:26.520> blend<00:03:26.850> it

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
everything needs naked and just blend it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:36.620 
everything needs naked and just blend it
along<00:03:33.680> so<00:03:34.680> my<00:03:34.830> only<00:03:35.190> gripe<00:03:35.550> with<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.000> Naked

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
along so my only gripe with the Naked

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.020 
along so my only gripe with the Naked
palette<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.709> they<00:03:37.950> didn't<00:03:38.310> include<00:03:38.820> a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
palette is that they didn't include a

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.330 
palette is that they didn't include a
very<00:03:39.330> nice<00:03:39.630> Brown<00:03:40.760> neutral<00:03:41.760> matte<00:03:42.470> shade<00:03:43.470> to

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
very nice Brown neutral matte shade to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.830 
very nice Brown neutral matte shade to
blend<00:03:44.370> out<00:03:44.819> some<00:03:45.330> of<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.630> great

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
blend out some of the really great

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.470 
blend out some of the really great
colors<00:03:46.290> in<00:03:46.470> here<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.310> I'm<00:03:47.700> not<00:03:47.760> going<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.209> rely

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
colors in here so I'm not going to rely

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.290 
colors in here so I'm not going to rely
on<00:03:48.510> my<00:03:48.959> blender<00:03:49.470> from<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.459> Naked<00:03:50.790> palette<00:03:50.819> if

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
on my blender from the Naked palette if

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.540 
on my blender from the Naked palette if
you<00:03:51.480> wanted<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.470> could<00:03:52.709> very<00:03:52.980> easily<00:03:53.040> use

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
you wanted to you could very easily use

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.150 
you wanted to you could very easily use
virgin<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.780> blend<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.170> up<00:03:55.230> here<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.860> would<00:03:56.130> be

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
virgin to blend that up here it would be

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.550 
virgin to blend that up here it would be
beautiful<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.239> would<00:03:57.360> work<00:03:57.540> perfectly<00:03:58.019> but

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560
