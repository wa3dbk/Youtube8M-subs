00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:03.619 

all<00:00:02.669> right<00:00:02.790> so<00:00:02.879> we're<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> construct

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
all right so we're going to construct

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.530 
all right so we're going to construct
the<00:00:03.750> centroid<00:00:04.259> here<00:00:04.500> of<00:00:04.620> triangle<00:00:05.069> ABC<00:00:05.940> and

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
the centroid here of triangle ABC and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.990 
the centroid here of triangle ABC and
since<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.500> know<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> centroid<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.370> where<00:00:08.610> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
since we know the centroid is where the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.140 
since we know the centroid is where the
medians<00:00:09.420> intersect<00:00:10.340> we<00:00:11.340> basically<00:00:11.730> need<00:00:12.120> to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
medians intersect we basically need to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.540 
medians intersect we basically need to
find<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:13.080> midpoints<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.009> two<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:15.179> these<00:00:15.330> sides

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
find the midpoints of two of these sides

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.370 
find the midpoints of two of these sides
okay<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.480> we're<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> use

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
okay so to do that we're going to use

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.279 
okay so to do that we're going to use
the<00:00:19.560> same<00:00:19.830> construction<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.640> perpendicular

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
the same construction as perpendicular

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.689 
the same construction as perpendicular
bisector<00:00:22.289> because<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> bisector<00:00:23.519> goes

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
bisector because the bisector goes

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.939 
bisector because the bisector goes
through<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> midpoint<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> let's<00:00:25.800> go<00:00:25.890> ahead

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
through the midpoint so let's go ahead

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.630 
through the midpoint so let's go ahead
and<00:00:26.099> find<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.699> midpoint<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.050> B<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.550> so<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
and find the midpoint of a B here so you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
and find the midpoint of a B here so you
open<00:00:29.849> your<00:00:29.939> compass<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.599> more<00:00:30.779> than<00:00:30.900> half<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
open your compass to more than half the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.250 
open your compass to more than half the
distance<00:00:36.530> draw<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.739> arc<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.780> then

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
distance draw one arc there and then

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.869 
distance draw one arc there and then
using<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> same<00:00:40.829> compass<00:00:41.190> measure<00:00:41.460> from

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
using the same compass measure from

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.560 
using the same compass measure from
point<00:00:42.270> B<00:00:42.950> if<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.040> draw<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> same<00:00:44.520> arc

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.110 

then<00:00:52.570> we<00:00:52.660> want<00:00:52.810> to<00:00:52.870> draw<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.500> line<00:00:54.120> through

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
then we want to draw the line through

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:13.890 
then we want to draw the line through
the<00:00:55.150> two<00:00:55.420> intersections<00:00:56.079> of<00:00:56.260> our<00:00:56.380> arc

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.160 

we'll<00:01:14.440> just<00:01:14.590> call<00:01:14.800> this<00:01:14.920> point<00:01:15.190> P<00:01:15.870> so<00:01:16.870> we<00:01:17.050> know

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
we'll just call this point P so we know

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.280 
we'll just call this point P so we know
that<00:01:17.320> P<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.610> midpoint<00:01:18.790> of<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:20.070> B<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:26.140> now

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
that P is the midpoint of a B so now

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.690 
that P is the midpoint of a B so now
when<00:01:26.470> we<00:01:26.620> look<00:01:26.830> at<00:01:26.920> this

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.929 

here's<00:01:34.299> one<00:01:34.659> median<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:36.580> triangle<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.909> we

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
here's one median of the triangle so we

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.730 
here's one median of the triangle so we
know<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.270> centroid<00:01:40.840> has<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.170> lie<00:01:41.320> somewhere

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
know the centroid has to lie somewhere

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.990 
know the centroid has to lie somewhere
on<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.820> median<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.520> now<00:01:45.610> we're<00:01:45.700> going<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.850> do

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
on this median so now we're going to do

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.030 
on this median so now we're going to do
is<00:01:46.210> also<00:01:46.930> find<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.229> midpoint<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.740> another

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
is also find the midpoint of another

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.389 
is also find the midpoint of another
side<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.720> can<00:01:49.869> just<00:01:50.080> say<00:01:50.289> like<00:01:50.619> BC<00:01:53.039> so<00:01:54.039> we<00:01:54.159> open

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
side we can just say like BC so we open

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.480 
side we can just say like BC so we open
up<00:01:54.460> our<00:01:54.640> compass<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.149> more<00:01:55.299> than<00:01:55.420> half<00:01:59.250> we<00:02:00.250> draw

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
up our compass to more than half we draw

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.559 
up our compass to more than half we draw
one<00:02:00.729> arc<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:03.369> point<00:02:04.299> B<00:02:05.940> then<00:02:06.940> using<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> same

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
one arc from point B then using the same

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.500 
one arc from point B then using the same
radius<00:02:08.519> draw<00:02:09.519> an<00:02:09.610> arc<00:02:09.789> from<00:02:10.149> Point<00:02:10.420> C<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:13.360> gets

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
radius draw an arc from Point C it gets

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.479 
radius draw an arc from Point C it gets
to<00:02:13.630> be<00:02:13.750> quite<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:14.019> few<00:02:14.260> lines<00:02:14.500> here<00:02:14.680> but<00:02:15.069> just

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
to be quite a few lines here but just

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.370 
to be quite a few lines here but just
have<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:18.299> try<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.360> focus<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.019> see<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
have to try to focus so you can see the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:34.440 
have to try to focus so you can see the
two<00:02:24.900> intersections<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.140> arc<00:02:26.350> there

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.380 

okay<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.560> draw<00:02:35.890> this<00:02:36.040> bisector<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:37.209> now

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
okay so we draw this bisector we now

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.650 
okay so we draw this bisector we now
have<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.810> midpoint<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.410> BC<00:02:39.209> I'll<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.360> label

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
have the midpoint of BC I'll just label

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.580 
have the midpoint of BC I'll just label
that<00:02:40.690> point<00:02:40.810> Q

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.180 

and<00:02:48.680> now<00:02:49.400> we're<00:02:50.060> going<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.239> draw<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.420> midpoint

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
and now we're going to draw the midpoint

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:01.690 
and now we're going to draw the midpoint
from<00:02:52.190> our<00:02:52.340> vertex<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:55.220> median<00:02:55.610> sorry<00:03:00.700> okay

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
from our vertex a the median sorry okay

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.460 
from our vertex a the median sorry okay
now<00:03:02.209> if<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.360> look<00:03:02.510> at<00:03:02.599> this<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:03.080> really

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
now if you look at this is not really

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.240 
now if you look at this is not really
necessary<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.190> draw<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:05.209> median<00:03:05.920> from<00:03:06.920> point

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
necessary to draw the median from point

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.400 
necessary to draw the median from point
B<00:03:07.459> because<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.480> know<00:03:08.630> all<00:03:08.660> three<00:03:09.080> medians

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
B because we know all three medians

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.009 
B because we know all three medians
intersect<00:03:09.590> in<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.099> same<00:03:10.340> point<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.630> right

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
intersect in the same point so right

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.070 
intersect in the same point so right
here<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:14.720> have<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.080> centroid<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:17.080> our

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
here we have the centroid of our

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.530 
here we have the centroid of our
triangle
