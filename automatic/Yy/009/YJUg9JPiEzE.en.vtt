 I wanted to participate in this edition 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.630
 of the master's degree in motorcycle engineering from 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:15.250
 race to implement knowledge 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.049
 theoretical to my practical knowledge 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.729
 matured in five years of work 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.499
 in the motor sport it was 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.289

 to this master and like the real pilots 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 of the motorcycle gp regardless of the bike 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.760
 closed by the possibilities you have of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.050
 win the race or not when you are 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.540
 on the starting line 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.520
 you are all so we all start with it 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.170
 same goal to be able to do the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.600
 his passion is a way of doing business 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.209
 to be heroes but above all one 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.480
 chooses as how to be a hero to his 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.480
 way 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.530
 that is, I started at the end of the years 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.890
 2000 with directly with the 125 I have not 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.600
 never made the minibikes and I must say that the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.200
 passion my father had 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.900
 broadcast has started to run and a lot 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.680
 important motogp not just work 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.660
 on the bike 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.400
 let's never parallel work on you 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.020
 same as how to improve the style of 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.690
 guide how to always improve the 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.690
 performance and capabilities here 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.840
 the racetrack is the home of this one 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.080
 passion the door ahead is so committed 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.000
 like you today who study that there 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.840
 always apply to improve it some 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.220
 it is a science that if for 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.950
 evolution is that of the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.570
 mechanics of the competition 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.240
 you came here dedicating part of the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.210
 your life and you all got here 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.460
 driven by the same reason the passion 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.870
 you have finished master but now I have 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.380
 started but defined 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.380
 started towards 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.090
 during this season you teachers there 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.890
 you have taught excellence 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.710
 sharing your fruit experiences 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.430
 of years of success and work 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:07.640
 difficulty I found myself very well in 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.990
 how I was in contact with people who 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.200
 they had the same level as me 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.600
 passion was the most beautiful experience 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.930
 who ever did educational level 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.540
 the students who followed the course 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.750
 this comes from the north and south Italy 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.530
 testifies to the passion of our country 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.530
 on the bikes 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.910
 what an engineer can choose 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:42.790
 that you have to get your hands dirty 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.740
 the goal is to be able to give 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.050
 the maximum of information that you can 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.850
 to the engineers to make a motorcycle 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.880
 competitive after the practice session 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.560
 anyway, he can ask guys 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.900
 what do you want to change on the bike 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.880
 what you counted well what it takes for 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.830
 that circuit what not to have a good one 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.650
 tester for a fundamental thing for 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.910
 to develop it motion must establish a 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.479
 good relationship with him 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.440
 try to make the most of it for 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.440
 indications that can give us 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.970
 we hope this master has 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.580
 represented for all a moment of

 over the years we also hope 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.229
 that knowledge and skills 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.570

 part of the students of history 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.259
 edition of the master's degree in engineering of the
