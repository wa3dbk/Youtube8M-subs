00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:12.059
 today yes something big has happened 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.950
 and that big basin is gone like 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 you can see here is the again 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.550
 construction and cabinet as then 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.980
 Well filled the cupboard and over there 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.480
 is now the dazzle 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.730
 then we were again and for yesterday 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.610
 on the way and plundered and the many 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.880
 annoyed men seen there or 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.670
 goods issue no 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.690
 this cabinet fit perfectly with the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.780
 we have a little backwards 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:49.879
 are some extended looks exactly as 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 still built under it 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.010
 then we here even have the technology 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.920
 Seconds timer for the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 Dosieranlage then we want to order 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.500
 lamps control the electricity meter 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.220
 that is important and has to say i have 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.990
 since a 72 was the pool the one 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.470
 thing good with life can have down here 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.740
 I turn my dosing system and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.270
 Means will continue to give 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:30.750
 to keep the lime household up and 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.320
 Here I have everything in it now 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.320
 in the heart with 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.729
 but always partly here too 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 can see, for example, at the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.650
 Greens down here could be without superman 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.160
 or why exactly is strong I want 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.070
 I do not know the bridges 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.970
 come out very well or here 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.460
 behind the monti one sees this one 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.960
 Moments a bit crazy but you 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.050
 fought it very well get other 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.149
 new growth tips yes then we have 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.770
 lie down to my lap 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.500
 I really wanted to be ahead 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.250
 but she did not want to be there then she was 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.250
 I will not take that next morning 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.190
 As you can see that gets new mouths 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.190
 everywhere where these games are 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.760
 yes, we do not have more in it too 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:51.440
 not much more 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:59.120
 now it is the wish everything 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.120
 it is also a good overall picture here 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.300
 because at that time I want to be myself 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.300
 again
