00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
and see the hub point locations better

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.039 
and see the hub point locations better
we<00:00:11.820> go<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> first<00:00:15.389> place<00:00:15.750> we're<00:00:15.900> going<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
we go so the first place we're going to

visit<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.379> our<00:00:16.470> high<00:00:16.590> point<00:00:16.770> rotation<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.460> area

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
visit in our high point rotation is area

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
visit in our high point rotation is area
one<00:00:18.109> now<00:00:19.109> as<00:00:19.260> area<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.920> right<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.310> the

I've<00:00:45.360> spawned<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.870> towards<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.559> an

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
I've spawned like towards the for an

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.380 
I've spawned like towards the for an
area<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.399> I've<00:00:47.489> already<00:00:47.640> decided<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.270> I'm

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
area so I've already decided that I'm

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
decide to chop my shot char just to see

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.299 
decide to chop my shot char just to see
if<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.899> can<00:00:52.020> get<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> hit<00:00:52.350> marker<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.890> maybe<00:00:53.039> slow

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
if I can get a hit marker and maybe slow

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
if I can get a hit marker and maybe slow
some<00:00:53.489> people<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.719> manage<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.960> get

some people down and I do manage to get
a<00:00:55.170> hit<00:00:55.320> marker<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.800> I'll<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
a hit marker so I'll just do like a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
a hit marker so I'll just do like a
second<00:00:56.670> sake<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> man<00:00:57.809> should<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.199> guy

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
second sake and man should get that guy

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
second sake and man should get that guy
quite<00:00:58.620> easy<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> push<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.300> I'm

quite easy but I push on and I think I'm

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.700 
quite easy but I push on and I think I'm
gonna<00:01:00.570> check<00:01:00.780> his<00:01:00.870> shock<00:01:01.050> charge<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
gonna check his shock charge to get the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.139 
gonna check his shock charge to get the
guy<00:01:01.829> before<00:01:02.160> he<00:01:02.250> goes<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.699> half<00:01:02.879> point

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
guy before he goes in for the half point

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
guy before he goes in for the half point
but<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.629> miss<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> looks<00:01:04.470> like

well another snare you don't want to go

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.350 
well another snare you don't want to go
for<00:01:11.040> weeds<00:01:11.189> whoppin<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> spawn<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.240> at

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
for weeds whoppin if you spawn right at

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.520 
for weeds whoppin if you spawn right at
the<00:01:12.420> back<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.110> light<00:01:13.320> where

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the back and you don't have light where

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
the back and you don't have light where
are<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.950> extreme<00:01:14.280> conditioning<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
are like extreme conditioning to get you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.969 
are like extreme conditioning to get you
to<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> front<00:01:15.509> well<00:01:16.170> that's<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.560> happens<00:01:16.860> in

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
to the front well that's what happens in

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
to the front well that's what happens in
this<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.299> how

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
this one and there as you can see how

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.700 
this one and there as you can see how
don't<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.049> any<00:01:19.170> further<00:01:19.439> back

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
don't think I can get any further back

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440 
don't think I can get any further back
than<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.880> at<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.030> back<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
than this I'm right at the back with the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
than this I'm right at the back with the
rubbish<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> they're<00:01:22.380> looking<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> side

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
rubbish and they're looking at a side

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.200 
rubbish and they're looking at a side
view<00:01:23.009> although<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.520> doesn't<00:01:23.640> look<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> lot

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
view although it doesn't look like a lot

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
view although it doesn't look like a lot
of<00:01:24.270> distance<00:01:24.630> between<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.990> front<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> back

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
of distance between the front and back

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
of distance between the front and back
person<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.369> distance<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.060> make<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
person this distance can make all the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.670 
person this distance can make all the
difference<00:01:27.869> between<00:01:28.020> getting<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
difference between getting to the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
difference between getting to the
hardpoint<00:01:29.009> location<00:01:29.579> first<00:01:29.850> or<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.360> been

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
hardpoint location first or just been

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.030 
hardpoint location first or just been
that<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.110> bit<00:01:31.229> slow<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.590> walking<00:01:31.890> into

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that a little bit slow and walking into

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.890 
that a little bit slow and walking into
the<00:01:32.159> enemy's<00:01:32.430> bullets<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the enemy's bullets so what I do is if I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.210 
the enemy's bullets so what I do is if I
spawn<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.530> instead<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.950> going

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
spawn at the back instead of going

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069 
spawn at the back instead of going
forward<00:01:35.610> after<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.869> although

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
forward after and right and although

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.359 
forward after and right and although
it's<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> quickest<00:01:37.799> way<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it's not the quickest way to get to the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.440 
it's not the quickest way to get to the
half<00:01:38.549> point<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:39.000> least<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.270> me<00:01:39.360> not

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
half point at least you know me not

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.730 
half point at least you know me not
gonna<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.659> walking<00:01:39.780> into<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> enemies<00:01:40.590> or

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
gonna be walking into the enemies or

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.080 
gonna be walking into the enemies or
right<00:01:41.040> near<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> hardpoint<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.850> probably

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
right near the hardpoint and probably

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.490 
right near the hardpoint and probably
aiming<00:01:42.299> down<00:01:42.420> sights<00:01:42.750> waiting<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> take<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
aiming down sights waiting to take you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200 
aiming down sights waiting to take you
out<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.460> come<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.759> wedge<00:01:44.970> make

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
out but when you do come this wedge make

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.370 
out but when you do come this wedge make
sure<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.450> look<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> steps<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> right

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
sure you look at the steps on the right

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.420 
sure you look at the steps on the right
so<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.619> don't<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.860> shot<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> back<00:01:47.399> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so you don't get shot in the back of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.190 
so you don't get shot in the back of
your<00:01:47.640> off<00:01:47.729> into<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> hardpoint<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> because

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
your off into the hardpoint and because

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.480 
your off into the hardpoint and because
this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.470> really<00:01:49.649> small<00:01:49.799> hard<00:01:50.100> point<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
this is a really small hard point the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.830 
this is a really small hard point the
best<00:01:50.640> way<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.820> hold<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.210> down<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.689> not

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
best way to hold this down it's like not

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.999 
best way to hold this down it's like not
to<00:01:51.960> sit<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> corners<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.799> wait

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
to sit in one of the corners and wait

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.679 
to sit in one of the corners and wait
for<00:01:53.130> him<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.310> come<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.549> always<00:01:53.970> look<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
for him to come in always look out and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.819 
for him to come in always look out and
try<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.990> kill<00:01:55.140> them<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.380> they're<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> way

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
try and kill them as they're on the way

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289 
try and kill them as they're on the way
to<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> hard<00:01:56.280> point<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.880> find<00:01:57.060> that's<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to the hard point and just find that's a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.819 
to the hard point and just find that's a
lot<00:01:57.450> more<00:01:57.600> better<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> area<00:01:58.799> is

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
lot more better and because the area is

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.410 
lot more better and because the area is
so<00:01:58.979> small<00:01:59.250> any<00:01:59.490> more<00:01:59.670> than<00:01:59.820> two<00:01:59.969> people<00:02:00.149> in

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so small any more than two people in

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.580 
so small any more than two people in
there<00:02:00.600> just<00:02:00.689> gonna<00:02:00.899> make<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> easy<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.500> your

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
there just gonna make it easy for your

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.959 
there just gonna make it easy for your
enemies<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.280> double<00:02:02.549> kills<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
enemies to get like double kills and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.160 
enemies to get like double kills and
stuff<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.420> always<00:02:03.540> better<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> go<00:02:04.110> out

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
stuff so it's always better to go out

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.420 
stuff so it's always better to go out
and<00:02:04.290> patrol<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.619> perimeter<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.130> try<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.340> get

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and patrol the perimeter and try and get

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
and patrol the perimeter and try and get
him<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> way<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.030> Hat<00:02:06.180> point<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
him on the way to the Hat point and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.059 
him on the way to the Hat point and
that's<00:02:07.049> what<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.320> doing<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> wasn't<00:02:08.009> in

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that's what I was doing here I wasn't in

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.260 
that's what I was doing here I wasn't in
one<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> corners<00:02:08.670> waiting<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.119> him<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
one of the corners waiting for him I

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.699 
one of the corners waiting for him I
looked<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.629> managed<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.319> kill<00:02:10.500> two<00:02:10.530> people

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
looked out managed to kill two people

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
make it was the hardpoint so that's it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.300 
make it was the hardpoint so that's it
guys<00:02:19.050> that's<00:02:19.380> all<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> play<00:02:19.890> area<00:02:20.100> one

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
guys that's all I like to play area one

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.100 
guys that's all I like to play area one
and<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:20.880> we're<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.150> make<00:02:21.330> our<00:02:21.510> way<00:02:21.570> down<00:02:21.690> to

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
and now we're gonna make our way down to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.730 
and now we're gonna make our way down to
area<00:02:22.470> 2<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.170> see<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> next<00:02:25.620> head

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
area 2 and as you can see the next head

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.410 
area 2 and as you can see the next head
point<00:02:25.980> location<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.550> very<00:02:26.760> close<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.090> all<00:02:27.330> you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
point location is very close so all you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.700 
point location is very close so all you
have<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.600> do<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.780> go<00:02:27.930> down<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> steps<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
have to do is go down the steps and

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.900 
have to do is go down the steps and
that's<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.010> you're<00:02:29.130> pretty<00:02:29.220> much<00:02:29.460> there<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
that's it you're pretty much there and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.910 
that's it you're pretty much there and
just<00:02:30.510> quickly<00:02:30.660> mentioning<00:02:31.170> scorestreaks<00:02:31.800> now

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
just quickly mentioning scorestreaks now

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.230 
just quickly mentioning scorestreaks now
probably<00:02:32.130> s<00:02:32.370> support<00:02:32.670> scarf<00:02:32.910> streaks<00:02:33.150> that

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
probably s support scarf streaks that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.520 
probably s support scarf streaks that
going<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.540> effective<00:02:33.990> on<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.230> mountain

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
going to be effective on this mountain

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.780 
going to be effective on this mountain
just<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:34.890> each<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.490> point

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
just because each one the have point

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.400 
just because each one the have point
locations<00:02:36.270> has<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> roof<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.290> you're

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
locations has a roof on so you're

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.600 
locations has a roof on so you're
probably<00:02:37.500> best<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:38.070> with<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:38.460> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
probably best going with like the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.460 
probably best going with like the
Guardian<00:02:39.150> or<00:02:39.390> maybe<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> sentry<00:02:40.140> gun<00:02:40.170> and

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
Guardian or maybe the sentry gun and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.750 
Guardian or maybe the sentry gun and
that's<00:02:40.890> what<00:02:41.070> happens<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.520> managed<00:02:41.730> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
that's what happens here I managed to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.190 
that's what happens here I managed to
get<00:02:41.880> my<00:02:42.030> sentry<00:02:42.420> gun<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.020> put<00:02:43.140> in

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
get my sentry gun in there just put in

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.240 
get my sentry gun in there just put in
at<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.350> end<00:02:43.440> there<00:02:43.710> where<00:02:43.830> all<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> enemies

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
at the end there where all the enemies

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.740 
at the end there where all the enemies
are<00:02:44.340> gonna<00:02:44.490> flood<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> gonna<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.510> pretty

be<00:02:52.650> able<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.950> hold<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.190> down<00:02:53.310> effectively<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
be able to hold it down effectively and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.730 
be able to hold it down effectively and
another<00:02:54.720> main<00:02:54.930> point<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.440> can<00:02:55.590> utilize

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
another main point that you can utilize

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.290 
another main point that you can utilize
in<00:02:56.130> holding<00:02:56.490> down<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.730> High<00:02:56.850> Point<00:02:56.880> area

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
in holding down this High Point area

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.420 
in holding down this High Point area
like<00:02:57.930> these<00:02:58.080> bins<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.620> stick<00:02:58.950> out<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.250> can

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
like these bins that stick out you can

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.130 
like these bins that stick out you can
use<00:02:59.550> them<00:02:59.700> as<00:02:59.790> like<00:02:59.970> headglitching<00:03:00.390> spots<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
use them as like headglitching spots and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.840 
use them as like headglitching spots and
they<00:03:01.590> always<00:03:01.740> try<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.040> catch<00:03:02.310> people<00:03:02.670> like

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
they always try to catch people like

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.430 
they always try to catch people like
off-guard<00:03:03.209> they<00:03:03.450> think<00:03:03.690> I'm<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.050> corner

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
off-guard they think I'm in that corner

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.750 
off-guard they think I'm in that corner
so<00:03:04.470> they<00:03:04.680> come<00:03:04.860> in<00:03:04.950> here<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.160> kill<00:03:05.400> me<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.700> then

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
so they come in here to kill me and then

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.580 
so they come in here to kill me and then
I<00:03:05.910> rush<00:03:06.120> out<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.480> kill<00:03:06.690> them<00:03:06.900> self<00:03:07.200> catching

I rush out and kill them self catching

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.080 
I rush out and kill them self catching
them<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.740> mid<00:03:07.890> sprint<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.520> it's<00:03:08.850> such<00:03:09.000> an

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
them in mid sprint and it's such an

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.640 
them in mid sprint and it's such an
effective<00:03:09.450> tool<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.840> using<00:03:10.170> these<00:03:10.290> corners

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
effective tool just using these corners

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.080 
effective tool just using these corners
as<00:03:10.740> much<00:03:10.860> as<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.250> sometimes<00:03:11.700> going<00:03:11.970> in

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
as much as you can sometimes going in

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.280 
as much as you can sometimes going in
there<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.360> reload<00:03:12.660> or<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.110> need<00:03:13.260> to

there to reload or if you need to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.990 
there to reload or if you need to
flicker<00:03:13.650> see<00:03:13.860> far<00:03:14.100> out<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:14.910> so

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
flicker see far out it's just so

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.640 
flicker see far out it's just so
effective<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.630> one<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.110> use<00:03:16.230> quite<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.470> lot

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
effective and one that I use quite a lot

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.470 
effective and one that I use quite a lot
when<00:03:16.770> holding<00:03:17.070> down<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> Chad<00:03:17.519> point<00:03:17.790> so

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
when holding down the Chad point so

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.180 
when holding down the Chad point so
that's<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.840> like<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.050> play<00:03:19.170> area<00:03:19.440> -<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.010> now

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
that's all I like to play area - and now

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.150

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
we move on to area 3 and just a quick

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.140 
we move on to area 3 and just a quick
and<00:03:23.310> easy<00:03:23.400> way<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.610> getting<00:03:23.910> into<00:03:24.000> this

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
and easy way of getting into this

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.790 
and easy way of getting into this
building<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.630> just<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.840> jump<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.170> here<00:03:25.350> jump<00:03:25.680> on

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
building is just to jump on here jump on

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.710 
building is just to jump on here jump on
the<00:03:25.890> train<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.340> then<00:03:26.850> jump<00:03:27.120> into<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.480> top

the train and then jump into the top
side<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.140> building<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.769> also<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.220> might

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.039 
but it's a guy and I sort of have to
jump<00:03:44.670> up<00:03:44.790> pretty<00:03:45.030> quick<00:03:45.299> but<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.570> managed<00:03:45.989> to

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
jump up pretty quick but I managed to

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.570 
jump up pretty quick but I managed to
get<00:03:46.260> him<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:46.560> I'm<00:03:46.650> lucky<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.220> do<00:03:47.310> fall<00:03:47.549> off

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
get him but I'm lucky I just do fall off

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.430 
get him but I'm lucky I just do fall off
there<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.390> if<00:03:48.600> actually<00:03:48.870> look<00:03:49.019> at<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.230> hard

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
there and if actually look at that hard

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.990 
there and if actually look at that hard
point<00:03:49.709> north<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:50.070> one<00:03:50.250> second<00:03:50.700> where<00:03:50.880> we

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
point north of one second where we

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.130 
point north of one second where we
didn't<00:03:51.180> have<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.390> hard<00:03:51.570> points<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.959> thought

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
didn't have the hard points I thought

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.210 
didn't have the hard points I thought
was<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.290> pretty<00:03:52.410> good<00:03:52.650> crossover

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
was a pretty good crossover

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.160 
was a pretty good crossover
and<00:03:53.400> once<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.180> drive<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.390> teammate<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:54.959> there

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
and once you drive a teammate in there

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.240 
and once you drive a teammate in there
what<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.470> do<00:03:55.560> he<00:03:55.650> should<00:03:55.680> patrol<00:03:56.130> this

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
what you do he should patrol this

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.530 
what you do he should patrol this
perimeter<00:03:56.489> because<00:03:57.000> there's<00:03:57.180> only<00:03:57.239> three

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
perimeter because there's only three

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.880 
perimeter because there's only three
ways<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:57.930> you've<00:03:58.049> got<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.290> ladder<00:03:58.470> going<00:03:58.709> up

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
ways in you've got the ladder going up

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.810 
ways in you've got the ladder going up
and<00:03:59.070> then<00:03:59.160> you've<00:03:59.280> got<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.519> two<00:03:59.670> windows

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
and then you've got the two windows

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.150 
and then you've got the two windows
either<00:04:00.269> side<00:04:00.600> they're<00:04:01.380> just<00:04:01.590> focused<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:02.010> that

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
either side they're just focused on that

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.710 
either side they're just focused on that
window<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.700> just<00:04:02.850> go<00:04:03.060> around<00:04:03.150> from<00:04:03.540> left

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
window so you just go around from left

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.150 
window so you just go around from left
to<00:04:03.780> right<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.200> catch<00:04:04.410> him<00:04:04.530> off<00:04:04.620> guard<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.040> get

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
to right and catch him off guard and get

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.770 
to right and catch him off guard and get
the<00:04:05.220> easy<00:04:05.370> kills<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.000> although<00:04:06.360> I'm<00:04:06.510> not<00:04:06.600> in<00:04:06.720> a

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the easy kills and although I'm not in a

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.630 
the easy kills and although I'm not in a
party<00:04:07.170> I'm<00:04:07.320> just<00:04:07.590> playing<00:04:07.799> solo<00:04:08.070> I'm<00:04:08.400> always

doing so obviously that guys in there so

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.979 
doing so obviously that guys in there so
I'll<00:04:11.760> work<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> perimeter<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.540> there<00:04:12.660> try<00:04:12.900> and

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
I'll work the perimeter in there try and

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.600 
I'll work the perimeter in there try and
kill<00:04:13.110> people<00:04:13.140> around<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.040> if<00:04:14.250> no<00:04:14.370> one<00:04:14.400> was

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
kill people around it and if no one was

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.740 
kill people around it and if no one was
in<00:04:14.760> there<00:04:14.880> I<00:04:14.940> would<00:04:15.150> be<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.330> there<00:04:15.450> trying<00:04:15.690> to

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
in there I would be in there trying to

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.030 
in there I would be in there trying to
hold<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.049> down<00:04:16.169> but<00:04:16.680> yeah<00:04:16.739> just<00:04:16.830> because

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
hold it down but yeah just because

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.170 
hold it down but yeah just because
you're<00:04:17.220> not<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.459> team<00:04:17.700> doesn't<00:04:17.910> mean<00:04:18.090> you

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
you're not in a team doesn't mean you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.940 
you're not in a team doesn't mean you
can't<00:04:18.359> work<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.630> your<00:04:18.720> teammates<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.320> that's

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
can't work with your teammates so that's

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.409 
can't work with your teammates so that's
how<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.070> like<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.250> play<00:04:20.430> every<00:04:20.669> three<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.060> now

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
how I like to play every three and now

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.110 
how I like to play every three and now
we're<00:04:21.570> moving<00:04:21.810> on<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.049> area<00:04:22.530> four<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.610> if

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
we're moving on to area four and if

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.580 
we're moving on to area four and if
you've<00:04:24.240> been<00:04:24.390> holding<00:04:24.690> on<00:04:24.780> area<00:04:25.080> three<00:04:25.410> then

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
you've been holding on area three then

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.750 
you've been holding on area three then
there's<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.800> big<00:04:25.950> chance<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.520> end

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
there's a big chance that the end

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.190 
there's a big chance that the end
is<00:04:26.790> gonna<00:04:26.910> be<00:04:27.090> right<00:04:27.270> now<00:04:27.390> area<00:04:27.660> far<00:04:27.930> and

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
is gonna be right now area far and

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.870 
is gonna be right now area far and
that's<00:04:28.710> what<00:04:28.890> happens<00:04:29.160> here<00:04:29.250> but<00:04:29.610> just<00:04:29.820> took

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
that's what happens here but just took

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.700 
that's what happens here but just took
my<00:04:30.000> C<00:04:30.180> far<00:04:30.360> straight<00:04:30.660> away<00:04:30.870> even<00:04:30.900> though<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.320> see

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
my C far straight away even though I see

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.990 
my C far straight away even though I see
an<00:04:31.800> enemy<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.130> don't<00:04:32.370> even<00:04:32.490> think<00:04:32.670> about<00:04:32.790> way

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
an enemy I don't even think about way

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.460 
an enemy I don't even think about way
under<00:04:33.330> looking<00:04:33.720> at<00:04:33.840> managed<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.110> get<00:04:34.200> a<00:04:34.260> double

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
under looking at managed to get a double

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.020 
under looking at managed to get a double
kill<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:35.010> they<00:04:35.310> say<00:04:35.430> exactly<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.820> same

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
kill and they say exactly the same

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.820 
kill and they say exactly the same
layout<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.330> area<00:04:36.720> 2<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.230> you<00:04:37.290> still<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:37.680> those

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
layout as area 2 so you still got those

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.740 
layout as area 2 so you still got those
like<00:04:38.010> little<00:04:38.130> dustbin<00:04:38.670> head<00:04:38.940> glitch<00:04:39.180> spots<00:04:39.480> at

like little dustbin head glitch spots at
the<00:04:39.810> end<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:40.230> can<00:04:40.440> use<00:04:40.560> them<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.190> actually

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
the end so you can use them and actually

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.800 
the end so you can use them and actually

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
fill ball thing in the middle so you can

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.850 
fill ball thing in the middle so you can
work<00:05:03.270> on<00:05:03.420> that<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.990> now<00:05:04.410> that<00:05:04.440> one<00:05:04.680> of<00:05:04.770> my

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
work on that and now that one of my

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.260 
work on that and now that one of my
teammates<00:05:05.220> is<00:05:05.310> pushed<00:05:05.550> into<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.820> hand<00:05:06.060> point

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
teammates is pushed into the hand point

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.910 
teammates is pushed into the hand point
there's<00:05:06.450> no<00:05:06.540> point<00:05:06.720> it's<00:05:06.870> bobbing<00:05:07.200> in<00:05:07.260> here<00:05:07.500> so

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
there's no point it's bobbing in here so

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.080 
there's no point it's bobbing in here so
I<00:05:07.980> decided<00:05:08.310> to<00:05:08.400> go<00:05:08.550> out<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:08.880> work<00:05:08.970> the

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
I decided to go out and work the

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.430 
I decided to go out and work the
perimeter<00:05:09.480> in<00:05:09.600> there<00:05:09.810> so<00:05:09.960> I'll<00:05:10.050> be<00:05:10.200> like<00:05:10.350> the

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
perimeter in there so I'll be like the

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.200 
perimeter in there so I'll be like the
first<00:05:10.650> line<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.890> defense<00:05:11.280> because<00:05:11.700> even<00:05:12.030> if<00:05:12.120> I

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
first line of defense because even if I

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.030 
first line of defense because even if I
do<00:05:12.270> die<00:05:12.570> then<00:05:13.110> at<00:05:13.380> least<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.680> school<00:05:13.890> will

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
do die then at least the school will

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.290 
do die then at least the school will
come<00:05:14.220> up<00:05:14.340> on<00:05:14.460> my<00:05:14.520> teammates<00:05:14.820> will<00:05:14.970> know<00:05:15.120> which

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
come up on my teammates will know which

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.030 
come up on my teammates will know which
way<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.600> enemies<00:05:15.840> coming<00:05:16.080> from<00:05:16.260> but<00:05:16.710> I've

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
actually managed to hold them off quite

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.970 
actually managed to hold them off quite
effectively<00:05:18.480> with<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.720> b23r<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.620> -<00:05:19.770> files

effectively with the b23r and - files
pretty<00:05:20.280> good<00:05:20.430> clip<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.820> how<00:05:21.150> to<00:05:21.210> hold<00:05:21.420> down

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
pretty good clip of how to hold down

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.810 
pretty good clip of how to hold down
area<00:05:21.840> 4<00:05:22.050> so<00:05:22.650> that's<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.250> guys<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.670> is<00:05:23.700> the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.620 
to be the next half point tips and
tricks<00:05:49.680> video<00:05:49.890> and<00:05:50.190> it<00:05:50.880> seems<00:05:51.090> like<00:05:51.270> I've<00:05:51.450> done

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
tricks video and it seems like I've done
