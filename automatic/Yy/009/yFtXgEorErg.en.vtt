up<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.220> like<00:03:14.370> within<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.239> dative<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
up and like within a dative like the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.770 
up and like within a dative like the
videos<00:03:17.130> they're<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.430> 3000<00:03:18.299> hits<00:03:18.480> or

do some subscription like sub for sub or

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.390 
do some subscription like sub for sub or
if<00:03:24.959> they<00:03:25.170> promote<00:03:25.590> their<00:03:25.829> channel<00:03:26.280> or

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
if they promote their channel or

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.220 
if they promote their channel or
something<00:03:26.850> because<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.269> don't<00:03:27.840> promote<00:03:27.959> my

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
something because I don't promote my
