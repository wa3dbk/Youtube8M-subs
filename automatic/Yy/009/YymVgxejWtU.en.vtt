00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:06.820
 beautiful for our phone 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.860
 android and good what interests me 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.810
 is this the first one that brings 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.720
 by default of that phone you see the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 no 3 it's pretty pretty good 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.810
 but there are already 16 more than here 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.820
 Obviously you may like them too and 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.100
 good to me the personal I choose the first 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.710
 because you see the truth pretty good and 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.560
 we are going to give you to apply in wallpaper and 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.020
 well once applied it will direct us to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.960
 what is the main screen with the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.479
 volpe but it already applies and a labor 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.789
 is very very good in the wallpaper that 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.009
 extract this application and it 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.170
 I totally recommend you already know guys 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.960
 the applications that we always use 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.210
 they are the videos I will leave them in the link 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.310
 download in the video description 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.800
 so they can download it directly 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.979
 to your cell phone without having to be 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.649
 going to what is the play store and good 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.229
 now let's move on to what is another 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.509
 application that this would be an equal wing 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.369
 paper the first are wallpaper that 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.369
 they would simply be without movement is 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.440
 say a picture but let's move on 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.970
 with what is the same but this wants 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.730
 say it's an image 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.440
 in motion and good the name of that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.020
 application will be appearing in what 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.110
 is the screen and once installed 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.210
 the other application we will direct or not 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.000
 direct us again to what is bottom of 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.400
 screen but now to animated backgrounds and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.950
 good we're going to go here where it says 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.680
 the name of the application and it's going to 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.020
 put this way the truth is pretty 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.810
 pretty light in what is this the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.850
 wallpaper and also this beautiful and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.190
 well lets us two things as is 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.350
 configuration and difficult to define how 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.510
 wallpaper if we go to what 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.060
 is configuration give us a series of 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.950
 menu but the truth does not allow us 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.110
 manipulate nothing else because we have to 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.390
 buy what is the full version but 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.430
 in this case this free version is very 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.950
 good and so we're going to leave it without 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.830
 modify anything and well let's give back 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.440
 and we're going to define it as wallpaper 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.110
 and good once defined as a fund of 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.450
 screen will direct us 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.640
 to this section and well let's go 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.700
 on the main screen and see that 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.980
 it puts us as a series of pens that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.200
 they are falling from the top and 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.570
 They look good to our anar phone 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.030
 and good guys and have if we try 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.040
 grab what is a pen that is in 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.180
 those who put us in motion the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.740
 feathers that obey us and know how to 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.950
 that make an effect that we are 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.020
 grabbing or touching and they look good and 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.930
