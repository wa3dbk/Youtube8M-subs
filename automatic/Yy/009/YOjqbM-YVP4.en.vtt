00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it touches this lip in the hub I cut off

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.099 
it touches this lip in the hub I cut off
a<00:00:15.389> piece<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> wood<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:17.600> pretty<00:00:18.600> once<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
a piece of wood and pretty once to the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.779 
a piece of wood and pretty once to the
diameter<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> little<00:00:20.189> bit<00:00:20.279> less<00:00:20.490> than<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
diameter a little bit less than the

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.790 
diameter a little bit less than the
bearing<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> cover<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.650> in

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
bearing and I'm going to cover it in

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.660 
bearing and I'm going to cover it in
this<00:00:22.980> cloth<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:25.350> don't<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:26.519> wood

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
this cloth so you don't get little wood

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.189 
this cloth so you don't get little wood
chips<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> sawdust<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.519> bearing<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.199> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
chips and sawdust on the bearing so you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.100 
chips and sawdust on the bearing so you
put<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> bearing<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.110> then

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the Hamet the wood is sort of breaking

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
the Hamet the wood is sort of breaking
apart<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.920> also<00:01:08.040> working<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.520> well<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

apart it's also working really well to
use<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:10.070> old<00:01:11.070> bearing

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.360 

all<00:01:35.150> right<00:01:35.300> yeah<00:01:35.660> just<00:01:36.020> about<00:01:36.950> finished

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
hammering it in work really well the old

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.090 
hammering it in work really well the old
bushing<00:01:40.880> just<00:01:41.090> smack<00:01:41.840> smack<00:01:42.320> really<00:01:42.860> hard

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
bushing just smack smack really hard

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.560 
bushing just smack smack really hard
back<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.790> forth<00:01:44.260> make<00:01:45.260> sure<00:01:45.470> it's<00:01:45.680> seated<00:01:46.570> all

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
back and forth make sure it's seated all

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.060 
back and forth make sure it's seated all
the<00:01:47.930> way<00:01:48.080> around<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.850> it's<00:01:49.850> even<00:01:50.890> next<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:51.979> got

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
the way around and it's even next we got

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.859 
the way around and it's even next we got
to<00:01:52.220> press<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.729> hub<00:01:52.940> or<00:01:53.180> hammer<00:01:53.450> in<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> hub

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
to press in the hub or hammer in the hub

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.830 
to press in the hub or hammer in the hub
okay<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.160> hub<00:01:55.369> gets<00:01:55.610> pressed<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.420> the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
okay so the hub gets pressed in in the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.200 
okay so the hub gets pressed in in the
opposite<00:01:57.380> direction<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.400> in<00:01:58.580> order<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.940> ensure

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
opposite direction so in order to ensure

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.969 
opposite direction so in order to ensure
that<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.510> bearing<00:01:59.720> doesn't<00:02:00.170> start<00:02:00.680> coming

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
that the bearing doesn't start coming

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.469 
that the bearing doesn't start coming
out<00:02:01.160> I'm<00:02:01.580> going<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.820> put<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.000> old<00:02:02.090> bearing

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
out I'm going to put the old bearing

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.620 
out I'm going to put the old bearing
here<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:04.250> vise<00:02:04.520> has<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:04.970> little<00:02:05.210> anvil

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
here on the vise has a little anvil

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.080 
here on the vise has a little anvil
thing<00:02:05.930> then<00:02:06.560> I'm<00:02:06.619> going<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.830> put<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.220> knuckle

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
thing then I'm going to put the knuckle

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.710 
thing then I'm going to put the knuckle
right<00:02:08.450> on<00:02:08.600> top<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.259> then<00:02:10.570> we're<00:02:11.570> going

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
right on top of it and then we're going

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.970 
right on top of it and then we're going
to<00:02:11.780> put<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:13.540> hub<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:15.050> here<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.980> start

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
to put the hub right here and start

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:35.050 
to put the hub right here and start
hammering<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.489> on<00:02:33.310> let's<00:02:34.310> put<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.580> lug<00:02:34.790> nuts

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
hammering it on let's put the lug nuts

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.330 
hammering it on let's put the lug nuts
on<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:38.269> we<00:02:38.480> don't<00:02:38.660> damage<00:02:39.530> anything

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
on so we don't damage anything

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:54.490 
on so we don't damage anything
ah<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:45.470> makes<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.830> easy<00:02:52.750> okay<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.049> hub<00:02:54.230> is

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
ah this makes it easy okay so the hub is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.089 
ah this makes it easy okay so the hub is
fully<00:02:55.489> pressed<00:02:55.820> in

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
fully pressed in

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.190 
fully pressed in
and<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.629> can<00:02:58.750> see<00:02:59.099> it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and as you can see it

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.540 
and as you can see it
rotate<00:03:01.980> smoothly<00:03:02.280> there's<00:03:02.700> no<00:03:02.819> noise<00:03:04.280> next<00:03:05.280> we

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
rotate smoothly there's no noise next we

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.280 
rotate smoothly there's no noise next we
have<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.790> put<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> snap<00:03:06.420> ring<00:03:06.660> back<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:06.900> which

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
have to put the snap ring back in which

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.740 
have to put the snap ring back in which
might<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.890> difficult<00:03:08.220> okay<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.240> went<00:03:09.450> out<00:03:09.569> and

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
might be difficult okay I went out and
