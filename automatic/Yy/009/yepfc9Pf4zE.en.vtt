00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.360
 Hello everyone, I am Stas Kargin, alias "Veider" 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.440
 Also the game designer of Chariot World 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.840
 Today I am going to tell you about the updated version of 9.2. 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.360
 1. What can players expect in this update? 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.400
 9.2 Updated version not significantly renovated 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.640
 Only correct minor issues 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.040
 And improve the map and balance the performance of each chariot 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880
 In addition, we also launched several high quality vehicles. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.120
 2. What is the test result of the fortress? 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
 The general test response of the fortress is good 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.120
 We will adjust the form of combat based on these results. 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.800
 Including conflicts of 6, 8, and 10 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.560
 The war will be 7 to 7, 10 to 10 and 15 to 15 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.440
 Others remain unchanged 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.960
 3. Which performance balances have you adjusted? 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.080
 We have modified many chariots 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.840
 Especially the Waffenträger E100 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.600
 Focus on modifying the drum 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.040
 Because everyone is fed up 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.560
 This problem is difficult to solve 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.920
 But we hope to redesign this chariot and let the performance really balance 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 Version 9.2 will remove a shell from the drum 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.240
 As for FV215b (183), the main problem is the value-added shells. 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.920
 This type of shell has a strong armor piercing ability. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 The frequency of players is beyond our imagination 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 So the performance of these shells has been adjusted. 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.000
 Reduce armor-piercing ability 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.800
 We adjust the performance of the 9th-order M46 Patton 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 And VK. 4502 (P) Ausf. B 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.360
 These chariots have been in the game for a long time. 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.280
 Performance has never been adjusted 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.600
 They slowly lose their competitiveness 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.680
 So we bet some effort 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.000
 Raised the performance of M46 Patton 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.600
 Higher accuracy and faster aiming 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.400
 So we focus on the main gun 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.920
 VK 4502 (P) Ausf. B is in a different situation 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.400
 It has always been a heavy armored vehicle 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.960
 Over time, armor performance is also reduced 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.640
 So we decided to improve the survival rate of this chariot. 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.040
 Improved front body armor and turret armor 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.320
 Now this car should be able to play its role more. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 We also noticed Waffenträger auf Pz. IV 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.320
 This car is too hot 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.520
 We are also worried that the firepower of this chariot is too strong. 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 So decided to redo this chariot 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.240
 Most of the changes are concentrated on the main gun 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.160
 Currently this chariot has the highest damage per minute. 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.360
 So we modify the loading time of the main gun. 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.880
 As for the eighth-order chariot, we modified the T-44. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.240
 And the Rheinmetall-Borsig Waffenträger German expulsion chariot 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360
 We also modified the loading time of the main gun. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.720
 Basically, the T-44 conforms to the original design, that is, the mobile medium-sized vehicle. 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.040
 The only thing that needs improvement is the main gun loading time. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.600
 So we shorten the time 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.400
 Rheinmetall-Borsig Waffenträger has the same problem 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.120
 Generally, this chariot is difficult to control, and the armor is too thin. 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.000
 Easy to find 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.280
 But because the rate of fire is very fast, someone uses this 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.760
 Think of a game that is very different from our original design. 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.400
 So we increased the loading time 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.440
 We also reviewed the relatively unpopular branch lines. 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.640
 For example, the spur that leads to the Object 263 Soviet ambulance 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.840
 And the feeder line leading to the Leopard 1 German medium tank 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.240
 Re-emphasize once 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.720
 We changed the main gun loading time of some of these tanks. 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000
 Let these tanks fire more efficiently 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.440
 Some high quality chariots will appear in the 9.2 update. 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.440
 Including Soviet IS heavy tanks 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.800
 SU-100 Soviet Expulsion Vehicle 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.120
 Sturmgeschütz III German expulsion chariot 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.160
 And Churchill I British heavy tank 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680
 4. Is there a redesigned map for this update? 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.240
 Yes, 9.2 update has redesigned several maps 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.560
 Most of the changes are used to improve the gaming experience. 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.200
 And make these maps more balanced 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.040
 Redesigned map including El Halluf 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.400
 Sand River, Cliff and Hidden Village 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.360
 We also redesigned the map of Komarin's fighting class. 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.000
 Higher order chariots will not see this map 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.600
 We also joined the so-called "Prokhorovka-2" 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.160
 This is a refurbished, designed map of Prokhorovka 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.960
 Also added new effects: smoke, gunfire, explosions, etc. 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.680
 5. What changes have been made? 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.440
 We have modified a lot of places in the 9.2 update. 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.320
 Should improve performance 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.400
 Make the game client execute faster 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.240
 One of the most important changes 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.520
 Is how to display high quality vehicles in 3D scenes 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.800
 We rethink our point of view 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.800
 Also understand that players really want to... 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.960
 See the wish of high quality vehicles 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.120
 But the player does not care when aiming... 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.760
 I am aiming at the high quality chariot 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.200
 Or ordinary picture quality chariot 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.960
 Players care more about 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.960
 Can you really aim and destroy enemy vehicles? 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.200
 And don’t care so much about the appearance of the car 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.000
 In addition, if there are a large number of high quality vehicles on the map 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.400
 System performance will be slowed down 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.040
 So we turn off the display of high quality vehicle features in 3D scenes. 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.000
 Only the player’s own chariot will appear in high quality. 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.600
 We also added the ability to turn off leaf transparency 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.200
 The purpose of this change is to improve system performance. 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.120
 Let the computer with poor computing power not suffer 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.760
 Leaves, especially transparent leaves 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.440
 May cause some computers to be out of gear in FPS games 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.320
 We also solved this problem 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.680
 If you want to know the details of all the changes 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 We will discuss this in the next 9.2 update comment... 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.760
 We are currently dealing with a large number of chariots in the 9.3 update. 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.280
 Including new US, Soviet and German light tanks
