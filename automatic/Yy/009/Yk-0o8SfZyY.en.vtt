pretty<00:01:26.260> strong<00:01:26.650> right<00:01:26.979> now

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.820 

you<00:01:31.510> might<00:01:31.690> have<00:01:31.780> heard<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:31.960> little<00:01:32.170> rattle<00:01:32.590> -

you might have heard a little rattle -

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.649 
you might have heard a little rattle -
that's<00:01:33.280> just<00:01:33.700> because<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:34.180> don't<00:01:34.360> have<00:01:34.479> the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
that's just because I don't have the

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.050 
that's just because I don't have the
hanger<00:01:35.020> mount<00:01:35.290> mount<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.830> up<00:01:35.920> right<00:01:36.220> right<00:01:36.850> now

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.750 
too when it's idling and I'm not sure if
that's<00:02:23.870> because<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.200> hang<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.680> -<00:02:25.890> or<00:02:26.220> I
