alright<00:00:01.170> here's<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.410> little<00:00:01.560> test<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.070> of

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
alright here's a little test video of

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.390 
alright here's a little test video of
the<00:00:02.280> SD<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.939> 500<00:00:03.780> watt<00:00:03.899> prototype<00:00:04.380> 10<00:00:04.650> still

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
the SD to 500 watt prototype 10 still

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.930 
the SD to 500 watt prototype 10 still
too<00:00:05.580> cold<00:00:06.410> see<00:00:07.410> here's<00:00:07.589> got<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.010> ventilated

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
too cold see here's got the ventilated

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.470 
too cold see here's got the ventilated
frame<00:00:10.340> solid<00:00:11.340> core<00:00:11.550> here<00:00:11.820> so<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.240> don't<00:00:12.389> need

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
frame solid core here so you don't need

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.910 
frame solid core here so you don't need
to<00:00:12.540> leave<00:00:12.690> any<00:00:12.870> room<00:00:13.019> behind<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.469> speaker<00:00:13.620> in

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
to leave any room behind the speaker in

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.950 
to leave any room behind the speaker in
the<00:00:14.280> box<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.120> shallow<00:00:15.389> box<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.809> don't

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
the box in a shallow box you don't

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.029 
the box in a shallow box you don't
really<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> lot<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.440> room<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.619> begin<00:00:16.740> with

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
really have a lot of room to begin with

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.330 
really have a lot of room to begin with
and<00:00:17.970> got<00:00:18.869> written<00:00:19.170> hooked<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.039> our<00:00:20.070> test

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and got written hooked up to our test

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.580 
and got written hooked up to our test
rig<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:21.380> on<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.560> 2500<00:00:24.199> play<00:00:25.199> some<00:00:25.410> base

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
rig here on a 2500 play some base

00:00:25.590 --> 00:01:25.420 
rig here on a 2500 play some base
mechanic<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.130> it

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.560 

all<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.759> was<00:01:26.850> pretty<00:01:26.880> much<00:01:27.119> maxim

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
all right that was pretty much maxim

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.749 
all right that was pretty much maxim
stroke<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.080> driver<00:01:28.320> has<00:01:29.070> about<00:01:29.250> 25

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
stroke in this driver has about 25

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.820 
stroke in this driver has about 25
millimetres<00:01:29.939> each<00:01:30.450> way<00:01:30.690> mechanical<00:01:31.590> throw

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
millimetres each way mechanical throw

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.490 
millimetres each way mechanical throw
allowable<00:01:32.690> before<00:01:33.690> anything<00:01:34.020> bottoms<00:01:34.350> out

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
allowable before anything bottoms out

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730 
allowable before anything bottoms out
and<00:01:35.570> linear<00:01:36.570> travels<00:01:36.960> 12<00:01:37.229> millimeters<00:01:37.619> each

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and linear travels 12 millimeters each

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.990 
and linear travels 12 millimeters each
way<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.580> double<00:01:38.970> that

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
way so you have about double that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.020 
way so you have about double that
mechanically<00:01:39.750> allowable<00:01:40.610> got<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> 15

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
mechanically allowable got a 15

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.510 
mechanically allowable got a 15
