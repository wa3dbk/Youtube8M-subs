weapons<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.730> was<00:02:58.940> almost<00:02:59.090> something<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.540> was

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
weapons it was almost something that was

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.870 
weapons it was almost something that was
really<00:02:59.750> cool<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.080> mystery<00:03:00.560> box<00:03:00.770> kind<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.610> a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
really cool the mystery box kind of in a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.170 
really cool the mystery box kind of in a
sense<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.990> epitome<00:03:03.290> of<00:03:03.530> what<00:03:03.980> 115<00:03:04.610> does<00:03:04.910> it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
sense is the epitome of what 115 does it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.870 
sense is the epitome of what 115 does it
allows<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.810> bend<00:03:06.020> time<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.590> space<00:03:06.880> so

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
allows you to bend time and space so

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.790 
allows you to bend time and space so
going<00:03:08.120> back<00:03:08.300> origins<00:03:09.020> was<00:03:09.200> basically<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
going back origins was basically the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.680 
going back origins was basically the
first<00:03:10.040> one<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:10.430> had<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.670> sarcophagus<00:03:11.450> that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
first one you had the sarcophagus that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.470 
first one you had the sarcophagus that
was<00:03:11.960> basically<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.920> mystery<00:03:13.910> box<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.390> it

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
was basically the mystery box but it

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.850

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
the mystery box the idea for the mystery

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.380 
the mystery box the idea for the mystery
box<00:04:44.750> came<00:04:45.530> back<00:04:45.800> in<00:04:45.980> World<00:04:46.190> War<00:04:46.460> one<00:04:46.730> when

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
box came back in World War one when

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.090 
box came back in World War one when
basically<00:04:47.720> they<00:04:48.140> went<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.470> this<00:04:48.560> excavation

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
basically they went to this excavation

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.100 
basically they went to this excavation
point<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:49.700> we're<00:04:49.820> digging<00:04:50.120> up<00:04:50.240> 115<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:51.020> they

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
point that we're digging up 115 and they

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.270 
point that we're digging up 115 and they
discovered<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:51.770> kind<00:04:51.980> of<00:04:52.040> weird

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
discovered this kind of weird

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.400 
discovered this kind of weird
sarcophagus<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.660> allowed<00:04:53.930> them<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.170> get

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
sarcophagus that allowed them to get

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.410 
sarcophagus that allowed them to get
these<00:04:54.860> really<00:04:55.280> awesome<00:04:55.430> weapons<00:04:56.180> from

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
these really awesome weapons from

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.310 
these really awesome weapons from
different<00:04:56.900> time<00:04:57.080> frames<00:04:57.320> so<00:04:57.530> in<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.490> sense<00:04:58.760> a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
different time frames so in a sense a

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.690 
different time frames so in a sense a
mystery<00:05:00.320> box<00:05:00.470> is<00:05:00.800> just<00:05:01.070> something<00:05:01.280> that<00:05:01.460> was

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
mystery box is just something that was

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.730 
mystery box is just something that was
based<00:05:02.060> off<00:05:02.390> something<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:03.080> was<00:05:03.200> found<00:05:03.500> in

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
based off something that was found in

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.280 
based off something that was found in
ancient<00:05:04.010> time<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:04.910> World<00:05:05.390> War<00:05:05.660> one<00:05:05.930> was<00:05:06.140> out

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
ancient time so World War one was out

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.110 
ancient time so World War one was out
you<00:05:06.590> know<00:05:06.680> we're<00:05:06.830> talkin<00:05:07.190> was<00:05:07.340> there<00:05:07.520> Dr<00:05:07.970> Maxis

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
you know we're talkin was there Dr Maxis

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.370 
you know we're talkin was there Dr Maxis
was<00:05:08.420> there<00:05:08.570> they<00:05:08.750> discovered<00:05:09.170> all<00:05:09.260> these

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
was there they discovered all these

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.230 
was there they discovered all these
really<00:05:09.710> ancient<00:05:09.890> artifacts<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:10.670> stuff<00:05:11.000> and

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
really ancient artifacts and stuff and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.940 
really ancient artifacts and stuff and
it<00:05:11.660> was<00:05:11.690> bringing<00:05:12.080> them<00:05:12.170> weapons<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:12.800> why

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
it was bringing them weapons this is why

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.530 
it was bringing them weapons this is why
I<00:05:12.980> say<00:05:13.070> that<00:05:13.460> there's<00:05:13.610> like<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:14.030> thing<00:05:14.390> of

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
I say that there's like that thing of

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.510 
I say that there's like that thing of
where<00:05:14.720> it's<00:05:14.840> bending<00:05:15.200> time<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.650> space<00:05:15.890> so<00:05:16.490> we

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
where it's bending time and space so we

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.640 
where it's bending time and space so we
don't<00:05:16.790> necessarily<00:05:17.420> know<00:05:17.600> if<00:05:17.870> it<00:05:18.230> is<00:05:18.260> in<00:05:18.530> fact

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
don't necessarily know if it is in fact

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.590 
don't necessarily know if it is in fact
something<00:05:18.980> that<00:05:19.190> was<00:05:19.310> ancient<00:05:19.610> or<00:05:20.270> if<00:05:20.480> it's

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
something that was ancient or if it's

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.880 
something that was ancient or if it's
something<00:05:20.720> that's<00:05:21.020> actually<00:05:21.590> from<00:05:21.710> the

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
something that's actually from the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.820 
something that's actually from the
future<00:05:22.280> so<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.750> mystery<00:05:24.050> box<00:05:24.290> does<00:05:24.740> they

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
future so the mystery box does they

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.680 
future so the mystery box does they
really<00:05:25.130> have<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.340> definitive<00:05:25.700> origin<00:05:26.330> we<00:05:26.510> don't

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
really have a definitive origin we don't

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.150 
really have a definitive origin we don't
really<00:05:26.810> know<00:05:27.020> it's<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.470> sort<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.710> coffee<00:05:27.920> gift

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
really know it's a sort of coffee gift

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.770 
really know it's a sort of coffee gift
they<00:05:28.400> found<00:05:28.640> when<00:05:28.730> they<00:05:28.790> were<00:05:28.940> digging<00:05:29.120> up<00:05:29.390> 115

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
they found when they were digging up 115

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.720 
they found when they were digging up 115
and<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.560> was<00:05:30.650> giving<00:05:30.920> them<00:05:31.040> weapons<00:05:31.220> from<00:05:31.580> the

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
and it was giving them weapons from the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.790 
and it was giving them weapons from the
future<00:05:32.060> from<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.270> past<00:05:32.470> basically<00:05:33.470> weapons

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
future from the past basically weapons

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.010 
future from the past basically weapons
from<00:05:34.010> all<00:05:34.280> time<00:05:34.640> frames<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.300> it's<00:05:35.660> something

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
from all time frames and it's something

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.450 
from all time frames and it's something
that's<00:05:36.170> kind<00:05:36.380> of<00:05:36.440> been<00:05:36.650> moving<00:05:37.040> around<00:05:37.160> in

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
that's kind of been moving around in

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.280 
that's kind of been moving around in
time<00:05:37.700> which<00:05:38.180> is<00:05:38.210> why<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.510> mystery<00:05:38.930> box<00:05:39.050> in

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
time which is why the mystery box in

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.290 
time which is why the mystery box in
some<00:05:39.590> maps<00:05:39.860> disappears<00:05:40.850> it<00:05:41.030> goes<00:05:41.150> to

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
some maps disappears it goes to

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.930 
some maps disappears it goes to
different<00:05:41.450> places<00:05:41.810> or<00:05:42.260> in<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.100> sense<00:05:43.370> it<00:05:43.670> has

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
different places or in a sense it has

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.000 
different places or in a sense it has
the<00:05:44.090> ability<00:05:44.420> to<00:05:44.450> teleport<00:05:44.870> not<00:05:45.230> only<00:05:45.470> just<00:05:45.890> in

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
the ability to teleport not only just in

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.370 
the ability to teleport not only just in
the<00:05:46.400> within<00:05:46.670> that<00:05:46.850> location<00:05:47.420> but<00:05:47.960> also<00:05:48.110> in

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
the within that location but also in

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.800 
the within that location but also in
time<00:05:48.590> now<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.130> last<00:05:49.490> version<00:05:50.000> of<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.420> mystery

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
time now the last version of the mystery

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.240 
time now the last version of the mystery
box<00:05:51.020> that<00:05:51.110> we<00:05:51.320> see<00:05:51.530> is<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.740> one<00:05:51.860> that<00:05:51.950> we<00:05:52.070> see

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
box that we see is the one that we see

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.740 
box that we see is the one that we see
in<00:05:52.280> alcatraz<00:05:53.030> and<00:05:53.210> it's<00:05:53.330> the<00:05:53.420> one<00:05:53.540> that<00:05:53.660> looks

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
in alcatraz and it's the one that looks

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.690 
in alcatraz and it's the one that looks
kind<00:05:53.990> of<00:05:54.020> like<00:05:54.110> a<00:05:54.230> hell<00:05:54.590> infested<00:05:55.400> when<00:05:55.550> it's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
kind of like a hell infested when it's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.450 
kind of like a hell infested when it's
got<00:05:55.880> spikes<00:05:56.270> floating<00:05:56.930> on<00:05:57.020> fire<00:05:57.350> and<00:05:58.190> it's

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
got spikes floating on fire and it's

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.340 
got spikes floating on fire and it's
like<00:05:58.610> basically<00:05:58.910> that<00:05:59.660> one<00:05:59.840> doesn't<00:06:00.080> really

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
like basically that one doesn't really

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.990 
like basically that one doesn't really
count<00:06:00.560> as<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.770> mystery<00:06:01.130> box<00:06:01.340> it's<00:06:01.640> something

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
count as a mystery box it's something

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.790 
count as a mystery box it's something
that<00:06:02.150> we<00:06:02.270> see<00:06:02.480> as<00:06:02.570> a<00:06:02.600> demonic<00:06:03.020> presence<00:06:03.140> in<00:06:03.680> the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
that we see as a demonic presence in the

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.070 
that we see as a demonic presence in the
afterlife<00:06:04.220> it's<00:06:04.910> again<00:06:05.540> something<00:06:05.840> that's

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
afterlife it's again something that's

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.290 
afterlife it's again something that's
alternating<00:06:06.680> with<00:06:06.830> 115<00:06:07.340> and<00:06:07.550> the<00:06:07.640> ability<00:06:08.060> to

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
alternating with 115 and the ability to

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.570 
alternating with 115 and the ability to
go<00:06:08.840> through<00:06:09.200> time<00:06:09.440> and<00:06:09.590> space<00:06:09.770> but<00:06:10.310> anyways

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
go through time and space but anyways

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.770 
go through time and space but anyways
guys<00:06:10.700> that's<00:06:10.760> basically<00:06:11.300> it<00:06:11.420> for<00:06:11.540> this

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
guys that's basically it for this
