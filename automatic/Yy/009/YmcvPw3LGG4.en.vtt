00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
pretty impressive they do it by having a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
pretty impressive they do it by having a
dedicated<00:01:26.729> low<00:01:27.180> power<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.920> that's<00:01:28.920> just

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
dedicated low power for that's just

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
dedicated low power for that's just
always<00:01:29.310> listening<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.180> meant<00:01:30.540> I'd<00:01:31.020> show

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
always listening for that meant I'd show

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
always listening for that meant I'd show
it<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.670> actually<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
it now but you actually have to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
it now but you actually have to
calibrate<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.350> device<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.009> voice

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
calibrate the device to your voice

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
calibrate the device to your voice
before<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> pretty

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
before you can do it but it's a pretty

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.330 
before you can do it but it's a pretty
innovative<00:01:37.590> feature<00:01:37.920> than<00:01:38.189> other

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
innovative feature than other

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.950 
innovative feature than other
manufacturers<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.119> Samsung<00:01:39.570> haven't<00:01:39.810> quite

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
manufacturers like Samsung haven't quite

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.859 
manufacturers like Samsung haven't quite
been<00:01:40.020> able<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.409> figure<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.869> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
been able to figure out to have that the
