00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 do not 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.950
 no no 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.730
 today it is sunny, it seems a lie that can be 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.350
 lose someone but it's not always like that 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.259
 there are days that there is very bad weather 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.720
 fog is snowing then people are 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.580
 loses it's very difficult to locate her how 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.619
 It was solved in the past 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.899
 going out to look for them today there is 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.399
 a thing called the ifai that serves 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.200
 for two things one to be 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.450
 locatable at all times throughout the 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.100
 ski area and the other one is for 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.239
 notify the emergency service that you 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.239
 something has happened 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.010
 with a margin of error ranging from 5 to 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.899
 10 meters far better than 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.309
 formerly served 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.019
 and today he continues to use this 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.050
 antenna triangulation I have the one of 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.230
 antennas in andorra gives a margin of 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.180
 error of several kilometers then it was 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.650
 impossible to locate a person from 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.800
 fast and effective way by this 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.800
 system 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.850
 on ski slopes like great valira there are 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.890
 signs indicating the advantages of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.370
 download the free application to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.510
 pif there is like 'the fifa and it works with 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.159
 internet via gps included sms works on 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.619
 practically anywhere in the world 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.780
 then it is an ideal tool for 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.700
 any emergency situation in the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.479
 which may have involved a 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.479
 person in his day to day 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.490
 It is a free application for both 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.200
 Android iphone and blackberry used to 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.330
 be locatable as long as you 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.160
 you find in a coverage area 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.160
 fifa and take the application mind 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.640
 although he was born in the ski environment 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.470
 this application has quickly been 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.090
 become an important tool 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.890
 for 112 emergency systems by 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.260
 that we have moved to the center 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.320
 What is there in the Principality of Andorra with 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.310
 the goal of seeing how it works 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.649
 identical in all the centers of 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.290
 emergency that have agreements with 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.720
 the company to the pif there are always the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.819
 artifi application connected at 24 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.829
 hours 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.370
 and now I'll give you a call 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.370
 emergency 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.160
 and it's going to come on screen and now 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.490
 we received the call 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.910
 the person who needs help 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.840
 then the main control panel 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:47.270
 he says that here in 112 of andorra 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.790
 so then this is an example that 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.290
 would be the route that I made today 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.420
 with the artist application already understood 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.300
 So this is what this serves 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.610
 so that we imagine that I was 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.370
 disappeared then introducing my 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.070
 data in the system because he would know the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.660
 I've done today and the 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.390
 position where I am in this 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.220
 same moment so then this does 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.690
 that in case of disappearance and that there 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.090
 a complaint of how good there is a 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.040
 missing person because it is more flexible and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.930
 effective locating this person 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.360
 we can see the name of the person 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.430
 where is at this moment the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.860
 address the time of the last position 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.360
 we see the longitude and the latitude where 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.370
 is the margin of error of the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.530
 signal that is 8 meters the speed to 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.120
 the one that is moving the altitude to 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.040
 which it is the orientation 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.600
 is following the battery level and 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.760
 according to what devices we also know 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.440
 If you have an internet connection, it has a level 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.640
 of internet connection and that the level of 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.440
 coverage has inside 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.300
 then all this is an information 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.440
 Well, so 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:55.440
 it helps to be more effective 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.090
 I find the rescues during 2014 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.870
 the mountain civil guard has rescued 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.930
 about 1,400 people with about 100 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.100
 More than 500 injured and about 800 injured 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.330
 unharmed people a correct 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.250
 geolocation of the emergency is 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.230
 fundamental to reduce the time of 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.110
 rescue and therefore the number of 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.750
 victims also to reduce costs 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.480
 economic for example mobilize a 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.440
 Terrestrial rescue team costs about 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.440
 300 euros every hour and about 3000 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.440
 helicopters 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.880
 due to the concern that the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.770
 people who missed people that 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.800
 it disappeared so much in ski resorts 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.020
 as in other car spaces 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.510
 these outdoor activities then 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.180
 we decided to make a company a company 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.680
 that today works in 10 people and 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.680
 we work to develop the fifa 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.320
 the beginning we started to develop from 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.260
 from andorra but already at 6 months we 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.860
 we had to come to live in Barcelona and 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.720
 then you found the offices here and everything 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.190
 everything we developed from the king of 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 jealousy on this side of the office is 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.370
 devote to develop 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.440
 louis active there is so much architecture 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.320
 of the software as of the applications 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.520
 both for android iphone and blackberry and 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.730
 we also have a person who 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.650
 devotes to test everything they develop 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.530
 after the other side we have the team 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.660
 commercial and design that is dedicated to 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.200
 market the system and design 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.540
 all parts of the application the 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.730
 other studies that has notify is that 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.230
 is online does not require installation of 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.060
 hardware or software 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.010
 then we can upload the 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.710
 versions from our two offices in 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.960
 barcelona and that on the same day the 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.330
 have in the 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.680
 of all regions and countries that 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.850
 they have contact with their coasts 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.490
 nowadays our system is 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.870
 implanted enter this need the 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:07.919
 world all in andorra one in argentina 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:11.819
 3 in France 3 or 4 in Asia and after 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:15.300
 various 112 up to andorra the del 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:18.470
 Basque country la rioja cantabria aragÃ³n 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.120
 Extremadura and soon Galicia 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.949
 there are currently about 6 million 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.160
 Spaniards who have access to this 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.500
 application through the 112 that gives 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.479
 assistance to the citizen before any 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.030
 type of health emergency 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.539
 fire extinguishing salvage and 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.539
 security 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.550
 every time there are more people who go out to the 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:45.710
 mountain and unfortunately not all the 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.500
 sufficiently well equipped 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.659
 neither has the basic knowledge nor is it 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.729
 aware of the dangers that can 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.800
 find out from there that the teams 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.990
 rescue will have to attend more and more 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.479
 setbacks where the information is 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.759
 vital to get auxiliary form 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.090
 fastest possible people 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.090
 crashed 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.390
 how it connects you with the 112 has 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.080
 rescued people of all kinds people 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.850
 take to the mountain heteros children 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.800
 small because their parents when they leave 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.260
 to play alone they put the phone with 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.230
 when poking in your pocket older people 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.470
 also people who usually lose because 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.330
 goes out to walk or leaves home alone 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.670
 their family members put them to push in the 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.600
 phone then when they report to the 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.910
 112 is your grandfather your father is missing at home 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.190
 They can locate it in a more 

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.260
 fast and effective in this way a 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.530
 free application that emerged from the 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.490
 restlessness of some Andorran skiers 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:50.290
 is currently being treated in 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.450
 implant in all the services of 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.550
 world's emergency not only for 

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.890
 find and rescue skiers or 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.810
 lost hikers but also 

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.910
 to help anyone in 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.100
 anywhere on the planet that has a 

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:06.370
 problem and where the 

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:09.300
 system to the fifa with the emergency 112 

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.300
 corresponding
