00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
that and then they actually got me this

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.010 
that and then they actually got me this
dry<00:06:46.470> erase<00:06:46.860> board<00:06:47.280> with<00:06:47.850> these<00:06:48.150> hooks<00:06:48.539> on<00:06:48.810> it

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
dry erase board with these hooks on it

inside<00:06:50.760> or<00:06:51.030> the<00:06:51.060> outside<00:06:51.180> of<00:06:51.660> the<00:06:51.780> door<00:06:51.960> and<00:06:52.470> we

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
inside or the outside of the door and we

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:54.800 
inside or the outside of the door and we
could<00:06:53.130> just<00:06:53.310> like<00:06:53.460> write<00:06:53.699> things<00:06:53.970> on<00:06:54.240> it<00:06:54.510> and

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810 
could just like write things on it and

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.529 
could just like write things on it and
then<00:06:55.050> hang<00:06:55.710> like<00:06:56.100> jackets<00:06:56.699> or<00:06:56.970> just<00:06:57.150> random

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
then hang like jackets or just random
