00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.950
So we've got him in single.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:24.580
We can show you that he won't run away; I've
got the reins down there slack on his back,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:01:03.350
come over, come over, got to steer him a little
bit but you can see there like that he's going

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.290
alright.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:22.960
He's only got a bit of rubber in his mouth.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.560
Get up babe, go on.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.400
Good lad.

Coming on with the traffic.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:02:05.100
Going to stop here and let these cars go,
come over babe.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.900
Trot on.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:20.409
Little bit of steering with this one, that's
it.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:04:00.319
If I want to do an emergency stop with him,
right, whoa.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:08.349
Stand still.

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:20.400

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:31.509
Car coming.

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:42.039
Go on then.

00:04:42.039 --> 00:05:03.030
Go on, get on.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:13.520
Good boy.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.770
