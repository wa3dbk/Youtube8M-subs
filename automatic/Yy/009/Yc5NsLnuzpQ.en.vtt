generator<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.079> stuff<00:01:25.469> so<00:01:25.859> I<00:01:25.890> have

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
generator and all this stuff so I have

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.310 
generator and all this stuff so I have
to<00:01:26.850> try<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.090> clean<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.840> haven't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to try and clean this out I haven't

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.669 
to try and clean this out I haven't
haven't<00:01:29.159> found<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.780> best<00:01:30.990> place<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> put<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
haven't found the best place to put it

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.109 
haven't found the best place to put it
yet<00:01:31.859> but<00:01:32.009> let's<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.280> least<00:01:32.310> see<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.969> get

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
yet but let's at least see if I can get

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.050 
yet but let's at least see if I can get
this<00:01:33.270> started<00:01:34.100> those<00:01:35.100> are<00:01:35.250> totally<00:01:35.399> iced<00:01:35.759> over

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
this started those are totally iced over

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.319 
this started those are totally iced over
I<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> try<00:01:37.679> using<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> hot<00:01:38.670> water<00:01:38.700> trick

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I have to try using the hot water trick

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.349 
I have to try using the hot water trick
on<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.659> windows<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.700> snow<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.240> ice

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
on the windows you can see snow and ice

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:50.149 
on the windows you can see snow and ice
on<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.810> trees<00:01:48.289> just<00:01:49.289> enough<00:01:49.499> through<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.920> sit

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
on my trees just enough through the sit

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.389 
on my trees just enough through the sit
dominant<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.409> let's<00:01:52.679> see<00:01:52.859> how<00:01:53.039> it<00:01:53.159> starts

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
dominant here so let's see how it starts

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:06.529 
dominant here so let's see how it starts
up<00:02:03.979> ok<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> starter<00:02:05.549> drive<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.969> not<00:02:06.119> engaged

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
up ok the starter drive is not engaged

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.530 
up ok the starter drive is not engaged
in<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.929> try<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.289> again

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.000 

ok<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.750> would<00:02:12.930> often<00:02:13.260> happen<00:02:13.470> when<00:02:13.710> I'll<00:02:13.860> get

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
ok this would often happen when I'll get

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.010 
ok this would often happen when I'll get
really<00:02:14.250> cold<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.210> at<00:02:15.270> least<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.600> starters

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
really cold but at least the starters

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.140 
really cold but at least the starters
turning<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.190> get<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.460> engage<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
turning see if we can get it engage the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.390 
turning see if we can get it engage the
flywheel<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:21.960> key<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.740> hard<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.130> turn

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
flywheel the key is really hard to turn

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.070 
flywheel the key is really hard to turn
to<00:02:23.820> because<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.540> gotten<00:02:24.810> gummy

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
to because it's just gotten gummy

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.899 
to because it's just gotten gummy

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
it's always the problem it's like one of

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.849 
it's always the problem it's like one of
these<00:03:07.890> vehicles<00:03:08.780> seems<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:09.989> one<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.709> them

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
these vehicles seems like one of them

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.809 
these vehicles seems like one of them
always<00:03:11.040> ends<00:03:11.400> up<00:03:11.489> heating<00:03:11.730> gas

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.179 

you<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.420> have<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.599> let<00:03:16.840> it<00:03:16.930> warm<00:03:17.109> up<00:03:17.379> here<00:03:17.709> for

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:18.189 
you just have to let it warm up here for

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.350 
you just have to let it warm up here for
a<00:03:18.219> little<00:03:18.459> while

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
a little while

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.130 
a little while
I<00:03:21.400> clean<00:03:22.400> out<00:03:22.430> some<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.060> equipment<00:03:23.390> maybe

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
I clean out some of this equipment maybe

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.680

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.420 

so<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.410> needs<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.800> go<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.220> West

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
