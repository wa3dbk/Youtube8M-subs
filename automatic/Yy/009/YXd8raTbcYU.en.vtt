00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
journey now that you're familiar with

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.460 
journey now that you're familiar with
and<00:00:38.420> everybody's<00:00:38.780> familiar<00:00:38.870> with<00:00:39.140> minor

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
and everybody's familiar with minor

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.010 
and everybody's familiar with minor
pentatonic<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:40.340> then<00:00:40.850> add<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.570> one<00:00:41.750> or<00:00:41.870> two

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
pentatonic and then add the one or two

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.520 
pentatonic and then add the one or two
notes<00:00:42.200> that<00:00:42.530> will<00:00:42.620> expand<00:00:43.239> into<00:00:44.239> a<00:00:44.600> modal

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
notes that will expand into a modal

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.530 
notes that will expand into a modal
pattern<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:46.700> that's<00:00:46.879> what<00:00:47.030> we're<00:00:47.150> gonna<00:00:47.239> do

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
pattern so that's what we're gonna do

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.010 
pattern so that's what we're gonna do
here<00:00:48.290> we<00:00:48.410> go<00:00:49.270> alright<00:00:50.270> we're<00:00:50.360> gonna<00:00:50.450> start<00:00:50.540> in

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
here we go alright we're gonna start in

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.080 
here we go alright we're gonna start in
the<00:00:51.110> key<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.710> using<00:00:52.340> a<00:00:52.490> minor<00:00:52.730> pentatonic

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
the key of a using a minor pentatonic

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.390 
the key of a using a minor pentatonic
and<00:00:53.690> then<00:00:54.080> we're<00:00:54.170> going<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.320> expand<00:00:54.950> those<00:00:55.160> a

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
and then we're going to expand those a

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.360 
and then we're going to expand those a
minor<00:00:55.850> pentatonic<00:00:56.240> licks<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.680> licks<00:00:57.890> based<00:00:58.130> on

me<00:01:02.810> show<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.470> minor<00:01:04.070> pentatonic<00:01:04.280> in<00:01:04.759> fifth

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
me show you a minor pentatonic in fifth

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.870 
me show you a minor pentatonic in fifth
position<00:01:06.070> all<00:01:07.070> right<00:01:07.100> here's<00:01:07.430> a<00:01:07.610> minor

now to expand to a natural minor or the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.600 
now to expand to a natural minor or the
alien<00:01:34.020> mode<00:01:34.260> we're<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.250> take<00:01:35.400> that

alien mode we're just going to take that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.220 
alien mode we're just going to take that
scale<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> we're<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.870> it

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
scale and we're going to add to it

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.420 
scale and we're going to add to it
the<00:01:37.350> major<00:01:37.620> second<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:39.290> B<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> the

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
minor pentatonic so I'm going down one

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.500 
minor pentatonic so I'm going down one
note<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.519> scale<00:02:41.609> each<00:02:41.939> time<00:02:42.150> first<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
note in the scale each time first I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.970 
note in the scale each time first I
start<00:02:42.750> from<00:02:42.840> C<00:02:43.109> I<00:02:43.519> start<00:02:44.519> from<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:45.109> G<00:02:48.829> and<00:02:49.829> I

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
start from C I start from a G and I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.380 
start from C I start from a G and I
continue<00:02:50.430> down<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.730> whole<00:02:50.849> thing<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.180> then<00:02:51.299> I

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
continue down the whole thing and then I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.180 
continue down the whole thing and then I
go<00:02:51.510> up<00:02:51.689> the<00:02:51.840> same<00:02:52.049> way

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.040 

that's<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.520> common<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.300> minor<00:03:00.690> pentatonic

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
that's a very common a minor pentatonic

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.560 
that's a very common a minor pentatonic
lick<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.980> convert<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.700> national<00:03:03.300> minor

and the flat six F and that's going to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:34.319 
and the flat six F and that's going to
give<00:03:12.330> us<00:03:12.360> this

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.580 

all<00:03:35.329> right<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:35.629> now<00:03:35.810> we're<00:03:35.930> using<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.319> eighth

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
all right so now we're using that eighth

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.649 
all right so now we're using that eighth
note<00:03:36.860> triplet<00:03:37.400> 1<00:03:37.579> triplet<00:03:37.610> 2<00:03:38.060> triplet<00:03:38.239> 3

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
note triplet 1 triplet 2 triplet 3

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.170 
note triplet 1 triplet 2 triplet 3
triplet<00:03:38.870> 4<00:03:39.230> triplet<00:03:39.439> but<00:03:40.220> I'm<00:03:40.340> using<00:03:40.519> natural

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
triplet 4 triplet but I'm using natural

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.649 
triplet 4 triplet but I'm using natural
minor<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:46.129> I'm<00:03:46.579> just<00:03:46.730> standing<00:03:47.269> from<00:03:47.480> one

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
minor and I'm just standing from one

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.280 
minor and I'm just standing from one
note<00:03:47.840> lower<00:03:48.079> in<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.319> scale<00:03:48.650> each<00:03:48.859> time<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:51.109> now

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
note lower in the scale each time so now

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.099 
note lower in the scale each time so now
instead<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.650> just<00:03:51.739> going<00:03:51.950> like<00:03:52.900> we<00:03:53.900> wouldn't

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
instead of just going like we wouldn't

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.920 
instead of just going like we wouldn't
minor<00:03:54.349> pentatonic<00:03:55.269> we<00:03:56.269> don't<00:03:56.480> go<00:03:56.629> straight

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
minor pentatonic we don't go straight

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.130 
minor pentatonic we don't go straight
from<00:03:57.079> C<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.379> a<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.890> go<00:03:58.040> from<00:03:58.220> C<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.459> B<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:59.510> then<00:03:59.959> a

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
from C to a we go from C to B and then a

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.589 
from C to a we go from C to B and then a
so<00:04:00.200> those<00:04:00.530> 3<00:04:00.829> notes<00:04:00.980> on<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:02.090> high<00:04:02.209> string<00:04:02.510> are

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
so those 3 notes on the high string are

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.000 
so those 3 notes on the high string are
going<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.810> make<00:04:02.989> up<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.290> first<00:04:03.500> 3<00:04:03.650> notes<00:04:03.680> of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
going to make up the first 3 notes of

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.470 
going to make up the first 3 notes of
the<00:04:04.099> eighth<00:04:04.190> note<00:04:04.370> triplet<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.269> keep

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
the eighth note triplet and you keep

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.789 
the eighth note triplet and you keep
going

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.950 

so<00:04:18.799> as<00:04:18.980> you<00:04:19.160> progress<00:04:19.370> each<00:04:19.850> time

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.150 

we're<00:04:26.960> just<00:04:27.050> going<00:04:27.289> one<00:04:27.470> out<00:04:27.620> lower<00:04:27.830> in<00:04:28.039> the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
we're just going one out lower in the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.890 
we're just going one out lower in the
scale<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:28.729> I<00:04:28.910> do<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.150> same<00:04:29.180> thing<00:04:29.389> on<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:29.870> way

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
scale and I do the same thing on the way

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.349 
scale and I do the same thing on the way
up
