and<00:00:20.850> description<00:00:21.330> down<00:00:21.480> below

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
and description down below

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.870 
and description down below
Algrim<00:00:22.560> mini-map<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.369> currently<00:00:23.699> in

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
Algrim mini-map now this is currently in

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.910 
Algrim mini-map now this is currently in
beta<00:00:24.060> because<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:25.170> point<00:00:25.380> seven<00:00:25.560> point<00:00:25.650> five

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
beta because one point seven point five

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.670 
beta because one point seven point five
or<00:00:25.980> four<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.990> under<00:00:28.260> development

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
or four I think is now under development

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
or four I think is now under development
so<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.519> beta<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.000> will<00:00:30.060> also

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
so this is just a beta but it will also

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.299 
so this is just a beta but it will also
work<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.900> well<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.500> once<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.949> downloaded

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
work just as well so once you downloaded

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.370 
work just as well so once you downloaded
it<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.579> open<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.480> winrar<00:00:33.780> I'll<00:00:34.170> leave<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it and open it with winrar I'll leave a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
it and open it with winrar I'll leave a
link<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:34.920> you're<00:00:35.070> done<00:00:35.219> another<00:00:35.940> lip
