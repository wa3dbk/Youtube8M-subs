00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
and understand that okay yeah they they

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.260 
and understand that okay yeah they they
promised<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.380> isn't<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.340> let's<00:02:30.580> let's

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
promised this isn't this but let's let's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.210 
promised this isn't this but let's let's
try<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.570> see<00:02:31.930> if<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.290> distant<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.740> actually

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
try to see if this distant this actually

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.950 
try to see if this distant this actually
makes<00:02:33.400> sense<00:02:33.550> or<00:02:33.940> if<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.330> isn't<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.780> is

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
makes sense or if this isn't this is

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.980 
makes sense or if this isn't this is
balance<00:02:35.380> if<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.130> isn't<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.970> fair<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.450> if

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
balance if this isn't this is fair or if

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.090 
balance if this isn't this is fair or if
it<00:02:38.170> isn't<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.710> broken<00:02:39.100> mechanic<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.000> um

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
it isn't a broken mechanic and so um

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.680 
it isn't a broken mechanic and so um

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.140 
the things he says rubs off on people
like<00:03:41.800> when<00:03:42.010> he<00:03:42.100> said<00:03:42.310> kill<00:03:42.550> zone<00:03:42.790> was<00:03:42.970> not<00:03:43.120> a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
like when he said kill zone was not a

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.550 
like when he said kill zone was not a
good<00:03:43.330> game<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.600> he<00:03:43.870> felt<00:03:44.110> like<00:03:44.170> he<00:03:44.410> was<00:03:44.500> a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
good game and he felt like he was a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.490 
good game and he felt like he was a
fucking<00:03:44.890> robot<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.700> he<00:03:45.820> can<00:03:46.000> control<00:03:46.500> you
