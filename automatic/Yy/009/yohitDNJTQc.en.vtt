Minnesota<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.530> something<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.789> can

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Minnesota or something like that you can

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
Minnesota or something like that you can
be<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.239> expensive<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:55.050> other<00:00:55.230> times<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.649> year

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
be very expensive at other times of year

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040 
be very expensive at other times of year
it's<00:00:56.070> literally<00:00:56.640> growing<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> ground

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
it's literally growing out of the ground

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.470 
it's literally growing out of the ground
so<00:00:58.320> there's<00:00:58.980> tremendous<00:00:59.340> fluctuations<00:01:00.300> for

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so there's tremendous fluctuations for

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.930 
so there's tremendous fluctuations for
good<00:01:00.660> reasons<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.199> certain<00:01:01.680> things<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
good reasons for certain things you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
good reasons for certain things you
might<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.239> taken<00:01:03.359> advantage<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:04.049> vacations

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
will be substantially more expensive so

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.510 
will be substantially more expensive so
are<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.229> same<00:01:13.500> fluctuations<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
