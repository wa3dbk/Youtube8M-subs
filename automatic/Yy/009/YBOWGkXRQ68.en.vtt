so let's go
I<00:05:44.290> don't<00:05:45.290> know<00:05:45.350> if<00:05:45.410> this<00:05:45.560> video<00:05:45.920> will<00:05:46.070> do<00:05:46.220> it

I don't know if this video will do it

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.050 
I don't know if this video will do it
justice<00:05:47.120> because<00:05:47.360> this<00:05:47.660> is<00:05:47.810> such<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.110> beautiful

and we'll turn off the sound here for a

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.410 
and we'll turn off the sound here for a
second<00:05:55.460> because<00:05:55.490> you<00:05:55.730> really<00:05:55.940> don't<00:05:56.030> need<00:05:56.270> it

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420
