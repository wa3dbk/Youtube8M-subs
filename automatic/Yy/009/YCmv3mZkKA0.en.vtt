promised you mentioned PR review units
so<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.030> normally<00:01:24.299> don't<00:01:24.450> come<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so they normally don't come with the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.020 
so they normally don't come with the
wrapping<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.380> tape<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.759> priest

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
wrapping and tape and and the priest

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940 
wrapping and tape and and the priest
stuff<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.450> keeps<00:01:27.659> them<00:01:27.900> secure<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
stuff that keeps them secure as you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
stuff that keeps them secure as you
would<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> bought<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> shelf

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
would if you bought this off the shelf

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.060 
would if you bought this off the shelf
so<00:01:30.900> you'll<00:01:31.110> notice<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.380> these<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.710> kind<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so you'll notice that these are kind of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
so you'll notice that these are kind of
loosely<00:01:32.340> wrapped<00:01:32.700> both<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> camera<00:01:33.930> body<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
loosely wrapped both the camera body and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.140 
loosely wrapped both the camera body and
the<00:01:34.590> lens<00:01:34.799> you'll<00:01:35.070> probably<00:01:35.250> get<00:01:35.490> much<00:01:35.970> better

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the lens you'll probably get much better

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
the lens you'll probably get much better

essentially what you're looking at
effective<00:03:13.670> pixels<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.390> 2.4

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
effective pixels on this is 2.4

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.250 
effective pixels on this is 2.4
megapixels<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:18.090> weight<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.389> fairly<00:03:18.630> light

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
megapixels the weight is fairly light

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.940 
megapixels the weight is fairly light
it's<00:03:19.700> 200<00:03:20.700> grams<00:03:21.030> on<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:22.410> very<00:03:22.650> light

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
it's 200 grams on it so it's very light

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.080 
it's 200 grams on it so it's very light
on<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.549> unit<00:03:24.239> itself<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:26.340> course<00:03:26.609> this<00:03:26.760> 50

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
on the unit itself and of course this 50

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.849 
on the unit itself and of course this 50
lens<00:03:27.329> mount<00:03:27.660> now<00:03:27.930> that's<00:03:28.200> sort<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.500> good<00:03:28.829> stuff

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
lens mount now that's sort of good stuff

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.819 
lens mount now that's sort of good stuff
so<00:03:29.480> it's<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.600> beautiful<00:03:30.840> little<00:03:31.170> camera<00:03:31.680> it

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
so it's a beautiful little camera it

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.309 
so it's a beautiful little camera it
took<00:03:32.040> exceptional<00:03:32.940> pictures<00:03:33.329> for<00:03:33.600> us<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:33.930> of

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
took exceptional pictures for us and of

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.080 
took exceptional pictures for us and of
course<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.769> got<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.040> viewfinder<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.880> the
