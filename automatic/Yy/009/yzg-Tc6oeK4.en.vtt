00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
well g'day welcome back to tractor

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.840 
well g'day welcome back to tractor
school<00:00:03.259> today<00:00:04.259> we're<00:00:04.950> going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.400> have<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> look

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
school today we're going to have a look

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.879 
school today we're going to have a look
at<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> looping<00:00:06.600> features<00:00:07.049> on<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.259> tractor<00:00:07.649> Pro

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
at the looping features on a tractor Pro

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.110 
at the looping features on a tractor Pro
basic<00:00:10.889> looping<00:00:11.250> first<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.820> then<00:00:11.910> we'll<00:00:12.000> go

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
basic looping first and then we'll go

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.879 
basic looping first and then we'll go
into<00:00:12.269> something<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.929> little<00:00:13.469> bit<00:00:13.710> more

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
into something a little bit more

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.609 
into something a little bit more
advanced<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.870> here's<00:00:15.870> your<00:00:15.990> loop<00:00:16.139> functions

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
advanced so here's your loop functions

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.830 
advanced so here's your loop functions
here<00:00:17.480> these<00:00:18.480> ones<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:19.730> they<00:00:20.730> these<00:00:21.420> numbers

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
here these ones here they these numbers

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.980 
here these ones here they these numbers
correspond<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.010> beats<00:00:23.600> press<00:00:24.600> any<00:00:24.869> of

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
correspond to the beats press any of

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.679 
correspond to the beats press any of
these<00:00:25.140> buttons<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.279> will<00:00:26.430> loop<00:00:26.689> those

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
these buttons and it will loop those

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.569 
these buttons and it will loop those
around<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> beats<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.300> press<00:00:30.480> Paul<00:00:31.579> will

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
around the beats so for press Paul will

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.430 
around the beats so for press Paul will
automatically<00:00:33.210> loop<00:00:33.860> four<00:00:34.860> beats<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:37.110> turn<00:00:37.290> it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
automatically loop four beats to turn it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.190 
automatically loop four beats to turn it
off<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.940> click<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> again<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.809> we'll<00:00:40.050> go

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
off you click it again and we'll go

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.119 
off you click it again and we'll go
right<00:00:40.379> past<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:42.559> alright<00:00:43.559> sounds<00:00:43.800> simple

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
right past it alright sounds simple

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.170 
right past it alright sounds simple
enough

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:01:05.000 

can<00:00:51.180> muck<00:00:51.360> around<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:51.780> it<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.530> just

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
can muck around with it so that's just

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.300 
can muck around with it so that's just
basically<00:01:05.400> looping<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> fly<00:01:06.360> okay

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
basically looping on the fly okay

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.109 
basically looping on the fly okay
piece<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.340> cake<00:01:08.610> yeah<00:01:09.890> now<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.130> also<00:01:11.280> use

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
piece of cake yeah now you can also use

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.359 
piece of cake yeah now you can also use
these<00:01:12.390> buttons<00:01:12.659> over<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.619> make<00:01:14.070> any

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
these buttons over here and make any

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.149 
these buttons over here and make any
length<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.000> loop<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.360> want<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
length of the loop you want so if you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.679 
length of the loop you want so if you
press<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.729> let's<00:01:18.119> obviously<00:01:18.450> where<00:01:18.570> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
press in let's obviously where it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
press in let's obviously where it's
gonna<00:01:18.810> start<00:01:19.080> looping<00:01:19.320> yeah<00:01:20.000> press<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
gonna start looping yeah press in and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.630 
gonna start looping yeah press in and
then<00:01:23.640> press<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.689> that'll<00:01:27.689> loop<00:01:28.369> as<00:01:29.369> long

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
then press out and that'll loop as long

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.200 
then press out and that'll loop as long
as<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.909> want<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> loop<00:01:32.090> until<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
as you want it to loop until you

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.840 
as you want it to loop until you
deactivate<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.049> over<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.100> activates

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
deactivate it over here activates

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.380 
deactivate it over here activates
highlighted<00:01:36.450> click<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.700> it'll<00:01:38.700> go<00:01:38.850> right<00:01:39.060> past

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
highlighted click it it'll go right past

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.139 
highlighted click it it'll go right past
it<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:40.680> that's<00:01:40.829> basic<00:01:42.409> looping<00:01:43.670> very<00:01:44.670> similar

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
it so that's basic looping very similar

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.980 
it so that's basic looping very similar
to<00:01:45.420> every<00:01:45.869> other<00:01:45.990> program<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.770> yeah<00:01:47.990> ok

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to every other program out there yeah ok

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.050 
to every other program out there yeah ok
let's<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.799> into<00:01:50.159> something<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> little<00:01:50.939> bit

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
let's go into something a little bit

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.649 
let's go into something a little bit
more<00:01:51.299> advanced<00:01:51.860> say<00:01:53.210> you're<00:01:54.210> at<00:01:54.299> home<00:01:54.450> you're

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
more advanced say you're at home you're

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
more advanced say you're at home you're
preparing<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.350> set<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> gig<00:01:56.310> tonight

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
preparing a set for a gig tonight

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.149 
preparing a set for a gig tonight
and<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.990> know<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.560> certain<00:01:58.740> part<00:01:59.070> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
and you know there's a certain part of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.410 
and you know there's a certain part of
the<00:01:59.219> song<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> want<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.270> loop<00:02:01.969> so<00:02:02.969> to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the song that you want to loop so to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.609 
the song that you want to loop so to
make<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.689> easy<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.020> yourself<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.500> can

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
make it easy for yourself you can

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.649 
make it easy for yourself you can
pre-program<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.850> loop

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
pre-program this loop

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.930 
pre-program this loop
like<00:02:08.289> I've<00:02:08.470> done<00:02:08.500> here<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:09.310> loop<00:02:09.550> was

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
like I've done here this loop was

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.120 
like I've done here this loop was
pre-programmed<00:02:10.420> earlier<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.709> as<00:02:11.770> soon<00:02:11.950> as<00:02:12.069> it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
pre-programmed earlier so as soon as it

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.979 
pre-programmed earlier so as soon as it
gets<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.520> green<00:02:12.849> marker<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:19.360> will<00:02:19.510> loop<00:02:19.720> on

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
gets to the green marker it will loop on

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.770 
gets to the green marker it will loop on
its<00:02:20.200> own<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.970> long<00:02:22.030> as<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:23.530> active<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.750> that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
its own as long as it's active so that

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.960 
its own as long as it's active so that
will<00:02:26.140> stop<00:02:26.620> looping<00:02:26.830> when<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.370> hit<00:02:28.590> action<00:02:29.970> so

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
will stop looping when I hit action so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.140 
will stop looping when I hit action so
it's<00:02:31.150> not<00:02:31.300> activated<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:33.519> should<00:02:33.760> go<00:02:33.910> right

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
it's not activated it should go right

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850 
it's not activated it should go right
past<00:02:34.180> Melbourne<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.530> don't<00:02:35.650> have<00:02:35.739> to

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
past Melbourne so you don't have to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.680 
past Melbourne so you don't have to
worry<00:02:41.580> now<00:02:43.680> how<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.099> that
