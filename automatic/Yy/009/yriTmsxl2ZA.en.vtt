why we watch this he wasn't in the suit
he<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> Batman<00:01:34.710> suit<00:01:34.950> he<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.400> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
he was in the Batman suit he was and it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
he was in the Batman suit he was and it
was<00:01:35.790> cool<00:01:36.479> seeing<00:01:36.780> how<00:01:36.990> Batman

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
was cool seeing how Batman

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.380 
was cool seeing how Batman
he's<00:01:38.100> actually<00:01:38.490> pissed<00:01:38.700> off<00:01:38.880> with<00:01:38.970> Superman

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
he's actually pissed off with Superman

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
he's actually pissed off with Superman
as<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.600> great<00:01:39.780> legitimate<00:01:40.259> reason<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.650> be<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
as a great legitimate reason to be that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
as a great legitimate reason to be that
was<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.759> emotional<00:01:42.180> core<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.869> trailer

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
was the emotional core of that trailer

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.330 
was the emotional core of that trailer
and<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:43.979> awesome<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and I think it's going to be awesome in

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.020 
and I think it's going to be awesome in
the<00:01:44.430> movie
