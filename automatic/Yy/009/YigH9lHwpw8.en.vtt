ghazan<00:00:11.940> symbols<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> handcart<00:00:13.139> symbol<00:00:13.500> out

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
ghazan symbols are a handcart symbol out

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.460 
ghazan symbols are a handcart symbol out
of<00:00:13.980> China<00:00:14.280> they<00:00:15.150> use<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.480> age-old<00:00:15.929> century

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
of China they use the age-old century

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.019 
of China they use the age-old century
technique<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.039> make<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.310> symbols<00:00:17.699> which<00:00:17.850> is

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
technique to make the symbols which is

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.170 
technique to make the symbols which is
not<00:00:18.240> commonly<00:00:18.750> found<00:00:18.840> these<00:00:19.230> days<00:00:19.520> they<00:00:20.520> melt

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
not commonly found these days they melt

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.120 
not commonly found these days they melt
the<00:00:21.300> cast<00:00:21.539> by<00:00:21.779> hand<00:00:22.080> they<00:00:22.439> machine<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:22.980> by

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the cast by hand they machine them by

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160 
the cast by hand they machine them by
hand<00:00:23.460> they're<00:00:23.880> hand<00:00:24.180> hammered<00:00:24.510> by<00:00:24.660> hand

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
hand they're hand hammered by hand

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.890 
hand they're hand hammered by hand
so<00:00:25.830> each<00:00:26.070> Kazan<00:00:26.519> symbol<00:00:26.910> has<00:00:27.060> its<00:00:27.240> own<00:00:27.510> unique

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
so each Kazan symbol has its own unique

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.870 
so each Kazan symbol has its own unique
tone<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.310> that's<00:00:29.429> what's<00:00:29.640> great<00:00:29.789> about

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
