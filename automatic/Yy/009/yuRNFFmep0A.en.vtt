but keep in mind that each one of these

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.670 
but keep in mind that each one of these
items<00:03:27.579> here<00:03:27.939> can<00:03:28.449> only<00:03:28.569> hold<00:03:28.870> one<00:03:28.989> set<00:03:29.530> of

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.020 
items here can only hold one set of
items<00:03:29.829> so<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.459> only<00:03:30.579> hold<00:03:30.759> either

diamond<00:03:31.659> ore<00:03:31.870> coal<00:03:32.409> you<00:03:32.919> can<00:03:33.009> only<00:03:33.099> hold<00:03:33.280> one

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
diamond ore coal you can only hold one

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.009 
diamond ore coal you can only hold one
type<00:03:33.879> of<00:03:34.120> item<00:03:34.389> which<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.659> kind<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:34.959> a

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
type of item which is kind of a

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.229 
type of item which is kind of a
disadvantage<00:03:35.349> but<00:03:35.889> it's<00:03:36.430> an<00:03:36.549> extension<00:03:36.819> chest

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
disadvantage but it's an extension chest

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.849 
disadvantage but it's an extension chest
so<00:03:37.419> I<00:03:37.449> mean<00:03:37.689> if<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:37.930> guys<00:03:38.079> had<00:03:38.259> a<00:03:38.290> full<00:03:38.560> chest

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
so I mean if you guys had a full chest

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.920 
so I mean if you guys had a full chest
of<00:03:39.009> something<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.879> go<00:03:40.090> ahead<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.389> you<00:03:40.659> know

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
of something you go ahead and you know

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.479 
of something you go ahead and you know
pull<00:03:41.259> out<00:03:41.349> an<00:03:41.470> extension<00:03:41.889> chest<00:03:42.099> and<00:03:42.250> extend

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
pull out an extension chest and extend

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.770 
pull out an extension chest and extend
it<00:03:42.639> and<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.879> can<00:03:43.000> get<00:03:43.150> something<00:03:43.509> like<00:03:43.629> this

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
it and you can get something like this

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.869 
it and you can get something like this
where<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.049> only<00:03:44.169> takes<00:03:44.409> up<00:03:44.590> one<00:03:44.769> block<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
where it only takes up one block and it

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.699
