serozha<00:01:47.079> Beach<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.619> Sara's<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.009> nice

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
serozha Beach to Sara's a nice

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.059 
serozha Beach to Sara's a nice
brokenhearted<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.209> go<00:01:49.329> I<00:01:49.709> think<00:01:50.709> that<00:01:50.889> was<00:01:51.039> a

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
brokenhearted to go I think that was a

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.870 
brokenhearted to go I think that was a
fine<00:01:51.369> line<00:01:51.639> that<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:52.299> Nick<00:01:52.479> Stoller<00:01:53.759> kept<00:01:54.759> me

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
riding I think it was difficult because

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.660 
riding I think it was difficult because
you<00:01:56.679> want<00:01:56.859> to<00:01:56.920> make<00:01:57.069> her<00:01:57.159> as<00:01:57.249> funny<00:01:57.520> as

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
show a little bit of vulnerability if

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.160 
show a little bit of vulnerability if
you<00:02:08.350> expect<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.770> audience<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:10.050> find<00:02:11.050> her

you expect the audience to find her
appealing<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:11.980> think<00:02:12.130> he<00:02:12.459> just<00:02:13.110> he

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
appealing and so I think he just he

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.450 
appealing and so I think he just he
allowed<00:02:14.379> all<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.799> those<00:02:14.920> moments

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
allowed all of those moments

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.330 
allowed all of those moments
be<00:02:15.580> shown<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.240> was<00:02:16.360> more<00:02:16.480> shaped<00:02:16.750> in

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
be shown I think that was more shaped in

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.910 
be shown I think that was more shaped in
