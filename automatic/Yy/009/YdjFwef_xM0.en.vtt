00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hey i show my favorite today 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.859
 hair care products for curls 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.929
 and I'm going over from shampoo 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.450
 care products to styling so in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.080
 then use the following would I 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.869
 at the moment of barea professional this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 lure shampoo and I have too 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.990
 the right conditioner and these two 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.019
 I can really do a lot together 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.539
 Recommend and of the same series 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.149
 so also from barea professional that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.399
 These meadow are shiny in so wore 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.629
 on the repair shampoo i know now 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.559
 not exactly as it is said that is so 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.059
 brown brown brown also allowed that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.480
 Shampoo and the rinse of it I find 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.730
 very well 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.360
 and then from the normal balea 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.840
 Schampus the spring sketch with 40 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.320
 now it's mango and aloe vera for 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.930
 dry hair as the shampoo and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 The flush I find very good but am 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.640
 Best of all, this one knows 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.820
 I am very tempting then to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.100
 Thief has container or simply haarkur 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.560
 I of garnier fructis harm this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:21.540
 holes cool 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:23.070
 that's in big tanks i find 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.320
 In any case very good and then have 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.720
 I still recommend all of Rossmann 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.100
 from the natural brand of osman so of 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:36.060
 Altera there is such a hair cure with 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.890
 Pomegranate and aloe vera I believe and 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.960
 I think that's especially good because it is 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.439
 nature things are so they are not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.939
 silicones in there and so that cares for the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.700
 Hair is also very good and it smells too 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.470
 really amazing and the church 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.869
 Highly recommend and last so 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.409
 Area hair treatments would be homemade 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.030
 chur 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.799
 I think that's best because 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.079
 so it's just the most natural, the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.170
 really not chemical in there and then 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.110
 you can do the three where you do that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.930
 Just good for your hair if you like 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.280
 to see maybe a few recipes 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.959
 I want to write in the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.310
 comments and then I'll show you 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.849
 pair 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.020
 So now he is styling and me 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.420
 start now with libya 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.430
 conditioner so as a dear conditioner 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.690
 Can I recommend one of the barea 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.230
 really good for me 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.270
 that works from this one of the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.580
 same series as the shampoo this 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.060
 manko and aloe vera shampoo for dry 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.319
 hair 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.989
 that's such a moisturizing milk for 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.760
 dry hair and that cares for the hair 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.069
 very good and just gave them the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.110
 Moisture throughout the day and helps 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.730
 also the curls to define something more 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.010
 I had one more love I could 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.910
 one of about the same consistency 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.540
 like valea so it is 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.620
 both pretty fluid and though is 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:04.400
 it simply speaks of fig believe us 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:07.340
 I also read this lush girls 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.620
 cream yes they were at earlier at 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.730
 to buy douglas but I believe that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.530
 the meanwhile from the assortment 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.040
 so have taken a year ago in 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.709
 they still had and yes I have there 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.320
 I did an internship and I have this 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.430
 I get a bottle as a gift 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.959
 not if she just bought me that way 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.420
 because this size costs about 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.350
 30 euro 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.569
 and I have to say I thought so too 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.950
 really very good so now 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.640
 almost empty is still a very solid 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.560
 in the middle 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.230
 I think that 's the only way 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.019
 still on the internet to buy so on ebay 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.609
 she still believed me and you have to 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.230
 you just have a look if you think so 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.530
 that you deliver a viscous 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.450
 I could then needs nothing 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.680
 if you look in the drugstore area because 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.359
 I do not want anything 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.120
 So I'll find myself now 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.920
 First of all , look again and yes 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.139
 then I can still find something 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.450
 then show you 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:04.250
 but otherwise you really have to abo 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.989
 shops are watching so there you will 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.910
 Guaranteed what to find in the now 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.830
 So foamy 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.260
 I recommend foam stabilizer now 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.630
 generally not because it just for me 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.100
 hair very very very dehydrated though 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.120
 if it is not you then you can 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.130
 her so use it well 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.620
 yes so what always lures me with it 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.320
 was very well defined by pantene 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:29.800
 pro-v the bells pure foam firm 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.700
 and then sometimes I still use 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.760
 this one I would now 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:40.520
 already shown a few times by gabi 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:42.830
 volume initiating volume ii sees this 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.270
 volume ii sieren de 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.930
 that was wrong mobilizing volumes 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.100
 do not care 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.910
 Definitely this plus flat tvs 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.320
 I sometimes use that too and that 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.900
 I also defined it very well and it 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.880
 Smells the last delicious 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.510
 products that I consider very important for 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.600
 oils are enticing and I have them now 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.310
 already tried a lot now as 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.990
 I had tried the last one of 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.870
 l'oreal this one here 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.370
 I once had that for colored 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.320
 hair and then the one where I do that 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.610
 Label agreed in any case 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.200
 I think that's why this is better 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.780
 golden lid so sometimes i look 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.980
 I think everyone had it all 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.860
 the golden lid I find personally 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.240
 preferably 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.840
 and what I am doing right now 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.210
 use is of pays i know 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.980
 not if you know the brand so that's it 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.110
 There are not so many shops of them 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.330
 you can only get most of it 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.250
 internet and in the gloss box is also 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.350
 sometimes in there 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.640
 I have a hairy mask that 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.640
 means bad hair day 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.030
 the special thing about them is just as well 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.760
 that they are only natural products 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.240
 So use ciabatta cocoa butter 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.630
 Coconut oil and so what these really 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.680
 very good for the rake and that's it 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.780
 a bit more expensive 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.440
 the cost I think 15 euros this size 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.990
 But here it is worth it for me 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.580
 really that really lasts a long time and me 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.680
 it's just worth it 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.440
 Hair really cares very well what you do 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.440
 Of course you can use it as well 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.090
 natural oils so coconut oil or macho 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.010
 also use olive oil 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.780
 I personally still have olive oil 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.280
 not tried it because I think 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.710
 somehow that does not smell right now 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.060
 so good and I know if that 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.460
 then not finished because looks like 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:38.500
 olive oil very thick greasy oily 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.180
 has consistency and that's why I have 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.620
 I have not tried it myself yet 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.180
 actually all the products were me 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.310
 I can recommend you at the moment 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.350
 but try some at the moment 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.990
 other things and if I already there 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.640
 then tried a bit more 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.290
 I will definitely be metal 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.060
 if you have some for the products 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.920
 Tried or maybe you 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:00.060
 can recommend more products then 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.060
