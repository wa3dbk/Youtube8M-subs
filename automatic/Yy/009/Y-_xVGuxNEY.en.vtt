find<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.330> much<00:02:52.110> better<00:02:52.320> fuel<00:02:52.680> economy<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.190> a

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
bigger tank and this transmission this

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.090 
bigger tank and this transmission this
is<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.530> car<00:02:55.739> much<00:02:56.190> much<00:02:56.670> broader<00:02:57.150> appeal<00:02:58.100> the

is a car much much broader appeal the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.680 
is a car much much broader appeal the
chassis<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> transmission<00:03:00.300> and<00:03:00.569> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
chassis and the transmission and the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.570 
chassis and the transmission and the
steering<00:03:00.930> all<00:03:01.319> have<00:03:01.620> three<00:03:01.890> settings<00:03:02.190> so<00:03:02.550> you

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
steering all have three settings so you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.210 
steering all have three settings so you
can<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.239> comfort<00:03:04.020> or<00:03:04.200> sport<00:03:04.500> or<00:03:04.709> Sport+

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
can have a comfort or sport or Sport+

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.090 
can have a comfort or sport or Sport+
setting<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.260> lot<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.500> choice<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.070> a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
setting so there's a lot of choice is a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.130 
setting so there's a lot of choice is a
car<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.459> through<00:03:09.000> its<00:03:09.150> calibration<00:03:09.510> can

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
car that through its calibration can

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.140 
car that through its calibration can
offer<00:03:10.410> three<00:03:10.830> very<00:03:11.160> different<00:03:11.610> characters

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
offer three very different characters

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.300 
offer three very different characters
and<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:13.200> think<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.530> means<00:03:13.739> it's<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.130> be

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
and I think that means it's going to be

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:25.160 
and I think that means it's going to be
very<00:03:14.970> very<00:03:15.269> popular<00:03:15.570> indeed<00:03:17.269> is<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.480> fast<00:03:18.840> well

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
summarize by saying this this car feels

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.150 
summarize by saying this this car feels
to<00:03:56.800> me<00:03:56.830> like<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.580> successor<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.540> e39<00:03:59.260> m5<00:03:59.890> and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
to me like a successor to the e39 m5 and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.510 
to me like a successor to the e39 m5 and
not<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.670> successor<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.480> e60<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.430> a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
not a successor to the e60 and that is a

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.880 
not a successor to the e60 and that is a
crucial<00:04:03.970> distinction<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.930> means<00:04:05.590> it's<00:04:05.800> a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
crucial distinction that means it's a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.180 
crucial distinction that means it's a
better<00:04:06.100> all-round<00:04:06.700> car<00:04:07.300> so<00:04:07.780> can't<00:04:08.620> wait<00:04:08.950> till
