00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.950
 with scissors they walked somewhere nearby 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.350

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.940
 professional prosecutor playing these

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.190
 the barber when he tried to make me 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:23.950

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.220
 return without any problems I think 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.140

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.020

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.080
 in fact so that so the second time 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.070
 not so scary to play but the first one 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.810
 since it was a very quiet head 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.390
 quiet quiet 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.280
 head is quiet but the question is not to play 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.320
 scary the first time was even enough 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.390
 a little shy to chop this good 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.640

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.770
