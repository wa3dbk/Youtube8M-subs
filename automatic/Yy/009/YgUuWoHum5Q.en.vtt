we loved it because it was such an

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.350 
we loved it because it was such an
atypical<00:00:31.109> element<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.550> fantasy<00:00:32.969> world

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
most high fantasy but it was so well

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.510 
most high fantasy but it was so well
drawn<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.809> felt<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> grounded<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
drawn and felt like it grounded the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
always behind the scenes so we've heard

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.150

to<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> iron<00:00:55.079> bank<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.620> we've<00:00:56.160> heard<00:00:56.309> others

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
to the iron bank and we've heard others

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.849 
to the iron bank and we've heard others
refer<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.289> haven't<00:00:58.440> seen<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.710> yet

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
refer to it but we haven't seen it yet

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.650 
refer to it but we haven't seen it yet

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and so it was important for us to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.150 
and so it was important for us to
finally<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> sense<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:02.039> this

those<00:05:13.790> four<00:05:14.090> points<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.690> contention<00:05:15.170> if<00:05:15.530> you

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
those four points of contention if you

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.950 
those four points of contention if you
will<00:05:15.800> so<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.640> was<00:05:16.790> very<00:05:16.910> important<00:05:17.330> for<00:05:17.450> us<00:05:17.510> to

will so it was very important for us to

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.380 
will so it was very important for us to
be<00:05:18.080> able<00:05:18.170> to<00:05:18.440> constantly<00:05:18.710> a<00:05:18.950> bounce<00:05:19.880> both<00:05:20.180> off

of these characters and see what

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.430 
of these characters and see what

on<00:05:24.890> him<00:05:25.100> he<00:05:25.790> slapped<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.210> King<00:05:26.390> across<00:05:26.480> the

a fool

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.860 
a fool
I<00:05:30.110> think<00:05:30.890> if<00:05:31.010> Tyrion<00:05:31.370> has<00:05:31.670> a<00:05:31.700> tragic<00:05:32.360> flaw<00:05:32.810> it

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
I think if Tyrion has a tragic flaw it

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.810 
I think if Tyrion has a tragic flaw it
may<00:05:33.140> be<00:05:33.200> that<00:05:33.530> he<00:05:33.620> sometimes<00:05:34.160> lets<00:05:34.610> his

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
may be that he sometimes lets his

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.470 
may be that he sometimes lets his
distaste<00:05:35.510> for<00:05:36.190> hypocrisy<00:05:37.190> and<00:05:37.490> stupidity<00:05:38.000> get

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
distaste for hypocrisy and stupidity get

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.940 
distaste for hypocrisy and stupidity get
