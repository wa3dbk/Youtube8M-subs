play<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.519> aggressively<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.420> sniper<00:00:27.689> rifles

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
play so aggressively with sniper rifles

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.140 
play so aggressively with sniper rifles
instead<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.189> traditional<00:00:29.220> playstyle

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
instead of a more traditional playstyle

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.600

a more realistic play style why do we
snipe<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.090> much<00:00:33.300> instead<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.930> using<00:00:34.170> SMGs<00:00:35.160> or

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
snipe so much instead of using SMGs or

much<00:00:41.340> since<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.730> started<00:00:41.910> sniping<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:42.899> used

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
much since I started sniping I've used

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.340 
much since I started sniping I've used
sniper<00:00:44.160> rifles<00:00:44.690> 90%<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> time<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.230> maybe

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
sniper rifles 90% of the time or maybe

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
sniper rifles 90% of the time or maybe
even<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.770> than<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.270> why<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
even more than that so why is that the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.940 
even more than that so why is that the
case<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.989> why<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> case<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
case and why is that the case with so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.130 
case and why is that the case with so
many<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.309> people<00:00:50.370> I'm<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.690> attempt

miaow if you want but anyways let's get
into<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.100> first<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.390> aggressive

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
into this so first of all the aggressive

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.590 
into this so first of all the aggressive
playstyle<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.650> Call<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> Duty<00:01:08.729> sniping<00:01:09.390> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
playstyle of Call of Duty sniping I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600 
playstyle of Call of Duty sniping I
think<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.619> something<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.340> clearly

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
think is something that is clearly

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.929 
think is something that is clearly
caught<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.680> it's<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.860> effective<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
caught on because it's so effective and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
caught on because it's so effective and
it's<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> most<00:01:15.990> effective<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> play<00:01:16.860> with

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's the most effective way to play with

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
it's the most effective way to play with
the<00:01:17.070> sniper<00:01:17.310> rifle<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.939> opinion<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the sniper rifle in my opinion with the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.630 
the sniper rifle in my opinion with the
size<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> maps<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.920> Call<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.100> Duty<00:01:20.430> which

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
size of the maps in Call of Duty which

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600 
size of the maps in Call of Duty which
makes<00:01:21.000> traditional<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.229> realistic<00:01:22.830> sniping<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
makes traditional or realistic sniping a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.359 
makes traditional or realistic sniping a
bit<00:01:24.240> impractical<00:01:24.600> yes<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.500> snipe<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
bit impractical yes you can snipe in a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070 
bit impractical yes you can snipe in a
realistic<00:01:26.850> way<00:01:27.000> yes<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.450> camp<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.960> lay

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
realistic way yes you can camp and lay

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.350 
realistic way yes you can camp and lay
down<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> map<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.130> snipe

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
down in the back of the map and snipe

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.630 
down in the back of the map and snipe
and<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.780> fairly<00:01:31.020> well<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.520> can

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and you can do fairly well and you can

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.670 
and you can do fairly well and you can
get<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:32.880> kill<00:01:33.090> streaks<00:01:33.329> easily<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.960> calling

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
get your kill streaks easily and calling

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
get your kill streaks easily and calling
your<00:01:34.799> kill<00:01:34.979> streaks<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> ton<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> kills

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
your kill streaks and get a ton of kills

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.270 
your kill streaks and get a ton of kills
with<00:01:36.119> those<00:01:36.299> but<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.710> goes<00:01:37.860> against

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
with those but it kind of goes against

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.170 
with those but it kind of goes against
the<00:01:38.400> grain<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.860> it's<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:41.220> weird<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> play

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the grain and it's a weird way to play

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.969 
the grain and it's a weird way to play
in<00:01:42.420> such<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> fast-paced<00:01:43.079> game<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.590> feels<00:01:43.799> like

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
in such a fast-paced game it feels like

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.319 
in such a fast-paced game it feels like
you're<00:01:44.159> not<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.549> involved<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.060> what

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you're not really involved with what

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.030 
you're not really involved with what
everybody<00:01:45.570> else<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> doing<00:01:46.009> personally<00:01:47.009> I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
everybody else is doing personally I

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980 
everybody else is doing personally I
think<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.909> aggressive<00:01:48.270> playstyle<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.689> caught

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
think the aggressive playstyle is caught

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.600 
think the aggressive playstyle is caught
on<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.680> much<00:01:49.799> fun<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.220> works<00:01:50.399> so

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
on because it's so much fun it works so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.560 
on because it's so much fun it works so
well<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.439> it<00:01:52.439> feels<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.189> how<00:01:53.909> sniping<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
well and it feels like how sniping and

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.620 
well and it feels like how sniping and
Call<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> Duty<00:01:55.020> should<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> next<00:01:57.390> thing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
Call of Duty should be so the next thing

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.800 
Call of Duty should be so the next thing
is<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.380> learning<00:01:58.799> curve<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.280> really<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
is the learning curve I really like the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.780 
is the learning curve I really like the
learning<00:02:00.960> curve<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.469> sniping<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.340> just

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
learning curve of sniping not just

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
learning curve of sniping not just
anybody<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.509> pick<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.899> sniper<00:02:04.079> rifle<00:02:04.380> when

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
anybody can pick up a sniper rifle when

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.749 
anybody can pick up a sniper rifle when
they've<00:02:04.890> never<00:02:04.920> played<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> first-person

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
they've never played a first-person

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.310 
they've never played a first-person
shooter<00:02:05.939> before<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.840> well<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
shooter before and do well with the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.449 
shooter before and do well with the
sniper<00:02:07.530> rifle<00:02:07.649> they're<00:02:07.979> gonna<00:02:08.069> do<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> lot

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
sniper rifle they're gonna do a lot

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.040 
sniper rifle they're gonna do a lot
better<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.849> they're<00:02:09.000> using<00:02:09.270> an<00:02:09.360> SMG<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:09.989> an

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
better if they're using an SMG or an

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.450 
better if they're using an SMG or an
assault<00:02:10.259> rifle<00:02:10.550> because

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
assault rifle because

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.370 
assault rifle because
you<00:02:12.790> have<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.150> practice<00:02:13.600> knifing<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.080> get<00:02:14.230> good

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
you have to practice knifing to get good

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.570 
you have to practice knifing to get good
at<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.770> that's<00:02:14.980> something<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.490> I<00:02:15.520> think

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
at it and that's something that I think

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.490 
at it and that's something that I think
a<00:02:16.000> lot<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.630> people<00:02:16.960> including<00:02:17.380> myself

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
a lot of people including myself

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.970 
a lot of people including myself
obviously<00:02:18.220> really<00:02:19.150> enjoy<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.830> learning

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
obviously really enjoy the learning

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.250 
obviously really enjoy the learning
curve<00:02:21.340> where<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.700> start<00:02:22.270> off<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:22.750> sucking

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
curve where you start off really sucking

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.600 
curve where you start off really sucking
with<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> sniper<00:02:23.710> rifle<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.280> takes<00:02:24.490> a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
with the sniper rifle and it takes a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.420 
with the sniper rifle and it takes a
while<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.820> build<00:02:25.330> up<00:02:25.710> your<00:02:26.710> skills<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.220> be<00:02:27.340> able

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
while to build up your skills to be able

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.980 
while to build up your skills to be able
to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:27.850> well<00:02:28.090> with<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.300> sniper<00:02:28.510> rifle<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:28.900> do

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
to do well with the sniper rifle and do

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.630 
to do well with the sniper rifle and do
just<00:02:29.260> as<00:02:29.350> well<00:02:29.410> as<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.860> would<00:02:30.070> be<00:02:30.190> able<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.400> do

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
just as well as you would be able to do

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.170 
just as well as you would be able to do
with<00:02:31.270> an<00:02:31.560> SMG<00:02:32.560> or<00:02:32.770> an<00:02:32.950> assault<00:02:33.190> rifle<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.760> then

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
with an SMG or an assault rifle and then

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.940 
with an SMG or an assault rifle and then
you<00:02:34.390> get<00:02:34.660> other<00:02:35.110> people<00:02:35.680> you're<00:02:35.830> playing

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
you get other people you're playing

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.260 
you get other people you're playing
against<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.430> random<00:02:36.730> people<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.120> lobby

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
against the random people in the lobby

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.940 
against the random people in the lobby
getting<00:02:37.480> frustrated<00:02:38.170> when<00:02:38.350> you're<00:02:38.560> doing<00:02:38.800> so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
getting frustrated when you're doing so

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.070 
getting frustrated when you're doing so
well<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.340> they<00:02:39.460> try<00:02:39.700> out<00:02:39.850> they<00:02:40.540> try<00:02:40.600> out<00:02:40.840> using

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
well and they try out they try out using

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.660 
well and they try out they try out using
a<00:02:41.140> sniper<00:02:41.350> rifle<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.800> they<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.190> get<00:02:42.340> slapped

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
a sniper rifle and they just get slapped

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.550 
a sniper rifle and they just get slapped
because<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.180> takes<00:02:43.330> some<00:02:43.450> practice<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.470> need

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
because it takes some practice you need

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.260 
because it takes some practice you need
to<00:02:44.710> put<00:02:44.830> some<00:02:44.980> time<00:02:45.160> in<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.370> into<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.120> get

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
to put some time in it into it to get

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.030 
to put some time in it into it to get
actually<00:02:46.810> good<00:02:46.990> at<00:02:47.110> using<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.410> sniper<00:02:47.590> rifle<00:02:47.770> so

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
actually good at using a sniper rifle so

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.130 
actually good at using a sniper rifle so
that's<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.430> thing<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.030> really<00:02:49.930> enjoy

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.570 
that's one thing that I really enjoy
about<00:02:50.170> sniping<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.830> still<00:02:51.100> feel<00:02:51.280> like<00:02:51.430> I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
can improve my sniping I don't feel like

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.870 
can improve my sniping I don't feel like
I<00:02:53.470> ever<00:02:53.590> reach<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:54.010> plateau<00:02:54.220> with<00:02:54.550> sniping

I ever reach a plateau with sniping
where<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.180> where<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> can't<00:02:56.020> get<00:02:56.140> any<00:02:56.380> better

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
where I can where I can't get any better

really are and it motivates me to try
and<00:03:05.140> get<00:03:05.260> better<00:03:05.350> at<00:03:05.560> sniping<00:03:05.710> myself<00:03:06.190> all<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
and get better at sniping myself all the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.230 
and get better at sniping myself all the
time<00:03:06.810> there's<00:03:07.810> always<00:03:08.020> room<00:03:08.260> for<00:03:08.290> improvement

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
time there's always room for improvement

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.540 
time there's always room for improvement

so the next thing is competition with my
friends<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.570> started<00:03:13.870> off<00:03:14.080> with<00:03:14.230> real-life

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
friends so it started off with real-life

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.110 
friends so it started off with real-life
friends<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.070> guess<00:03:15.220> around<00:03:15.370> modern<00:03:15.790> warfare<00:03:15.940> 2

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
friends I guess around modern warfare 2

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.760 
friends I guess around modern warfare 2
where<00:03:16.570> they<00:03:16.720> would<00:03:16.870> be<00:03:17.020> quick<00:03:17.230> scoping<00:03:17.650> and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
where they would be quick scoping and

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.930 
where they would be quick scoping and
stuff<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.460> was<00:03:18.580> trying<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.880> get

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
into it and obviously they were a bit

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.630 
into it and obviously they were a bit
better<00:03:20.590> because<00:03:20.830> they'd<00:03:21.100> been<00:03:21.250> doing<00:03:21.460> it<00:03:21.550> for

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
better because they'd been doing it for

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.300 
better because they'd been doing it for

that<00:04:37.420> well<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.590> mean<00:04:38.650> people<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.190> hit<00:04:39.310> seven

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
that well I mean people have hit seven

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.090 
that well I mean people have hit seven
on<00:04:39.730> screens<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.420> guess<00:04:41.260> I<00:04:41.440> can<00:04:41.620> compare<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.070> a

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
on screens I guess I can compare to a

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.810 
on screens I guess I can compare to a
six<00:04:42.340> oddity<00:04:42.580> anyways<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.280> next<00:04:45.430> thing<00:04:45.640> is

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
six oddity anyways so the next thing is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.610 
six oddity anyways so the next thing is
some<00:04:46.420> people<00:04:46.660> want<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.990> stamp<00:04:47.230> of<00:04:47.470> approval

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
some people want the stamp of approval

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.370 
some people want the stamp of approval
of<00:04:48.040> being<00:04:48.250> in<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.430> clan<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:48.910> that<00:04:49.900> takes<00:04:50.170> a<00:04:50.260> lot

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
of being in a clan and that takes a lot

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.600 
of being in a clan and that takes a lot
of<00:04:50.410> work<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.770> think<00:04:50.890> some<00:04:51.190> people<00:04:51.280> really

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
of work so I think some people really

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.340 
of work so I think some people really
enjoy<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.120> grind<00:04:52.390> of<00:04:52.660> trying<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.080> get<00:04:53.230> into
