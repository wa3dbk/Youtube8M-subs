00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 I was two guys who see how they are and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.339
 be all welcome again the day 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.200
 today we are back with something 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.000
 quite interesting enough I'm going to 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.559
 talk about what is the version of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 plants against zombies garden guard see 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.790
 for pc something of which many people 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.619
 they are already anxious about this there are some 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.760
 people which was their only way 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.949
 to get to this game by the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.990
 PC version and guys are about 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.220
 very but very few days of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.810
 get to what this is 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.460
 We are confirmed in the family 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 released what is an official trailer it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.060
 have already seen what are a few 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.679
 gameplay captures of what would be the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.600
 version of this game already as such 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.860
 running on a computer so 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.300
 girls let's give a little about 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.430
 this background we're going to have some 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 small screenshots in which 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.300
 we can appreciate the version 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.620
 of pc we have it out there in the part 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.210
 lower right of the screen the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 controls what are the skills 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 that they can use with the characters and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 note that we no longer see the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.110
 xbox buttons like us what 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.789
 we know however they appear now 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.829
 what are the controls that would be in 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.660
 the pc note that the skills are going 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.760
 to be using by the first 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.770
 numerical buttons from 1 to 3 as 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.210
 can you already have there and nothing guys 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.710
 you will notice that it is a map 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.360
 completely different from those that are 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.740
 Today we know that's 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.120
 because just with what this new 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.040
 version of what is being asked against 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.080
 zombies for pc is added what is a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 new map a new dynamic map like this 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 it was like it's called a new map 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 dynamic which we do not have a little bit 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.980
 that is inspired as that between the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.560
 old this between what they are like a 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.900
 type mines there is even a train which 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.430
 it passes practically to half of all the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.780
 map traverses the map what a train is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.100
 which will be happening 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.080
 continuously so that it is a 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.880
 map so completely dynamic there 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.770
 changes even throughout all 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.510
 the games and nothing looks pretty good 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 very well very well inspired to what is 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.470
 the theme of what is this game so 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.850
 guys we are talking about what 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.860
 would be the pc version of plants against 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.570
 zombies would arrive in what are two 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.190
 different giving the no about the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 normal version the common version the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.670
 version that we or the majority of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.899
 people know of the most games without 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 However, it would also reach what would be 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.890
 a version a little bit could be said 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.060
 that with more content 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.950
 we are talking about the version 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.780
 deluxe so from games guys we have 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.860
 what is the normal version comes out the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.060
 normal version of the truth is against 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.990
 zombies which has a cost 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.369
 approximate of 18 with 99 dollars goes out 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.789
 we will be able to acquire this through 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.340
 the origin page know that origin 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.900
 you could say by which 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.430
 can be acquired through the servers 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.469
 in which to be able to play this 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.730
 in multiplayer and the following impression 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.829
 which I am already talking about 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.120
 of the deluxe version saleh know that 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.129
 these versions or these games are 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.920
 obviously digital and that has a 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.720
 approximate cost of $ 21.99 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.069
 there really is not much difference and 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.870
 Now let's see a little bit about 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.480
 what are the differences that is what 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.879
 makes one version better than the other 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.739
 because Monday deluxe and especially which 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.359
 is the difference in cost that is what 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.189
 offers us more one than the one to 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.930
 difference from the other then good guys 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.090
 practically is the following we do not have 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.769
 around here on this little board that 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.480
 which is the standard version contains the 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.919
 good game version rather the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.409
 game as such in digital 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:56.540
 we have a party envelope we have 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.459
 also a crazy pack and it's the only thing 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.049
 contains more however in the part 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.819
 right of what is the column we have 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.010
 in the deluxe edition which contains 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.319
 everything mentioned above and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.329
 also add what are 150,000 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.700
 coins to start imagine this 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.349
 start with 150 thousand coins would come 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.609
 super super good to start buying 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.199
 our first characters ours 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.520
 first sachets and start with 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.890
 enough desire 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.390
 I would add out there in what is 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.510
 version an exclusive package of 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.280
 custom accessories comes out that 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.660
 I imagine it will be an envelope in which 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.940
 only accessories will come for 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.280
 your characters only because things that 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.480
 only you will be able to have and good 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.400
 guys, these are the specifications 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.960
 techniques regarding the computer that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.370
 you must have to be able to play this 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.950
 come out here we have the minimum requirements 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.810

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.880
 obviously the first ones are going to be for 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.830
 being able to play at the minimum quality is 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.390
 I could say that with jobs you can 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.980
 use it and on the bottom 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.450
 we have the recommended ones not for you 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.880

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.920
 good fluency and that you obviously have a 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.300
 good performance of what the game is like
