00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.330 
I it was soft but I don't know how to
explain<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.880> is<00:02:39.240> even<00:02:39.569> give<00:02:39.840> me<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.560> shine<00:02:40.830> it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
explain it is even give me the shine it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.900 
explain it is even give me the shine it
didn't<00:02:41.580> give<00:02:41.700> me<00:02:41.819> shine<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:44.550> didn't<00:02:44.790> hold

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
didn't give me shine and it didn't hold

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.820 
didn't give me shine and it didn't hold
the<00:02:45.090> curl<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:45.840> as<00:02:45.930> long<00:02:46.140> as<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.410> thought<00:02:46.650> it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the curl but as long as I thought it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.830 
the curl but as long as I thought it
would<00:02:46.860> I'm<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:47.850> knocking<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.360> product

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
would I'm not knocking the product

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.360 
would I'm not knocking the product
because<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.290> know<00:02:49.350> like<00:02:49.650> super<00:02:49.920> probably<00:02:50.250> do

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
because I know like super probably do

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.940 
because I know like super probably do
like<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.790> product<00:02:51.240> but<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:52.050> me<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.440> mean<00:02:52.680> it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
like this product but for me I mean it

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.120 
like this product but for me I mean it
was<00:02:53.010> blind<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.320> price<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.860> would<00:02:55.890> think

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
was blind but the price I would think

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.020 
was blind but the price I would think
that<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.459> would<00:02:56.660> be<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> little<00:02:57.870> better<00:02:59.030> for

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
that it would be a little better for

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.190 
that it would be a little better for
different<00:03:00.300> type<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.450> hair<00:03:00.600> talking<00:03:00.780> so<00:03:00.989> maybe

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
different type of hair talking so maybe

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.050 
different type of hair talking so maybe
I<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.530> need<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.800> try<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.070> other<00:03:02.430> type<00:03:02.790> like

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
I just need to try the other type like

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.880 
I just need to try the other type like
the<00:03:03.239> curl<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.630> couldn't<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.200> didn't<00:03:04.739> try<00:03:04.860> that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
the curl you couldn't I didn't try that

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.470 
the curl you couldn't I didn't try that
because<00:03:05.340> they<00:03:05.760> didn't<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.090> that<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.300> stock

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
because they didn't have that in stock

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.040 
because they didn't have that in stock
so<00:03:07.520> maybe<00:03:08.520> that's<00:03:08.880> what<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.060> need<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.270> do<00:03:09.480> um<00:03:09.750> i

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
so maybe that's what I need to do um i

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.800 
so maybe that's what I need to do um i
was<00:03:10.350> told<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:11.310> kind<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.090> more<00:03:12.450> for

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
was told that this kind is more for

child Carly puddin thinking that that'll

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.630 
child Carly puddin thinking that that'll
probably<00:03:30.690> do<00:03:30.930> better<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:33.140> I<00:03:34.140> was<00:03:35.010> kind<00:03:35.280> of

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
probably do better but I was kind of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.340
