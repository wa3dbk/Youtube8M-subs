00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.080 
more well-known issue right now is that
there<00:05:08.479> is<00:05:08.630> question<00:05:09.350> about<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:10.460> long<00:05:10.759> term

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
there is question about the long term

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.510 
there is question about the long term
sexual<00:05:11.780> side<00:05:11.870> effects<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.740> taking

sexual side effects of taking
finasteride<00:05:14.830> this<00:05:15.830> has<00:05:16.009> led<00:05:16.220> in<00:05:16.370> our<00:05:16.490> practice

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
finasteride this has led in our practice

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.330 
finasteride this has led in our practice
for<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.630> lot<00:05:18.169> of<00:05:18.199> men<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.650> come<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:19.009> who<00:05:19.190> are<00:05:19.220> in

what we've developed in our practice is

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.830 
what we've developed in our practice is
this<00:05:25.370> alternative<00:05:26.030> that<00:05:26.180> we<00:05:26.300> call<00:05:26.510> hair

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
this alternative that we call hair

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.430 
this alternative that we call hair
regeneration<00:05:27.190> and<00:05:28.190> what<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.060> is<00:05:29.210> is<00:05:29.510> a<00:05:29.539> they

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
regeneration and what it is is a they

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.920 
regeneration and what it is is a they
the<00:05:31.010> application<00:05:31.910> of<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.210> material<00:05:32.750> called

large clinical data pool of data so what
we<00:05:57.530> do<00:05:57.830> is<00:05:58.039> actually<00:05:58.190> a<00:05:58.490> one-time<00:05:59.180> injection

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
we do is actually a one-time injection

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.100 
we do is actually a one-time injection

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
for female pattern hair loss so this

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.760 
for female pattern hair loss so this

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
and what can be what can happen when

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.790 
and what can be what can happen when
you're<00:06:37.000> 2530<00:06:38.000> years<00:06:38.120> old

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
you're 2530 years old

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.159 
you're 2530 years old

growth to the level that we understand
everything<00:07:09.949> about<00:07:10.340> it<00:07:10.819> so<00:07:11.419> we've<00:07:11.960> been<00:07:12.139> very

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
everything about it so we've been very

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:14.409 
everything about it so we've been very
fortunate<00:07:12.590> that<00:07:13.129> clinically<00:07:13.610> we<00:07:13.819> found<00:07:14.150> a

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419 
fortunate that clinically we found a

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.360 
fortunate that clinically we found a
material<00:07:15.050> that<00:07:15.199> was<00:07:15.319> already<00:07:15.620> approved<00:07:16.039> for

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 
wound healing that we've been able to

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.890 
wound healing that we've been able to
now<00:07:18.560> help<00:07:18.800> a<00:07:19.039> lot<00:07:19.219> of<00:07:19.340> patients<00:07:19.879> who<00:07:20.360> have<00:07:20.629> male

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
now help a lot of patients who have male

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.110 
now help a lot of patients who have male
pattern<00:07:21.169> and<00:07:21.469> female<00:07:21.800> pattern<00:07:22.009> hair<00:07:22.370> loss<00:07:22.400> so
