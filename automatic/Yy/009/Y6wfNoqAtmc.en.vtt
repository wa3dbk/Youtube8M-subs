00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 the mold that was made with plaster is this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.929
 this whole structure was made with plaster 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.450
 here we have a resistance to rain 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 you can check a resistance you 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.010
 can find in any store of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.859
 construction material and for this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.619
 this resistance will be connected 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.090
 through these children here you are 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.869
 seeing this resistance will be linked to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.239
 a voltage source of 110 volts to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.809
 so I'll're using this stabilizer 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.059
 which will convert the 220 volts of my 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.430
 taken in 110 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.430
 let's see how well that works 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.770
 people are going to link our existence here 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.090
 wait a second of it start 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.129
 warm sure if you will notice that after 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.489
 heat resistance becomes reddish 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.340
 You have the effect already happening. 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.859
 sure we put our bottle 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.250
 contact resistance and we will see the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.250
 that happens 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.320
 You can then check our 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.500
 bottle has turned around the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.500
 fire pit
