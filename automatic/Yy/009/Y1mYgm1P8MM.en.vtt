00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.230
 this time we are going to prepare something 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.920
 very natural something for people who have 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.600
 to take care of this diet where it is 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.580
 really to be on a diet to see 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.530
 all right 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.260
 many times with we have prepared a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.470
 natural dish that does not have many 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.990
 things come creams that contain kisses 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 what we do is we increase it to art 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:28.030
 sorry we do not know if we put a 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.970
 small a few minutes 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.800
 and we give a little bit of importance to 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.240
 fish and we lose 5 minutes of the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.670
 preparation of our plate 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.430
 we can do many things 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.340
 here I have a never of Roman 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 cool in that way to affect the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.450
 iron and salt and pepper habitat and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.450
 Eat me like five minutes 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.870
 can be much better if in the morning 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.489
 that leave the house I leave marinating 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 base result the amazing that we're going to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.580
 do not take it from me in the USA only 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.860
 I'm going to eat mixed this piece almost 300 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.660
 grams with 300 grams and with this 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.190
 opening that I have here is going to be 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:14.690
 enough let's go with the pumpkin 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.000
 this porto - the tomatoes eat a lot 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.070
 potassium for which we are runners I 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.750
 they will understand potassium is very good 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.720
 let's marinate our fish 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.540
 I have lime 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.730
 here we call it lina with us many 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.730
 Sometimes it happens that we arrive and ask 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:48.750
 the fridge 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 last 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.270
 garlic powder 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.899
 onion powder 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.180
 pain in the ankle is okay to have 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.300
 alone of white 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.040
 after 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.890
 a milk puddle that proposes large 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.130
 things with milk the fish is also 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.130
 all right 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.110
 leave our Roman cane 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.620
 marine 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.360
 two hours 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.360
 it smells very well prepared 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.800
 colour 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.120
 as I fish it very fresh most of 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.680
 the marinade that we put the absorbed 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.909
 all the flavors here are 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.909
 then in an open port 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.920
 a few slices of 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.760
 pumpkin 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.780
 and tomato potassium 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.780
 comes out grain 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.450
 Pepper 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:20.590
 the same marinade that was ready for us 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.590
 to heal found to be more comfortable 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.400
 olive oil 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.050
 the ribbon we take it directly to the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.480
 fire and we do it in the pan or the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.060
 same pan we sell to the oven but 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.580
 It was also the oven for 15 minutes at 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.440
 about 150 degrees to be cooked 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.530
 insert in this same pan when 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.980
 come out in this art 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.889
 already 20 minutes passed the cut of 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.750
 That's why fish was a bit 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.290
 And it's ready 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.290
 let's take out 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.380
 we take our cane out of the oven 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.800
 rich in fat and tomato 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.520
 but if they do not have these at home 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.620
 vegetable with onion with carrot 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.810
 put what you can think of 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.960
 juanpa the marinade if he wants to put 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.050
 more lemon to lecce 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.090
 although other broth is perfect 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.169
 also on this occasion , the 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.169
 fish for example more than donate a 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:40.370
 quite juicy loss quite rich and 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:40.370
 nutritious completely identical and ready 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.900
