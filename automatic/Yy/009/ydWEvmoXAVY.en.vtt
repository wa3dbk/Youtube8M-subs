00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.470
 hi girls how are you today I want 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:09.130
 show them a metallic wine like this 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.019
 from here so we're going to how it's done 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 I'm going to apply the base all over my face 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.059
 I'm going to use a brush 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.030
 flat with separate bristles to generate 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.820
 much lighter base dispersion 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.850
 in the face I grabbed the base and put on a 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.310
 little back of his hand a little 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.150
 just because otherwise I do not like to see myself as 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.990
 with a base for the face the desagarro 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.690
 pretty as well as this and I pass the brush 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.770
 and applied to cover all those 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.050
 imperfections 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.110
 as you can see it's a very coverage 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.230
 light is not special and will cover the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.070
 it covers the pores or nothing is a base 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.750
 Awesome 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.900
 I'm going to apply some compact powders with 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.320
 a brush like this to fix that base 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.390
 did not apply many to not see us as a 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.890
 painted canvas then applied a little 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.890
 he blurred it well like that all over his face 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.400
 well then once we aspire the base 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.730
 all over my face I'm going to prepare a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.500
 extension and I'm dying I'll continue with 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.960
 the eyes is a test is for the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.580
 shadow is set much better on the eyelid 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 then what you are going to do is with video 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.590
 I will apply only my own mobile 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.590
 because that's where the shadow will go 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.009
 but what I want to achieve is to set 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 well and it says okay now I'm going to grab 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.720
 use a shadow brush like this and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.720
 my shadow that I showed you before does not open 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.670
 then grabbed by the brush and applied 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.979
 on the mobile eyelid with little touches 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.770
 see how it adheres well with this 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.509
 separate test remains much more 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.509
 pigmented so it looks 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.180
 then the eyelids are left like this one not 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.560
 it happens to you if you are my neutral palette 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.840
 I can know what is here with a 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.200
 brush like this is a pencil type brush 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.670
 which is perfect for generating contours 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.880
 in the eyes with the black shadow this way 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.709
 at 15 and what I'm going to do is apply 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.709
 on the whole foot 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.140
 and came in a little 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 towards the corner of the outer corner 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.280
 Of the eye 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.460
 where I was seeing in this way 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:43.040
 with a diffused brush 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.319
 so I'm going to blur all the edges 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.810
 then they could have been hard on that 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.350
 black because that's what I want to achieve 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.520
 is 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.250
 a smoky effect there are eyes to the smoky eye 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.590
 so that it is not so hard and not 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.590
 you see a softer gradient 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.519
 and the difference of this eye to this one 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.120
 how the black shadow letter was blurred 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.120
 much harder 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.350
 so you see then moving the 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.930
 makeup and look like this looks its 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.380
 super super flattering makeup for 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.500
 all eyes color all brown green 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.690
 blue gray hazelnut etcetera all 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.820
 color ranges that flattering yes 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.370
 yes I'm going to grab the same shadow that 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.920
 I grabbed before the wine color 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.470
 and with my shadow brush I'm going to 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.740
 apply it on the tabs below 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.740
 as well 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.120
 so you can see now with the same 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.180
 brush I will grab the same shadow 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.630
 Black is with the same shadow brush 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.480
 and with a little 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.990
 I will apply only abroad 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.990
 of the eye 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:07.390
 to grab a black pencil eyeliner 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.990
 new delineate the tabs above and 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.900
 down inside 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.590
 to give more definition as well as they can 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.169
 see is seeing super defined 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.930
 ruiz to the tabs to apply the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.669
 I 'm going to apply a line like 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.669
 this one has the small brush 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.800
 now after I apply the two 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.050
 layers on the tabs above I'm going to 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.550
 apply this loss is fantastic for 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.680
 the tabs below brush grid 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.010
 super small and is reached to grab 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.010
 all 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.520
 applied a capita numbers down to not 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.000
 see me with the eye too open 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.000
 neither 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.129
 and I forgot something super important 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:56.969
 in this type of loops is to apply some 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:05:00.029
 clear shadow for 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:03.310
 illuminate this eye so dark that we did 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:05.650
 as pink as this is here 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.910
 This will apply in the bone of the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.430
 eyebrows to illuminate and it would also be 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.030
 blur the edge of the black a little 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.520
 so that it is more tuxedo type 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.240
 I'm going to grab a blush like this which is 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.240
 a coral color 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.090
 and with a big brush like that 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.190
 I would like it well blurred by all 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.050
 the cheeks I like that I have left in 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.690
 blush lines like this by all means 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.930
 so that well blurred to a 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.610
 brush for the blush and apply 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.870
 I start applying in the middle of the 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.160
 cheek and blurs back and by 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.870
 latest 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:51.850
 lips for lips I will apply a 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.990
 this is a shine that has as a 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.510
 pink and took a salmon color he cited 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.040
 clinique is going to grab me I'm going to 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.320
 apply to the lips is a very color 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.010
 soft and since we have pretty eyes 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.420
 powerful 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.920
 it is best to soften a little makeup 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.920
 of the lips 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:15.240
 and then the makeup the hair 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.600
 then to loquillo so final it would be 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.920
 So that's how it would be then everything I hope 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.810
