 Ultraism to be able to mount the image 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.980
 did the game 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.630
 and the wind to be able to extract all the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.059
 weird files that we once 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.560
 unloaded the fire if they ask what 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.810

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.310
 I will see that we have everything installed 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.600
 we're just going to give damn all of the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.479

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 will begin to download the game as 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.700
 They are five and a half because no 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.829

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.539
 download though the default folder 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.390
 they keep all our files of 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.680
 download torrents and we see that we have 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.480
 many rare files 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.580

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.520
 ultra did I am like example usa made you 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.620
 but you can also use the damn 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.869
 we have tools that stop asking me 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.580
 these are exactly the two programs 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.810
 also pass the same any 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.970
 program in which it serves to mount a 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.740
 image did with him that's why 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.280
 they can use is not that only the 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.170
 ultra and are so you know but the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.030
 first that is to use the ultra made famous 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.340
 the tyson 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.920
 we go to configuration options a 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.720
 usual number of units we put 1 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.550
 accept and we close and now we are 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.400
 will create a virtual unit in our 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.620
 system to be able to mount images that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.270

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.820
 we are expecting a pack dyn 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.080
 and we go to team units and the unit 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.510
 virtual and here we have the little mirror 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.150

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.150
 normally by double- clicking the zp 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.800

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.460
 folder where we want to save it but not 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.660
 touch nothing of genres and by default next 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.140
 we mark this box so that we are 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.490
