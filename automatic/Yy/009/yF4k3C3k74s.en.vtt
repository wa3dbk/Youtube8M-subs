00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.969
 for lorena save 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.019
 oaks will also somehow be through all its history 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.140
 alvarado a lot of experience efe with respect to our fields each field is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.099
 very different and through this time we have been able to understand better 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.529
 our salary our climate 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.019
 in short is your homeland 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.999
 and I think that now with all this experience of the new consultancies 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.320
 what are we having 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.660
 of the experts 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.520
 Certainly Moscow has evolved a lot in our field, not even today 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 day is very good I had him technology 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.550
 as many of us know 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.820
 70% of the quality of a wine you remember a boot and 70% an atc of your 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.660
 quality 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.589
 comes from the field then 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.590
 while your field you have it better 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.520
 Percent studies are going to improve the non-logical part as well 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.490
 learning from their mistakes 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.920
 I am very clear year after year that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.190
 that our quality has been improving and 3 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.630
 as witnesses of this by the way are the consumers who have recognized us 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.560
 I answered with this quality and at the same time the international competitions 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.680
 another of the important part of our evolution 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.870
 has been that we have been able to understand very well what is happening in the 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.030
 market and 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.940
 and we have understood that evolution that we have also seen inside the palate 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.350
 of the consumer that is very important 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.060
 the detected day and adapt to it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.970
 since our palates are not the same as we did 30 ago 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.540
 years 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.990
 we look for different things in the wines in each time per hundred 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.000
 We try to use the techniques such as micro-oxygenation 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.990
 that somehow 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.020
 t that streamline online what is the aging in bottle 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.140
 every time it is because there are fewer people who buy wines to fill them 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.760
 save them in your work 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.060
 then very important to understand about this type of change 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.329
 when Mount xanic arises percent 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.509
 then there 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.440
 the other wineries start following in their footsteps taking out more product lines 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.709
 criminal 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.379
 i already later in the late nineties mid-nineties we see in which 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.950
 they owe a huge surge of wineries 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.039
 little ones with this one 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:24.719
 because with this nationality to produce quality wines right now in the valley 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.889
 after more than five hours 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.959
 popeye definitely that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.799
 very important partaguas and here is not skimp in any way 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.670
 I do not make high quality wines you will never sacrifice quality for the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.719
 quantity 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.599
 good he the old world because we already know those countries as in the 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.499
 Traditionally European 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.549
 Exteniente cent of certain styles very 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.339
 specials he said conservatives 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.619
 are already 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.020
 they have been doing it for years 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.039
 then it is very easy to identify 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.369
 certain products that come from the old world we were not going 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:04.319
 and when it talks about the new world if you talk about as an evolution in margins to 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.339
 winemaking and the best are also viticulture 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.019
 undoubtedly viticulture 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.469
 and we see what 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.379
 Well yes the wines are different 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.659
 we see that not necessarily the traditional is what we seek has been 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.719
 very important that we adapt saved extremes 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.530
 and based on that, it is believed that they have left one of the new world 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.920
 look we are 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.150
 very focused hurry mind right now reach the young 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:34.619
 because yes, those who were going to attend and yes in this industry in Mexico this 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:35.469
 Of the wine 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.589
 that's a pleasure with this activity where maybe you start by trying 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:42.909
 percent find the bust to a wine 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.669
 and a palate develops not between more wines tastes 1 martÃ­nez 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:48.539
 He wants to try 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.730
 here how we handle different wines 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.180
 and different styles in young wines we see that there are by scientist samos 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.820
 - new barrel and this is because that way if it laporta percent - Caesar 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.319
 that tan and city 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.139
 to wines and wines can be 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.159
 a little softer the case of not having wanted was new rich 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.899
 in the case of children who have the greatest potential to nÃ­jar 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.739
 We always use new cask from case for example from Iran stressed 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.380
 what do we give that studies usually has a very serious structure very 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.240
 enduring what does this mean that 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.160
 that you can put them for a longer time in the barrel and this barrel 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.849
 new 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.899
 i the wine through all this time will not lose 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.779
 the balance we always look for in a great wine that is 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:45.229
 the one with the greatest potential in the fruit, the highest aromatic intensity in that part 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.629
 the futile species and then 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.949
 this treatment the barrel contribute what is the vanilla that contributes what 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.789
 it's wood and smoke but this part is always behind 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.819
 of the boiled fruit does not matter nelly with this work precisely 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.459
 make people know the money that you lose the fear that becomes a 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:08.139
 everyday part of their lives 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.210
 I see it as a part of the complementary gastronomy for 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.319
 finish I think it's very important 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.620
 who invite all people to consume Mexican wine 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.360
 he really came 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.449
 It is in spectacular stage 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.300
 every time there are better wines 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.810
 it is important to support them so that 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.870
 based on that when you grow as industry fists slogans wines 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.409
 under construction more jobs in percent percent 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.840
 I think all this happening is very positive but we have to intensify 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.059
