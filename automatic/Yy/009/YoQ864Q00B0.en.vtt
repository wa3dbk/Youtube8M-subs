00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and I'm really surprised to see him play

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.520 
and I'm really surprised to see him play
65<00:00:49.770> against<00:00:50.430> molnar<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.600> makes<00:00:51.870> me<00:00:52.020> wonder<00:00:52.260> if

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
65 against molnar it makes me wonder if

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.830 
65 against molnar it makes me wonder if
he's<00:00:52.680> afraid<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> molars<00:00:53.699> Evans<00:00:54.180> gambit<00:00:54.660> or

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
he's afraid of molars Evans gambit or

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.590 
he's afraid of molars Evans gambit or
something<00:00:55.199> weird<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:56.090> but<00:00:57.090> regardless

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
something weird like that but regardless

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
something weird like that but regardless
I<00:00:57.809> think<00:00:57.840> Julio's<00:00:58.469> best<00:00:58.770> choice<00:00:59.129> should

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
I think Julio's best choice should

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
I think Julio's best choice should
probably<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.570> been<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.870> play<00:01:01.050> 'if

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
probably really have been to play 'if

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.270 
I've his main opening and to deal with
whatever<00:01:05.519> McKenzie<00:01:06.390> plays<00:01:06.659> there<00:01:07.280> but

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
whatever McKenzie plays there but

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.890 
whatever McKenzie plays there but
playing<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> Sicilian<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.570> actually

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
playing to the Sicilian is actually

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
playing to the Sicilian is actually
playing<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.350> Mackenzie's<00:01:10.890> even<00:01:11.700> bigger

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
playing into Mackenzie's even bigger

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
playing into Mackenzie's even bigger
strength<00:01:12.299> McKenzie<00:01:13.049> molnar<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> great<00:01:13.979> open

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430

better in this kind of position than in

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
better in this kind of position than in
the<00:01:21.330> e4<00:01:22.259> e5<00:01:22.290> openings<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.720> especially<00:01:24.720> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
rouser this is like a great one for

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.990 
rouser this is like a great one for
Mackenzie<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.950> white<00:01:32.189> almost<00:01:32.520> always

Mackenzie because white almost always

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.289

back<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.640> then<00:02:13.730> h5<00:02:14.470> prevents<00:02:15.470> g4<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:17.180> are

back and then h5 prevents g4 and we are

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.660 
back and then h5 prevents g4 and we are
definitely<00:02:17.750> now<00:02:18.050> in<00:02:18.350> territory<00:02:19.010> for<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> sharp

definitely now in territory for a sharp
game<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:23.390> normal<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.840> put<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.110> bishop<00:02:24.350> back

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
game it's normal to put the bishop back

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.020 
game it's normal to put the bishop back
here<00:02:24.740> by<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.950> way<00:02:25.100> once<00:02:25.340> blacks<00:02:25.610> played<00:02:25.880> age

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
here by the way once blacks played age

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.140 
here by the way once blacks played age
five<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.020> good<00:02:27.200> square<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.590> be<00:02:27.709> on

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
five it's a good square to be on

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
five it's a good square to be on
defended<00:02:29.150> by<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.300> H<00:02:29.480> pawn<00:02:29.750> putting<00:02:30.020> some

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
defended by the H pawn putting some

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.120 
defended by the H pawn putting some
pressure<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.680> diagonal<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:33.130> black

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
pressure on this diagonal and black

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.890 
pressure on this diagonal and black
continues<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.819> develop<00:02:35.030> his<00:02:35.270> counter-attack

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
continues to develop his counter-attack

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.320 
continues to develop his counter-attack
and<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.440> not<00:02:36.620> easy<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.040> see<00:02:37.220> here<00:02:37.550> how<00:02:38.030> white

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
and it's not easy to see here how white

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.260 
and it's not easy to see here how white
is<00:02:38.540> going<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.900> get<00:02:39.050> his<00:02:39.350> own<00:02:39.530> attack<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.280> for

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
is going to get his own attack going for

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.520 
is going to get his own attack going for
the<00:02:41.330> moment<00:02:41.480> before<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.140> big<00:02:42.380> threat

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the moment before is a big threat

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.960 
the moment before is a big threat
because<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:42.950> night<00:02:43.130> would<00:02:43.310> have<00:02:43.489> nowhere<00:02:43.819> to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
because this night would have nowhere to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.470 
because this night would have nowhere to
go<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:45.220> he<00:02:46.220> just<00:02:46.400> defends<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:46.970> threat<00:02:47.269> and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
go so he just defends that threat and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.320 
go so he just defends that threat and
now<00:02:47.680> he<00:02:48.680> starts<00:02:49.010> his<00:02:49.280> attack<00:02:49.610> suddenly<00:02:50.120> and

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
now he starts his attack suddenly and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.410 
now he starts his attack suddenly and
quickly<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.190> point<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:53.180> even

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
quickly and on the point is that even

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.270 
quickly and on the point is that even
though<00:02:53.989> he<00:02:54.080> gives<00:02:54.200> up<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.530> G<00:02:54.769> foursquare

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
though he gives up this G foursquare

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.699 
though he gives up this G foursquare
whatever<00:02:55.610> black<00:02:55.880> does<00:02:56.180> white<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.019> planning<00:02:57.680> to

whatever black does white is planning to

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.920 
whatever black does white is planning to
just<00:02:57.950> play<00:02:58.130> 'if<00:02:58.400> I've<00:02:58.640> sacking<00:02:59.540> upon<00:02:59.750> and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
dire shape here because knight moves can

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.920 
dire shape here because knight moves can
probably<00:03:13.430> already<00:03:13.700> be<00:03:14.000> answered<00:03:14.300> by<00:03:14.510> any

night<00:03:15.620> move<00:03:15.860> from<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.130> white<00:03:16.310> knight<00:03:16.519> on<00:03:16.670> d4

night move from the white knight on d4

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.310 
night move from the white knight on d4
and<00:03:17.209> they're<00:03:17.420> going<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.630> be<00:03:17.750> devastating

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
and they're going to be devastating

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.440 
and they're going to be devastating
threats<00:03:18.620> coming<00:03:18.829> down<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.220> file<00:03:19.930> so<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
threats coming down this file so the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.030 
threats coming down this file so the
Sarah<00:03:23.690> actually<00:03:24.019> played<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.290> tricky<00:03:24.680> move<00:03:24.860> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
Sarah actually played a tricky move and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.830 
Sarah actually played a tricky move and
I<00:03:25.070> think<00:03:25.280> he<00:03:25.370> probably<00:03:25.579> saw<00:03:25.880> e5<00:03:26.299> coming<00:03:26.720> and

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
I think he probably saw e5 coming and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.780 
I think he probably saw e5 coming and
thought<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.380> move<00:03:27.650> here<00:03:28.040> would

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
thought that this move here would

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.080 
thought that this move here would
absolutely<00:03:29.180> deal<00:03:29.780> with<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.170> d<00:03:30.530> 5<00:03:30.860> keeping<00:03:31.730> what

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
absolutely deal with it d 5 keeping what

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.789 
absolutely deal with it d 5 keeping what
looks<00:03:32.329> like<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.810> solid<00:03:33.320> central<00:03:34.220> structure<00:03:34.630> and

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
looks like a solid central structure and

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.860 
looks like a solid central structure and
I<00:03:36.799> mean<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.940> brilliant<00:03:38.329> part<00:03:38.360> about<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.720> is

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
I mean the brilliant part about it is

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.900 
I mean the brilliant part about it is
that<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.170> acts<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.590> night<00:03:39.799> but<00:03:40.549> when<00:03:40.820> he

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
that it's acts the night but when he

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.080 
that it's acts the night but when he
takes<00:03:41.180> back<00:03:41.360> this<00:03:41.630> Bishop<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.049> trapped<00:03:43.090> right

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
takes back this Bishop is trapped right

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.849 
takes back this Bishop is trapped right
so<00:03:44.570> in<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.750> sense<00:03:44.900> he's<00:03:45.170> getting<00:03:45.440> white<00:03:45.620> dark

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
so in a sense he's getting white dark

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.380 
so in a sense he's getting white dark
squared<00:03:46.160> Bishop<00:03:46.489> because<00:03:46.730> white<00:03:46.970> has<00:03:47.120> trapped

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
squared Bishop because white has trapped

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.920 
squared Bishop because white has trapped
it<00:03:47.600> with<00:03:47.720> f4<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.230> age<00:03:48.380> 4<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.780> leaving<00:03:50.780> himself

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
it with f4 and age 4 and leaving himself

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.620 
it with f4 and age 4 and leaving himself
with<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.290> very<00:03:51.590> very<00:03:51.859> nice<00:03:52.090> central<00:03:53.090> formation

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
with a very very nice central formation

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.520 
with a very very nice central formation
that's<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.739> theory<00:03:55.810> but<00:03:56.810> what<00:03:57.170> makes<00:03:57.380> this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
that's in theory but what makes this

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.259 
that's in theory but what makes this
game<00:03:57.709> amazing<00:03:58.190> is<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.280> molnar<00:03:58.850> has

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
game amazing is that molnar has

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.449 
game amazing is that molnar has
predicted<00:03:59.930> this<00:04:00.049> kind<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.350> idea<00:04:00.500> with<00:04:00.799> d5<00:04:01.010> and

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
predicted this kind of idea with d5 and

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.310 
predicted this kind of idea with d5 and
he<00:04:02.030> has<00:04:02.209> in<00:04:02.359> mind<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.660> way<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.840> crash<00:04:03.290> through

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
he has in mind a way to crash through

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.190 
he has in mind a way to crash through
here<00:04:03.920> for<00:04:03.950> white<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.549> crush<00:04:04.850> black<00:04:05.120> so<00:04:05.900> i

centralized with every piece very very

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.659 
centralized with every piece very very
tough<00:06:59.379> for<00:06:59.529> black<00:06:59.710> to<00:06:59.740> deal<00:07:00.009> with<00:07:00.219> this<00:07:00.370> here

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669

he's<00:07:00.789> looking<00:07:01.059> at<00:07:01.120> moves<00:07:01.300> like<00:07:01.449> f5<00:07:01.990> to<00:07:02.349> go

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:02.499 
he's looking at moves like f5 to go

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:08.119

after<00:07:02.620> the<00:07:02.800> e8<00:07:03.159> bishop<00:07:03.610> or<00:07:04.379> possibly<00:07:05.379> 95<00:07:06.300> and

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.129 
after the e8 bishop or possibly 95 and
