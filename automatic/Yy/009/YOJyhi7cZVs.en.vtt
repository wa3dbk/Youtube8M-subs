00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.080
 and we already have it and now we are going to put it 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.650
 Baked in the oven, we're going to put it in 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.819

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.819
 to 170 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.300
 and we're going to leave it for 25 minutes and then 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.300
 we will check to see how it is 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.079
 the 25 minutes have already passed and we are going to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.079

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.620
 we are going now to take a moment 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.830
 because we are going to do the following as 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.400
 You see, a little bit is missing 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.860

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.860
 and we will swim a little above 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.060
 and we bathed a bit and now 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.390
 we're going to put them in the oven and we're going to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.890

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.890
 15 more minutes 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.860

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.860

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.230

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.760

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.210

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.730

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.050

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.680
