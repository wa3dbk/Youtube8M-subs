kinda like you see with lots of video

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.699 
kinda like you see with lots of video
cards<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.739> let's<00:02:38.920> set<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.220> down

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
cards so let's set that down

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.880 
cards so let's set that down
here<00:02:41.709> go<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.100> additional<00:02:42.580> cabling<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.800> you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
here go the additional cabling so you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.650 
here go the additional cabling so you
guys<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.190> see<00:02:45.400> these<00:02:45.580> are<00:02:45.730> all<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.090> flat<00:02:46.420> type

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
guys can see these are all the flat type

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.330 
guys can see these are all the flat type
cables<00:02:47.080> some<00:02:47.290> people<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.709> them<00:02:47.890> some<00:02:48.130> people

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
cables some people like them some people

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.780 
cables some people like them some people
don't

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
don't

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.630 
don't
they're<00:02:49.750> very<00:02:49.989> easy<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.530> use<00:02:50.709> with<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.100> case<00:02:51.370> and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
they're very easy to use with a case and

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.190 
they're very easy to use with a case and
for<00:02:52.030> braiding<00:02:52.239> they're<00:02:52.480> not<00:02:52.660> too<00:02:52.810> bad<00:02:52.989> either

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
for braiding they're not too bad either

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.540 
for braiding they're not too bad either
so<00:02:53.709> if<00:02:53.830> you're<00:02:53.920> gonna<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.190> braiding<00:02:54.489> your

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
so if you're gonna be braiding your

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.729 
so if you're gonna be braiding your
cable<00:02:54.850> it's<00:02:55.000> not<00:02:55.120> really<00:02:55.300> gonna<00:02:55.420> matter<00:02:55.739> just

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
cable it's not really gonna matter just

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.870 
cable it's not really gonna matter just
take<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.890> look<00:02:57.040> at<00:02:57.160> all<00:02:57.280> these<00:02:57.400> ones<00:02:57.610> we'll<00:02:57.730> pull

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
take a look at all these ones we'll pull

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.220 
take a look at all these ones we'll pull
them<00:02:58.000> out<00:02:58.060> of<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.209> box<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.570> got<00:02:58.660> your<00:02:58.870> molex

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
them out of the box you got your molex

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.110 
them out of the box you got your molex
here<00:02:59.650> just<00:03:00.190> hold<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.550> put<00:03:00.730> them<00:03:00.820> back<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
here just hold on put them back in the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.180 
here just hold on put them back in the
box<00:03:01.270> maybe<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.630> might<00:03:01.840> be<00:03:02.050> easier<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:03.010> here<00:03:03.130> you

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
box maybe it might be easier so here you

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.539 
box maybe it might be easier so here you
go<00:03:03.340> molex<00:03:04.300> for<00:03:05.170> your<00:03:05.260> floppy<00:03:06.239> molex<00:03:07.239> again<00:03:08.280> 6<00:03:09.280> &amp;

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
go molex for your floppy molex again 6 &amp;

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:21.630 
go molex for your floppy molex again 6 &amp;
8<00:03:09.730> pin<00:03:10.980> 8<00:03:11.980> pin<00:03:13.140> molex<00:03:15.900> SATA<00:03:18.570> SATA<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:20.640> more

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
8 pin 8 pin molex SATA SATA and more

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.699 
8 pin 8 pin molex SATA SATA and more
save<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.630> those<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:23.019> all<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.170> ones<00:03:23.560> that

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
save it so those are all the ones that

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.610 
save it so those are all the ones that
are<00:03:24.100> modular<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.930> let's<00:03:26.110> get<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.350> out<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
are modular so let's get that out of the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.699 
are modular so let's get that out of the
way<00:03:27.570> here<00:03:28.570> are<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.690> screws<00:03:28.900> also<00:03:29.350> by<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.560> way

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
way here are the screws also by the way

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.259 
way here are the screws also by the way
these<00:03:29.860> are<00:03:30.010> going<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.220> help<00:03:30.340> put<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.000> inside

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
these are going to help put it inside

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.580 
these are going to help put it inside
your<00:03:31.450> case<00:03:31.630> so<00:03:31.780> it'll<00:03:31.930> mount<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.290> in<00:03:32.350> there<00:03:32.470> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
your case so it'll mount it in there and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.780 
your case so it'll mount it in there and
stay<00:03:32.739> in<00:03:32.860> place<00:03:33.070> so<00:03:33.250> doesn't<00:03:33.310> go<00:03:33.489> flying

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
stay in place so doesn't go flying

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.640 
stay in place so doesn't go flying
anywhere<00:03:34.180> if<00:03:34.269> you're<00:03:34.360> moving<00:03:34.570> around<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:35.049> think

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
anywhere if you're moving around I think

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.840 
anywhere if you're moving around I think
those<00:03:35.769> be<00:03:35.890> better<00:03:36.100> off<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.370> that<00:03:36.489> box<00:03:36.700> over

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
those be better off in that box over

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.539 
those be better off in that box over
there<00:03:37.030> someone<00:03:37.269> to<00:03:37.360> move<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:39.370> ahead<00:03:39.430> and
