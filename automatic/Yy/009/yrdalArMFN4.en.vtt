00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:22.355
Q: You are facing the same opponent in the same location as last year’s Opening Round. How do you feel about it?

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:49.646
A: It is the same opponent and the same event, but I am prepared this time so the result will be different.

00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:55.321
Q: What sort of preparation has been different?

00:00:55.321 --> 00:01:48.685
A: Last year I had several issues to deal with that disturbed my preparation. This year nothing has gotten in the way.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:52.685
Q: What was wrong last year?

00:01:52.685 --> 00:02:33.599
A: Last year I was injured. Zimmermann was on a roll last year and we meet while I was having some problems and he was at his best.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:46.451
Q: Zimmermann has been clubbing and going to amusement parks recently, like he will have no problems with you. How do you feel about that?

00:02:46.451 --> 00:03:35.863
A: I don’t mind if he is enjoying himself. I am sure he is prepared for Saturday. Whatever he is doing it doesn’t bother me.

00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:41.960
Q: What have you sacrificed for this fight?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:04:14.010
A: I have been in Japan for the last month preparing, so the biggest sacrifice I have made is leaving my family in Brazil for so long to enable me to prepare well.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.594
Q: Have you been talking to your family at all?

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:47.694
A: I have been using a web camera to talk to them, and of course using the telephone.

00:04:47.694 --> 00:04:55.902
Q: This is your 8th WGP, but does it hold any special significance for you?

00:04:55.902 --> 00:05:44.658
A: Every time I am excited and nervous to enter the GP. This year more than most.

00:05:44.658 --> 00:05:50.377
Q: What is so special about this year?

00:05:50.377 --> 00:06:33.869
A: I think my chances for entering the WGP are very limited now, so each is very important to make the most of.

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:38.309
Q: Do you have any special message for your fans?

00:06:38.309 --> 00:07:22.876
I will do my best and put my heart into it entirely. I want to thank them all for their support. The only way to repay them is with victory.
