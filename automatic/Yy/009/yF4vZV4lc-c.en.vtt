00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.540 

so<00:06:12.200> this<00:06:12.500> is<00:06:12.620> actually<00:06:12.980> first<00:06:13.250> part<00:06:13.520> of

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:28.909 

then

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:37.409 

see<00:06:29.919> once<00:06:30.519> G<00:06:31.119> again<00:06:35.580> demons<00:06:36.580> don't<00:06:36.819> mean<00:06:37.299> to
