00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
resources so not that much never losing

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.990 
resources so not that much never losing
hardly<00:04:30.599> anything<00:04:30.870> right<00:04:31.229> now<00:04:31.699> but<00:04:32.699> at<00:04:32.880> the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
hardly anything right now but at the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.300 
hardly anything right now but at the
same<00:04:33.180> time<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.419> don't<00:04:33.570> have<00:04:33.690> much<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.380> lose<00:04:34.949> I

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
same time I don't have much to lose I

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.940
