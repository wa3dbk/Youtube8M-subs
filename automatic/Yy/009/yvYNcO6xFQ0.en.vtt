my<00:00:02.610> name<00:00:02.790> is<00:00:02.880> Raven<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.510> an<00:00:03.659> ecologist<00:00:04.170> with

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
my name is Raven I'm an ecologist with

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.159 
my name is Raven I'm an ecologist with
Savannah<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.460> we're<00:00:06.000> just<00:00:06.149> here<00:00:06.330> today<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:06.899> a

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:07.169 
Savannah and we're just here today at a

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:09.440 
Savannah and we're just here today at a
front<00:00:07.620> down<00:00:07.770> bar<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.790> we're<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.330> be

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
front down bar so we're going to be

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.360 
front down bar so we're going to be
talking<00:00:09.719> about<00:00:09.929> steak<00:00:10.469> hibernacula<00:00:11.130> sand

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
talking about steak hibernacula sand

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.400 
talking about steak hibernacula sand
where<00:00:11.490> snakes<00:00:11.759> like<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.269> overwinter<00:00:12.839> during

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
where snakes like to overwinter during

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.910 
where snakes like to overwinter during
fall<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.280> winter<00:00:14.759> months<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.920> basically

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
fall and winter months so basically

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.860 
fall and winter months so basically
generally<00:00:17.310> there<00:00:18.090> will<00:00:18.210> be<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.360> lot<00:00:18.540> of<00:00:18.570> junk

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
generally there will be a lot of junk

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.870 
generally there will be a lot of junk
lying<00:00:19.170> around<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.860> basically<00:00:20.340> creates

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
lying around and this basically creates

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.920 
lying around and this basically creates
cover<00:00:21.120> for<00:00:21.420> snakes

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
cover for snakes

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.170 
cover for snakes
so<00:00:22.560> snakes<00:00:22.860> will<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.160> able<00:00:23.280> to<00:00:23.460> tunnel<00:00:23.640> inside

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
so snakes will be able to tunnel inside

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900 
so snakes will be able to tunnel inside
and<00:00:24.570> under<00:00:24.920> what's<00:00:25.920> important<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.490> over

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
and under what's important for over

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.210 
and under what's important for over
renting<00:00:27.210> habitat<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.870> snakes<00:00:28.110> it<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.950> to<00:00:29.130> be

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
renting habitat for snakes it has to be

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
renting habitat for snakes it has to be
below<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.520> frost<00:00:29.880> line<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.900> want<00:00:31.110> an<00:00:31.260> area

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
below the frost line so you want an area

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.299 
below the frost line so you want an area
that<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.700> dry<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.059> well-drained<00:00:33.629> but<00:00:34.289> not<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that is dry and well-drained but not to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.880 
that is dry and well-drained but not to
drive<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.820> snakes<00:00:36.300> still<00:00:36.539> need<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
drive because snakes still need to

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
drive because snakes still need to
retain<00:00:37.890> moisture<00:00:38.100> during<00:00:38.579> during<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> winter

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
retain moisture during during the winter

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.599 
retain moisture during during the winter
months<00:00:40.019> so<00:00:40.050> they<00:00:40.199> don't<00:00:40.350> dry<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.519> need

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
months so they don't dry up and you need

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.369 
months so they don't dry up and you need
to<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.879> enough<00:00:42.089> cover<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.749> when<00:00:43.289> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to have enough cover so that when the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.500 
to have enough cover so that when the
spring<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:43.890> emerge<00:00:44.309> they<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.329> hide

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
spring when they do emerge they can hide

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720 
spring when they do emerge they can hide
they<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.960> bask<00:00:46.199> at<00:00:46.440> their<00:00:46.620> own<00:00:46.710> pace<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.429> they

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
they can bask at their own pace and they

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
they can bask at their own pace and they
have<00:00:47.969> food<00:00:48.210> readily<00:00:48.570> available<00:00:51.109> so<00:00:52.109> snakes

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
have food readily available so snakes

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.680 
have food readily available so snakes
especially<00:00:52.589> like<00:00:53.309> these<00:00:53.550> uh<00:00:53.690> stone

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
especially like these uh stone

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.729 
especially like these uh stone
foundations<00:00:55.879> basements<00:00:56.879> old<00:00:57.420> barns<00:00:57.989> older

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
foundations basements old barns older

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.790 
foundations basements old barns older
houses<00:00:59.129> without<00:00:59.429> physical<00:01:00.239> stone<00:01:00.479> walls

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
houses without physical stone walls

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.250 
houses without physical stone walls
they're<00:01:01.800> able<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.159> use<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.050> lines<00:01:04.050> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
they're able to use all the lines and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.650 
they're able to use all the lines and
nooks<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.680> crannies<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.430> basically<00:01:06.300> find

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
nooks and crannies to basically find

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.130 
nooks and crannies to basically find
food<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.140> shelter<00:01:07.410> and<00:01:08.420> usually<00:01:09.420> uh<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
food and shelter and usually uh in the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.650 
food and shelter and usually uh in the
winter<00:01:10.470> some<00:01:10.980> landowners<00:01:11.700> might<00:01:12.060> find<00:01:12.330> milk

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
winter some landowners might find milk

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.540 
winter some landowners might find milk
snakes<00:01:12.990> or<00:01:13.350> black<00:01:13.650> rat<00:01:13.890> snakes<00:01:14.160> in<00:01:14.340> their

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.700 
snakes or black rat snakes in their
basement<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:16.140> where<00:01:16.350> they're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
basement because that's where they're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
basement because that's where they're
warm<00:01:16.980> that's<00:01:17.370> where<00:01:17.640> there's<00:01:17.850> food<00:01:18.030> available

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and that's where they can safely rest

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.180 
and that's where they can safely rest
for<00:01:23.430> six<00:01:24.210> months<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.780> do<00:01:25.380> find<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> snake<00:01:25.980> in

for six months you do find a snake in

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.490 
for six months you do find a snake in
your<00:01:26.310> house<00:01:26.720> first<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.320> should

or<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:56.160> hole<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.180> makes<00:01:57.420> access<00:01:57.990> easy<00:01:58.470> for

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
or or hole that makes access easy for

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.470 
or or hole that makes access easy for
them<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.220> what<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.520> need<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.760> do<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.150> find

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
them so what you need to do is find

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.940 
them so what you need to do is find
every<00:02:00.780> hole<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.230> house<00:02:01.440> which<00:02:01.710> may<00:02:01.890> be

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
every hole in your house which may be

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.490 
every hole in your house which may be
difficult<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.640> block<00:02:03.270> them<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:04.350> should

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
difficult and block them and you should

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.200 
difficult and block them and you should
also<00:02:04.650> try<00:02:04.800> to<00:02:05.010> provide<00:02:05.340> an<00:02:05.640> alternate

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
also try to provide an alternate

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
also try to provide an alternate
hibernation<00:02:06.990> site<00:02:07.200> fruit<00:02:07.440> snakes<00:02:07.800> so<00:02:08.099> that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
hibernation site fruit snakes so that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
hibernation site fruit snakes so that
after<00:02:09.149> you've<00:02:09.269> blocked<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.719> the<00:02:09.749> holes<00:02:10.019> they

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
after you've blocked all the holes they

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.390 
after you've blocked all the holes they
will<00:02:10.499> still<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:10.829> somewhere<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.159> go<00:02:11.249> to

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
will still have somewhere to go to

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640 
will still have somewhere to go to
survive<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.999> winter<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:13.109> what<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.319> can<00:02:13.409> do<00:02:13.530> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
survive the winter so what you can do is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.790 
survive the winter so what you can do is
you<00:02:13.769> can<00:02:13.859> build<00:02:14.010> an<00:02:14.219> artificial

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
you can build an artificial

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.550 
you can build an artificial
snake<00:02:15.800> hibernacula<00:02:16.460> so<00:02:17.210> that's<00:02:17.780> basically<00:02:18.200> a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
snake hibernacula so that's basically a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.980 
snake hibernacula so that's basically a
2<00:02:19.100> meter<00:02:19.340> deep<00:02:19.550> hole<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.060> ground<00:02:20.180> where

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
2 meter deep hole on the ground where

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.680 
2 meter deep hole on the ground where
you<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.740> play<00:02:21.950> cinder<00:02:22.490> blocks<00:02:22.760> piece<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
you can play cinder blocks piece the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.350 
you can play cinder blocks piece the
wood<00:02:23.930> PVC<00:02:24.500> pipe<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:25.040> basically<00:02:25.940> allows<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
wood PVC pipe that basically allows the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.660 
wood PVC pipe that basically allows the
snake<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.900> crawl<00:02:27.170> inside<00:02:27.380> below<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.460> frost

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
snake to crawl inside below the frost

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.410 
snake to crawl inside below the frost
line<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.750> still<00:02:30.350> above<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.680> water<00:02:30.860> table<00:02:31.070> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
line and still above the water table and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.610 
line and still above the water table and
create<00:02:32.420> these<00:02:32.570> little<00:02:32.780> chambers<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.380> are

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
create these little chambers that are

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.030 
create these little chambers that are
that<00:02:34.490> are<00:02:34.640> stable<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.680> ideal<00:02:36.680> for<00:02:36.920> them

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
that are stable and and ideal for them

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.030 
that are stable and and ideal for them
to<00:02:37.280> basically<00:02:38.200> go<00:02:39.200> into<00:02:39.470> their<00:02:39.620> tour<00:02:39.860> for

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
to basically go into their tour for

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.860 
to basically go into their tour for
state<00:02:40.280> for<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.700> rest<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.300> winter<00:02:41.480> and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
state for the rest of the winter and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.230 
state for the rest of the winter and
then<00:02:42.560> allow<00:02:43.070> them<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.430> emerge<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.910> spring

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
then allow them to emerge in the spring

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.660 
then allow them to emerge in the spring
with<00:02:44.840> enough<00:02:45.080> cover<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.620> enough<00:02:45.860> basking

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
with enough cover and enough basking

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.449 
with enough cover and enough basking
sites<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.900> they'll<00:02:48.080> be<00:02:48.140> able<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.620> leave

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
sites so that they'll be able to leave

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.100 
sites so that they'll be able to leave
and<00:02:49.640> find<00:02:49.700> their<00:02:50.000> own<00:02:50.060> foraging<00:02:50.540> ways<00:02:50.690> and

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
and find their own foraging ways and

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.720 
and find their own foraging ways and
snakes<00:02:51.740> usually<00:02:51.890> will<00:02:52.190> come<00:02:52.340> back<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.640> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
snakes usually will come back to the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.790 
snakes usually will come back to the
same<00:02:52.970> hibernate<00:02:53.600> hibernate<00:02:54.080> feuless<00:02:54.620> site

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
same hibernate hibernate feuless site

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.430 
same hibernate hibernate feuless site
every<00:02:55.610> year<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.150> once<00:02:56.600> you've<00:02:56.780> locked<00:02:57.020> off

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
every year so once you've locked off

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.800 
every year so once you've locked off
your<00:02:57.800> your<00:02:58.100> basement<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:59.240> important

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
your your basement it's important

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.860 
your your basement it's important
basically<00:03:00.940> observe<00:03:01.940> where<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.480> snakes<00:03:02.720> have

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
basically observe where the snakes have

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.270 
basically observe where the snakes have
been<00:03:02.990> going<00:03:03.350> if<00:03:03.560> they're<00:03:03.740> using<00:03:04.160> your

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
been going if they're using your

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.310 
been going if they're using your
hibernacula<00:03:04.850> site<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.390> if<00:03:05.450> they<00:03:05.600> aren't<00:03:05.810> you

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
hibernacula site and if they aren't you

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.980 
hibernacula site and if they aren't you
can<00:03:06.530> contact<00:03:07.160> your<00:03:07.310> local<00:03:07.990> conservation

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
can contact your local conservation

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.970 
can contact your local conservation
authority<00:03:09.920> or<00:03:10.930> conservation<00:03:11.930> NGO<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.800> ask

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
authority or conservation NGO and ask

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.090 
authority or conservation NGO and ask
them<00:03:13.250> for<00:03:13.550> assistance<00:03:14.650> we<00:03:15.650> don't<00:03:15.800> recommend

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
them for assistance we don't recommend

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.370 
them for assistance we don't recommend
that<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.430> transport<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.360> snakes<00:03:17.630> more<00:03:18.200> than

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
that you transport the snakes more than

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.699 
that you transport the snakes more than
a<00:03:18.440> kilometer<00:03:18.890> from<00:03:18.920> your<00:03:19.340> help<00:03:19.930> snakes<00:03:20.930> are

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
a kilometer from your help snakes are

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.340 
a kilometer from your help snakes are
highly<00:03:22.670> location<00:03:23.239> based<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:23.810> if<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.050> move

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
highly location based so if you move

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.110 
highly location based so if you move
them<00:03:24.590> too<00:03:24.890> far<00:03:25.100> from<00:03:25.340> their<00:03:25.459> home<00:03:25.640> habitat

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
them too far from their home habitat

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.030 
them too far from their home habitat
they<00:03:26.300> they<00:03:26.600> won't<00:03:26.780> have<00:03:26.930> enough<00:03:27.140> time<00:03:27.320> to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
they they won't have enough time to

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.710 
they they won't have enough time to
establish<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.489> new<00:03:28.670> habitat<00:03:29.120> finding<00:03:29.600> you

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
establish a new habitat finding you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.750 
establish a new habitat finding you
breeding<00:03:30.590> grounds<00:03:30.920> foraging<00:03:31.340> grounds<00:03:31.519> in

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
breeding grounds foraging grounds in

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.690 
breeding grounds foraging grounds in
hibernation<00:03:32.150> sites<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:33.769> survive<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.190> winter

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
hibernation sites to survive the winter

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.820 
hibernation sites to survive the winter
so<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:35.269> from<00:03:35.450> recommend<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:36.050> you<00:03:36.290> move<00:03:36.620> them

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
so we from recommend that you move them

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.270 
so we from recommend that you move them
only<00:03:37.459> around<00:03:37.880> 200<00:03:38.180> meters<00:03:38.780> or<00:03:38.930> so<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.709> an

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
only around 200 meters or so to an

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.910 
only around 200 meters or so to an
alternate<00:03:40.670> site<00:03:40.940> or<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:42.230> basically<00:03:42.590> away

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
alternate site or just basically away

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.500 
alternate site or just basically away
from<00:03:43.160> your<00:03:43.310> your<00:03:43.580> house<00:03:43.760> your<00:03:44.030> lawn<00:03:44.239> and

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
from your your house your lawn and

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.410 
from your your house your lawn and
anywhere<00:03:44.900> that<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.260> feel<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:46.610> you're<00:03:47.000> exposed

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
anywhere that you feel is you're exposed

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.690 
anywhere that you feel is you're exposed
to<00:03:47.540> snakes<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.769> snakes<00:03:49.100> will<00:03:49.250> emerge<00:03:49.549> from

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
to snakes so snakes will emerge from

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.360 
to snakes so snakes will emerge from
hibernation<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.660> late<00:03:51.019> April<00:03:51.530> once<00:03:52.130> the

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
hibernation in late April once the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.039 
hibernation in late April once the
temperatures<00:03:52.790> start<00:03:53.120> warming<00:03:53.510> up<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.870> they

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
temperatures start warming up and they

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.110 
temperatures start warming up and they
the<00:03:54.530> air<00:03:54.650> temperature<00:03:55.100> reaches<00:03:55.549> down<00:03:55.760> below

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the air temperature reaches down below

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.449 
the air temperature reaches down below
in<00:03:56.360> their<00:03:56.720> hibernation<00:03:56.900> site<00:03:57.500> they'll<00:03:58.130> start

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
in their hibernation site they'll start

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.130 
in their hibernation site they'll start
emerging<00:03:58.910> they'll<00:03:59.180> hang<00:03:59.600> around<00:03:59.720> for<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
emerging they'll hang around for the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.210 
emerging they'll hang around for the
first<00:04:00.260> two<00:04:00.470> weeks<00:04:00.500> around<00:04:00.950> their<00:04:01.070> hibernation

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
first two weeks around their hibernation

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.860 
first two weeks around their hibernation
sites<00:04:01.820> just<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.090> bask<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:02.600> gather<00:04:02.750> some

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
sites just to bask and gather some

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.570 
sites just to bask and gather some
energy<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.590> then<00:04:04.100> around<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.549> May<00:04:05.239> June<00:04:06.080> July

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
energy and then around a May June July

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.880 
energy and then around a May June July
they'll<00:04:07.580> be<00:04:07.790> off<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.450> fields<00:04:09.260> foraging

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
they'll be off in the fields foraging

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.699 
they'll be off in the fields foraging
further<00:04:10.160> for<00:04:10.430> mice<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:11.000> for<00:04:11.570> frogs<00:04:12.019> insects

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
further for mice and for frogs insects

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.340 
further for mice and for frogs insects
so<00:04:13.310> they<00:04:13.430> won't<00:04:13.549> be<00:04:13.730> around<00:04:13.940> houses<00:04:14.450> as<00:04:14.630> much

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
so they won't be around houses as much

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.860 
so they won't be around houses as much
and<00:04:15.590> uh<00:04:15.680> in<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.190> in<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.790> real<00:04:17.239> summer<00:04:17.510> months

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and uh in the in the real summer months

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.770 
and uh in the in the real summer months
but<00:04:18.410> starting<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:19.489> late<00:04:20.060> August<00:04:20.630> and

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
but starting in late August and

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.390 
but starting in late August and
September<00:04:20.959> they'll<00:04:21.500> start<00:04:21.799> moving<00:04:21.890> back<00:04:22.070> to

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
September they'll start moving back to

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.969 
September they'll start moving back to
hibernation<00:04:22.940> sites<00:04:23.210> for<00:04:24.169> example<00:04:24.260> both

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
hibernation sites for example both

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.180 
hibernation sites for example both
houses

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
houses

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.310 
houses
Barnes<00:04:26.730> anything<00:04:27.210> with<00:04:27.330> a<00:04:27.360> stone<00:04:27.660> Foundation

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
Barnes anything with a stone Foundation

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.930 
Barnes anything with a stone Foundation
and<00:04:28.830> they'll<00:04:29.010> just<00:04:29.040> stay<00:04:29.430> there<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.730> gather

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
and they'll just stay there to gather

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.180 
and they'll just stay there to gather
more<00:04:30.210> energy<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.750> forward<00:04:31.140> for<00:04:31.380> producing

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
more energy and forward for producing

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.280 
more energy and forward for producing
mice<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.730> basically<00:04:33.720> they<00:04:33.870> just<00:04:33.900> want<00:04:34.230> to

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
mice and basically they just want to

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.050 
mice and basically they just want to
stay<00:04:34.530> near<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.920> hibernation<00:04:35.310> site<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:35.910> in

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
stay near the hibernation site so in

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.420 
stay near the hibernation site so in
case<00:04:36.270> some<00:04:37.020> nights<00:04:37.230> if<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:38.070> temperature

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
case some nights if the temperature

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.430 
case some nights if the temperature
drops<00:04:38.670> below<00:04:38.910> zero<00:04:39.030> they'll<00:04:39.810> be<00:04:39.990> able<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.200> just

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
drops below zero they'll be able to just

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.680 
drops below zero they'll be able to just
pop<00:04:41.160> right<00:04:41.190> into<00:04:41.610> there<00:04:41.910> their<00:04:42.300> overwintering

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
pop right into there their overwintering

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.680 
pop right into there their overwintering
site<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.500> just<00:04:43.770> wait<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.670> out<00:04:44.760> so<00:04:45.300> one<00:04:45.480> way<00:04:45.660> to

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
site and just wait it out so one way to

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.600 
site and just wait it out so one way to
find<00:04:45.960> out<00:04:46.140> snakes<00:04:46.590> around<00:04:46.740> your<00:04:46.980> property<00:04:47.160> or

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
find out snakes around your property or

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.360 
find out snakes around your property or
to<00:04:47.970> use<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.810> artificial<00:04:49.620> cover<00:04:49.920> boards<00:04:50.250> and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
to use a artificial cover boards and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.970 
to use a artificial cover boards and
what<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.640> is<00:04:50.790> is<00:04:51.030> sheets<00:04:51.780> of<00:04:51.990> metal<00:04:52.140> carpet

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
what that is is sheets of metal carpet

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.310 
what that is is sheets of metal carpet
or<00:04:53.190> wood<00:04:53.490> that<00:04:53.790> basically<00:04:54.210> attract<00:04:54.780> snakes<00:04:54.930> to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
or wood that basically attract snakes to

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.680 
or wood that basically attract snakes to
them<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.580> basically<00:04:56.940> creates<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.450> little

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
them so this basically creates a little

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.930 
them so this basically creates a little
island<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.170> habitat<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:58.980> sneak<00:04:59.190> Muse<00:04:59.520> to

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
island of habitat that is sneak Muse to

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.750 
island of habitat that is sneak Muse to
to<00:05:00.720> bask<00:05:00.960> under<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.560> bask<00:05:01.740> on<00:05:01.980> top

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
to bask under to bask on top

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.460 
to bask under to bask on top
usually<00:05:03.390> rodents<00:05:03.780> will<00:05:03.900> start<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.260> nest

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
usually rodents will start to nest

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.980 
usually rodents will start to nest
underneath<00:05:04.890> and<00:05:05.100> that<00:05:05.130> provides<00:05:05.930> prey<00:05:06.930> for

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
underneath and that provides prey for

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.200 
underneath and that provides prey for
snakes<00:05:07.680> to<00:05:07.860> go<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.130> find<00:05:08.340> it's<00:05:09.030> usually

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
snakes to go and find it's usually

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.910 
snakes to go and find it's usually
somewhat<00:05:09.690> moist<00:05:09.870> under<00:05:10.230> cover<00:05:10.470> board<00:05:10.770> and

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
somewhat moist under cover board and

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.260 
somewhat moist under cover board and
that<00:05:11.010> allows<00:05:11.250> snakes<00:05:11.580> go<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:11.970> shut<00:05:12.120> their

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
that allows snakes go and shut their

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.640 
that allows snakes go and shut their
skin<00:05:12.540> which<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:12.780> another<00:05:13.110> way<00:05:13.320> you<00:05:13.380> can<00:05:13.590> tell

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
skin which is another way you can tell

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
skin which is another way you can tell
just<00:05:14.580> what<00:05:14.730> species<00:05:15.030> is<00:05:15.330> using<00:05:15.660> them<00:05:15.810> so

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
just what species is using them so

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.700 
just what species is using them so
expand<00:05:17.670> to<00:05:17.850> these<00:05:18.030> boards<00:05:18.720> in<00:05:19.230> a<00:05:19.380> reptile

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
expand to these boards in a reptile

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.370 
expand to these boards in a reptile
surveys<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.400> they're<00:05:20.970> good<00:05:21.150> for<00:05:21.380> salamander

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
surveys and they're good for salamander

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.310 
surveys and they're good for salamander
snakes<00:05:22.830> frogs<00:05:23.280> mutes<00:05:23.880> so<00:05:24.720> they're<00:05:24.930> they're

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
snakes frogs mutes so they're they're

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.840 
snakes frogs mutes so they're they're
very<00:05:25.350> versatile<00:05:26.340> multi-use<00:05:26.940> tool<00:05:27.540> and<00:05:27.840> uh<00:05:29.840> yes

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
very versatile multi-use tool and uh yes

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.310 
very versatile multi-use tool and uh yes
so<00:05:32.850> you<00:05:32.940> can<00:05:33.150> see<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.450> all<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.750> low<00:05:33.900> rodents

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
so you can see is all the low rodents

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.050 
so you can see is all the low rodents
all<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.830> decay<00:05:35.130> basically<00:05:35.640> this<00:05:35.790> was<00:05:35.940> all

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
all the decay basically this was all

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.210 
all the decay basically this was all
grass<00:05:36.300> before<00:05:36.570> but<00:05:37.410> after<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:37.740> put<00:05:37.890> a<00:05:37.919> cover

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
grass before but after you put a cover

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.010 
grass before but after you put a cover
board<00:05:38.490> on<00:05:38.700> all<00:05:38.910> the<00:05:39.030> vegetation<00:05:39.419> starts<00:05:39.780> to

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
board on all the vegetation starts to

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.600 
board on all the vegetation starts to
die<00:05:40.140> and<00:05:40.440> the<00:05:40.500> snakes<00:05:40.770> like<00:05:41.010> it<00:05:41.190> when<00:05:41.400> there's

hover<00:05:44.430> boards<00:05:44.730> are<00:05:44.880> so<00:05:45.150> successful<00:05:45.360> is<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:45.870> a

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
hover boards are so successful is that a

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.930 
hover boards are so successful is that a

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
in the open mostly you'll find garter

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.010

snakes<00:05:50.370> out<00:05:50.550> basking<00:05:51.120> on<00:05:51.210> top<00:05:51.390> of<00:05:51.510> rocks<00:05:51.750> but

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
snakes out basking on top of rocks but

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.620

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.320 
bellied snakes up Decay's Brown they
prefer<00:05:57.690> cover<00:05:58.320> so<00:05:59.160> this<00:05:59.430> allows<00:05:59.700> basically

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
prefer cover so this allows basically

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.810 
prefer cover so this allows basically
them<00:06:01.050> to<00:06:01.230> hide<00:06:01.410> and<00:06:01.770> gain<00:06:02.070> energy<00:06:02.250> at<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.640> same

boards<00:06:06.060> are<00:06:06.210> very<00:06:06.360> cheap<00:06:06.660> and<00:06:06.870> they're<00:06:07.860> just

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
boards are very cheap and they're just

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.650

summers<00:06:30.480> now<00:06:30.690> and<00:06:30.990> we<00:06:31.919> find<00:06:32.160> a<00:06:32.220> lot<00:06:32.370> of<00:06:32.490> snakes

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
summers now and we find a lot of snakes

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.420 
summers now and we find a lot of snakes
like<00:06:33.060> milk<00:06:33.570> snakes<00:06:33.870> and<00:06:34.169> decays<00:06:34.860> Brown<00:06:35.190> snakes

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
like milk snakes and decays Brown snakes

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.910 
like milk snakes and decays Brown snakes
as<00:06:35.610> I've<00:06:35.729> said<00:06:35.910> before<00:06:35.970> and<00:06:36.830> basically

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
as I've said before and basically

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.460 
as I've said before and basically
they'll<00:06:39.580> utilize<00:06:39.850> this<00:06:40.360> habitat<00:06:40.810> by<00:06:41.140> their

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
they'll utilize this habitat by their

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.440 
they'll utilize this habitat by their
hibernaculum<00:06:42.190> so<00:06:42.790> they'll<00:06:42.970> be<00:06:43.120> under<00:06:43.330> this

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
hibernaculum so they'll be under this

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.960 
hibernaculum so they'll be under this
cover<00:06:43.690> board<00:06:44.050> and<00:06:44.350> around<00:06:45.100> October<00:06:45.670> or<00:06:45.820> late

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
cover board and around October or late

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.810 
cover board and around October or late
September<00:06:46.480> so<00:06:47.320> so<00:06:47.980> one<00:06:48.130> of<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.310> many<00:06:48.460> hazards

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
September so so one of the many hazards

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.970 
September so so one of the many hazards
snake<00:06:49.330> face<00:06:49.630> when<00:06:50.050> they<00:06:50.230> leave<00:06:50.770> their

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
snake face when they leave their

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.560 
snake face when they leave their
hibernacula<00:06:51.580> sites<00:06:51.820> I<00:06:52.000> can<00:06:52.090> come<00:06:52.240> back<00:06:52.390> to

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
hibernacula sites I can come back to

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.450 
hibernacula sites I can come back to
them<00:06:52.690> is<00:06:52.870> that<00:06:53.440> all<00:06:53.500> of<00:06:53.890> the<00:06:53.950> time<00:06:54.160> they<00:06:54.310> have

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
them is that all of the time they have

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.910 
them is that all of the time they have
to<00:06:54.550> cross<00:06:54.760> roads<00:06:55.180> so<00:06:55.870> snakes<00:06:56.200> first<00:06:56.470> instinct

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
to cross roads so snakes first instinct

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.650 
to cross roads so snakes first instinct
when<00:06:57.040> they<00:06:57.160> see<00:06:57.310> an<00:06:57.400> oncoming<00:06:57.700> cars<00:06:58.090> to<00:06:58.360> freeze

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
when they see an oncoming cars to freeze

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.990 
when they see an oncoming cars to freeze
and<00:06:58.960> try<00:06:59.470> to<00:06:59.530> camouflage<00:06:59.770> themselves<00:07:00.280> in<00:07:00.760> so

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
and try to camouflage themselves in so

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.970 
and try to camouflage themselves in so
that's<00:07:01.120> not<00:07:01.360> ideal<00:07:01.420> when<00:07:02.050> you<00:07:02.560> have<00:07:02.710> a<00:07:02.740> vehicle

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
that's not ideal when you have a vehicle

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.040 
that's not ideal when you have a vehicle
coming<00:07:03.430> at<00:07:03.640> you<00:07:03.820> so<00:07:04.180> a<00:07:04.210> lot<00:07:04.420> of<00:07:04.450> them<00:07:04.660> get<00:07:04.870> run

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
coming at you so a lot of them get run

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.490 
coming at you so a lot of them get run
over<00:07:05.080> on<00:07:05.410> the<00:07:05.500> roads<00:07:05.710> and<00:07:06.010> uh<00:07:06.930> basically<00:07:07.930> this

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
over on the roads and uh basically this

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.250 
over on the roads and uh basically this
impacts<00:07:08.890> a<00:07:09.010> population<00:07:09.610> as<00:07:09.790> it<00:07:10.060> takes<00:07:10.540> a<00:07:10.720> few

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260 
impacts a population as it takes a few

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.020 
impacts a population as it takes a few
years<00:07:11.500> for<00:07:11.740> a<00:07:12.040> snake<00:07:12.370> to<00:07:12.400> mature<00:07:12.760> enough<00:07:12.970> to

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030 
years for a snake to mature enough to

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.760 
years for a snake to mature enough to
lay<00:07:13.270> eggs<00:07:13.480> so<00:07:13.750> once<00:07:13.930> you<00:07:14.050> take<00:07:14.200> an<00:07:14.380> adult<00:07:14.680> snake

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
lay eggs so once you take an adult snake

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.680 
lay eggs so once you take an adult snake
out<00:07:15.040> of<00:07:15.070> the<00:07:15.250> population<00:07:15.850> you<00:07:16.300> have<00:07:16.360> to<00:07:16.540> wait

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
out of the population you have to wait

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.240 
out of the population you have to wait
another<00:07:16.900> five<00:07:17.230> ten<00:07:17.500> years<00:07:17.770> for<00:07:17.950> it<00:07:18.070> to<00:07:18.160> be

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250 
another five ten years for it to be

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.910 
another five ten years for it to be

area<00:07:27.880> and<00:07:28.540> what<00:07:28.690> we<00:07:28.720> now<00:07:28.930> understand<00:07:29.380> is<00:07:29.500> is

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 
area and what we now understand is is

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.370 
area and what we now understand is is
because<00:07:30.250> the<00:07:30.610> hibernacula<00:07:31.240> site<00:07:31.540> that<00:07:31.870> was

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380 
because the hibernacula site that was

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.100 
because the hibernacula site that was
just<00:07:32.590> shown<00:07:32.830> was<00:07:33.100> a<00:07:33.210> was<00:07:34.210> down<00:07:34.450> further<00:07:34.810> in

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110 
just shown was a was down further in

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.080 
just shown was a was down further in
look<00:07:35.410> along<00:07:35.650> the<00:07:35.680> driveway<00:07:36.070> so<00:07:36.820> what<00:07:36.970> the

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
look along the driveway so what the

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.670 
look along the driveway so what the
understand<00:07:37.510> is<00:07:37.630> that<00:07:37.660> snakes<00:07:38.290> were<00:07:38.440> getting

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680 
understand is that snakes were getting

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.650 
understand is that snakes were getting
hit<00:07:38.890> mostly<00:07:39.340> moving<00:07:40.000> to<00:07:40.150> and<00:07:40.330> from<00:07:40.510> their

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660 
hit mostly moving to and from their

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.690 
hit mostly moving to and from their
hibernacula<00:07:41.290> site<00:07:41.530> and<00:07:42.040> what<00:07:42.130> we<00:07:42.250> can<00:07:42.370> do<00:07:42.520> now

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:42.700 
hibernacula site and what we can do now

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.060 
hibernacula site and what we can do now
is<00:07:43.000> basically<00:07:43.240> put<00:07:43.750> up<00:07:43.840> reptile<00:07:44.320> fencing<00:07:44.830> put

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.070 
is basically put up reptile fencing put

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.890 
is basically put up reptile fencing put
up<00:07:45.160> culverts<00:07:45.610> to<00:07:45.790> assist<00:07:46.180> snakes<00:07:46.450> so<00:07:46.750> they

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:46.900 
up culverts to assist snakes so they

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.720 
up culverts to assist snakes so they
don't<00:07:47.110> get<00:07:47.320> hit<00:07:48.040> on<00:07:48.070> the<00:07:48.280> roads<00:07:48.460> they<00:07:48.580> don't

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:48.730 
don't get hit on the roads they don't

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.950 
don't get hit on the roads they don't
have<00:07:48.940> to<00:07:49.090> go<00:07:49.240> over<00:07:49.570> they<00:07:50.350> can<00:07:50.530> go<00:07:50.650> under
