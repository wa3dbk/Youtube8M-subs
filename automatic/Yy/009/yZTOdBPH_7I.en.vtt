 let's see what things bring we do not start 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.810
 with the weapons skins and above they look 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.570
 normal here are the new waterfalls are 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.730
 looks pretty good is how it's like 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.380
 a suit of armor is bought 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.630
 pretty good and chlorophyll this one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.750
 I like I like this green quoted 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.590
 but not seen anymore or is it supposed to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.840
 they are going to take them out I do not know if they are going to take it out 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.370
 with boxes or nose unlockable I do not know 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.700
 but as I told you they lived to take out 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.250
 plus 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.280
 today we are going to see the armors 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.430
 here it's up there you can not see anything outside 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.430
 the normal 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:11.200
 to see this car 13 there is this plane 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:16.299
 did not give up I like this crazy doctor 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:20.229
 it looks pretty good what it does not 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.720
 for believing it really they did not put 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.920
 the crazy but if you put a skin 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.920
 crazy armor 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.380
 and they really happen it can not be and in what 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.070
 that burns 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.560
 that I do not like not in a grenade says 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.900
 the rowing recalls and the games 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.190
 multiplayer of yesteryear with this role 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.190
 because it can not be is let's try it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.000
 now let's try the maps and we're going to 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.860
 see what we can expect from them not what 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 what I know is basically what interests me 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.650
 a prediction that we can be 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.840
 What to expect is to know 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.970
 it worries me when we're going to start with 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.550
 way of blood but I'm very worried 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.770
 that map because then the way of blood 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.440
 or country road as it is 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.030
 you remember him or call him and 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.210
 Well let's see what we're going to see 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.480
 weapons are the normal ones so 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.530
 that's the important thing is change of 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.650
 blood blood on the road but good 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.459
 let's give it 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.519
 let's start here they exist in the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:39.470
 banks that were spent with that I've 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.200
 remained without taking it out but good to them 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820
 and before jumping always to games 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.430
 multiplayer every new maps come out 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.500
 always always play 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.110
 one or two private to study it do not 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.790
 I'm analyzing more grenade weapons 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.519
 flamethrower banned 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.370
 there is good music or it is not considered my 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.840
 know more ugly 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.700
 let's see how they changed it today as 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.319
 I know how it adapts to the new 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.959
 yemen software needs me 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.950
 he is very worried because he is on his way 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.840
 purchases, it will be 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.970
 this very 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.320
 to start, I change a lot 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.360
 let's see this I imagine it is spam 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.540
 That's why I did not know 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.879
 now the map is bigger 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.450
 well I do not like this in the back 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.310
 there's a flamethrower that I do not see well 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.510
 this is the slip that we all say 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.910
 we know there is 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.260
 go ahead 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.610
 increased in the size of the map that 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.080
 it's fine until there's a boom see I think to 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.380
 jose divina how fast will he give me 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.380
 problems 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.310
 you knew I'm going to give problems there's a 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.140
 boom in boomers I do not like and is 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.460
 I feel that weapon is wrong in this 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.200
 Map 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.620
 I have not liked two 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.620
 things 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.480
 the flamethrower is starting 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.030
 the boom in the boat I grab in one of those 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.209
 weapons 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.730
 this broad that's fine that I like 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.100
 so there's no way to say 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.470
 campear who already see that in this map 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.530
 way of champions will be but a 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.599
 color problemÃ³n or this world like 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.689
 the game wants to kill forces 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:31.870
 320 if you want to ignore it let's see the 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.870
 Map 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.440
 down below first shields where before 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.900
 there was the arch 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.120
 I feel the broader map that's good 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.800
 I tell them that what worried me the most about 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.800
 this map were 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.710
 Well basically closed spaces 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.750
 for example here this is very given for 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.260
 grenades 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.490
 and now they expanded it a lot the maps are 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.520
 all right 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.370
 I like that because we would lend 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.800
 a path so closed as to not 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.409
 be waiting and camping 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.409
 it just comes like they're this 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.220
 well, as if gathering the two points 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:23.230
 I like that 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.230
 this time sign button 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.510
 although I feel good the map is that this 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.080
 it's pretty good 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:35.940
 I like it except the weapons that got him 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.940
 the map I see it then very well 

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:41.749
 this part is what I love the most 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.349
 before here as people would start 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:47.269
 champion a lot and now we have 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.360
 space like to go by many sides 

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:53.300
 I do that well I like it I like it 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.819
 that in george they have adapted me because 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.369
 for the issue of grenades and 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.199
 shotgun that has less a range this 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:03.289
 game is like for more closed spaces 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:06.080
 and what have they done, let's say more 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.839
 open more with more spaces to 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.969
 move so that people are not 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.409
 hidden nothing else I see it I see it very 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:16.059
 all right 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.059
 I had a success of this magnum 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:23.719
 finally this map got into things 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.699
 good things I did not like 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:28.339
 example this boom shot of truth what 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.729
 I see a reverent nonsense this is not 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:33.490
 brother should have gotten it 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.729
 but good are the things that want us 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.419
 do not easy medium no but there they see the 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.189
 be in front 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:41.949
 pure launches my football called no 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:45.069
 grenade launchers really go from 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.680
 you will see and where is the search and the boom 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.400
 shot 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.930
 bush seeks a soft and flamethrower not 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.120
 we are lost of age but 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.000
 but well anyway, there will be 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.980
 adapt to that 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.960
 well with this I finish this video 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:07.470
 nothing else is a quick view of the map in 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.230
 yes well I see that they have put more 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.810
 Wide the map of what the area is 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.370
 well what is the combat becomes more 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.220
 fluid because there is more 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.430
 space and there are not so many places where 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.080
 hide that I do it well that I like 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.810
 I did not like the weapons that they put 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.910
 I hope that they change it later but 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.640
 well, finally 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:33.000
 in a few words it 's pretty good 

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.950
 this road map of blood on video 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.020
 via bleeds sager as the call of 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.450
 here we will remember it as 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.090
 shopping way but I feel box the 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.260
 fields no longer have so many options but 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.030
 well thank you very much for having seen 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.370
 this video follow environments of the 

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:50.570
 next maps and see you in another 

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.570
 good bye
