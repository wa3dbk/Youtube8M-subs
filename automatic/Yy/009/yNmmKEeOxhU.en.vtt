00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.999 
think what's important is is I suppose
not<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.569> individual<00:02:04.990> but<00:02:05.140> there's<00:02:05.350> some<00:02:05.890> of

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
not the individual but there's some of

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.490 
not the individual but there's some of
the<00:02:06.100> collective<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.850> that's<00:02:07.000> what<00:02:07.500> something

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
the collective and that's what something

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.749 
the collective and that's what something
we've<00:02:08.619> been<00:02:08.649> hammering<00:02:09.039> out<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.250> last<00:02:09.519> while

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
we've been hammering out the last while

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.460 
we've been hammering out the last while
and<00:02:10.060> that's<00:02:10.929> what<00:02:11.080> we're<00:02:11.200> going<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> keep

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and that's what we're going to keep

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.180 
and that's what we're going to keep
hammering

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.809 

you
