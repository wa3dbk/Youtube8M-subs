so<00:04:17.239> I'm<00:04:17.690> actually<00:04:17.810> gonna<00:04:18.049> set<00:04:18.410> our<00:04:18.560> lid<00:04:18.709> on<00:04:18.739> the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
so I'm actually gonna set our lid on the

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.310 
so I'm actually gonna set our lid on the
jar<00:04:19.040> right<00:04:19.880> there<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.389> fits<00:04:20.570> perfectly<00:04:20.630> and

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
jar right there so it fits perfectly and

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.560 
jar right there so it fits perfectly and
just<00:04:21.889> twist<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.310> until<00:04:22.490> its<00:04:22.820> fingertip<00:04:23.330> tight

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
just twist it until its fingertip tight

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.420 
just twist it until its fingertip tight
which<00:04:24.200> means<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.710> don't<00:04:24.950> have<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.310> twist

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
which means that you don't have to twist

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.310 
which means that you don't have to twist
it<00:04:25.669> too<00:04:25.880> hard<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.630> want<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.900> be<00:04:26.960> able<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.200> let

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
it too hard you want to be able to let

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.230 
it too hard you want to be able to let
