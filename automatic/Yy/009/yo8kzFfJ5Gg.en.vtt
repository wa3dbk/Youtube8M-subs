00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
under the idea of being a look at ideas

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.969 
under the idea of being a look at ideas
where<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:04.990> go<00:02:05.140> next<00:02:05.350> in<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.679> local

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
where to go next in the local

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.649 
where to go next in the local
neighborhood<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.729> there's<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:07.000> lot<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.420> depth

neighborhood so there's a lot of depth
in<00:02:07.810> systems<00:02:08.289> as<00:02:08.440> well<00:02:10.470> essentially<00:02:11.470> we've

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
in systems as well essentially we've

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.070 
in systems as well essentially we've

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.240 
maintained the concept from my first
restaurant<00:02:14.319> cuz<00:02:14.560> we<00:02:14.620> felt<00:02:14.830> that<00:02:14.860> was<00:02:15.069> that

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
restaurant cuz we felt that was that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.500 
restaurant cuz we felt that was that
that<00:02:15.370> was<00:02:15.459> our<00:02:15.519> proof<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.790> concept<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:16.239> felt<00:02:16.420> is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
that was our proof of concept I felt is

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.390 
that was our proof of concept I felt is
very<00:02:16.690> successful<00:02:16.870> but<00:02:17.739> what<00:02:17.920> we've<00:02:18.040> done<00:02:18.190> here

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
very successful but what we've done here

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280 
very successful but what we've done here
is<00:02:18.459> we've<00:02:18.850> played<00:02:19.239> around<00:02:19.450> experimented<00:02:20.140> more

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
is we've played around experimented more

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.600 
is we've played around experimented more
with<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.470> design<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.769> totally<00:02:21.340> different

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
with the design a totally different

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.210 
with the design a totally different
interior<00:02:21.819> feel<00:02:22.239> much<00:02:22.780> more<00:02:23.019> use<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> natural

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220
