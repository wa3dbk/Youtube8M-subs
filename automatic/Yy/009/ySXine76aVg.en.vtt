to<00:00:07.770> push<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.309> cube<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:09.210> see<00:00:09.389> what<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.660> cube

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
to push the cube to see what the cube

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.879 
to push the cube to see what the cube
can<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.530> cannot<00:00:11.190> do<00:00:12.139> it's<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.559> thing<00:00:13.830> to

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
can and cannot do it's one thing to

can and cannot do it's one thing to
print<00:00:14.280> out<00:00:14.400> things<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.030> know<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.660> do

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
print out things that I know it can do

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.230 
print out things that I know it can do
and<00:00:16.080> it'll<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.680> absolutely<00:00:16.920> beautiful<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
and it'll be absolutely beautiful and

quite another to pick objects that will

really<00:00:21.000> stress<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.900> cube<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.500> make<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.920> really

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
really stress the cube to make it really

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.060 
really stress the cube to make it really
work<00:00:23.550> hard<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.990> case<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.590> wanted<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
work hard and in this case I wanted to

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.790 
work hard and in this case I wanted to
see<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.060> cube<00:00:27.390> could<00:00:27.720> print<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.170> really

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
see if the cube could print a really

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.939 
see if the cube could print a really
complex<00:00:29.429> object<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.949> downloaded

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
complex object like this I downloaded

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.569 
complex object like this I downloaded
this<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.840> Thingiverse<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.309> it's<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
this from Thingiverse and it's a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.290 
this from Thingiverse and it's a
mathematic<00:00:36.300> vase<00:00:36.710> very<00:00:37.710> complex<00:00:38.399> really

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
mathematic vase very complex really

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.889 
mathematic vase very complex really
meant<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.140> printed<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.149> powder<00:00:42.149> type<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
meant to be printed on a powder type of

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.160 
meant to be printed on a powder type of
printer<00:00:43.370> it's<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:45.450> meant<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
printer it's not really meant to be

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.090 
printer it's not really meant to be
printed<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.160> an<00:00:47.579> extrusion<00:00:48.649> printer<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
printed on an extrusion printer like the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
printed on an extrusion printer like the
cube<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> thought<00:00:50.879> I'd<00:00:51.030> give<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.420> shot

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
cube but I thought I'd give it a shot

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.020 
cube but I thought I'd give it a shot
one<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> features<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.670> has

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
one of the features that it has

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.080 
one of the features that it has
is<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:55.260> straight<00:00:55.739> line<00:00:55.800> right<00:00:56.460> through<00:00:56.730> here

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
is this straight line right through here

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
is this straight line right through here
right<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.260> those<00:00:58.980> are

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
right in there so that those are

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.490 
right in there so that those are
straight<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.969> wanted<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> see<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> cube

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
straight I wanted to see if the cube

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.690 
straight I wanted to see if the cube
could<00:01:01.770> bridge<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> print<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> without

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
could bridge that and print this without

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
could bridge that and print this without
supports<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.210> turns<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> design

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
supports it turns out that the design

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.440 
supports it turns out that the design
does<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.280> allow<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.210> going<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
does not allow that but I'm going to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.620 
does not allow that but I'm going to
show<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.520> now<00:01:11.520> let's<00:01:11.760> go<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.360> see

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
show you that now let's go in and see

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.780 
show you that now let's go in and see
how<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> printed<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:14.000> supports<00:01:16.640> okay<00:01:17.640> I'm

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
how I printed it with supports okay I'm

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
how I printed it with supports okay I'm
just<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> step<00:01:18.540> through<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.810> few<00:01:19.110> images

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
just going to step through a few images

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.330 
just going to step through a few images
not<00:01:20.100> many<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.790> few<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.740> you'll<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:23.100> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
not many just a few and you'll see that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.359 
not many just a few and you'll see that
I've<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:23.820> printing<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.689> supports<00:01:25.369> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
I've I'm printing it with supports you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
I've I'm printing it with supports you
can<00:01:26.520> barely<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> piece<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.290> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
can barely see the piece right back in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.850 
can barely see the piece right back in
here<00:01:29.420> but<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:30.900> through<00:01:30.930> you'll<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
here but as we go through you'll see it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.230 
here but as we go through you'll see it
come<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.820> support

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
come up and now you see the the support

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
come up and now you see the the support
here<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.990> very<00:01:37.170> interesting<00:01:37.560> look

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
here now this is very interesting look

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.270 
here now this is very interesting look
at<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> way<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.090> support<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.780> designed<00:01:40.320> see

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
at the way this support is designed see

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
at the way this support is designed see
these<00:01:41.430> little<00:01:41.700> teeth<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.350> makes<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
these little teeth that makes the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.030 
these little teeth that makes the
support<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.369> from<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> cube<00:01:45.570> very<00:01:46.229> very<00:01:46.649> easy

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
support in from the cube very very easy

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.600 
support in from the cube very very easy
to<00:01:47.640> remove<00:01:47.970> those<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.079> who<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.530> other<00:01:49.860> 3d

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
to remove those of you who have other 3d

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
to remove those of you who have other 3d
printers<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.450> recognize<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
printers will recognize that this is a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.539 
printers will recognize that this is a
very<00:01:53.369> nice<00:01:53.640> strategy<00:01:54.299> for<00:01:55.079> support<00:01:55.770> makes<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
very nice strategy for support makes it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
very nice strategy for support makes it
very<00:01:56.790> easy<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.329> remove<00:01:57.659> compared<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
very easy to remove compared to the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
very easy to remove compared to the
other<00:01:58.649> kinds<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.250> support<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.969> are<00:02:00.060> out

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
other kinds of support that are out

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.289 
other kinds of support that are out
there<00:02:00.259> it's<00:02:01.259> continued<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.850> you'll<00:02:03.030> see

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
there it's continued on now you'll see

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.440 
there it's continued on now you'll see
it<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.659> building<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.640> complex<00:02:05.640> shape<00:02:06.000> very

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it is building the complex shape very

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.280 
it is building the complex shape very
very<00:02:06.719> well<00:02:07.819> I've<00:02:08.819> gone<00:02:09.390> more

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
very well I've gone more

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.259 
very well I've gone more
and<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:12.469> we<00:02:12.530> start<00:02:12.950> now<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.549> notice<00:02:13.999> that<00:02:14.150> it

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
and now we start now you notice that it

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.869 
and now we start now you notice that it
doesn't<00:02:14.689> need<00:02:14.900> support<00:02:15.530> up<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.859> here<00:02:16.159> it<00:02:16.519> does

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
doesn't need support up in here it does

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.319 
doesn't need support up in here it does
use<00:02:17.359> support<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:18.230> these<00:02:18.650> holes<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.430> those<00:02:20.120> are

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
use support in these holes and those are

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.690 
use support in these holes and those are
very<00:02:20.540> easily<00:02:20.840> cleaned<00:02:21.469> out<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:22.459> pretty

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
very easily cleaned out and that pretty

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.369 
very easily cleaned out and that pretty
much<00:02:23.079> finishes<00:02:24.159> our<00:02:25.159> object<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.840> now<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.049> want

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
much finishes our object so now I want

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.449 
much finishes our object so now I want
to<00:02:27.469> show<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:28.069> object<00:02:28.689> as<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:30.769> was<00:02:30.920> printed

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
to show you the object as it was printed

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.110 
to show you the object as it was printed
as<00:02:31.579> all<00:02:32.329> of<00:02:32.719> the<00:02:33.280> supports<00:02:34.280> were<00:02:34.489> taken<00:02:34.939> off

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
as all of the supports were taken off

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.209 
as all of the supports were taken off
the<00:02:35.450> support<00:02:35.900> was<00:02:36.049> relatively<00:02:36.650> easy<00:02:36.799> to

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:37.219 
the support was relatively easy to

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.490 
the support was relatively easy to
remove<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.909> I'm<00:02:38.750> going<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.959> show<00:02:39.139> you<00:02:39.200> two

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
remove and I'm going to show you two

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.770 
remove and I'm going to show you two
things<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.609> first<00:02:40.909> thing<00:02:41.180> I'm<00:02:41.329> going<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.569> show

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
things the first thing I'm going to show

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.349 
things the first thing I'm going to show
you<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.889> object<00:02:43.579> itself<00:02:44.030> without

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
you is the object itself without

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.640 
you is the object itself without
supports<00:02:45.230> until<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.980> failed<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:48.290> reason

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
supports until it failed and the reason

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.339 
supports until it failed and the reason
it<00:02:48.799> failed<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.459> because<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:50.540> these<00:02:50.810> straight

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
it failed is because of these straight

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.580 
it failed is because of these straight
lines<00:02:51.650> right<00:02:52.129> here<00:02:52.540> design<00:02:53.540> has<00:02:54.019> everything

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
lines right here design has everything

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.649 
lines right here design has everything
to<00:02:55.010> do<00:02:55.219> with<00:02:55.250> whether<00:02:55.760> or<00:02:56.030> not<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.449> need

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
to do with whether or not you need

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.119 
to do with whether or not you need
supports<00:02:58.510> now<00:02:59.510> after<00:02:59.870> seeing<00:03:00.199> this<00:03:00.439> I<00:03:00.769> want<00:03:01.069> to

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
supports now after seeing this I want to

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.830 
supports now after seeing this I want to
show<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.669> object<00:03:01.849> that<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:02.419> did<00:03:02.810> I

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
show you the object that we did I

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.039 
show you the object that we did I
printed<00:03:03.379> with<00:03:03.859> support<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.790> think<00:03:05.569> he<00:03:05.870> did<00:03:06.019> a

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
printed with support I think he did a

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:18.120 
printed with support I think he did a
great<00:03:06.319> job<00:03:06.349> I<00:03:06.969> hope<00:03:07.969> you<00:03:08.120> do<00:03:08.299> too

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.190 

you
