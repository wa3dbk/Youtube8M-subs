running Pittsburgh because I kind of

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.409 
running Pittsburgh because I kind of
flip-flop<00:03:49.590> between<00:03:50.009> Pittsburgh<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.609> Arizona

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419

so in this one I want with Pittsburgh I

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.999 
so in this one I want with Pittsburgh I
like<00:03:54.540> Pittsburgh<00:03:55.049> because<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:55.500> gives<00:03:55.620> me<00:03:55.799> one

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:56.009 
like Pittsburgh because it gives me one

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.640 
like Pittsburgh because it gives me one
more<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.400> run<00:03:56.699> base<00:03:56.939> when<00:03:57.720> I'm<00:03:57.810> Arizona<00:03:58.439> I

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
more of a run base when I'm Arizona I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.640 
more of a run base when I'm Arizona I
think<00:03:59.009> I<00:03:59.129> get<00:03:59.189> a<00:03:59.430> little<00:03:59.699> to<00:04:00.090> throw<00:04:01.079> happy<00:04:01.470> and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
think I get a little to throw happy and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.439 
think I get a little to throw happy and
I<00:04:02.099> don't<00:04:02.430> try<00:04:02.699> to<00:04:03.049> you<00:04:04.049> know<00:04:04.079> run<00:04:04.909> and<00:04:05.909> and<00:04:06.389> I

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
I don't try to you know run and and I

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:07.999 
I don't try to you know run and and I
think<00:04:06.479> running<00:04:06.989> in<00:04:07.109> this<00:04:07.229> game<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> little

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.009 
think running in this game is a little

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.740 
think running in this game is a little
bit<00:04:08.129> overrated<00:04:08.459> because<00:04:08.939> when<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.150> play<00:04:09.180> some

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
bit overrated because when you play some

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.960 
bit overrated because when you play some
real<00:04:10.290> good<00:04:10.530> players<00:04:10.829> they're<00:04:11.340> stripping<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
real good players they're stripping the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.360 
real good players they're stripping the
ball<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.629> about<00:04:12.840> on<00:04:13.019> every<00:04:13.530> single<00:04:13.739> tackle

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
ball just about on every single tackle

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.270 
ball just about on every single tackle
and<00:04:14.579> if<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.780> don't<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.440> cover<00:04:16.739> up<00:04:16.979> or<00:04:17.250> if

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
and if you don't you know cover up or if

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.189 
and if you don't you know cover up or if
you<00:04:17.430> are<00:04:17.699> running<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.419> special<00:04:18.630> egg<00:04:18.900> with<00:04:19.079> the

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
you are running a special egg with the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.349 
you are running a special egg with the
Cowboys<00:04:19.650> when<00:04:20.219> you<00:04:20.370> run<00:04:20.579> uh<00:04:20.609> give<00:04:21.000> me<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.180> I

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
Cowboys when you run uh give me that I

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.939 
actually showed I'm doing a lot of
swatting<00:05:17.310> instead<00:05:18.090> of<00:05:18.530> intercepting<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.680> I

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
swatting instead of intercepting and I

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.640 
swatting instead of intercepting and I
think<00:05:20.190> that<00:05:20.310> that's<00:05:20.340> key<00:05:20.850> because<00:05:21.199> not<00:05:22.199> every

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
think that that's key because not every

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.980 
think that that's key because not every
pass<00:05:23.250> that's<00:05:23.580> thrown<00:05:23.910> is<00:05:24.180> intercepted

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
pass that's thrown is intercepted

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.020 
pass that's thrown is intercepted
sometimes<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:26.010> have<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.430> just<00:05:26.460> go<00:05:26.699> for<00:05:26.820> the

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
sometimes you have to just go for the

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.930 
sometimes you have to just go for the
SWAT<00:05:27.419> instead<00:05:28.350> of<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.710> actual<00:05:28.940> interception

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
SWAT instead of the actual interception

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.150 
SWAT instead of the actual interception
so<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.360> did<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:30.990> lot<00:05:31.229> this<00:05:31.410> game<00:05:31.650> I'm

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
so I did that a lot this game I'm

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.430 
so I did that a lot this game I'm
running<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.639> lot<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.940> strong<00:05:33.210> close<00:05:33.570> as<00:05:33.780> my<00:05:34.139> run

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
running a lot of strong close as my run

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.060 
running a lot of strong close as my run
base<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.190> then<00:05:35.820> for<00:05:36.320> passing<00:05:37.320> I'm<00:05:37.560> really

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
base and then for passing I'm really

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.550 
base and then for passing I'm really
