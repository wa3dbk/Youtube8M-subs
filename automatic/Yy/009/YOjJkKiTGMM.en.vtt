00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this is the big thing this is the big

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.880 
this is the big thing this is the big
thing<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.920> thought<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.869> what<00:01:54.869> about<00:01:55.200> his<00:01:55.409> powers

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
thing I thought of what about his powers

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.469 
thing I thought of what about his powers
being<00:01:56.100> used<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.729> people<00:01:57.000> he's<00:01:57.090> fighting

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
being used on the people he's fighting

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.819 
being used on the people he's fighting
against<00:01:58.070> they<00:01:59.070> need<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.460> even<00:01:59.820> stronger

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
against they need to be even stronger

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
against they need to be even stronger
okay<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:01.890> let's<00:02:02.369> say<00:02:02.520> he's<00:02:02.700> facing<00:02:02.939> your<00:02:03.329> role

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
okay so let's say he's facing your role

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.940 
okay so let's say he's facing your role
and<00:02:05.360> let's<00:02:06.360> say<00:02:06.509> he's<00:02:06.630> supposedly<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.500> going

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
and let's say he's supposedly is going
to<00:02:08.190> certain<00:02:08.610> distance<00:02:08.940> he<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.149> change

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to certain distance he could change

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510 
to certain distance he could change
