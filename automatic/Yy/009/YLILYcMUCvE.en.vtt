00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
over the place yet only 58 chemistry i

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.609 
over the place yet only 58 chemistry i
believe<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.300> also<00:00:21.960> davage<00:00:22.380> fear

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
believe and also davage fear

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
believe and also davage fear
surprisingly<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> right<00:00:23.850> back<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.359> also

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
surprisingly as a right back and also

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.170 
surprisingly as a right back and also
alex<00:00:25.019> i<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> CDM<00:00:25.980> who<00:00:26.130> normally<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
alex i think as a CDM who normally is a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.910 
alex i think as a CDM who normally is a
centre-back<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.410> are<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> greatest

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
centre-back so we are not the greatest

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
centre-back so we are not the greatest
team<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.369> came<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.730> against<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.359> although

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
team we came up against but although

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
team we came up against but although
this<00:00:31.679> team<00:00:32.009> wasn't<00:00:32.189> really<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> best<00:00:32.730> he<00:00:32.910> was

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
this team wasn't really the best he was

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
this team wasn't really the best he was
an<00:00:33.149> okay<00:00:33.570> play<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> decent<00:00:34.350> player<00:00:34.770> took

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
an okay play it was a decent player took

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
an okay play it was a decent player took
us<00:00:35.579> like<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.030> think<00:00:36.210> 30<00:00:36.510> minutes<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.050> until

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
us like I think 30 minutes or so until

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.290 
us like I think 30 minutes or so until
we<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.800> create<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.160> first<00:00:38.399> proper<00:00:38.850> chance<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we we create a first proper chance that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
we we create a first proper chance that
would<00:00:39.390> policy<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.649> game<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:40.950> also<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> little

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
would policy this game was also a little

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.069 
would policy this game was also a little
bit<00:00:41.640> laggy<00:00:41.879> from<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> time<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:42.870> made

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
bit laggy from time to time which made

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
bit laggy from time to time which made
it<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.410> quite<00:00:43.829> hard<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> her<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> create<00:00:44.730> some

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it also quite hard to her to create some

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.970 
it also quite hard to her to create some
chances<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.870> 38th<00:00:46.289> minute<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.680> went<00:00:46.860> on

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
chances but a the 38th minute we went on

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
chances but a the 38th minute we went on
a<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.610> nice<00:00:47.789> skillman<00:00:48.210> with

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
minute he got him a chance as well a
nice<00:01:15.630> block<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:15.960> from<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:16.890> rafinha

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
nice block there from I think rafinha

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
nice block there from I think rafinha
who<00:01:17.520> pretty<00:01:17.729> much<00:01:17.820> cleared<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.330> off<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.720> line

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
who pretty much cleared it off the line

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080 
who pretty much cleared it off the line
and<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.650> how<00:01:19.770> he<00:01:19.799> gave<00:01:20.130> minutes<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and that is how he gave minutes so as I

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.179 
and that is how he gave minutes so as I
said<00:01:21.150> before<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:22.170> had<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.530> chances<00:01:23.040> but

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
said before we had a lot of chances but

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.890 
said before we had a lot of chances but
mainly<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.030> lack<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.630> said

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
mainly because of the lack it was said

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.210 
mainly because of the lack it was said
to<00:01:24.930> us<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.380> bit<00:01:25.560> difficult<00:01:25.740> sometimes

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
to us a little bit difficult sometimes

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
to us a little bit difficult sometimes
to<00:01:26.549> actually<00:01:27.090> convert<00:01:27.509> him<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.810> well<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to actually convert him as well and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
to actually convert him as well and
although<00:01:28.710> his<00:01:28.829> team<00:01:29.040> wasn't<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> best

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
although his team wasn't really the best

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
although his team wasn't really the best
my<00:01:30.030> opponent<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.509> actually<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> pretty<00:01:31.140> decent

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
my opponent was actually a pretty decent

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.950 
my opponent was actually a pretty decent
player<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.159> yeah<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.700> move<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.060> into<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.370 
cristiano ronaldo for rafinha so at that
point<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.180> knew<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.540> game<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.899> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.259> be

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
point I knew this game was going to be

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.870 
point I knew this game was going to be
really<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:52.890> tough<00:01:53.070> especially<00:01:53.460> with

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
really really tough especially with

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090 
really really tough especially with
Ronaldo<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.509> Aguero<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:55.079> front<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.920> we

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
Ronaldo and Aguero up front but I we

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
Ronaldo and Aguero up front but I we
starting<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.549> very<00:01:56.880> very<00:01:57.000> nicely<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.719> with

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
starting so very very nicely there with

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.480 
starting so very very nicely there with
her<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.200> Polaski<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.950> hoping<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.460> that

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
her with Polaski I was hoping for that

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
her with Polaski I was hoping for that
skill<00:01:59.880> run<00:02:00.060> straight<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.110> corner<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
skill run straight from a corner but it

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
skill run straight from a corner but it
ended<00:02:01.979> up<00:02:02.070> being<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.939> dribbling<00:02:03.479> not

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
ended up being just some dribbling not

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.600 
ended up being just some dribbling not
really<00:02:03.869> skill<00:02:04.140> moves<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.560> stuff<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.219> just

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
really skill moves and stuff so I just

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.980 
really skill moves and stuff so I just
gonna<00:02:05.759> count<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> normal<00:02:06.630> call<00:02:06.810> for

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
gonna count it as a normal call for

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.020 
gonna count it as a normal call for
velocity<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.770> yeah<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.429> take<00:02:08.640> care<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:08.910> do

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
velocity so yeah we do take care we do

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.369 
velocity so yeah we do take care we do
take<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.300> lead<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.599> nonetheless<00:02:09.810> which<00:02:10.200> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
take the lead that nonetheless which is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.559 
take the lead that nonetheless which is
nice<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.220> 24th<00:02:11.760> minute<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.239> another

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
nice and a 24th minute we get another

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.610 
nice and a 24th minute we get another
goal<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.050> time<00:02:13.110> with

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
goal this time with

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.050 
goal this time with
like<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.739> said<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.430> bit<00:02:14.519> lucky<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
like I said a little bit lucky with the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360 
like I said a little bit lucky with the
spin<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.900> do<00:02:16.019> make<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.230> tuna<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.860> an<00:02:16.980> extent

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
spin but we do make a tuna on an extent

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.860 
spin but we do make a tuna on an extent
elite<00:02:17.610> which<00:02:17.849> is<00:02:18.000> really<00:02:18.209> really<00:02:18.360> nice<00:02:18.599> and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
elite which is really really nice and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.479 
elite which is really really nice and
did<00:02:19.260> not<00:02:19.379> really<00:02:19.560> expect<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.099> be<00:02:20.129> honest

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
did not really expect that to be honest

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.280 
did not really expect that to be honest
since<00:02:20.670> my<00:02:20.849> opponent<00:02:21.299> had<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> pretty<00:02:21.930> good<00:02:22.140> team

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
since my opponent had a pretty good team

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.199 
since my opponent had a pretty good team
but<00:02:22.560> luckily<00:02:22.920> enough<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.280> yeah<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.670> were<00:02:23.909> sort

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
but luckily enough we yeah we were sort

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.000 
but luckily enough we yeah we were sort
of<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> dominant<00:02:24.780> side<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.019> guess<00:02:25.319> then<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.860> got

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
of the dominant side I guess then we got

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.770 
of the dominant side I guess then we got
another<00:02:26.250> chance<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.580> fakir<00:02:27.060> which<00:02:27.510> went

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
another chance with fakir which went

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.050 
another chance with fakir which went
white<00:02:28.110> then<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.769> continue<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.310> 35th<00:02:29.909> minute

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
white then I we continue on 35th minute

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
white then I we continue on 35th minute
he<00:02:30.239> got<00:02:30.360> himself<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.780> first<00:02:31.019> chance<00:02:31.319> there<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
he got himself the first chance there a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.680 
he got himself the first chance there a
nice<00:02:31.769> shot<00:02:31.980> at<00:02:32.129> the<00:02:32.250> near<00:02:32.430> post<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.909> fantastic

penalty<00:02:43.709> couldn't<00:02:44.069> really<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.370> anything

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
penalty couldn't really do anything

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.910 
penalty couldn't really do anything
about<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.150> since<00:02:45.510> he<00:02:45.720> pretty<00:02:46.079> much<00:02:46.170> came<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.739> me

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
about it since he pretty much came to me

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.740 
about it since he pretty much came to me
and<00:02:47.129> he<00:02:47.489> finished<00:02:48.000> off<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.180> toronado<00:02:48.629> to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and he finished off with toronado to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.479 
and he finished off with toronado to
make<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.109> 2-1<00:02:49.290> but<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.010> was<00:02:50.129> pretty<00:02:50.310> much

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
make it 2-1 but that was pretty much

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.130 
make it 2-1 but that was pretty much
everything<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> second<00:02:51.510> half<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:51.900> was

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
everything in the second half it was

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.559 
everything in the second half it was
overall<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.920> guess<00:02:53.220> an<00:02:53.430> even<00:02:53.730> game<00:02:53.940> he<00:02:54.390> got

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
overall I guess an even game he got

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.000 
overall I guess an even game he got
himself<00:02:54.690> some<00:02:55.019> chances<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.590> well<00:02:55.769> especially

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
himself some chances as well especially

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.650 
himself some chances as well especially
towards<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.760> end<00:02:56.790> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> game<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.510> they're

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
towards the end of the game but they're

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.390 
towards the end of the game but they're
lucky<00:02:57.870> enough<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.319> still<00:02:58.590> won<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.859> game<00:02:59.040> 2-1

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
lucky enough we still won the game 2-1

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.819 
lucky enough we still won the game 2-1
so<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.209> continued<00:03:00.599> on<00:03:00.720> next<00:03:00.750> game<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.620> came<00:03:01.799> up

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
so we continued on next game we came up

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.860 
so we continued on next game we came up
against<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.280> subscriber<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.299> look<00:03:03.750> at

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
against the subscriber and just look at

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.140 
against the subscriber and just look at
this<00:03:03.959> team<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.379> mean<00:03:04.560> he<00:03:05.040> had<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.159> 79<00:03:05.730> rating

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
this team I mean he had a 79 rating

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.599 
this team I mean he had a 79 rating
overall<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.170> also<00:03:07.470> his<00:03:07.650> attack<00:03:08.069> i<00:03:08.190> think<00:03:08.430> was

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
overall and also his attack i think was

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.360 
overall and also his attack i think was
67<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:09.540> then<00:03:09.720> look<00:03:10.019> at<00:03:10.200> his<00:03:10.290> team<00:03:10.530> yet<00:03:10.769> ronaldo

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
67 but then look at his team yet ronaldo

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.360 
67 but then look at his team yet ronaldo
up<00:03:11.489> front<00:03:11.790> three<00:03:12.540> legends<00:03:13.049> some<00:03:13.379> informs<00:03:14.040> just

up front three legends some informs just
an<00:03:14.519> insane<00:03:14.879> team<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.480> after<00:03:16.140> ten<00:03:16.349> minutes<00:03:16.500> I

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
an insane team and after ten minutes I

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.069 
an insane team and after ten minutes I
was<00:03:17.459> already<00:03:17.639> surprised<00:03:18.120> because<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.930> can

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
was already surprised because you can

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.750 
was already surprised because you can
clearly<00:03:19.319> see<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.650> his<00:03:19.919> attacker<00:03:20.310> I'm<00:03:20.579> not

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
clearly see that his attacker I'm not

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.550 
clearly see that his attacker I'm not
really<00:03:20.880> too<00:03:21.090> sure<00:03:21.120> which<00:03:21.510> one<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.720> is<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.139> he

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
really too sure which one it is but he

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.199 
really too sure which one it is but he
was<00:03:22.709> clearly<00:03:23.040> offside<00:03:23.519> but<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.819> referee<00:03:24.000> is

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
was clearly offside but the referee is

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.870 
was clearly offside but the referee is
still<00:03:24.630> decide<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.139> let<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.440> go<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.859> know<00:03:26.250> he<00:03:26.730> did

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
still decide to let it go I know he did

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.550 
still decide to let it go I know he did
not<00:03:27.000> touch<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.389> ball<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:27.720> he<00:03:27.840> still<00:03:28.109> sort<00:03:28.470> of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
not touch the ball but he still sort of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.949 
not touch the ball but he still sort of
interfered<00:03:29.489> his<00:03:29.700> attack<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.780> ball

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
interfered his attack because the ball

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.479 
interfered his attack because the ball
clearly<00:03:31.230> went<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.590> him<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.829> can<00:03:31.980> see<00:03:32.160> clearly

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
clearly went to him you can see clearly

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.369 
clearly went to him you can see clearly
especially<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.419> if<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.720> scroll<00:03:33.989> back<00:03:34.049> a

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
especially if you if you scroll back a

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.229 
especially if you if you scroll back a
look<00:03:34.829> on<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.069> radar<00:03:35.250> because<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.760> think<00:03:36.090> Bowa

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
look on the radar because I think Bowa

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.050 
look on the radar because I think Bowa
tanglewood<00:03:36.720> was<00:03:36.900> just<00:03:37.739> did<00:03:37.889> lb<00:03:38.250> y<00:03:38.400> Paz<00:03:38.639> clearly

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
tanglewood was just did lb y Paz clearly

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.789 
tanglewood was just did lb y Paz clearly
to<00:03:39.239> win<00:03:39.359> but<00:03:39.540> he<00:03:39.690> just<00:03:39.870> decided<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.379> avoid<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
to win but he just decided to avoid the

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.559 
to win but he just decided to avoid the
ball<00:03:40.980> with<00:03:41.129> year<00:03:41.340> which<00:03:41.459> was<00:03:41.609> unlucky<00:03:42.060> but

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
ball with year which was unlucky but

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.180 
ball with year which was unlucky but
still<00:03:42.810> he<00:03:42.900> makes<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.199> one<00:03:43.379> nil<00:03:43.590> than<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> couple

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
still he makes it one nil than a couple

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.770 
still he makes it one nil than a couple
minutes<00:03:44.489> later<00:03:44.639> we<00:03:44.819> got<00:03:44.940> herself<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.389> go<00:03:45.569> back

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
minutes later we got herself to go back

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.629 
minutes later we got herself to go back
there<00:03:45.810> with<00:03:46.169> luck<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.440> said<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.829> make<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.190> 1-1

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
there with luck I said to make it 1-1

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.909 
there with luck I said to make it 1-1
but<00:03:47.879> overall<00:03:48.209> this<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.440> really

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
but overall this was just a really

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.259 
but overall this was just a really
really<00:03:50.040> tough<00:03:50.280> game<00:03:50.549> especially<00:03:50.819> with<00:03:51.239> all

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
really tough game especially with all

pretty hard to stop him and he also
created<00:03:56.430> most<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.030> chances<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:57.750> overall

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
created most of the chances but overall

is<00:04:07.829> pretty<00:04:08.040> much<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:08.459> he<00:04:08.760> did<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:09.750> some

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
is pretty much all he did you get some

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.809 
is pretty much all he did you get some
lby<00:04:10.470> passes<00:04:10.980> again<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.340> her<00:04:11.430> now<00:04:11.579> though<00:04:11.790> I

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
lby passes again to her now though I

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.819 
lby passes again to her now though I
think<00:04:12.239> he<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.510> say<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.139> they're<00:04:13.290> slightly<00:04:13.560> as

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
think he I say that they're slightly as

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.039 
think he I say that they're slightly as
well<00:04:14.040> but<00:04:14.250> overall<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:15.299> was<00:04:15.449> my<00:04:15.599> opponent

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
well but overall it was my opponent

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.620 
well but overall it was my opponent
creating<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> chances<00:04:16.949> but<00:04:17.070> then<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.459> 88<00:04:18.030> 82nd

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
creating the chances but then in 88 82nd

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.150 
creating the chances but then in 88 82nd
minute<00:04:18.660> he's<00:04:18.870> got<00:04:19.079> a<00:04:19.109> beautiful<00:04:19.590> long<00:04:19.859> shot<00:04:20.039> I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
minute he's got a beautiful long shot I

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.890 
minute he's got a beautiful long shot I
with<00:04:20.310> gross-out<00:04:20.849> lagoons<00:04:21.570> really<00:04:21.780> do

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
with gross-out lagoons really do

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.080 
with gross-out lagoons really do
anything<00:04:22.169> about<00:04:22.409> it<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:22.770> think<00:04:22.950> so<00:04:23.099> Miette<00:04:23.849> was

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
anything about it I think so Miette was

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.060 
anything about it I think so Miette was
it<00:04:24.270> was<00:04:24.419> fair<00:04:24.630> enough<00:04:24.810> they<00:04:24.930> went<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.380> also

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
it was fair enough they went in also

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.300 
it was fair enough they went in also
just<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.700> fair<00:04:26.880> result

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
just a fair result

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.800 
just a fair result
thing<00:04:27.460> because<00:04:27.820> as<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.120> said<00:04:28.180> before<00:04:28.360> my

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
thing because as I said before my

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.629 
thing because as I said before my
opponent<00:04:29.260> created<00:04:29.590> most<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.010> chances<00:04:30.460> i

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
opponent created most of the chances i

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.820 
opponent created most of the chances i
unfortunately<00:04:31.330> forgot<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.139> record<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.650> bit

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
unfortunately forgot to record the bit

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.260

where<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.070> can<00:04:33.250> actually<00:04:33.370> see<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.820> stats<00:04:34.090> but

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.520 
i think yet like six shots on target and
