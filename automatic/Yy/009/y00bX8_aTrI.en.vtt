00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.329
 I've already put my onion - now it 's 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.309
 very unspoken with the people who 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.579
 does not like football 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.539
 so I 'll let it down a little bit 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:12.499
 and automatically add the eye or 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:14.329

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.829

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.229
 passion fruit 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.709

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.939
 flowers questioning thyme thyme is Ã© 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:28.789

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.920
 when mixing let the 10 minutes 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.689
 I'll take the thyme rosemary branch 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.709

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.560
 salt 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.829

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.409

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.849
 little lemon
