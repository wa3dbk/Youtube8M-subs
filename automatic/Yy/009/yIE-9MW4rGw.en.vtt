00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.860 

masters<00:01:32.950> allow<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.370> crack<00:01:34.910> these<00:01:35.540> are<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
masters allow it to crack these are the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.830 
masters allow it to crack these are the
potatoes<00:01:36.320> raw<00:01:37.160> potatoes<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:38.090> can<00:01:38.360> do<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:38.690> if

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
potatoes raw potatoes you can do it if
