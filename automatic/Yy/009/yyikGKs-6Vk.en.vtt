00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.470
 and fell to such 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.680
 by the way, this is one of the missions 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.680
 So 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.730
 which you remember was in the commercials 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.550
 you put 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.550
 I'm old 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.290
 original control 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.840
 the tablet 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 love 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:01.500
 here he is 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:01.500
 epic friends to you children rest 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.569
 so okay second 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.450
 Olga 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.040
 I 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.250
 from that 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.870
 stora pull the trigger 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.209
 but 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.220
 what is it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.710
 answer if they fly accordingly 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.740
 on us or from us it's easy to do we 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.510
 themselves flying side here and so this external 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.850
 easy task to get them what is the delay 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.850
 it's really hard to guess 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.790
 like now here's the last brush 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.790
 shot case 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.680
 ready for sure 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.109
 but 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.910
 if you will this mission then yourself 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.949
 try to pass right in the very 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.060
 repeater start three helicopters because 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:47.860
 which is very hard when they fly away 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.860
 could destroy 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.240
 I remind you once again that you can ask 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.240
 questions will give them to me 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.240
 skype 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.180
 and we will start to make today 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.480
 frequently asked questions and 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.000
 lay out their vkontakte 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.430
 And on gamer stevi point ru to have 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.960
 questions did not repeat the same 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.960
 upgraded that way 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.960

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.759
