00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.389
 here is the guide 35 more from deutscher 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.940
 1 as its name indicates the guide 35 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.090
 is a mountaineering backpack 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.800
 that's its capacity 35 liters allows 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.699
 still charge a lot of material 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.289
 so for alpine hikes 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.880
 mountaineering on a two or even three 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.460
 days everything depends of course what we 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.550
 wants to put me inside so the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 guide is very very very well known in the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 all the families of backpack 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 hunter it exists in 35 and 45 liters 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.360
 in humans in standard model the small 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.340
 more than one sees matches him to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.410
 the stop rise actually that allows for 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.039
 win 8 liters we enjoy a bag 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.620
 who is 35 + am fast 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.140
 it also exists in sim version so 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.210
 for the ladies the little gentlemen in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.780
 version 30 plus and 40 more to enter 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
 in the technical specifics of the bag 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.420
 I insist but it's really a bag 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.909
 mountaineers designed by mountaineers 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.159
 German guides French guides 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.850
 Austrian guides wear it all 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.049
 days they gave their hand to 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 continually improve this bag 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.000
 that is why I present you the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.799
 new guide for 2013 so compared 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.409
 to the old a new design and then 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.620
 full of little details 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.170
 so what is very important in 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.460
 the mountain is that the material does not 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.020
 not a handicap that we have to be 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.710
 secure to the maximum and that's really the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.170
 program philosophy of this bag there 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.350
 do not feel it so we have a back 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.080
 of alpine letter with the system varies 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.810
 flex so it's a water consisting of 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.630
 two rows of moss and foam that 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.670
 are streaked which allows the bags to follow 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.610
 body movements a chimney 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.650
 still ventilation to evacuate 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.390
 humidity and the system your level of 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.610
 the lumbar belt of the system varies 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.410
 feast that actually is the belt is 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.320
 mounted on a pivot that we do not see who 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.840
 scratch and that actually allows the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.300
 belt to be dissociate from the movement 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.470
 of the backpack the buttocks and when the bag 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.540
 is charged if there is a movement of 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.850
 swaying all the movements are 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.570
 absorbed by this belt so that's 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.580
 very effective when you use the bag 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.930
 with a harness you have the 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:49.580
 possibility of removing this belt on 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.190
 dismantle the straps on the side and we 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.080
 just pull the belt I was talking about 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.570
 security so all these systems is the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.880
 makes the bag make good contact with 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.400
 the back but also that is not too much 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.920
 wide so he's not going to go over on the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.550
 sides did that we sentenced to the court 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.720
 meets a need for security 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.070
 then one of the others 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.600
 particularities of this bag is its 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.410
 robustness and its material is boring 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.020
 better style between united quotes 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.590
 therefore require one has a bag and reinforce 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.340
 on the bottom we have a ripstop fabric 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:31.440
 very very thick so on this guide we 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.340
 found a very ingenious system for 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.590
 the ice ax to come and put the ice ax 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.690
 the right to put one on each side 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.670
 which makes it possible to put 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.940
 ice axes for the icefall more 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.840
 that we will always need two 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.950
 we have the passers-by for the material we have 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.390
 of course this little scraps to hang 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.650
 puree but also why not 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:03.460
 boats one of the success of the bag too 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.930
 it's easy to access of course 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:11.700
 can access on the top a sect 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.080
 but we are also at trélazé which allows 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.280
 to access the contents of the bag without having to 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:23.830
 everything is also small 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.020
 passing on the top and on the sales 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.450
 on top we can put a system 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.590
 to hang something a rug 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.370
 the crampons we also have this same 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.780
 system on the front so that's fine 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.250
 allow to put for example a 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.600
 accessory available from guitar 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.610
 which is the helmet 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.080
 so in fact it's a little trick that 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.420
 comes to stand on the front in 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.650
 which one can put his helmet see 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.440
 also the crampons 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.009
 we find on this guide so on the 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:58.070
 fold a pocket with a culture that is 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:02.750
 waterproof and framed in case of small 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:05.539
 little rain the little cord to put 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:11.720
 the keys reality the farms by opening 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:15.199
 the pocket and sovereign goes as on all 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.690
 the doctor bags have the label sos milk 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.940
 conditioned the instructions to be followed in 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:27.229
 case of trouble is a check mark 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:29.710
 under the bar we also find a 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.180
 strap to put the rope 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.919
 the smallest details also 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.419
 found on many bags at once 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:43.150
 of the dna of height of course there is the 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:48.910
 waterproof compartment for the water bag 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.900
 we also have a metaboli floor mat 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.169
 inside the bag 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.360
 that's going to allow you to break the 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.669
 crust 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.669
 we know that 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.270
 it will be necessary to put it back when you 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.780
 leave with his box which allows 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.590
 stiffen the back and strengthen again 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.919
 you complete to improve the quality of 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.919
 porterage 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:26.570
 finally talk about it at the beginning the stop of the 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:32.070
 famous big half liter with of course 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:35.030
 the hat that is not sewn nose with 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:39.000
 two men who actually allows to have 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.200
 one of the bones without being bothered actually 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.510
 by the hood at the back of the head 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:50.010
 there we have the passerby for the pocket at 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:52.200
 water and finally two very wide ski door 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.030
 to adapt to new 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.910
 new skis that are a bit wider 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.010
 and then on the for conditions of 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.940
 security of security reasons a 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:05.810
 little whistle on the chest sambre 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:11.160
 to note also on the literatures 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:14.250
 40 + guide and 45 guides a difference 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:18.990
 compared to the 30 and 35 series 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:24.249
 so this is the arrival of a brooch what 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:29.789
 a compartment bag bottom with access 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:29.789
 on the bottom and that is divisible or good 

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:37.499
 it's the only one of our differences with 

00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:37.499
 the other the other version 2
