00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.220

 I said in the last days that I did not 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.099
 knows how to cook at absolutely nothing 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.990
 so I 'm going to teach one of the most 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.699
 refined that you have to do to us 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 do when you were 88 and consists of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 very complex mixture of mycelium with 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.150
 people 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.929
 the first step is to fill this pan 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.279
 that water for each little pack of 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.280
 spaghetti 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.350
 You will need two cups of 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:48.840
 water and then the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:51.590
 Fire high fire and put water to start 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.449
 boiling when the water is boiling 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:01.949
 you put the fire down and put the pasta 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.739
 now it is slowly stirring until the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.790
 pasta stays soft when pasta has 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.860
 soft 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.680
 if you like the full time 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.680
 pozinho you already put the pozinho 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.470
 mix well and that's where the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.990
 special ingredient that came before 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.509
 chicken you break it and throw it over 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.140
 mogi 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.070
 and mixes happily mix with 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.950
 hot water she's already cooking the egg 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.600
 Quickly you can see your white skates 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.670

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.399
 What is cooking? It will take longer. 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.159
 or less about 30 seconds 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.150
