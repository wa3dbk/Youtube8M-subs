hidden back here that took a good 5-10
minutes<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.750> out<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.770> once

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
minutes get out of there and then once

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.590 
minutes get out of there and then once
you<00:00:41.070> get<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.340> three<00:00:41.579> screws<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.420> thing

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you get your three screws out this thing

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.110 
you get your three screws out this thing
just<00:00:42.870> pops<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.320> off<00:00:44.239> pull<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:47.399> then

off to your your fan here so you can get

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.330 
off to your your fan here so you can get
at<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.260> electrical<00:00:56.190> connection<00:00:58.250> there's<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
at the electrical connection there's a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.450 
at the electrical connection there's a
screw<00:00:59.850> behind<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.050> took<00:01:01.590> me<00:01:01.829> 15

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
screw behind here that took me 15

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
screw behind here that took me 15
minutes<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.850> take<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.960> there's<00:01:04.199> two

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
minutes to take out so there's two

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.859 
minutes to take out so there's two
screws<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:07.430> they<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.090> your

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
to the electrical connector the actual

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.350 
to the electrical connector the actual
connection<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.220> pull<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> tab<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.180> back

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
connection you pull the tab on the back

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.300 
connection you pull the tab on the back
just<00:01:21.960> pops<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.070> your

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
just pops right out and that is your

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.840 
just pops right out and that is your
second<00:01:27.060> electrical<00:01:27.540> connection<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.170> there

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:45.010 

take<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.030> push<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> tab<00:01:33.659> in

screws okay I just checked into this and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.820 
screws okay I just checked into this and
I<00:02:08.700> guess<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.060> circuit<00:02:09.600> board<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.290> old<00:02:10.500> duh

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
I guess the circuit board is the old duh

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.160 
I guess the circuit board is the old duh
style<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.820> new<00:02:12.000> style<00:02:12.330> has<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.900> done

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
style in the new style has that done

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.320 
style in the new style has that done
over<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:13.740> I'm<00:02:13.860> gonna<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.700> in

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.960 
cabin air filter I was going to replace
it<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.050> uh<00:02:19.280> thirty<00:02:20.280> bucks<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:20.850> this

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
it but it's uh thirty bucks for this

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.500 
it but it's uh thirty bucks for this
thing

so I think I'm just gonna vacuum it out
just<00:02:25.560> take<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.950> screw<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.610> little

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
just take that screw out the little

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.580 
just take that screw out the little
cover<00:02:26.970> comes<00:02:27.270> off<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.870> believe<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.350> thing

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
cover comes off and I believe this thing

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.400 
cover comes off and I believe this thing
just<00:02:28.940> pulls<00:02:29.940> right<00:02:30.180> out<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.570> here<00:02:30.720> somehow<00:02:30.990> I

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
just pulls right out of here somehow I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:45.199 
just pulls right out of here somehow I
remember<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:31.980> replaced<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.060> before<00:02:44.209> alright

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
remember I replaced this before alright

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.660 
remember I replaced this before alright
here's<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:46.170> cabin<00:02:46.709> air<00:02:47.280> filters

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
here's what the in cabin air filters

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.330 
here's what the in cabin air filters
look<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.090> I'm<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.020> vacuum<00:02:49.950> these

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
look like I'm just going to vacuum these

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.830 
look like I'm just going to vacuum these
out<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.700> then<00:02:50.790> spray<00:02:51.300> them<00:02:51.480> with<00:02:51.510> like

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
out and then spray them with like

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.170 
out and then spray them with like
Febreze<00:02:52.080> or<00:02:52.680> something<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> throw<00:02:53.910> them<00:02:54.060> back

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
Febreze or something and throw them back

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.880 
Febreze or something and throw them back
in<00:02:54.239> there<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.900> new<00:02:55.020> ones<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:55.440> were<00:02:55.530> fifteen

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
in there the new ones there were fifteen

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.440 
in there the new ones there were fifteen
bucks<00:02:56.070> apiece<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.940> don't<00:02:57.270> know<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.360> just

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
bucks apiece and I don't know I just

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.600 
bucks apiece and I don't know I just
okay<00:02:58.020> if<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.709> think<00:02:58.890> you're<00:02:59.070> going<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.310> clean

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
okay if you think you're going to clean

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.880 
okay if you think you're going to clean
your<00:02:59.940> ear<00:03:00.450> cabin<00:03:00.870> filter<00:03:01.110> your<00:03:01.440> mistake<00:03:01.860> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
your ear cabin filter your mistake and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.820 
your ear cabin filter your mistake and
it's<00:03:02.580> all<00:03:02.750> microscopic<00:03:03.750> stuff<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.530> didn't

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
it's all microscopic stuff it didn't

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.500 
it's all microscopic stuff it didn't
really<00:03:04.920> clean<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.970> sprayed<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.420> with

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
really clean it but I sprayed it with

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.750 
really clean it but I sprayed it with
Febreze<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:08.070> know<00:03:08.160> that's<00:03:08.370> good<00:03:08.670> enough

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
Febreze and you know that's good enough

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.360 
Febreze and you know that's good enough
if<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.239> bothers<00:03:09.600> me<00:03:09.630> I'll<00:03:09.930> suck<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.860> up<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.250> pay

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
if it bothers me I'll suck it up and pay

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.520 
if it bothers me I'll suck it up and pay
two<00:03:11.580> thirty<00:03:11.880> bucks<00:03:12.180> all<00:03:12.930> right<00:03:13.080> just<00:03:13.380> take

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
two thirty bucks all right just take

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.300 
two thirty bucks all right just take
your<00:03:13.770> resistor<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:15.510> only<00:03:15.690> goes<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.170> one<00:03:16.260> way

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.449 

don't<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.790> take<00:03:21.060> your<00:03:21.300> fan<00:03:22.459> motor

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
don't you get to take your fan motor

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.979 
don't you get to take your fan motor
wire<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.480> put<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.020> through<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.440> cover

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
wire and put it through the cover

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.680 
wire and put it through the cover
otherwise<00:03:27.989> you'll<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.260> doing<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.800> again

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:50.470 

oh<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.860> new<00:03:41.040> ones<00:03:41.250> turn<00:03:41.520> around

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.910 

slide<00:03:51.480> your<00:03:51.510> let's<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:51.960> alert<00:03:53.540> click<00:03:54.920> alright

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
slide your let's go alert click alright

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.070 
slide your let's go alert click alright
let's<00:03:56.250> start<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.060> up<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.240> see<00:03:57.450> if<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.630> fixed<00:03:57.930> it

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
let's start it up and see if it fixed it

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:12.950 
let's start it up and see if it fixed it
before<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.530> put<00:03:58.770> it<00:03:58.890> back<00:03:58.920> there<00:03:59.160> here<00:03:59.460> we<00:03:59.580> go

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.810 

well<00:04:13.960> they're<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.380> go<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.740> hard<00:04:15.130> part<00:04:15.760> about

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
well they're to go the hard part about

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.640 
well they're to go the hard part about
that<00:04:16.120> job<00:04:16.360> was<00:04:16.540> up<00:04:16.720> getting<00:04:16.959> schools<00:04:17.350> out<00:04:17.530> of

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
that job was up getting schools out of

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.650 
that job was up getting schools out of
there<00:04:17.770> otherwise<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.670> was<00:04:18.790> pretty<00:04:19.030> simple<00:04:19.360> I

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
there otherwise it was pretty simple I

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.440 
there otherwise it was pretty simple I
probably<00:04:20.380> could<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.709> left<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.550> cover<00:04:22.150> on

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
probably could have left that cover on

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.110 
probably could have left that cover on
the<00:04:22.630> blower<00:04:23.020> motor<00:04:23.320> fan<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.310> gotten<00:04:25.060> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
the blower motor fan and gotten the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.480 
the blower motor fan and gotten the
electrical<00:04:25.510> outlet<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.930> way<00:04:26.170> but<00:04:26.800> people

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
electrical outlet that way but people

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.520 
electrical outlet that way but people
who<00:04:27.580> haven't<00:04:27.790> done<00:04:28.030> this<00:04:28.150> before<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.990> just

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
who haven't done this before I just

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.930 
who haven't done this before I just
wanted<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.860> show<00:04:30.070> them<00:04:30.220> what<00:04:30.430> was<00:04:30.580> in<00:04:30.730> there

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
wanted to show them what was in there

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.870 
wanted to show them what was in there
and<00:04:31.210> then<00:04:31.420> how<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.630> get<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:32.050> out<00:04:32.880> it's

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
and then how to get that out it's

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.210 
and then how to get that out it's
amazing<00:04:34.330> how<00:04:34.450> much<00:04:34.600> power<00:04:35.320> runs<00:04:35.710> through<00:04:36.010> that

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
amazing how much power runs through that

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.900 
amazing how much power runs through that
resistor<00:04:37.210> as<00:04:37.420> you<00:04:37.570> can<00:04:37.750> see<00:04:38.080> it<00:04:38.440> has<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.460> little

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
resistor as you can see it has a little

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.820 
resistor as you can see it has a little
bit<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.210> wear<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.390> tear<00:04:40.720> on<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:41.020> but<00:04:41.560> when<00:04:41.680> I'd

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
bit of wear and tear on it but when I'd

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.850 
bit of wear and tear on it but when I'd
be<00:04:41.980> driving<00:04:42.190> down<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.610> road<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.210> the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
be driving down the road and the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.060 
be driving down the road and the
family's<00:04:44.860> on<00:04:45.040> five<00:04:45.610> high<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:47.620> whole<00:04:47.770> lot

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
family's on five high the whole lot

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.040 
family's on five high the whole lot
electrical<00:04:48.580> system<00:04:48.910> would<00:04:49.060> dim<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.570> almost

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
electrical system would dim and almost

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.860 
electrical system would dim and almost
like<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.410> car<00:04:50.830> was<00:04:51.010> stolen<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:52.390> knew

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
like the car was stolen so I knew

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.770 
like the car was stolen so I knew
something<00:04:53.320> was<00:04:53.950> wrong<00:04:54.730> with<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.030> resistor

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
something was wrong with that resistor

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.870 
something was wrong with that resistor
all<00:04:56.410> right<00:04:56.530> well<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.800> just<00:04:56.950> want<00:04:57.670> to<00:04:57.730> thank
