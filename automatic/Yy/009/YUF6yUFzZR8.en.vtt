 brian white has a four of her the 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:56.430
 truth is that it weighs a little but not so much 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 well it takes me more than 20 minutes 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.269
 and once downloaded 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 you will leave here a winrar file what 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.680
 we open 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.860
 and this we unzip it in the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.170
 desk compresses it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.270
 when you go to the desk you will all 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.390
 these things 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.229
 and good to open the 54 of for the first 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.950
 time this is the 64 bit and this is the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.770
 32 bits 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.630
 when opening the cinema 4d for the first time 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.590
 will come out 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.560
 some knit things a man 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.799
 I do not know as if this one was recording 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.850
 and below all will come a big picture 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.820
 to put a serial is worth what 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.950
 we are going to have to buy but instead of 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.350
 buy it and spend the money on a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.939
 money foolishly like fucking program to 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.210
 the best we are only going to use three or 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.649
 four times we will use a serial 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.159
 that I will leave you in the description of 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.840
 video is worth a few serials in case 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.420
 This one does not work because I have not tried it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.969
 and well we copy it and what 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.290
 we paste there in the box and now of 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.380
 done that because you will go to the cinema 4d 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.350
 and in Spanish 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:23.160
 I'm going to open the 54 of study r12 vale 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.990
 we the 54 of is only the study r 12 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.200
 how good you could say it 's a bit 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.170
 better than a 4d cinema because they have 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.880
 just a few more things 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.880
 this is the appearance that has 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.950
 and good here you can already secretariate our 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:46.990
 videos make liters if you want too 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.780
 do things in 4d and that was all for today 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.540
 I hope I have helped you and those that 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.130
