00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629 

I'm<00:00:00.960> an<00:00:01.050> imagination<00:00:01.680> station<00:00:01.979> I<00:00:02.370> think<00:00:02.550> it's

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
I'm an imagination station I think it's

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:03.830 
I'm an imagination station I think it's
probably<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.939> pretty<00:00:03.060> good<00:00:03.179> day<00:00:03.419> since<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:03.780> don't

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
probably a pretty good day since I don't

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.869 
probably a pretty good day since I don't
have<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.230> have<00:00:04.440> protective<00:00:04.890> eyewear<00:00:05.130> or<00:00:05.700> any

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
have to have protective eyewear or any

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.730 
have to have protective eyewear or any
kind<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.240> blast<00:00:06.569> shield<00:00:06.899> around<00:00:07.049> us<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:07.410> I

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
kind of a blast shield around us so I

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.040 
kind of a blast shield around us so I
with<00:00:08.189> my<00:00:08.340> extreme<00:00:08.700> scientist<00:00:09.269> Jeff<00:00:09.540> see<00:00:09.780> today

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
with my extreme scientist Jeff see today

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.450 
with my extreme scientist Jeff see today
and<00:00:10.290> we're<00:00:10.740> going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.889> figure<00:00:11.040> out<00:00:11.280> what

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
and we're going to figure out what

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520 
and we're going to figure out what
happens<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.969> marshmallow<00:00:12.570> when<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.230> take

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
happens to a marshmallow when you take

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.620 
happens to a marshmallow when you take
out<00:00:13.769> all<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.490> oxygen<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:15.120> all<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> air<00:00:15.509> around

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
out all the oxygen or all the air around

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.689 
out all the oxygen or all the air around
it<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.500> absolutely<00:00:17.460> so

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
it what are we going to do absolutely so

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.150 
it what are we going to do absolutely so
just<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.690> enter<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.920> in

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
just to enter this a little bit so in

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.590 
just to enter this a little bit so in
the<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.550> balloon<00:00:20.820> when<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.180> fill<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.390> up

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the in a balloon when we fill it up

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.880 
the in a balloon when we fill it up
there's<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.080> whole<00:00:22.320> bunch<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.590> air<00:00:22.710> molecules

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
there's a whole bunch of air molecules

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
there's a whole bunch of air molecules
whizzing<00:00:23.640> around<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.210> pushing<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
whizzing around in there pushing on the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
whizzing around in there pushing on the
outside<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.470> balloon<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> only

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
outside of that balloon now the only

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.160 
outside of that balloon now the only
thing<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.269> keeps<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.689> balloon<00:00:28.050> from

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
thing that keeps this balloon from

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.109 
thing that keeps this balloon from
expanding<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.010> expanding<00:00:29.099> forever<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.000> ever

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
expanding and expanding forever and ever

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
expanding and expanding forever and ever
is<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.019> fact<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.289> there<00:00:31.500> are<00:00:31.529> air<00:00:31.769> molecules

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
is the fact that there are air molecules

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
is the fact that there are air molecules
on<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> outside<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.030> balloon<00:00:33.239> also

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
on the outside of the balloon also

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.600 
on the outside of the balloon also
pressing<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.829> right<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.460> we're

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
pressing in on it all right so we're

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.770 
pressing in on it all right so we're
going<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.880> find<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.300> would<00:00:36.420> happen<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
going to find out what would happen to a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.049 
going to find out what would happen to a
marshmallow<00:00:37.260> if<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.860> removed<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.579> those

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
marshmallow if we removed all of those

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.229 
marshmallow if we removed all of those
air<00:00:39.540> molecules<00:00:39.600> around<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.700> okay

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
air molecules around it all right okay

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.389 
air molecules around it all right okay

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
happening is we're pulling out all those
air<00:01:14.520> molecules<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.119> all<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> air<00:01:15.479> molecules

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
air molecules so all the air molecules

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.420 
air molecules so all the air molecules
that<00:01:16.020> inside<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> marshmallow<00:01:17.100> there's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that inside that marshmallow there's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.219 
that inside that marshmallow there's
thousands<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.090> tiny<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.450> air<00:01:18.689> pockets<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
thousands of tiny little air pockets and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.050 
thousands of tiny little air pockets and
they're<00:01:19.619> all<00:01:19.799> expanding<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.759> they're<00:01:20.880> all

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
they're all expanding and they're all

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.260 
they're all expanding and they're all
making<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.110> marshmallow<00:01:22.409> grow<00:01:23.060> he's<00:01:24.060> like

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
making that marshmallow grow he's like

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.820
