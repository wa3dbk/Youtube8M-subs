we've already established how importance
my<00:00:03.510> fears<00:00:03.750> for<00:00:03.899> bushcraft<00:00:04.490> but<00:00:05.490> it's<00:00:05.609> also

my fears for bushcraft but it's also

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.280 
my fears for bushcraft but it's also
really<00:00:06.029> important<00:00:06.509> that<00:00:06.569> your<00:00:06.750> life<00:00:06.899> has<00:00:07.080> kept

as sharp as possible
my<00:00:09.030> favorite<00:00:09.389> way<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.510> doing<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.769> use

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
my favorite way of doing that is to use

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.890 
my favorite way of doing that is to use
a<00:00:11.099> Japanese<00:00:11.610> water<00:00:11.880> stone<00:00:12.179> which<00:00:12.450> has<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
a Japanese water stone which has a

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.039 
a Japanese water stone which has a
coarse<00:00:13.679> side<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.490> dark<00:00:14.790> red<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
coarse side which is the dark red and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.099 
coarse side which is the dark red and
the<00:00:17.000> mustard<00:00:18.000> colored<00:00:18.300> side<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:18.900> a

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the mustard colored side is actually a

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.720 
the mustard colored side is actually a
much<00:00:19.439> finer<00:00:19.770> grit

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:38.779 

I<00:00:25.789> cut<00:00:26.390> myself<00:00:26.600> a<00:00:27.289> slice<00:00:27.650> of<00:00:27.710> time

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.540 

more<00:00:39.780> Japanese<00:00:40.230> Waterstone<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.010> used<00:00:41.250> has

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
more Japanese Waterstone can be used has

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.540 
more Japanese Waterstone can be used has
to<00:00:41.699> be<00:00:41.789> soaked<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.210> water<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.280> put<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to be soaked in water so we just put it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.599 
to be soaked in water so we just put it
in<00:00:44.670> water<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.359> a<00:00:45.390> couple<00:00:45.659> of<00:00:45.719> minutes<00:00:46.609> the

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
in water for a couple of minutes the

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.160 
in water for a couple of minutes the
water<00:00:47.850> helps<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> prevent<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> pores<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
water helps to prevent the pores of the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
water helps to prevent the pores of the
stone<00:00:49.530> from<00:00:49.769> clogging<00:00:49.979> up<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.579> pieces<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
stone from clogging up with pieces of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
stone from clogging up with pieces of
metal<00:00:51.359> and<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.899> also<00:00:52.050> helps<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> lubricate<00:00:52.769> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
metal and it also helps to lubricate the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.359 
metal and it also helps to lubricate the
blade<00:00:53.339> so<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> runs<00:00:53.850> smoothly<00:00:54.269> over<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> top

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:55.369 
blade so it runs smoothly over the top

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.469 
blade so it runs smoothly over the top
after<00:00:56.369> a<00:00:56.399> couple<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.729> minutes<00:00:57.030> we<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.299> take

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:57.479 
after a couple of minutes we can take

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.899 
after a couple of minutes we can take
the<00:00:57.629> stone<00:00:58.250> out<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.519> water<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.699> next

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
the stone out of the water and the next

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.430 
the stone out of the water and the next
thing<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.119> do<00:01:03.269> is<00:01:03.299> to<00:01:03.600> use<00:01:03.780> what's<00:01:03.989> known<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.320> an

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
thing we do is to use what's known as an

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.899 
thing we do is to use what's known as an
agarose<00:01:04.979> stone<00:01:05.479> this<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:07.580> rubbed<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that the tip of the blade also gets

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.999 
that the tip of the blade also gets
sharpened<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.050> stone<00:01:55.530> looks<00:01:55.739> like<00:01:55.890> it's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
sharpened if the stone looks like it's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.400 
sharpened if the stone looks like it's
getting<00:01:56.129> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.670> dry<00:01:57.360> sprinkle<00:01:58.319> some

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
getting a little bit dry sprinkle some

getting a little bit dry sprinkle some
more<00:01:58.560> water<00:01:58.739> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.039> top<00:01:59.190> and<00:02:00.030> carry<00:02:00.330> on<00:02:02.479> you

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
more water on the top and carry on you

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.419 
more water on the top and carry on you
can<00:02:03.629> really<00:02:03.750> tell<00:02:04.050> by<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.319> sound<00:02:04.679> if<00:02:05.129> you've

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
can really tell by the sound if you've

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.850 
can really tell by the sound if you've
got<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.729> right<00:02:05.989> should<00:02:06.989> be<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> very<00:02:07.440> smooth

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
got this right should be a very smooth

got this right should be a very smooth
sound<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.420> also<00:02:12.650> look<00:02:13.650> at<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.860> edge<00:02:13.950> of

sound you can also look at the edge of

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.860 
sound you can also look at the edge of
the<00:02:14.160> blade<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:15.390> from<00:02:15.599> where<00:02:15.750> it's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the blade and see from where it's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.630 
the blade and see from where it's
polished<00:02:16.260> if<00:02:16.739> you're<00:02:17.099> sharpening<00:02:17.430> the

polished if you're sharpening the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.800 
polished if you're sharpening the
correct<00:02:17.879> angle<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.560> do<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.800> other<00:02:19.920> way<00:02:20.099> I

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.070 
correct angle and to do the other way I
just<00:02:21.810> reversed<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.620> exact<00:02:22.920> same<00:02:23.099> principle

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
just reversed the exact same principle

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.080 
just reversed the exact same principle
bringing<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> blade<00:02:25.379> towards<00:02:26.250> me<00:02:26.640> under

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
bringing the blade towards me under

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.720 
bringing the blade towards me under

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.979 

once<00:02:34.730> we've<00:02:34.879> done<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.209> side<00:02:35.450> with<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.750> course

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
once we've done one side with the course

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.430 
once we've done one side with the course
so<00:02:36.170> don't<00:02:37.030> give<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.150> sone<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.540> give<00:02:39.319> the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
so don't give the sone and give the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.500 
so don't give the sone and give the
stone<00:02:39.620> another<00:02:39.890> soak<00:02:40.250> wipe<00:02:40.519> off<00:02:40.730> any<00:02:40.910> any

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
stone another soak wipe off any any

stone another soak wipe off any any
paste<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:43.430> side<00:02:43.610> we'll<00:02:43.790> be<00:02:43.819> using<00:02:44.209> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
paste this side we'll be using the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.509 
paste this side we'll be using the
mustard<00:02:44.660> colored<00:02:44.959> stone<00:02:45.290> which<00:02:46.069> is<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> least

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
mustard colored stone which is the least

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.490 
mustard colored stone which is the least
course<00:02:46.849> this<00:02:47.660> will<00:02:47.780> give<00:02:47.930> us<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.110> much<00:02:48.290> finer

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
course this will give us a much finer

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.280 
course this will give us a much finer
edge<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.099> we<00:02:49.599> continue<00:02:50.599> to<00:02:50.720> sharpen<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.170> knife

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
edge so we continue to sharpen the knife

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.720 
edge so we continue to sharpen the knife
in<00:02:51.440> exactly<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.950> same<00:02:51.980> way<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:52.430> this<00:02:52.670> time

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
in exactly the same way but this time

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.540 
in exactly the same way but this time
the<00:02:53.060> sound<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.480> very<00:02:53.599> different<00:02:54.550> because

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
the sound is very different because

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.970 
the sound is very different because
we're<00:02:55.730> not<00:02:55.849> using<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.239> coarse<00:02:56.510> stone<00:02:56.780> it's<00:02:57.739> more

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
we're not using a coarse stone it's more

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.470 
we're not using a coarse stone it's more
of<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.099> polishing<00:02:58.550> action<00:02:58.880> than<00:02:59.060> an<00:02:59.180> abrasive

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
of a polishing action than an abrasive

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.900 
of a polishing action than an abrasive
action<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:03.049> gives<00:03:03.290> us<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.590> very<00:03:03.950> very<00:03:04.280> fine

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
action this gives us a very very fine

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
action this gives us a very very fine
edge<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.480> we<00:03:05.569> can<00:03:05.690> use<00:03:06.760> for<00:03:07.760> all<00:03:08.630> of<00:03:08.840> our

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
edge that we can use for all of our

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.610 
edge that we can use for all of our
bushcraft<00:03:09.380> tasks<00:03:11.380> problem<00:03:12.380> with<00:03:12.530> the

bushcraft tasks problem with the
Japanese<00:03:13.040> water<00:03:13.310> stone<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.810> is<00:03:14.840> quite<00:03:15.230> heavy

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
Japanese water stone it is quite heavy

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.670 
Japanese water stone it is quite heavy
so<00:03:16.060> unless<00:03:17.060> I'm<00:03:17.209> going<00:03:17.450> somewhere<00:03:17.840> where<00:03:18.560> I'll

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
so unless I'm going somewhere where I'll

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.190 
so unless I'm going somewhere where I'll
be<00:03:18.799> in<00:03:18.920> close<00:03:19.130> proximity<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.910> vehicle<00:03:20.200> I'll

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
be in close proximity to a vehicle I'll

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.220 
be in close proximity to a vehicle I'll
normally<00:03:21.500> take<00:03:21.829> another<00:03:22.099> option<00:03:22.459> with<00:03:22.579> me

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
normally take another option with me

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.910 
normally take another option with me
this<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> DMZ<00:03:24.910> diamond<00:03:25.910> home<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:27.829> is

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
this is a DMZ diamond home and this is

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.009 
this is a DMZ diamond home and this is
used<00:03:28.130> in<00:03:28.280> much<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.459> same<00:03:28.610> way<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:29.959> a

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
used in much the same way but it's a

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.630 
used in much the same way but it's a
much<00:03:30.170> lighter<00:03:30.440> option<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.310> by<00:03:31.459> maintaining

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
much lighter option so by maintaining

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.319 
much lighter option so by maintaining
the<00:03:32.120> same<00:03:32.329> angle<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.750> edge<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.940> just<00:03:38.150> gives

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
the same angle of edge this just gives

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.670 
the same angle of edge this just gives
us<00:03:38.420> an<00:03:38.540> opportunity<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:39.079> hone<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.440> edge<00:03:39.530> of

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
us an opportunity to hone the edge of

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.020 
us an opportunity to hone the edge of
our<00:03:39.799> blade<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.160> we<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.549> same<00:03:40.760> thing

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
our blade and we can do the same thing

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.599 
our blade and we can do the same thing
