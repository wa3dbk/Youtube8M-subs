hi guys Burt here I'm going to show you
how<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> RC<00:00:41.010> longer<00:00:41.370> works<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:42.390> very<00:00:42.510> cool

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
how the RC longer works very very cool

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.380 
how the RC longer works very very cool
device<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:44.010> see<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.520> aside<00:00:45.149> from

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
device as you can see here aside from

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
device as you can see here aside from
your<00:00:45.600> on/off<00:00:45.960> button<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> whole

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
your on/off button you have a whole

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.369 
your on/off button you have a whole
button<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.850> shows<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> last<00:00:48.600> position

button<00:00:51.930> I'm<00:00:52.170> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> show<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.559> how<00:00:52.800> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
button I'm going to show you how that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.979 
button I'm going to show you how that
works<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> cool<00:00:54.719> feature

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
works but basically the cool feature

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.160 
works but basically the cool feature
about<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> fact<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.989> can

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
about this is the fact that you can

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.319 
about this is the fact that you can
measure<00:00:58.379> your<00:00:58.680> pitch<00:00:58.949> regardless<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.940> where

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
measure your pitch regardless of where

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
measure your pitch regardless of where
the<00:01:00.480> helicopter<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.109> placed<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.949> don't

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the helicopter is placed and you don't

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.830 
the helicopter is placed and you don't
need<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> reference<00:01:02.640> point<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.449> take<00:01:03.629> your

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
need a reference point to take your

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.980 
need a reference point to take your
helicopter<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.920> find<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.430> relatively<00:01:06.000> level

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
helicopter you find a relatively level

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.429 
helicopter you find a relatively level
surface<00:01:07.549> and<00:01:08.659> although<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.780> whole<00:01:09.960> level<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
surface and although a whole level that

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.170 
surface and although a whole level that
is<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.189> critical<00:01:11.369> what<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
is is not that critical what you do is

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.929 
is is not that critical what you do is
you<00:01:12.299> find<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.869> level<00:01:13.380> surface<00:01:14.010> within<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you find a level surface within the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.120 
you find a level surface within the
helicopter<00:01:15.509> itself<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.740> helicopter

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
helicopter itself and on this helicopter

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.649 
helicopter itself and on this helicopter
as<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> motor<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.450> pretty

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
as you can see here the motor is pretty

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.320 
as you can see here the motor is pretty
leveled<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.830> RC<00:01:20.310> logger<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
leveled so you take your RC logger and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.440 
leveled so you take your RC logger and
turn<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.369> then<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.400> place<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
turn it on and then you place it on that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.630 
turn it on and then you place it on that
surface<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.560> using<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> motor<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.520> this

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
surface we're using the motor on this

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
surface we're using the motor on this
helicopter<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
helicopter and then what you do is you

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
helicopter and then what you do is you
calibrate<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.490> zero<00:01:29.759> point<00:01:30.060> by<00:01:30.299> pushing<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
calibrate the zero point by pushing the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
calibrate the zero point by pushing the
zero<00:01:31.350> button<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.369> should

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
zero button here and that should

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.260 
zero button here and that should
calibrate<00:01:33.540> zero<00:01:34.200> let's<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.180> there<00:01:36.180> we

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
calibrate zero let's see here there we

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.860 
calibrate zero let's see here there we
go<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.640> quite<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.299> zero<00:01:39.720> but

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.350 

there<00:01:44.870> we<00:01:44.990> go<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:45.980> now<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.400> is<00:01:46.670> calibrated

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
there we go so now that is calibrated

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.230 
there we go so now that is calibrated
and<00:01:47.980> remembers<00:01:48.980> where<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.430> zero<00:01:49.730> point<00:01:50.090> is

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
and remembers where that zero point is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.090 
and remembers where that zero point is
you<00:01:50.570> take<00:01:50.870> your<00:01:50.990> actual<00:01:51.470> gauge

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
you take your actual gauge

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.190 
you take your actual gauge
place<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:53.000> on<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.120> blade<00:01:53.420> make<00:01:53.900> sure<00:01:54.050> you

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
place it on the blade make sure you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.110 
place it on the blade make sure you
place<00:01:54.440> it<00:01:54.620> correctly<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.280> then<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:55.940> is

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
place it correctly and then this is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.860 
place it correctly and then this is
magnetic<00:01:56.690> so<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.900> just<00:01:57.290> snap<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.520> place

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
magnetic so you just snap it in place

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.680 
magnetic so you just snap it in place
now<00:01:59.870> you<00:01:59.930> can<00:02:00.260> get<00:02:00.410> your<00:02:00.440> reading<00:02:01.420> full-

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
now you can get your reading full-

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.920 
now you can get your reading full-
as<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:03.080> can<00:02:03.230> see<00:02:03.410> 14<00:02:03.890> degrees<00:02:04.330> full<00:02:05.330> positive

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
as you can see 14 degrees full positive

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.440 
as you can see 14 degrees full positive
as<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:06.170> can<00:02:06.440> see<00:02:06.590> 14<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.610> little<00:02:08.000> less<00:02:08.180> positive

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
as you can see 14 a little less positive

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.270 
as you can see 14 a little less positive
than<00:02:08.780> negative<00:02:08.899> on<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.470> helicopter<00:02:10.070> but

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
than negative on this helicopter but

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.140 
than negative on this helicopter but
it's<00:02:10.399> pretty<00:02:10.580> close<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:13.460> main<00:02:13.700> advantage

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
it's pretty close so the main advantage

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.940 
it's pretty close so the main advantage
here<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.630> don't<00:02:14.870> need<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.050> fly<00:02:15.440> bar<00:02:15.710> or

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
here is that you don't need a fly bar or

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.520 
here is that you don't need a fly bar or
reference<00:02:16.580> point<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.480> where<00:02:17.690> 0<00:02:18.020> degrees

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
reference point to know where 0 degrees

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.950 
reference point to know where 0 degrees
is<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.550> what's<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.030> cool<00:02:20.240> about<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.600> and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
is this is what's so cool about this and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.900 
is this is what's so cool about this and
of<00:02:21.320> course<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.830> will<00:02:21.920> work<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.310> fly<00:02:22.550> bar<00:02:22.790> and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
of course it will work on fly bar and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.610 
of course it will work on fly bar and
flowerless<00:02:23.330> helicopters<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:24.290> very
