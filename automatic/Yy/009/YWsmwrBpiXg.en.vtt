the skin first it harmlessly breaks

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.220 
the skin first it harmlessly breaks
things<00:00:22.679> and<00:00:23.009> secondly<00:00:23.759> it<00:00:24.060> dangerously<00:00:24.900> makes

parts of the skin sick and ultimately

parts of the skin sick and ultimately
these<00:00:28.319> two<00:00:28.560> types<00:00:28.739> of<00:00:28.949> sun<00:00:29.159> damage<00:00:29.189> are

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
these two types of sun damage are

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.229 
these two types of sun damage are
related<00:00:30.409> the<00:00:31.409> first<00:00:31.649> type<00:00:31.919> just<00:00:32.700> breaking<00:00:33.000> the

related the first type just breaking the

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.080 
related the first type just breaking the
skin<00:00:33.359> is<00:00:34.109> unattractive<00:00:34.789> but<00:00:35.789> it's<00:00:35.940> completely

the Sun makes your skin sick then it

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.470 
the Sun makes your skin sick then it
causes<00:01:04.650> cancer<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.820> does<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.120> by<00:01:06.180> making

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
causes cancer and it does this by making

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.390 
causes cancer and it does this by making
the<00:01:06.780> cells<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> upper<00:01:07.800> layer<00:01:07.980> of<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.280> skin
