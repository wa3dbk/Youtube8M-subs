get your water pre-filtered if you're in

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.910

coffee filter they're very inexpensive

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.690 
coffee filter they're very inexpensive
and<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.330> pre<00:02:42.230> filter<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.830> sediment<00:02:43.310> out<00:02:43.430> of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
and you pre filter the sediment out of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.310 
and you pre filter the sediment out of
the<00:02:43.790> water<00:02:44.030> by<00:02:44.209> using<00:02:44.510> your<00:02:44.600> coffee<00:02:44.840> filter

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320

lot<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:51.430> what<00:02:52.430> if<00:02:52.550> my<00:02:52.790> water<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.300> so

lot is what if my water is so

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.360 
lot is what if my water is so

burking<00:02:57.050> well<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:59.000> can<00:02:59.150> always<00:02:59.360> use<00:02:59.600> iodine

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
burking well you can always use iodine

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.699 
burking well you can always use iodine
tablets<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:01.959> pretreat<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:02.989> water<00:03:03.350> with<00:03:03.560> your

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
tablets and pretreat the water with your

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.160 
tablets and pretreat the water with your
iodine<00:03:04.010> tablets<00:03:04.300> then<00:03:05.300> once<00:03:05.810> it's<00:03:05.959> pre

treated<00:03:06.560> pour<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.459> into<00:03:07.580> your<00:03:07.850> dirty<00:03:08.510> water

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
treated pour it into your dirty water

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.350

so<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.630> don't<00:03:11.720> have<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.080> have<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.410> taste<00:03:12.680> of

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
so you don't have to have the taste of

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.740 
so you don't have to have the taste of
the<00:03:12.950> iodine<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.610> get<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.970> effect<00:03:14.090> like
