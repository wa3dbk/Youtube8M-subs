00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.180
 Welcome to suva you next 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.520
 part 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.100
 I showed you the video clover 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.240
 known with four in the ruler 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.349
 prevent overturning 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 that's pretty well received by and 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.910
 Now let's go one step further 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.380
 Now I'll show you how to get in 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.449
 emscher won or also 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.580
 a next round are what i am in 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:39.400
 my macbook is really much 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.460
 grip on left gets because of that 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.969
 chassis it is so the colors of the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.680
 complete specs that will be extra soft 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.440
 that's what they really do 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.230
 luck and much of me is me 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.210
 a little stupidly fanatic about it 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.870
 I always have soft, very handy 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.120
 tire 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:06.460
 here are the skips on it with 330 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:09.369
 that it's rather small I'll show you this 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 stimulating big and though we have 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.149
 now attack the thrashers 6 above 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.740
 if you can get them the way I think 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:23.979
 relatively hard and you should, however, one 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.950
 bit thrown in and one heard 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.440
 she should also like me once 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.440
 a little bit richer 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.640
 So we do it with my clean 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.899
 The power acts as a brake cleaner but 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.009
 if you do that too often, you're pulling 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.149
 the plasticizers made so much luck 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.490
 That's why I'm not showing you this now 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:56.710
 but I really just show you that 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.439
 I was doing it and doing it 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:05.860
 we that with these so-called high 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:08.560
 group comes from electronics target 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.360
 you can find on ebay and also on cs 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.049
 electronic com.de I think so too 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.790
 application is on it shows anyway 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.299
 a bottle will cost you the ten to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.280
 15 euros depending on where the buys also for 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.769
 I have a fair in dortmund for ten euros 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.680
 see and as jazzy 4 13 eur 14 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.500
 Europe grew then need with shipping 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.739
 with follow the ever-long get there 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.180
 that we do so at the bigger car of course 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.239
 correspondingly less at the treads 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.090
 just bigger 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:49.440
 pol comes as I do in my life 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.440
 in such a moped I find the times 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:58.840
 not me, I have such a small 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.690
 bottle worried that on top just 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.950
 and that makes it a lot easier 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 and if this one is open before and the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.530
 most have 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.870
 table when things mostly happen 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.950
 Nothing 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.360
 so much better so you wear it on us 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.690
 we turn again to my 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.920
 Chamber you have to be there 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.910
 Exactly I have my husband rapp here 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.550
 key made it better for it 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:33.240
 Turning so if the gabold also one 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.600
 little luck, to wear an stop here 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.460
 I do not want to do it all at once 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.460
 Ripen because you are there and have to be long or 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.540
 all over the tire because otherwise have 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:52.110
 I will be unevenly that that 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.700
 Everywhere is nice wet if one 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.170
 a little bit so he presses again 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.170
 bit comes in more in the swarm 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.690
 where i also help a lot according to the motto 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.150
 a lot of 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.400
 no not much helps a lot but 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.320
 adequate amount he would always have one 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.209
 Kind of a few tricks and 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.489
 try something out there what 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:15.000
 really the tire needs in the beginning 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.230
 he says that on formally and see here 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.640
 that's it already here it is now completely 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.700
 very little I do that when I'm with 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:29.010
 the mature fed I'm like now so 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:39.870
 Here with him we are here now 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:42.210
 that is just standing over night 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.250
 which acts a nicely makes the 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.960
 next morning again grabbed mountains 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:52.680
 one and drive industry transfer of 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.870
 Here it goes a bit more 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.970
 everything not so tragic really it 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.370
 anyway, if you did this exotic one 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.409
 that you are responsible for the warmth then 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.869
 they really build 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:09.379
 is really hard times I've grade 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:10.719
 have become and that should actually 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.919
 already been 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.229
 otherwise we do it on the route 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.539
 10 15 minutes remain the true ones 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.399
 that on the car takes so long here 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.869
 actually on a ball success too 

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:24.379
 load from that 's it's not like that 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:26.059
 fell dramatically and the citizen too 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.339
 ask one has ever so much time 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:30.379
 already done that would be 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.569
 between my two levers and run away 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:35.659
 have to change drive shaft 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.279
 a chassis that was close also went 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:42.199
 even time for the cigarette 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:43.789
 in between so and get yourself 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:48.409
 maybe a little more grip 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:53.360
 the road what to say about it at all 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:57.409
 this home must move so changes 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.989
 that there are in different 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.569
 executions there is this one 

00:05:59.989 --> 00:06:04.169
 yellow that is in the backhand 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:07.960
 it is then 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:12.340
 but it will be less 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.889
 everything leads apple racer i wanted to go with 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.490
 Analyze not extra for this other 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.950
 to buy 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.450
 that's why I take that now it gives it 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.100
 also for asphalt but I think so 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.200
 Giant difference will not be there 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.090
 or it does not matter now 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:32.169
 if only now a competitive driver 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.190
 that's what people usually hear that people do 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.150
 it's not necessarily about one 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:38.650
 tenths of seconds 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:43.919
 they were the ones that exist now too 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:47.380
 even from family tires helped a good one 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.950
 mature adhesive and other of you 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.810
 company 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.550
 that has worked out best for us 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:56.500
 exposed because we needed a lot 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:07:00.550
 on the small short course yes that all 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:03.970
 short little update from me little 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:06.850
 announcing a week coming video will 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:10.470
 I was a packet to a large the 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.470
 hegau much fun
