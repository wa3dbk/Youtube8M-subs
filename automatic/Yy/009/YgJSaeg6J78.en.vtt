we're going to start out by making a

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.499 
we're going to start out by making a
small<00:00:29.119> furrow<00:00:30.520> on<00:00:31.520> top<00:00:31.850> the<00:00:32.059> row

oh<00:00:40.390> how<00:00:41.390> y'all<00:00:41.600> doing<00:00:41.960> by<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.140> way

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.440 

okra<00:00:50.059> is<00:00:50.149> not<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.390> big<00:00:50.720> seed<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:52.550> I'm<00:00:53.120> not<00:00:53.270> going

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
okra is not a big seed so I'm not going

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.490 
okra is not a big seed so I'm not going
to<00:00:53.510> plant<00:00:53.750> them<00:00:53.840> very<00:00:54.110> deep<00:00:56.290> I'm<00:00:57.290> going<00:00:57.440> to

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
to plant them very deep I'm going to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.700 
to plant them very deep I'm going to
push<00:00:57.649> them<00:00:57.829> down<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:59.780> about<00:00:59.809> even<00:01:00.500> with<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
push them down to about even with the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.190 
push them down to about even with the
first<00:01:00.950> knuckle<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.460> I'm<00:01:05.449> putting<00:01:05.780> them<00:01:05.840> about

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200

a<00:01:06.229> foot<00:01:06.710> apart<00:01:07.539> I'm<00:01:08.539> going<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:08.959> thin<00:01:09.229> these

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
a foot apart I'm going to thin these

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:15.669 
a foot apart I'm going to thin these
once<00:01:10.369> they<00:01:10.579> come<00:01:10.850> up<00:01:11.679> -<00:01:12.679> I<00:01:13.899> like<00:01:14.899> them<00:01:15.020> wide<00:01:15.259> I

once they come up - I like them wide I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.980 
once they come up - I like them wide I
like<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> lot<00:01:16.219> of<00:01:16.249> space<00:01:16.639> between<00:01:16.909> them<00:01:17.299> I'm

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
like a lot of space between them I'm

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.569 
like a lot of space between them I'm
gonna<00:01:18.139> probably<00:01:18.380> thin<00:01:18.679> them<00:01:18.829> out<00:01:18.889> to<00:01:19.130> about<00:01:19.279> 3

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
gonna probably thin them out to about 3
