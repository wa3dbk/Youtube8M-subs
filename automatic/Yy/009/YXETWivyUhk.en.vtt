I'm<00:00:06.450> standing<00:00:06.810> now<00:00:06.960> next<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.440> pine<00:00:07.919> tree

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
I'm standing now next to a pine tree

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.780 
I'm standing now next to a pine tree
whose<00:00:08.970> common<00:00:09.540> name<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:10.080> loblolly<00:00:10.980> pine<00:00:11.429> and

the scientific name is pine estiga the
way<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.960> identify<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.710> tree<00:00:17.039> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
way that you can identify this tree is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.290 
way that you can identify this tree is
first<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.690> by<00:00:18.869> looking<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.800> needles

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
first of all by looking at the needles

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.840 
first of all by looking at the needles
pine<00:00:21.300> tree's<00:00:21.779> leaves<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:23.130> called<00:00:23.369> needles

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
pine tree's leaves are called needles

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.450 
pine tree's leaves are called needles
and<00:00:24.119> they<00:00:24.660> will<00:00:24.810> come<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.170> fascicles<00:00:25.980> which

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and they will come in fascicles which

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.120 
and they will come in fascicles which
means<00:00:26.730> bunches<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:28.859> loblolly<00:00:29.099> pine<00:00:29.670> tree

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
means bunches and the loblolly pine tree

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.130 
means bunches and the loblolly pine tree
99%<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> time<00:00:32.520> will<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.329> needles<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
99% of the time will have needles that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.500 
99% of the time will have needles that
come<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.469> fascicles<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.130> three<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> they're

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
come in fascicles of three and they're

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.540 
come in fascicles of three and they're
gonna<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.780> about<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> length<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.160> average

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
gonna be about the length of the average

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.150 
gonna be about the length of the average
hand<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.510> that's<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:39.930> perhaps<00:00:40.320> five<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.950> six

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
hand so that's about perhaps five to six

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.750 
hand so that's about perhaps five to six
inches<00:00:41.690> loblolly<00:00:42.950> also<00:00:43.950> looking<00:00:44.399> around<00:00:44.520> on

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
inches loblolly also looking around on

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.700 
inches loblolly also looking around on
the<00:00:44.789> ground<00:00:45.059> here's<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.660> pinecone<00:00:46.230> over<00:00:46.500> here

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the ground here's a pinecone over here

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.750 
the ground here's a pinecone over here
I'm<00:00:46.800> gonna<00:00:46.890> walk<00:00:47.100> away<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.489> second<00:00:49.670> for<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
I'm gonna walk away for a second for the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.689 
I'm gonna walk away for a second for the
most<00:00:51.000> part<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> average<00:00:51.899> size<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:53.070> loblolly

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
most part the average size of a loblolly

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.760 
most part the average size of a loblolly
pine<00:00:54.120> cone<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.050> about<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.530> size

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
pine cone is going to be about the size

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.330 
pine cone is going to be about the size
of<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.399> baseball<00:00:57.500> this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> little

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
of a baseball this is actually a little

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.240 
of a baseball this is actually a little
bit<00:00:59.550> small<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.600> attribute<00:01:00.870> its<00:01:01.350> size<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
bit small and I attribute its size to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
bit small and I attribute its size to
the<00:01:02.340> fact<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.699> these<00:01:03.300> loblolly<00:01:03.719> pines<00:01:04.140> are

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the fact that these loblolly pines are

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
the fact that these loblolly pines are
growing<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:05.070> drier<00:01:05.580> climate<00:01:06.360> than

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
growing in a much drier climate than

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.380 
growing in a much drier climate than
would<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:06.930> their<00:01:07.380> native<00:01:07.950> native<00:01:08.820> home<00:01:09.030> range

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
would be their native native home range

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.350 
would be their native native home range
which<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.930> would<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.229> further<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.010> east

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
which be it would be further to the east

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
which be it would be further to the east
and<00:01:12.360> would<00:01:12.630> also<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.100> least

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and would also be have you know at least

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
and would also be have you know at least
10<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.760> 15<00:01:14.939> additional<00:01:15.780> inches<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.439> rain<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
10 to 15 additional inches of rain a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.230 
10 to 15 additional inches of rain a
year<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> considerable<00:01:18.650> but<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
year which is considerable but this is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.300 
year which is considerable but this is
also<00:01:21.420> probably<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.200> single<00:01:22.650> most<00:01:22.799> important

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
also probably the single most important

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.960 
also probably the single most important
commercial<00:01:23.880> species<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.750> pine<00:01:24.960> tree<00:01:25.460> in<00:01:26.460> in

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
commercial species of pine tree in in

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120 
commercial species of pine tree in in
East<00:01:27.299> Texas<00:01:27.540> which<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.290> which<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.009> an

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
East Texas which is which is that's an

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.950 
East Texas which is which is that's an
important<00:01:29.490> part<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> local<00:01:30.270> economy<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
important part of the local economy and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.740 
important part of the local economy and
I<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.439> probably<00:01:32.220> even<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.479> North

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I think probably even in in North

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.620 
I think probably even in in North
America<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> lot<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.479> lot

America now this is a lot of your a lot

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.530 
America now this is a lot of your a lot
of<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:36.900> paper<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:37.920> comes<00:01:38.759> comes

pine trees are conic in their form

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
pine trees are conic in their form
meaning<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.740> tree<00:01:47.040> puts<00:01:47.340> more<00:01:47.579> energy

does<00:01:51.000> say<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> rounded<00:01:52.770> crown<00:01:53.130> like

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
does say a like a rounded crown like

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.149 
does say a like a rounded crown like
like<00:01:54.390> an<00:01:54.509> oak<00:01:54.750> tree<00:01:54.780> wood<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> maple<00:01:56.130> tree

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
like an oak tree wood or a maple tree

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.789 
like an oak tree wood or a maple tree
that<00:01:56.610> has<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> very<00:01:56.969> rounded<00:01:57.540> crown<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.530> these

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that has a very rounded crown so these

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.130 
that has a very rounded crown so these
trees<00:01:59.070> tend<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.729> taller<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.659> straighter

canopy<00:02:03.570> though<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:04.710> how<00:02:04.979> there's<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
canopy though you can see how there's a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.119 
canopy though you can see how there's a
lot<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> branches<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.860> what<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
lot of branches up there and what that

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.830 
lot of branches up there and what that
tells<00:02:08.340> me<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.789> looking<00:02:08.970> at<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.629> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
tells me when I'm looking at it is that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.229 
tells me when I'm looking at it is that
when<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.140> tree<00:02:10.379> was<00:02:10.530> younger<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.879> didn't

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
when this tree was younger it didn't

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.530 
when this tree was younger it didn't
have<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> lot<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> comput

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
have a lot of comput

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.539 
have a lot of comput
hisham<00:02:13.900> which<00:02:14.590> must<00:02:14.920> admit<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.519> was

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
hisham which must admit that it was

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.190 
hisham which must admit that it was
growing<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.209> in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> middle<00:02:16.719> of<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.870> pasture

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
growing like in the middle of a pasture

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.069 
growing like in the middle of a pasture
someplace<00:02:18.189> because<00:02:19.150> there<00:02:19.359> wasn't<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.810> lot<00:02:19.959> of

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
someplace because there wasn't a lot of

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.890 
someplace because there wasn't a lot of
pressure<00:02:20.469> on<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.129> grow<00:02:21.629> straight<00:02:22.629> and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
pressure on it to grow straight and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.170 
pressure on it to grow straight and
narrow<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.650> was<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:24.129> was<00:02:24.310> able<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.969> grow

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
narrow it was it was able to grow

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.599 
narrow it was it was able to grow
outwards<00:02:25.900> which<00:02:26.709> tells<00:02:27.010> me<00:02:27.069> there<00:02:27.280> wasn't<00:02:27.459> a

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
outwards which tells me there wasn't a

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.789 
outwards which tells me there wasn't a
lot<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.879> light<00:02:28.180> competition<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:29.439> you<00:02:29.620> look

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
lot of light competition if you look

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.280 
lot of light competition if you look
around<00:02:30.069> at<00:02:30.159> some<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.430> other<00:02:30.579> trees<00:02:31.290> you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
around at some of the other trees you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.339 
around at some of the other trees you
you<00:02:32.560> won't<00:02:32.799> see<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:33.609> many<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.870> many<00:02:35.049> branches

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
you won't see so many so many branches

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.339 
you won't see so many so many branches
or<00:02:35.739> appendages<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.319> chances<00:02:38.319> are

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
or appendages like this and chances are

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.860 
or appendages like this and chances are
good<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.590> this<00:02:38.950> is<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.939> of<00:02:39.970> many<00:02:40.389> that<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.689> see

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
good that this is one of many that I see

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.319 
good that this is one of many that I see
around<00:02:41.139> us<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.560> mean<00:02:41.739> that<00:02:42.489> mean<00:02:42.700> that

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
around us that I mean that mean that

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.479 
around us that I mean that mean that
probably<00:02:43.659> were<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.409> parent<00:02:44.829> trees<00:02:45.129> that

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
probably were the parent trees that

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.699 
probably were the parent trees that
seeded<00:02:46.000> in<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.659> smaller<00:02:46.989> trees<00:02:47.349> that<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.680> see

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
seeded in the smaller trees that you see

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.340 
seeded in the smaller trees that you see
around<00:02:47.950> us
