so<00:00:58.350> by<00:00:58.680> getting<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.400> links<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.720> need<00:01:00.900> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
so by getting this links you need to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660 
so by getting this links you need to
make<00:01:01.590> sure<00:01:01.740> that<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.040> straps<00:01:02.280> will

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

accommodate<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.690> lower<00:01:03.930> distance<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
accommodate this lower distance so you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
accommodate this lower distance so you
can<00:01:05.070> lengthen<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.610> straps<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
can lengthen the straps out so that you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990

to<00:01:39.959> measure<00:01:40.139> yourself<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.219> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.459> get<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
to measure yourself so if you can get a

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.539 
to measure yourself so if you can get a
friend<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.179> again<00:01:42.539> go<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:43.139> a<00:01:43.549> professional

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
friend or again go have a professional

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.959 
friend or again go have a professional
bra<00:01:44.700> fitting<00:01:44.729> done<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.139> be<00:01:46.259> ideal<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
bra fitting done this would be ideal so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.849 
bra fitting done this would be ideal so
we<00:01:47.969> go<00:01:48.179> right<00:01:48.509> underneath<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.020> breast<00:01:49.170> tissue

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
we go right underneath the breast tissue

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.099 
we go right underneath the breast tissue
and<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.850> her<00:01:50.999> case<00:01:51.029> she's<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.539> odd<00:01:51.719> number

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
and in her case she's an odd number

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.319 
and in her case she's an odd number
she's<00:01:52.319> 29<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> half<00:01:53.039> so<00:01:53.789> we're<00:01:53.969> gonna<00:01:54.060> run

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
she's 29 and a half so we're gonna run

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
she's 29 and a half so we're gonna run
that<00:01:54.509> up<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.869> 30<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.499> that's<00:01:56.069> gonna<00:01:56.279> tell<00:01:56.549> us

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
that up to 30 and that's gonna tell us

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.389 
that up to 30 and that's gonna tell us
what<00:01:56.969> size<00:01:57.329> bra<00:01:57.719> band<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.259> start<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
what size bra band to start with the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.010 
what size bra band to start with the
second<00:01:59.819> measurement<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.810> around

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
second measurement is going to be around

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.899 
second measurement is going to be around
the<00:02:01.170> fullest<00:02:01.619> part<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.279> the<00:02:02.999> bust<00:02:04.639> and<00:02:05.639> in<00:02:05.789> her

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the fullest part of the bust and in her

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.410 
the fullest part of the bust and in her
case<00:02:05.939> that's<00:02:06.509> 36<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> we<00:02:08.429> subtract<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.090> bust

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
case that's 36 so we subtract that bust

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
case that's 36 so we subtract that bust
measurement<00:02:09.959> from<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> band<00:02:10.649> measurement

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
measurement from the band measurement

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.910 
measurement from the band measurement
and<00:02:11.400> get<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> difference<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.420> six<00:02:12.750> each<00:02:13.560> cup

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and get a difference of six each cup

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.160 
and get a difference of six each cup
size<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.459> approximately<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.480> two<00:02:15.510> inches

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
size is approximately one to two inches

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.230 
size is approximately one to two inches
so<00:02:16.410> in<00:02:16.950> her<00:02:17.070> case<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.460> probably<00:02:17.610> start<00:02:18.060> with<00:02:18.180> a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
so in her case we probably start with a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.150 
so in her case we probably start with a
bra<00:02:18.450> band<00:02:18.690> size<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.200> 30<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
bra band size of 30 and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.700 
bra band size of 30 and
cup<00:02:20.280> size<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.760> D<00:02:20.970> all<00:02:21.450> things<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:22.020> be<00:02:22.140> adjusted

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
cup size of D all things can be adjusted

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.100 
cup size of D all things can be adjusted

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
larger size if you have a variance and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
larger size if you have a variance and

about<00:04:48.860> some<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.220> the<00:04:49.280> positives<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:49.940> some<00:04:50.210> of

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
about some of the positives and some of

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.700 
about some of the positives and some of
the<00:04:50.540> things<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.870> see<00:04:51.080> differently<00:04:51.590> and

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
the things that I see differently and

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.409 
the things that I see differently and
how<00:04:51.830> this<00:04:52.040> bra<00:04:52.220> fits<00:04:52.520> okay<00:04:52.970> first<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.360> all

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
how this bra fits okay first of all

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
breasts and that's causing a little

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.600 
breasts and that's causing a little
shift<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:05.780> how<00:05:05.870> your<00:05:06.020> chest<00:05:06.620> carries<00:05:07.250> the

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
look at it one more thing I want to tell

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.040 
look at it one more thing I want to tell
you<00:05:15.500> about<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.850> bra<00:05:17.060> itself<00:05:17.480> is<00:05:17.630> now<00:05:17.780> fitted

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
you about the bra itself is now fitted

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.900 
you about the bra itself is now fitted
perfectly<00:05:18.410> on<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:18.980> very<00:05:19.160> last<00:05:19.370> set<00:05:19.640> of<00:05:19.760> hooks

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
perfectly on the very last set of hooks

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.550 
perfectly on the very last set of hooks
and<00:05:20.300> that's<00:05:20.419> really<00:05:20.630> important<00:05:21.169> because<00:05:21.260> as<00:05:21.530> a

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
and that's really important because as a

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.100 
and that's really important because as a
bra<00:05:21.830> ages<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.700> material<00:05:23.180> in<00:05:23.330> it<00:05:23.479> starts<00:05:23.870> to

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
bra ages the material in it starts to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.080 
bra ages the material in it starts to
expand<00:05:24.919> and<00:05:25.160> so<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.580> have<00:05:25.729> to<00:05:25.820> have<00:05:25.910> someplace

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
expand and so you have to have someplace

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.800 
expand and so you have to have someplace
to<00:05:26.270> go

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
to go

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.719 
to go
to<00:05:26.930> take<00:05:27.080> up<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.380> slack<00:05:27.530> so<00:05:28.010> you<00:05:28.220> want<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:28.550> use

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
to take up the slack so you want to use

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.610 
to take up the slack so you want to use
the<00:05:29.060> additional<00:05:29.540> sets<00:05:29.780> of<00:05:29.900> hooks<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.440> take

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
the additional sets of hooks to take

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.800 
the additional sets of hooks to take
that<00:05:30.830> up<00:05:30.979> this<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.280> bra<00:05:31.430> gets<00:05:31.669> older<00:05:32.030> most

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
that up this the bra gets older most

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.840 
that up this the bra gets older most
women<00:05:33.169> if<00:05:33.440> they<00:05:33.590> wear<00:05:33.800> their<00:05:33.950> bras<00:05:34.160> often

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
women if they wear their bras often

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.210 
women if they wear their bras often
which<00:05:35.180> I<00:05:35.360> say<00:05:35.600> two<00:05:35.900> to<00:05:35.990> five<00:05:36.169> times<00:05:36.200> a<00:05:36.590> week<00:05:36.620> are

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
which I say two to five times a week are

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.350 
which I say two to five times a week are
probably<00:05:37.520> going<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.700> need<00:05:37.850> to<00:05:37.910> switch<00:05:38.150> their

probably going to need to switch their
bras<00:05:38.510> out<00:05:38.660> every<00:05:38.930> six<00:05:39.110> months<00:05:39.470> if<00:05:39.680> you're
