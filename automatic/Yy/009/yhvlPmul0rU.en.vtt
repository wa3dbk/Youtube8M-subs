00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
of a change from them so cool I guess

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.450

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
really set it off for me was when they

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.730 
really set it off for me was when they
all<00:02:42.180> took<00:02:42.450> out<00:02:42.630> their<00:02:42.810> candy<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.320> dresses

which<00:02:43.980> was<00:02:44.220> their<00:02:44.430> challenge<00:02:44.880> because<00:02:45.360> that's

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
which was their challenge because that's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.150

what<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.690> felt<00:02:45.959> like<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.290> performance<00:02:46.770> came

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
what I felt like the performance came

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.250 
what I felt like the performance came
alive<00:02:47.490> now<00:02:48.270> don't<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.660> me<00:02:48.810> wrong<00:02:48.840> I'm<00:02:49.230> not

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
alive now don't get me wrong I'm not

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.960 
alive now don't get me wrong I'm not
saying<00:02:49.590> like<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.950> performance<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.430> bad<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
saying like the performance was bad and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.540 
saying like the performance was bad and
then<00:02:51.150> became<00:02:51.510> good<00:02:51.900> near<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.350> end<00:02:52.500> no<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.100> think

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
then became good near the end no I think

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.860 
then became good near the end no I think
that<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.970> beginning<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.330> their<00:02:54.480> performance

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
that the beginning of their performance

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.330 
that the beginning of their performance
was<00:02:54.930> more<00:02:55.320> about<00:02:55.410> showing<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.220> know

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.480 
not make sense until now and I gotta
plot<00:06:22.450> them<00:06:22.720> on<00:06:22.840> this<00:06:23.050> because<00:06:23.770> if<00:06:24.130> they<00:06:24.400> were

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
plot them on this because if they were

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.610 
plot them on this because if they were
just<00:06:24.640> trying<00:06:24.940> to<00:06:25.000> save<00:06:25.300> this<00:06:25.480> card<00:06:25.810> for<00:06:26.440> now

ha<00:07:12.900> just<00:07:13.290> here<00:07:14.270> but<00:07:15.270> um<00:07:15.480> you<00:07:16.140> can't<00:07:16.500> forget

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:16.890 
ha just here but um you can't forget

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.370 
ha just here but um you can't forget
about<00:07:16.950> the<00:07:17.610> audience<00:07:17.940> because<00:07:18.630> i<00:07:18.870> think<00:07:19.110> it's

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
about the audience because i think it's

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.900 
about the audience because i think it's
great<00:07:19.500> to<00:07:19.800> want<00:07:20.010> to<00:07:20.100> impress<00:07:20.430> the<00:07:20.700> judges

great to want to impress the judges

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.240 
great to want to impress the judges
because<00:07:21.390> it<00:07:21.660> means<00:07:22.020> that<00:07:22.140> your<00:07:22.350> crew<00:07:22.590> is<00:07:22.950> doing

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
because it means that your crew is doing

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.860 
because it means that your crew is doing
different<00:07:23.730> things<00:07:23.790> it<00:07:24.240> means<00:07:24.360> that<00:07:24.570> accrue

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
different things it means that accrue

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.410 
different things it means that accrue
it's<00:07:25.290> growing<00:07:25.740> but<00:07:26.400> what<00:07:26.580> good<00:07:26.730> is<00:07:26.790> that<00:07:26.910> if

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
it's growing but what good is that if

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.000 
it's growing but what good is that if
the<00:07:27.600> justice<00:07:27.900> doesn't<00:07:28.080> you<00:07:28.500> know<00:07:28.590> if<00:07:28.860> the

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
the justice doesn't you know if the

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.470 
the justice doesn't you know if the
audience<00:07:29.310> doesn't<00:07:29.460> see<00:07:29.910> it<00:07:30.030> what<00:07:30.180> good<00:07:30.360> is

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:30.480 
audience doesn't see it what good is

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.240 
audience doesn't see it what good is
that<00:07:30.510> so<00:07:31.230> the<00:07:31.530> other<00:07:31.620> ones<00:07:31.680> are<00:07:31.890> going<00:07:32.040> to<00:07:32.130> keep

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
that so the other ones are going to keep

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.040 
that so the other ones are going to keep
you<00:07:32.430> basically<00:07:32.730> on<00:07:32.970> the<00:07:33.030> show<00:07:33.480> and<00:07:33.630> both<00:07:33.810> for

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
you basically on the show and both for

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.140 
you basically on the show and both for
you<00:07:34.170> so<00:07:34.560> I<00:07:34.590> think<00:07:34.800> that<00:07:35.040> it's<00:07:35.610> a<00:07:35.730> double-edged

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
you so I think that it's a double-edged

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.480 
you so I think that it's a double-edged
sword<00:07:36.180> set<00:07:36.750> 50-50<00:07:37.560> thing<00:07:37.590> you<00:07:37.980> have<00:07:38.130> to<00:07:38.160> cater

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490 
sword set 50-50 thing you have to cater
