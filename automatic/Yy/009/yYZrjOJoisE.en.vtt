00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

80s<00:00:39.340> were<00:00:39.489> kind<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.850> a<00:00:40.030> bit<00:00:40.539> of<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.690> transitional

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
80s were kind of a bit of a transitional

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.319 
80s were kind of a bit of a transitional
period<00:00:41.789> synthesizers<00:00:42.789> were<00:00:42.820> coming<00:00:43.210> into

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
period synthesizers were coming into

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:44.970 
period synthesizers were coming into
their<00:00:43.539> own<00:00:43.690> drum<00:00:44.109> machines<00:00:44.440> were<00:00:44.590> coming<00:00:44.890> into

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
their own drum machines were coming into

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.790 
their own drum machines were coming into
their<00:00:45.190> own<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:46.120> it<00:00:46.269> seemed<00:00:46.510> like

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
their own and it seemed like

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.680 
their own and it seemed like
experimentation<00:00:47.800> was<00:00:48.039> was<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:52.120> going<00:00:52.510> on<00:00:52.660> a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
experimentation was was was going on a

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.380 
experimentation was was was going on a
little<00:00:52.960> more<00:00:53.109> now<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:53.710> wasn't<00:00:54.160> recording<00:00:54.390> prior

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
little more now I wasn't recording prior

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.810 
little more now I wasn't recording prior
to<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.690> mid<00:00:55.899> 80s<00:00:55.929> or<00:00:56.379> so<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:56.829> I<00:00:56.859> can't<00:00:57.489> speak<00:00:57.670> to

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
to the mid 80s or so so I can't speak to

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.459 
to the mid 80s or so so I can't speak to
that<00:00:57.940> time<00:00:58.329> period<00:00:58.600> I'm<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:58.960> saying<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.379> from

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
that time period I'm just saying it from

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.130 
that time period I'm just saying it from
my<00:00:59.649> perspective<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.460> course<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:02.019> know

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
my perspective and of course you know

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.160 
my perspective and of course you know
I'm<00:01:02.499> prejudiced<00:01:03.039> because<00:01:03.399> I<00:01:04.059> started<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.019> the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
I'm prejudiced because I started in the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.940 
I'm prejudiced because I started in the
80s<00:01:05.500> so<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:07.240> me<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.390> was<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.900> great<00:01:08.320> time<00:01:08.590> just

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
80s so to me that was a great time just

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.010 
80s so to me that was a great time just
like<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.240> 2013's<00:01:10.240> it's<00:01:10.450> going<00:01:10.600> to<00:01:10.659> be<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.780> great

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
like the 2013's it's going to be a great

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.539 
like the 2013's it's going to be a great
time<00:01:11.320> and<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.520> grand<00:01:12.909> tradition<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:14.549> sound

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
time and in that grand tradition I sound

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.340 
time and in that grand tradition I sound
kind<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.939> evolved<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.570> 80s<00:01:16.900> for<00:01:17.049> snare

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
kind of evolved in the 80s for snare

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.030 
kind of evolved in the 80s for snare
drums<00:01:17.680> where<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.869> wanted<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.259> particular<00:01:20.409> sound

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
drums where we wanted a particular sound

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.020 
drums where we wanted a particular sound
something<00:01:21.939> in<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.119> air<00:01:22.329> Phil<00:01:23.320> Collins<00:01:24.030> kind

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
something in the air Phil Collins kind

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.249 
something in the air Phil Collins kind
of<00:01:25.090> changed<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.540> way<00:01:25.689> we<00:01:25.720> thought<00:01:26.110> about

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
of changed the way we thought about

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.740 
of changed the way we thought about
snares<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.159> parameters<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.270> and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
snares and the parameters of that and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.410 
snares and the parameters of that and
then<00:01:29.310> drum<00:01:30.310> machines<00:01:30.610> came<00:01:30.880> along<00:01:31.149> they<00:01:31.360> were

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
then drum machines came along they were

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.959 
then drum machines came along they were
a<00:01:31.509> little<00:01:34.320> sterile<00:01:35.320> so<00:01:35.979> guys<00:01:36.219> started<00:01:36.670> trying

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
a little sterile so guys started trying

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.370 
a little sterile so guys started trying
to<00:01:37.090> do<00:01:37.329> certain<00:01:37.659> things<00:01:37.689> now<00:01:38.110> I'm<00:01:38.200> going<00:01:38.320> to

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
to do certain things now I'm going to

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:47.580 
to do certain things now I'm going to
show<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:39.070> classic<00:01:39.399> technique<00:01:40.090> for<00:01:40.840> snare

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.410 

okay<00:01:48.590> here's<00:01:48.860> my<00:01:48.920> here's<00:01:49.310> my<00:01:49.460> life<00:01:49.700> stare<00:01:50.120> a

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
okay here's my here's my life stare a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.920 
okay here's my here's my life stare a
little<00:01:50.510> bit<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.500> gait<00:01:51.680> on<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:53.540> then<00:01:53.660> here's

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
little bit of gait on it and then here's

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.530 
little bit of gait on it and then here's
the<00:01:53.990> bottom<00:01:54.380> man<00:01:54.590> part<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.010> that<00:01:55.160> snare<00:01:58.540> they

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
the bottom man part of that snare they

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.260 
the bottom man part of that snare they
used<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.810> like<00:01:59.990> lots<00:02:00.620> of<00:02:00.920> bottom<00:02:01.370> end<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
used to like lots of bottom end in the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.080 
used to like lots of bottom end in the
eighties<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:06.190> what<00:02:07.190> we<00:02:07.310> did<00:02:07.490> was<00:02:07.730> we<00:02:07.940> would

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
eighties so what we did was we would

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.940 
eighties so what we did was we would
take<00:02:08.680> a<00:02:10.060> signal<00:02:11.060> generator<00:02:11.440> here's<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.500> signal

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
take a signal generator here's a signal

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.520 
take a signal generator here's a signal
generator<00:02:13.100> just<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.760> stock<00:02:14.060> one<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.690> we'd<00:02:15.230> sit

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
generator just a stock one and we'd sit

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.510 
generator just a stock one and we'd sit
it<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.660> certain<00:02:18.170> frequency<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:19.010> certain

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
it on on a certain frequency a certain

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.600 
it on on a certain frequency a certain
level<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.840> actually<00:02:20.990> pink<00:02:21.410> noise<00:02:21.620> so

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
level but this is actually pink noise so

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.660 
level but this is actually pink noise so
like<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.360> says<00:02:23.540> here<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:23.960> so<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.190> what<00:02:25.520> you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
like it says here so so this is what you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.940 
like it says here so so this is what you
would<00:02:25.790> hear<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.570> took<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:27.170> gate<00:02:27.380> off<00:02:32.950> now

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
would hear if I took the gate off now

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.790 
would hear if I took the gate off now
what<00:02:34.070> I've<00:02:34.250> done<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.490> I've<00:02:34.790> gated<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.800> pink

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
what I've done is I've gated that pink

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.840 
what I've done is I've gated that pink
noise<00:02:37.120> with<00:02:38.170> let's<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.290> bus<00:02:39.500> 47<00:02:40.070> with<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
noise with let's the bus 47 with the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.790 
noise with let's the bus 47 with the
snares<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:41.840> every<00:02:42.020> time<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.230> snare<00:02:42.470> hit<00:02:42.620> I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
snares and so every time to snare hit I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:58.120 
snares and so every time to snare hit I
get<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.010> little<00:02:43.190> bit<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.370> pink<00:02:43.550> noise<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:57.130> then

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
get a little bit of pink noise and then

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.250 
get a little bit of pink noise and then
we<00:02:58.459> would<00:02:58.610> add<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> little<00:02:58.970> bit<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.209> reverb<00:02:59.360> I'm

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
we would add a little bit of reverb I'm

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.290 
we would add a little bit of reverb I'm
using<00:03:00.620> dream<00:03:01.430> verb<00:03:01.670> just<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.000> get<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> little

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
using dream verb just to get a little

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.110 
using dream verb just to get a little
I'm<00:03:03.200> not<00:03:03.380> quite<00:03:03.650> sure<00:03:03.680> why<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.340> Dalek<00:03:04.880> seeing

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
I'm not quite sure why is Dalek seeing

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.720 
I'm not quite sure why is Dalek seeing
something<00:03:05.300> purple<00:03:05.750> today<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.220> added<00:03:07.580> that

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
something purple today so I added that

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.430 
something purple today so I added that
reverb<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.600> snare<00:03:08.959> sound

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
reverb to the snare sound

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.770 
reverb to the snare sound
excuse<00:03:10.310> me<00:03:10.430> added<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.940> just<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> pink

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
excuse me added it just to the pink

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:28.960 
excuse me added it just to the pink
noise<00:03:27.220> why<00:03:28.220> did<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.430> spend<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:28.790> much<00:03:28.910> time

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
noise why did I spend so much time

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.820 
noise why did I spend so much time
showing<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.630> because<00:03:29.870> another<00:03:30.290> classic

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
showing you this because another classic

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.500 
showing you this because another classic
technique<00:03:31.220> back<00:03:31.430> then<00:03:31.640> was<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:31.970> do<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.209> same

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
technique back then was to do the same

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.270 
technique back then was to do the same
exact<00:03:32.930> thing<00:03:33.170> with<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.380> snare<00:03:33.709> drum<00:03:33.739> but

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
exact thing with a snare drum but

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.100 
exact thing with a snare drum but
instead<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.580> adding<00:03:34.880> pink<00:03:35.269> noise<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.959> would

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
instead of adding pink noise you would

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.460 
instead of adding pink noise you would
turn<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.380> a<00:03:36.560> frequency<00:03:37.220> with<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.470> signal

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
turn to a frequency with the signal

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.440 
turn to a frequency with the signal
generator<00:03:39.860> that<00:03:40.040> was<00:03:40.250> in<00:03:40.640> tune<00:03:41.150> with<00:03:41.300> your

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
generator that was in tune with your

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.780 
generator that was in tune with your
song<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.130> there's<00:03:43.130> charts<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.640> will

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
song and there's charts that will

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.380 
song and there's charts that will
convert<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.870> key<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.739> frequency<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:47.209> then

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
convert a key to frequency and so then

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.620 
convert a key to frequency and so then
you'd<00:03:47.840> like<00:03:48.019> ice<00:03:48.709> like<00:03:49.130> 40<00:03:49.580> 50<00:03:49.760> cycles<00:03:50.450> in

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
you'd like ice like 40 50 cycles in

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.600 
you'd like ice like 40 50 cycles in
there<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.440> then<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.830> then<00:03:51.950> we'd<00:03:52.130> add<00:03:52.340> that

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
there and then and then we'd add that

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.550 
there and then and then we'd add that
kind<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:52.880> 808<00:03:53.300> sounding<00:03:53.690> low<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.050> back<00:03:54.350> into

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
kind of 808 sounding low in back into

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.050 
kind of 808 sounding low in back into
the<00:03:54.739> kick

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
the kick

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.479 
the kick
and<00:03:55.360> gate<00:03:55.569> it<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.870> same<00:03:56.110> way<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:56.620> then<00:03:57.280> there

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
and gate it the same way and then there

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.790 
and gate it the same way and then there
was<00:03:57.580> numerous<00:03:57.910> applications<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:59.050> that<00:03:59.080> but<00:03:59.590> I

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
was numerous applications of that but I

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.699 
was numerous applications of that but I
was<00:04:00.760> working<00:04:00.940> on<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.239> from<00:04:01.390> my<00:04:01.510> friend<00:04:02.140> Dave

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
was working on this from my friend Dave

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.220 
was working on this from my friend Dave
half<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.569> thought<00:04:04.569> I'd<00:04:04.720> share<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.020> with<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.200> I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
half and thought I'd share it with you I

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.790 
half and thought I'd share it with you I
think<00:04:05.290> it's<00:04:05.530> kind<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.770> cool<00:04:05.920> all<00:04:06.459> right<00:04:06.520> guys
