00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.410
 these seconds of silence 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.269
 belong to the minute of silence that 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.070
 prior to the derby between sparta 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.320
 and the sea was kept due to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.609
 death of wim van slooten 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.619
 this is the first chance of the competition 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 actually the same in double first note 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.060
 and then season dani name and sparta 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
 nijkerk but how does save 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.019
 so flatten everything better in the opening phase 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 of the competition and created the necessary 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 odds were between an example of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.809
 was here again with the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.340
 men who are soenda who are lucky 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.500
 will you get the ball back then or once 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.030
 under the foundel and then cold loss 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.829
 put another foot in between you see 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.110
 really happy because it appears so 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.390
 lead for sparta that did not score 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.640
 and with that also itself in the initial phase 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.289
 deficit at tb corner corner 9 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.030
 frederiksen after that comes from them wrong 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.530
 leg than outside but good and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.570
 Anne had painstaking rescue verhoeven 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.540
 then you are lucky there 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.730
 help is in this case from alan copy 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.170
 to prevent it from tapping inside 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.540
 the anus still happened but sparta happened 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.100
 was looking for a hit but better 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.990
 very long to put it on the plate 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.250
 getting this is not a violation according to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.750
 referee luinge and then he may 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.610
 solarium with the ball off is a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.310
 move to someone Monday love ball 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.259
 just stood in David's feet 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.630
 it still hit him has sparta after 29 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.400
 minutes finally the lead 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.100
 right on the road it returns enough 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 odds in this duel of as you saw was 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 I invariably hover in the way 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.070
 this time mistake by the keeper and therefore 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 the chance for davids and the hit here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.330
 again davids via klote ashore 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.740
 frederiksen then to david a piece 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.780
 hit once at sparta 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.190
 looks very good than the door sector 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.380
 lucky still seems to be coming and if 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.119
 creepy 'soldiers minimal about things 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.890
 are again a pity and still a pity 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.899
 is a pity for sparta did nrc de already 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 nothing at all but that was not entirely 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.560
 where here they have the ball 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.180
 left side with lamp copley medal attack 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.200
 were had to go under by and on 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.360
 this is therefore not to score 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.039
 and you must make a series after all 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.729
 not great defensive work by tim 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.380
 drugs 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.719
 now with the closure comes that it is 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.549
 either has to take action or is beaten 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.170
 so it turns out huge from sparta but this 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.090
 indicates longer than you can see them yourself 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.769
 someone say good light pay attention here 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.929
 another side that sage 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.819
 via Verhoef and then David Cindery job too 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.290
 make it beautiful lie still that way 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.099
 Taliban still not banished 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.959
 fumbling 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.550
 and then the ado of davids yes that 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.900
 saliba many of the prefer themselves 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.380
 tried shot meal 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.880
 to do 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.580
 again no meeting of sparta and the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.860
 sea ​​stays in the competition with this 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.989
 batches of promotions all the way to the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.390
 left side of the field will chair kami 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.150
 fill the mom's there is the mine fish 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.510
 that way chest and so danger nrc side 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.099
 then at least prevent this shot 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.890
 glad of the shot of vossebelt but the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.299
 ball at t schuda that turning away but 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.739
 eventually beach that action 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.450
 yet again is upstairs for sparta with 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.160
 isunda which repels the ball to 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.230
 want multiple heads to be good 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.910
 defending in assay silk and chamomile 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.890
 don't put his head against that ball 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.540
 I still fly it before 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.579
 you can see through halfway through the match 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.170
 studio of broadcaster and 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.609
 and a lot i have to say that the whole 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.829
 match live from the out 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.060
 have broadcast horse in the second half 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.639
 actually the same picture with a lot 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.290
 opportunities for sparta here that sodalite with 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.829
 the way back also doesn't actually lead 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.049
 good enough 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.870
 keep mat in the pins and head 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.530
 here the cornelis is already that species 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.720
 through a defender and all 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.400
 then vermouth tiamo can catch opening 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.160
 to the right side of the field 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.500
 david that lamp paper many followers or 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.180
 this purple cross is good but will be 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.400
 again not worked inside 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.560
 and that is how we see many opportunities 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.050
 orange black sides too much at home 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.830
 that Sudan is a beautiful pan and it is 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.720
 now 2 0 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.340
 no, because cornelis makes this one 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.270
 way to cool off rescue again 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.160
 raise 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.860
 you stopped many men 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 open to david's name 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.120
 see if that 2 0 is added 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.890
 sparta delta looking frederiksen 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.930
 brings the ball to the second post 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.850
 can be cooked there and then it's choir 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.400
 cornelis with bad luck underside later in the 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.170
 rebound year button him about what has 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.820
 Sparta Nijkerk and had opportunities in that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.800
 duel say only one all kinds of one 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.239
 want black attack ball direction 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.760
 comes a bit lucky but t schuda 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.010
 lost great action rozema but do this 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.140
 not too much and is defensive on vvd 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.519
 work there from the begun midfielder 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.500
 this afternoon but eventually he had to 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.880
 play a right back and sc 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.800
 yes that naturally believed in one 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.000
 support because as dad that 2008 you do 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.489
 can fall only once 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.890
 cherkaoui with the balance sloppy 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.780
 turnovers in so quickly with a one 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.310
 The Kronenburg Kronenburg became the man 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.840
 forward that are may or may not handsome 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.750
 action why does it just not have enough 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.390
 time to make a decent goal 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.950
 Yes 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.480
 not to get out of play 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.950
 shoot doctor to ban 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.900
 it's easy for space to be 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.090
 ball to catch again nrc that it is in the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.280
 try the final phase and that corpse is so ff 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.620
 they only do metal union with every one 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.370
 opportunity was concerned about unfortunately for the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.410
 rush hour 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.780
 now sparta on the other hand 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.430
 always making that 2000 but the real one 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.830
 there were no major opportunities in the final phase 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.870
 this is a good shot of david tastes 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.490
 packed again by hoof 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.230
 te velthuis still marketing forward 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.000
 to vossebelt 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.490
 and sparta nijkerk that on two thoughts 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.360
 in we have to make 320 or the one 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.190
 to cherish 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.890
 This is a case could be anyone 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.110
 is only possible on the ball just next to the striker 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.220
 at sparta rich good cross from the 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.770
 love side of the field terrains 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.960
 windsor car tires mark and close 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.250
 referee long gave my wind sparta 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.250
 nijkerk with a zero nothing
