see<00:00:13.590> alternating<00:00:14.160> 10,000<00:00:14.639> K<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> next

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
see alternating 10,000 K is the next

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.000 
see alternating 10,000 K is the next
tank<00:00:15.299> step<00:00:15.570> back<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.199> zoo<00:00:16.410> Med<00:00:16.590> bulbs

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
tank step back when is a zoo Med bulbs

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.790 
tank step back when is a zoo Med bulbs
so<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.910> not<00:00:18.090> sure<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.840> true<00:00:19.199> actinic

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
so I'm not sure if it's a true actinic

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.890 
so I'm not sure if it's a true actinic
or<00:00:20.039> whatever<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.390> middle<00:00:21.600> ones<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
or whatever it is the middle ones of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
or whatever it is the middle ones of
coral<00:00:22.230> life<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:23.100> front<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> Hamilton

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
coral life the front one is a Hamilton

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.560 
coral life the front one is a Hamilton
10,000<00:00:25.109> K<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.550> this<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.910> middle<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.359> right

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
10,000 K and this this middle one right

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029 
10,000 K and this this middle one right
here<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.230> came<00:00:28.380> with<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
here is one that came with it so the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.080 
here is one that came with it so the
Odyssey<00:00:29.519> 10,000<00:00:30.119> KS<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:31.380> aren't<00:00:31.500> bad

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
Odyssey 10,000 KS actually aren't bad

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.030 
Odyssey 10,000 KS actually aren't bad
there<00:00:33.090> there's<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> Odyssey<00:00:34.320> actinic<00:00:34.710> bulbs

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
there there's the Odyssey actinic bulbs

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.620 
there there's the Odyssey actinic bulbs
look<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.460> more<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.000> zoom<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
look a lot more like that zoom in on the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.240 
look a lot more like that zoom in on the
back<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.079> obviously<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.829> guys<00:00:37.950> can't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
back which obviously you guys can't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
back which obviously you guys can't
really<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> true<00:00:39.270> color<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.320> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
really see the true color of it but it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.850 
really see the true color of it but it's
not<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> real<00:00:40.890> actinic<00:00:41.790> bulb<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.390> don't<00:00:42.600> think

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
not a real actinic bulb I don't think

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.290 
not a real actinic bulb I don't think
you'll<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.370> more<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
you'll see that more so when I do the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
you'll see that more so when I do the
compact<00:00:45.690> fluorescent<00:00:45.809> fixture<00:00:46.500> which<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.800> have

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
compact fluorescent fixture which I have

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.119 
compact fluorescent fixture which I have
in<00:00:47.219> addition<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.739> overall<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> real

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
in addition it is overall it's a real

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.029 
in addition it is overall it's a real
nice<00:00:50.309> fixture<00:00:50.730> though<00:00:50.940> each<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> each

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
nice fixture though each of the each

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.360 
nice fixture though each of the each
dual<00:00:53.370> t5<00:00:53.789> has<00:00:54.449> its<00:00:55.230> own<00:00:55.820> ballast<00:00:57.260> I'm<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:59.010> sure

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
dual t5 has its own ballast I'm not sure

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.729 
dual t5 has its own ballast I'm not sure
if<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.699> really<00:00:59.879> see<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.480> there's<00:01:00.840> let

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
if you can really see that there's let

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.760 
if you can really see that there's let
me<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.039> light<00:01:02.280> real<00:01:02.460> quick<00:01:04.400> light<00:01:05.400> I

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
me get this light real quick light I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.100 
me get this light real quick light I
don't<00:01:07.770> know

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.719 

there<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:12.229> go

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
there we go

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.050 
there we go
so<00:01:14.299> there<00:01:14.899> is<00:01:15.289> ballast<00:01:15.799> number<00:01:16.159> one<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.610> it

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
so there is ballast number one and it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.310 
so there is ballast number one and it
has<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.600> switch<00:01:17.899> right<00:01:18.590> there<00:01:19.869> so<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.079> is

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
has the switch right there so this is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.179 
has the switch right there so this is
this<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.130> actually<00:01:22.490> how<00:01:22.549> much<00:01:22.700> light<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:24.189> had

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
this is actually how much light I had

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.889 
this is actually how much light I had
when<00:01:25.429> I<00:01:25.460> bought<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.909> tank<00:01:26.119> just<00:01:26.539> had<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.659> zoo

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
when I bought the tank just had a zoo

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.230 
when I bought the tank just had a zoo
Med<00:01:27.079> dual<00:01:27.259> t5<00:01:27.679> picture<00:01:28.070> which<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.399> not<00:01:28.880> enough

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
Med dual t5 picture which is not enough

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.169 
Med dual t5 picture which is not enough
to<00:01:29.270> support<00:01:29.659> what's<00:01:29.899> in<00:01:30.079> there<00:01:30.259> now<00:01:30.289> for<00:01:30.920> sure

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
to support what's in there now for sure

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.660 
to support what's in there now for sure
really<00:01:32.179> minimal<00:01:32.689> lighting<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:34.460> is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
really minimal lighting and then this is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.630 
really minimal lighting and then this is
the<00:01:34.850> other<00:01:34.880> one<00:01:35.299> turned<00:01:35.899> off<00:01:36.140> all<00:01:36.979> lights<00:01:37.369> off

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
the other one turned off all lights off

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.730 
the other one turned off all lights off
and<00:01:37.969> then<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.299> really<00:01:38.929> love<00:01:39.110> about<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.380> you

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
and then what I really love about it you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.880 
and then what I really love about it you
get<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.369> nighttime<00:01:40.579> LEDs<00:01:42.340> boom<00:01:43.990> real<00:01:44.990> really

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
get the nighttime LEDs boom real really

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.300 
get the nighttime LEDs boom real really
pretty<00:01:46.569> you<00:01:47.569> can<00:01:47.860> not<00:01:48.860> sure<00:01:49.039> if<00:01:49.099> you<00:01:49.159> can

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
pretty you can not sure if you can

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.800 
pretty you can not sure if you can
really<00:01:49.490> see<00:01:49.700> how<00:01:49.849> well<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.060> bright<00:01:50.450> coral

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
really see how well that bright coral

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.429 
really see how well that bright coral
looks<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.319> the<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.280> Acropora<00:01:52.909> just<00:01:53.840> glows

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
looks that the the Acropora just glows

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.440 
looks that the the Acropora just glows
underneath<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.819> can<00:01:56.030> can't<00:01:56.240> see<00:01:56.329> the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
underneath it you can can't see the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.130 
underneath it you can can't see the
Greenham<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.869> frog<00:01:57.110> spawn<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:59.299> armored<00:01:59.689> blue

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
Greenham of frog spawn the armored blue

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.770 
Greenham of frog spawn the armored blue
clump<00:02:00.470> armor<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:01.549> God<00:02:01.729> really<00:02:02.000> pops<00:02:02.360> which

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
clump armor of God really pops which

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.479 
clump armor of God really pops which
again<00:02:03.289> you<00:02:03.500> can't<00:02:03.709> really<00:02:03.770> see<00:02:05.439> over<00:02:06.439> all<00:02:06.619> the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
again you can't really see over all the

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.170 
again you can't really see over all the
LEDs<00:02:07.880> look<00:02:08.239> really<00:02:08.989> nice<00:02:09.729> if<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.849> want<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> see

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
LEDs look really nice if you want to see

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.710 
LEDs look really nice if you want to see
the<00:02:11.299> underside<00:02:11.890> there<00:02:12.890> are<00:02:13.280> eight<00:02:14.650> altogether

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
the underside there are eight altogether

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
you know 96 Watts I mean this I think

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.679 
you know 96 Watts I mean this I think
this<00:03:52.040> alone<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.549> this<00:03:52.790> tank<00:03:53.060> would<00:03:53.209> do<00:03:53.329> alright

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
this alone on this tank would do alright

but<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.049> added<00:03:54.260> another<00:03:54.500> one<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.069> I'll<00:03:55.159> review

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
but I added another one so I'll review

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.409 
but I added another one so I'll review
