 very light makeup in your eyes and a 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.640

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.590
 beauty well girls if you guys

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.450
 It's super easy I invite you once again 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.219
 to keep watching this video because 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.140
 we start with our face washed for 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.450
 that our skin remains less oily 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.130
 during the day we are going to apply a 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.319
 bronzer to protect our skin 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.030
 ultraviolet rays may change 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.310
 the structure of the skin and cause 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.590
 short-term alterations like spots 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.289
 and early aging of the skin and 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.209
 speed or the spf is the indicator of 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.099
 solar protection of products in 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.590
 the more the number is higher, the 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.709
 power of protection and all apply 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.940
 before exposing yourself to the sun 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.010
 ok going to the premier may be 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.090
 applying this illuminating cream of the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.709
 brand pn fit 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.840
 program meet but I love it because it 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.209
 It gives a luminous effect to my skin and apart 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 like that helps you look youthful like that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.290
 you know how cool if you do not have it 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.250
 just skip this step and apply your 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.250
 favorite pre-base 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.040
 and now let's move on to apply our 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.079
 favorite base I'm going to be applying 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.060
 the new one of surface brown this way 'in 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.890
 color without I love this base because 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.650
 leaves coverage between medium to high 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.780
 and apart it is free of oils but you have 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.519
 so many imperfections you will only occupy 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.650
 a drop to distribute it in all your 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.540
 face I like to blur this base 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.700
 with a flat-tipped brush because 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.620
 I feel that you occupy less base and so the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.099
 Blur is much faster than with a 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.099
 sponge 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.019
 i 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.080
 and now let's move on to apply the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.150
 corrector the best corrector you have 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.740
 To cover your dark circles this is going to 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.720
 apply here on the corner in the 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.940
 commissure of the eyes simply to 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.400
 delete cancel the darkest of the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.380
 dark circles is optional the technique that you 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.390
 you want to apply to cover your dark circles 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.730
 but here I show you how to do it from 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.830
 so light a form and so do not overdo 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.900
 in the concealer if your dark circles are 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.520
 also darker in the part of the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.800
 eyelid carries this same concealer 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.570
 covering and blurring very well with your 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.370
 devito with the finger over because 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.080
 for me I think to apply this type 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.330
 of concealers in dark circles to be 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.840
 very precise you need to blur with the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.840
 fingerprint 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.030
 and now let's move on to apply another 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.680
 corrector let's apply one that is in 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.540
 the liquid since these give you a 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.910
 very light coverage and at the same time covers 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.160
 very well let's apply this concealer 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.320
 like a raccoon or like a tiger of this 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.210
 way to illuminate the center of our 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.430
 face since the strong makeup 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.049
 it's about highlighting the most 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.180
 high of your face and make your skin 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.860
 look very perfect and talking about this 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.690
 corrector of urban di cake I leave you 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.250
 know that the coverage is very similar to 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.110
 the one that leaves the maybelline corrector 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.110
 firm and also to March 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.169
 do not 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.550
 and to follow our makeup we are going to 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.680
 use our favorite compact powder 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.449
 I'm going to be here using the powder 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.449
 mac mineral in a medium shade 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.300
 and we will also be applying a 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.310
 little bit of yellowish dust or dust 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.410
 translucent to cover here in the area 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.120
 of the dark circles and this will help us 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.130
 May this makeup last longer 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.020
 in this area he will also help us 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.210
 control the fat of the skin that we 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.250
 usually leave during the day and if you have 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.319
 Oily skin also applies this powder in 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.440
 your brow bone in the area, this is going 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.940
 help control the fat and going 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.949
 the blush of cheeks we will be 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.360
 applying whatever you want, whatever 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.580
 your favorite we just take it 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.440
 from the manzanitas and we blur towards 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.569
 back and this is the only thing that is going to 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.510
 help define our cheeks and 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:32.120
 cheekbones 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.130
 ok we come to the trick of lestrove or more 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.690
 well to the point of illuminating the skin we're going 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.910
 to take us was factory brush for 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.590
 Apply this type of powder if you do not have 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.630
 a special brush to apply the 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.880
 illuminators you can use any 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.290
 another brochita that is for the eyes a 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.300
 that can serve you are the brushes 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.850
 spongy since they blur very 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.040
 okay ok and passing the makeup is trick 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.900
 is in applying two illuminators the 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.910
 first is to apply one that is integrated 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.690
 very beautiful to your skin that is very light 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.950
 the application that I'm not very 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.500
 satisfied that is the one that will help us 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.270
 to achieve this trick of lestrove ok with 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.460
 the first illuminator we will apply 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.140
 on the cheekbones if it is very light 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.060
 you can wear over the dark circles but have 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.650
 very careful if it is too saturated do not 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.660
 wear over the dark circles because you can 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.760
 look like a focus also apply it for 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.620
 above the eyebrows going down the temple 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.690
 and reaching the cheekbone as if drawing a 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.610
 letter c and do the same in front of 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.470
 his face making up the area t 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.150
 If you have a lot of forehead, do not apply 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.340
 too illuminating in this part 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.260
 because it will make it look bigger and if 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.940
 you have a very fatty skin in this area 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.190
 which is the forehead do not apply much 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.670
 because if not to see that your skin is 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.490
 sweat 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.410
 because it is very funny and happening with 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.630
 the second illuminator this has to 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.610
 be more satin this one just what 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.620
 we are going to apply on the cheekbones and in 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.780
 the bridge of the nose at the corner of 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.760
 the eyes or in cupido's bun for 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.440
 highlight this area more and apply it 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.450
 simply using the yolk of my 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.130
 fingers to be very precise and not exaggerate 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.810

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.640
 technique that you want to use to 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.040
