right hand from there we're gonna swing
it<00:04:23.090> on<00:04:23.229> one<00:04:24.400> over<00:04:25.400> all<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.970> way<00:04:26.060> around<00:04:26.300> to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
it on one over all the way around to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.170 
it on one over all the way around to
come<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.380> front<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.370> actually<00:04:28.729> makes<00:04:29.090> a

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
come to the front so it actually makes a

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.690 
come to the front so it actually makes a
rotation<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.930> half<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.500> light<00:04:30.710> on<00:04:30.919> so<00:04:31.550> that

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
rotation and a half to light on so that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.010 
rotation and a half to light on so that
was<00:04:31.850> six<00:04:32.660> hit<00:04:33.169> seven<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:35.360> serve<00:04:35.660> goal

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
was six hit seven and and you serve goal

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.760 
was six hit seven and and you serve goal
one<00:04:36.350> hit<00:04:36.950> -<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.360> circle<00:04:38.840> one<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:39.410> hit<00:04:39.620> on

one hit - so you circle one you hit on
to<00:04:40.070> make<00:04:40.729> sense<00:04:40.970> then<00:04:41.180> from<00:04:41.690> there<00:04:41.840> you're
