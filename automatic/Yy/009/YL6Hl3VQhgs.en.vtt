00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
five seconds and I think only about

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.590 
five seconds and I think only about
fifty<00:00:59.739> percent<00:01:00.040> of<00:01:00.159> them<00:01:00.339> nail<00:01:00.699> it<00:01:00.909> but<00:01:01.360> when

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
fifty percent of them nail it but when

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.939 
fifty percent of them nail it but when
they<00:01:01.690> do<00:01:01.750> they're<00:01:02.079> really<00:01:02.320> effective<00:01:02.769> and

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
they do they're really effective and

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.580 
they do they're really effective and
just<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.640> game<00:01:03.850> has<00:01:04.390> something<00:01:05.019> about<00:01:05.350> it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
just the game has something about it

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.279 
just the game has something about it
something<00:01:06.070> just<00:01:06.700> smarter<00:01:07.660> about<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:08.050> then<00:01:08.170> it

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
something just smarter about it then it

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:09.779

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
does the voice of Deadpool and I think

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.059 
does the voice of Deadpool and I think
he<00:03:57.840> pulls<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.169> off<00:03:58.260> pretty<00:03:58.410> well<00:03:58.560> while<00:03:58.950> at

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
he pulls it off pretty well while at

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.500 
he pulls it off pretty well while at
times<00:03:59.310> he<00:03:59.459> does<00:03:59.639> sound<00:03:59.849> like<00:03:59.940> he's<00:04:00.090> trying<00:04:00.389> a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
times he does sound like he's trying a

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.000 
times he does sound like he's trying a
bit<00:04:00.630> too<00:04:00.690> hard<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.709> said<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
bit too hard and like I said in the

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.770 
bit too hard and like I said in the
beginning<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.459> review<00:04:02.760> not<00:04:03.359> all<00:04:03.569> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
beginning of the review not all the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.620 
beginning of the review not all the
jokes<00:04:04.019> land<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:05.160> know<00:04:05.280> they<00:04:05.400> don't<00:04:05.760> really<00:04:06.120> do

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
jokes land you know they don't really do

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.140 
jokes land you know they don't really do
it<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:06.810> me<00:04:07.019> uh<00:04:07.290> he's<00:04:08.190> still<00:04:08.220> really<00:04:08.669> awesome

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
it for me uh he's still really awesome

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.150 
it for me uh he's still really awesome
and<00:04:09.389> I<00:04:09.660> think<00:04:09.720> he<00:04:09.989> does<00:04:10.169> come<00:04:10.380> off<00:04:10.410> very<00:04:10.859> much

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
and I think he does come off very much

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.460 
and I think he does come off very much
as<00:04:11.370> Deadpool<00:04:11.669> and<00:04:11.989> Deadpool<00:04:12.989> with<00:04:13.230> other

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
game and trying to work around that it

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.469 
game and trying to work around that it
does<00:05:55.620> break<00:05:56.099> down<00:05:56.159> tons<00:05:56.669> of<00:05:56.819> walls<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.300> it

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
does break down tons of walls and it

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.330 
does break down tons of walls and it
really<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:57.900> absolutely<00:05:58.469> brilliant<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:59.039> once

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
really is absolutely brilliant and once

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.980 
really is absolutely brilliant and once
again<00:05:59.490> I<00:05:59.789> say<00:06:00.000> it's<00:06:00.150> a<00:06:00.180> roller<00:06:00.360> coaster<00:06:00.780> that's

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
again I say it's a roller coaster that's

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.180 
again I say it's a roller coaster that's
when<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.199> game<00:06:01.319> is<00:06:01.469> the<00:06:01.530> most<00:06:01.680> funniest<00:06:01.889> when

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
when the game is the most funniest when

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.920 
when the game is the most funniest when
Deadpool<00:06:02.580> is<00:06:02.610> actually<00:06:03.210> working<00:06:03.479> with<00:06:03.780> the

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.600 
Deadpool is actually working with the
game<00:06:04.110> developers<00:06:04.740> because<00:06:05.129> he<00:06:05.219> has<00:06:05.340> them<00:06:05.520> on

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
game developers because he has them on

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.279 
game developers because he has them on
speed<00:06:05.849> dial<00:06:06.000> he<00:06:06.419> complains<00:06:06.840> about<00:06:06.960> the<00:06:07.139> budget

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
speed dial he complains about the budget

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.050 
speed dial he complains about the budget
and<00:06:07.650> they<00:06:07.889> cut<00:06:08.069> back<00:06:08.099> on<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:08.460> budget<00:06:08.759> and<00:06:08.969> then

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
and they cut back on the budget and then

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.909 
and they cut back on the budget and then
the<00:06:09.150> game<00:06:09.270> is<00:06:09.330> like<00:06:09.539> a<00:06:09.569> 2d<00:06:10.020> side<00:06:10.050> scroller<00:06:10.650> and

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
the game is like a 2d side scroller and

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.040 
the game is like a 2d side scroller and
it<00:06:11.460> really<00:06:11.669> shakes<00:06:11.880> up<00:06:12.060> not<00:06:12.240> only<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.810> game

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
it really shakes up not only the game

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.200 
it really shakes up not only the game
but<00:06:13.319> the<00:06:13.560> variety<00:06:14.099> of<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.279> game<00:06:14.460> because<00:06:14.729> then

but the variety of the game because then

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.879 
but the variety of the game because then
you're<00:06:15.360> playing<00:06:15.569> a<00:06:15.659> 2d<00:06:15.930> platformer<00:06:16.469> then

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
you're playing a 2d platformer then

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.379 
you're playing a 2d platformer then
you're<00:06:17.039> walking<00:06:17.400> through<00:06:17.430> a<00:06:17.639> pixelated<00:06:18.210> world

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
you're walking through a pixelated world

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:19.670 
you're walking through a pixelated world
you're<00:06:18.599> doing<00:06:18.810> all<00:06:18.960> kinds<00:06:19.289> of<00:06:19.349> crazy<00:06:19.409> stuff

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
you're doing all kinds of crazy stuff

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.980 
you're doing all kinds of crazy stuff
and<00:06:20.130> it<00:06:20.219> just<00:06:20.400> it<00:06:20.669> works<00:06:21.120> so<00:06:21.360> well<00:06:21.389> with<00:06:21.599> the

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
and it just it works so well with the

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.260 
and it just it works so well with the
ridiculous<00:06:22.349> stupid<00:06:23.039> story<00:06:23.490> and<00:06:23.789> the<00:06:23.940> gameplay

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
ridiculous stupid story and the gameplay

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.820 
ridiculous stupid story and the gameplay
but<00:06:24.509> the<00:06:24.810> game<00:06:25.020> is<00:06:25.169> a<00:06:25.199> little<00:06:25.440> boring<00:06:25.590> at<00:06:25.800> times

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
but the game is a little boring at times

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.080 
but the game is a little boring at times
you<00:06:26.159> know<00:06:26.190> when<00:06:26.400> you're<00:06:26.520> just<00:06:26.669> hacking<00:06:26.819> and

you know when you're just hacking and
slashing<00:06:27.180> it<00:06:27.659> isn't<00:06:27.990> for<00:06:28.139> everyone<00:06:28.380> because

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
slashing it isn't for everyone because

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.920 
slashing it isn't for everyone because
it<00:06:28.919> is<00:06:29.039> just<00:06:29.430> a<00:06:29.580> regular<00:06:29.789> simple<00:06:30.360> basic<00:06:30.750> video

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
game and the fact that it is so basic

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.309 
game and the fact that it is so basic
and<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.789> is<00:06:32.879> so<00:06:33.090> short<00:06:33.330> I<00:06:33.509> can't<00:06:33.840> really
