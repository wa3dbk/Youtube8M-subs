00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.070 

I<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:12.010> most<00:00:12.400> of<00:00:12.520> my<00:00:12.580> sharpening<00:00:13.210> on<00:00:13.450> Japanese

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
I do most of my sharpening on Japanese

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.030 
I do most of my sharpening on Japanese
waterstones<00:00:15.119> I've<00:00:16.119> got<00:00:16.480> a<00:00:16.560> 1200<00:00:17.560> grit<00:00:17.860> stone

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
waterstones I've got a 1200 grit stone

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.530 
waterstones I've got a 1200 grit stone
here<00:00:19.710> he's<00:00:20.710> an<00:00:20.890> only<00:00:21.010> I<00:00:21.400> have<00:00:21.790> to<00:00:21.970> flatten<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
here he's an only I have to flatten the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.080 
here he's an only I have to flatten the
stones<00:00:22.869> because<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:24.279> way<00:00:24.400> of<00:00:24.550> water<00:00:24.790> stone

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
stones because the way of water stone

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.339 
stones because the way of water stone
works<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.779> your<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:27.220> blade<00:00:27.520> actually

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
works is your your blade actually

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.310 
works is your your blade actually
creates<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.590> slurry<00:00:30.040> of<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.790> soft<00:00:31.720> stone

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
creates a slurry of the soft stone

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.990 
creates a slurry of the soft stone
material<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:33.250> that's<00:00:33.430> what<00:00:33.640> does<00:00:33.850> the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
material and that's what does the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.780 
material and that's what does the
cutting<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:35.040> because<00:00:36.040> it's<00:00:36.220> such<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.399> soft

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
cutting and because it's such a soft

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.280 
cutting and because it's such a soft
stone<00:00:37.149> it<00:00:37.329> tends<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.630> get<00:00:37.810> a<00:00:37.870> little<00:00:37.930> bit

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
stone it tends to get a little bit

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.830 
stone it tends to get a little bit
dished<00:00:38.620> so<00:00:39.310> every<00:00:40.239> once<00:00:40.420> a<00:00:40.510> while<00:00:40.540> I'll

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
dished so every once a while I'll

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.000 
dished so every once a while I'll
flatten<00:00:41.110> them<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:41.530> I'm<00:00:41.590> going<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:41.770> show<00:00:41.950> you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
flatten them and I'm going to show you

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.130 
flatten them and I'm going to show you
how<00:00:42.070> I<00:00:42.340> do<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.940> there<00:00:43.510> may<00:00:43.630> be<00:00:43.660> other<00:00:43.930> ways

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
how I do that there may be other ways

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.710 
how I do that there may be other ways
but<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:44.590> is<00:00:44.710> just<00:00:44.740> what<00:00:45.070> I<00:00:45.100> do<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:46.360> can<00:00:46.540> see

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
but this is just what I do you can see

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.090 
but this is just what I do you can see
this<00:00:46.840> home<00:00:47.080> snow<00:00:47.320> has<00:00:47.440> been<00:00:47.560> flattened<00:00:47.950> a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
this home snow has been flattened a

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.010 
this home snow has been flattened a
number<00:00:48.520> of<00:00:48.610> times<00:00:48.790> it's<00:00:49.150> actually<00:00:49.480> thicker<00:00:49.750> at

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
number of times it's actually thicker at

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.280 
number of times it's actually thicker at
one<00:00:50.230> end<00:00:50.410> that<00:00:50.560> it<00:00:50.650> is<00:00:50.770> at<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.010> other<00:00:52.290> the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
one end that it is at the other the

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.170 
one end that it is at the other the
first<00:00:53.560> stone<00:00:53.980> i'm<00:00:54.310> going<00:00:54.490> to<00:00:54.550> use<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:54.940> this<00:00:55.000> is

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
first stone i'm going to use and this is

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.110 
first stone i'm going to use and this is
totally<00:00:55.750> optional<00:00:55.990> is<00:00:56.830> an<00:00:57.070> actual<00:00:57.430> flattening

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
totally optional is an actual flattening

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.200 
totally optional is an actual flattening
stone<00:00:58.510> just<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.530> get<00:00:59.680> me<00:00:59.890> in<00:01:00.370> them<00:01:00.820> in<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
stone just to get me in them in the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.999 
stone just to get me in them in the
right<00:01:01.360> ballpark<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.809> i'm<00:01:04.930> just<00:01:05.049> going<00:01:05.290> to<00:01:05.320> wet

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009

this thing pretty good i normally store
my<00:01:12.009> stones<00:01:12.369> in<00:01:12.700> water<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:14.200> they're<00:01:14.829> they're

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
my stones in water so they're they're

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.940 
my stones in water so they're they're
fairly<00:01:15.429> wet<00:01:15.759> but<00:01:15.939> this<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.179> going<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:16.420> tell<00:01:16.689> me

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
fairly wet but this is going to tell me

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:29.030 
fairly wet but this is going to tell me
how<00:01:17.950> bad<00:01:18.249> i<00:01:18.310> really<00:01:18.579> am

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.820 

now<00:01:30.040> I'm<00:01:30.220> not<00:01:30.280> shooting<00:01:30.700> for<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.830> flatness

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
now I'm not shooting for the flatness

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.160 
now I'm not shooting for the flatness
that<00:01:32.980> you<00:01:33.130> need<00:01:33.370> for<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.640> machine<00:01:33.820> tool<00:01:34.390> set<00:01:34.990> up

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
that you need for a machine tool set up

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.630 
that you need for a machine tool set up
you<00:01:35.320> know<00:01:35.440> if<00:01:35.560> you're<00:01:35.680> making<00:01:36.040> gears<00:01:36.370> and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
you know if you're making gears and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.730 
you know if you're making gears and
things<00:01:36.880> because<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:37.750> are<00:01:37.900> working<00:01:38.140> with<00:01:38.440> wood

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
things because we are working with wood

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.370 
things because we are working with wood
and<00:01:39.040> actually<00:01:40.030> when<00:01:40.720> you're<00:01:40.840> doing<00:01:41.110> plain

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
and actually when you're doing plain

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.290 
and actually when you're doing plain
iron<00:01:41.710> for<00:01:41.920> example<00:01:42.370> you<00:01:42.520> do<00:01:42.670> want<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.120> be<00:01:43.270> a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
iron for example you do want it to be a

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.660 
iron for example you do want it to be a
little<00:01:43.720> bit<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.200> smile<00:01:44.530> in<00:01:44.800> it<00:01:44.920> just<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.490> keep

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
little bit of a smile in it just to keep

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.350 
little bit of a smile in it just to keep
the<00:01:45.850> edges<00:01:46.300> from<00:01:46.450> digging<00:01:46.870> in<00:01:47.020> but<00:01:48.360> this

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
the edges from digging in but this

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.450 
the edges from digging in but this
thing's<00:01:49.660> way<00:01:49.870> out<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.260> flat<00:01:50.560> we've<00:01:51.070> got<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.250> lot

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
thing's way out of flat we've got a lot

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.280 
thing's way out of flat we've got a lot
of<00:01:51.490> extra<00:01:52.060> material<00:01:52.510> that's<00:01:52.600> cutting<00:01:52.870> here

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
of extra material that's cutting here

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.840 
of extra material that's cutting here
and<00:01:53.470> here<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:53.860> it's<00:01:53.980> not<00:01:54.040> even<00:01:54.370> getting<00:01:54.550> down

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
and here so it's not even getting down

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:11.850 
and here so it's not even getting down
to<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.120> inside<00:01:55.480> yet

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.140 

I'm<00:02:12.860> starting<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.310> get<00:02:13.490> there<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.820> can<00:02:14.120> see

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
I'm starting to get there you can see

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.450 
I'm starting to get there you can see
it's<00:02:14.570> later<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:15.200> here<00:02:15.560> here<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.130> it's<00:02:16.250> still

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
it's later up here here but it's still

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.620 
it's later up here here but it's still
dark<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.060> here<00:02:18.640> once<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.820> while<00:02:20.060> I'll<00:02:20.330> just

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
dark in here once in a while I'll just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.540 
dark in here once in a while I'll just
dip<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.320> water<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.270> get<00:02:23.270> rid<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
dip this in water and get rid of the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:37.590 
dip this in water and get rid of the
material

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.330 

yeah<00:02:38.600> I'm<00:02:38.750> getting<00:02:38.960> close<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.740> this<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.160> just

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
yeah I'm getting close and this is just

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.920 
yeah I'm getting close and this is just
a<00:02:40.520> rough<00:02:40.760> work<00:02:41.030> I'm<00:02:41.240> going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.420> do<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> fine

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
a rough work I'm going to do the fine

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.900 
a rough work I'm going to do the fine
work<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> piece<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.770> glass<00:02:42.980> you'll<00:02:43.550> see<00:02:43.730> that

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
work on a piece of glass you'll see that

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
rough stones the glass works fine it

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
rough stones the glass works fine it
just<00:02:49.730> takes<00:02:50.030> longer

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
still have a dark area in here as I can

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.339 
still have a dark area in here as I can
tell<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.540> not<00:03:08.569> getting<00:03:08.959> all<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> way

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.410 
trying to make a single one more level 1
i'm<00:03:21.830> using<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:27.910> we're<00:03:28.910> just<00:03:29.090> about<00:03:29.239> there

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
i'm using it we're just about there

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
these other stones yeah I've done a

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.280 
these other stones yeah I've done a
first<00:03:48.880> go<00:03:49.120> around<00:03:49.270> on<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.750> fronts<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:50.200> backs

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
first go around on the fronts and backs

first go around on the fronts and backs
of<00:03:50.710> all<00:03:50.890> my<00:03:51.100> stones<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.790> now<00:03:52.390> I'm<00:03:52.540> going<00:03:52.720> to

of all my stones and now I'm going to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.440 
of all my stones and now I'm going to
check<00:03:52.990> to<00:03:53.050> see<00:03:53.230> if<00:03:53.410> I<00:03:53.650> got<00:03:54.610> most<00:03:54.910> of<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.360> I'm

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
check to see if I got most of it so I'm

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.450 
check to see if I got most of it so I'm
gonna<00:03:55.540> take<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.720> pencil<00:03:56.020> just<00:03:56.950> make<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.190> little

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
gonna take a pencil just make a little

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.460 
gonna take a pencil just make a little
grid<00:03:57.990> on<00:03:58.990> the<00:03:59.050> stone<00:04:00.810> pencil<00:04:01.810> gets<00:04:01.990> down<00:04:02.200> deep

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
grid on the stone pencil gets down deep

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.170 
grid on the stone pencil gets down deep
into<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:02.950> stone<00:04:03.190> so<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.520> doesn't<00:04:03.790> wash<00:04:03.970> off

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
into the stone so it doesn't wash off

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:15.750 
into the stone so it doesn't wash off
easy<00:04:04.510> image<00:04:04.840> do<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> few<00:04:06.270> tricks<00:04:14.520> that<00:04:15.520> pretty

going<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.299> wet<00:04:19.450> this<00:04:19.630> glass<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:22.270> then<00:04:22.360> put

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
going to wet this glass and then put

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.890 
going to wet this glass and then put
some<00:04:22.570> carborundum<00:04:23.140> powder<00:04:23.500> on<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:27.900> I'm

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
some carborundum powder on it just I'm

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.930 
some carborundum powder on it just I'm
not<00:04:29.050> sure<00:04:29.140> what<00:04:29.500> grip<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:30.040> is<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.310> tight<00:04:30.670> truth

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
not sure what grip this is a tight truth

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.310 
not sure what grip this is a tight truth
it's<00:04:31.090> been<00:04:31.240> too<00:04:31.390> long<00:04:31.420> since<00:04:31.630> i've<00:04:32.050> purchased

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
it's been too long since i've purchased

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.460 
it's been too long since i've purchased
it<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.940> i'm<00:04:34.270> going<00:04:34.360> to<00:04:34.420> start<00:04:34.510> out<00:04:34.840> with<00:04:34.870> my<00:04:35.230> 12

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
it so i'm going to start out with my 12

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.320 
it so i'm going to start out with my 12
hour<00:04:35.710> gritstones<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.730> i'm<00:04:36.970> going<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.180> try<00:04:37.240> to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
hour gritstones and i'm going to try to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.990 
hour gritstones and i'm going to try to
leave<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:38.470> residue<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:38.980> there<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.640> as<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:39.820> work

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
leave the residue on there so as I work

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.570 
leave the residue on there so as I work
down<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.480> next<00:04:40.600> down<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:41.560> will<00:04:42.250> help<00:04:42.400> a

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
down to the next down that will help a

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.640 
down to the next down that will help a
little<00:04:42.700> bit<00:04:42.880> with<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.150> cutting<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:43.660> then

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
little bit with the cutting and then

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.870 
little bit with the cutting and then
we'll<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:44.920> two<00:04:45.040> white<00:04:45.220> you<00:04:45.430> know<00:04:45.550> clean<00:04:45.850> the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
we'll have two white you know clean the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.460 
we'll have two white you know clean the
plate<00:04:46.870> off<00:04:47.050> too<00:04:47.230> much<00:04:48.660> all<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.810> do<00:04:49.960> is<00:04:49.990> take<00:04:50.290> an

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
plate off too much all you do is take an

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.999 
plate off too much all you do is take an
advantage<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.130> fact<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.520> glass<00:04:51.850> is<00:04:51.880> flat

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.390 

and<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.610> can<00:04:58.789> see<00:04:59.089> that<00:04:59.650> my<00:05:00.650> slurry<00:05:01.039> is

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
and you can see that my slurry is

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.779 
and you can see that my slurry is
turning<00:05:01.819> brown<00:05:02.089> now<00:05:09.279> they'll<00:05:10.279> do<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.550> same

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
turning brown now they'll do the same

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:28.779 
turning brown now they'll do the same
thing<00:05:11.089> with<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.270> pencil<00:05:11.599> line

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:49.560 

and<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:32.870> still<00:05:33.870> got<00:05:34.080> a<00:05:34.110> little<00:05:34.460> hollowing<00:05:35.460> here

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.120 

you<00:05:50.570> don't<00:05:50.780> need<00:05:50.990> much<00:05:51.290> in<00:05:51.530> this<00:05:51.620> carborundum

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
you don't need much in this carborundum

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.240 
you don't need much in this carborundum
powder<00:05:52.430> that<00:05:53.030> little<00:05:53.420> bit<00:05:53.600> back<00:05:53.840> can<00:05:54.250> come

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
powder that little bit back can come

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.840 
powder that little bit back can come
from<00:05:55.460> a<00:05:55.580> bag<00:05:55.790> that<00:05:55.820> i<00:05:56.210> bought<00:05:57.100> 1980<00:05:58.100> i<00:05:58.250> think

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:18.440 

just<00:06:01.850> a<00:06:01.970> loyal<00:06:02.180> smidgen

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450

another<00:06:20.710> check<00:06:21.160> with<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.430> pencil<00:06:35.340> looks<00:06:36.340> like

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
another check with the pencil looks like

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.910 
another check with the pencil looks like
I<00:06:36.640> got<00:06:36.670> it's<00:06:37.120> nice<00:06:37.300> and<00:06:37.540> flat<00:06:37.780> so<00:06:38.410> that's<00:06:38.620> it

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
I got it's nice and flat so that's it

I got it's nice and flat so that's it
the<00:06:39.600> stone<00:06:40.600> surface<00:06:41.050> will<00:06:41.200> be<00:06:41.290> a<00:06:41.320> little<00:06:41.530> bit

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
the stone surface will be a little bit

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.810 
the stone surface will be a little bit
rough<00:06:41.860> for<00:06:41.890> your<00:06:42.250> first<00:06:42.430> couple<00:06:42.790> of

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
rough for your first couple of

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.120 
rough for your first couple of
sharpenings<00:06:43.450> but<00:06:44.020> if<00:06:44.110> you<00:06:44.200> try<00:06:44.350> to<00:06:44.500> you<00:06:45.100> know

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
sharpenings but if you try to you know

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.070 
sharpenings but if you try to you know
use<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.700> whole<00:06:45.880> stone<00:06:46.180> as<00:06:46.450> much<00:06:46.600> as<00:06:46.780> you<00:06:46.870> can

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
use the whole stone as much as you can

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.050 
use the whole stone as much as you can
you<00:06:47.680> minimize<00:06:48.130> your<00:06:48.310> number<00:06:48.610> of<00:06:48.670> times<00:06:48.880> you

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
you minimize your number of times you

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.190 
you minimize your number of times you
have<00:06:49.240> to<00:06:49.390> do<00:06:49.540> this<00:06:49.660> because<00:06:49.780> this<00:06:49.960> really

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
have to do this because this really

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.070 
have to do this because this really
takes<00:06:50.500> away<00:06:50.650> the<00:06:50.890> material<00:06:51.400> and<00:06:51.750> you<00:06:52.750> can<00:06:52.900> see

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
takes away the material and you can see

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.780 
takes away the material and you can see
that<00:06:53.110> stones<00:06:53.500> worn<00:06:53.860> down<00:06:54.010> quite<00:06:54.250> a<00:06:54.280> bit<00:06:54.370> this

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
that stones worn down quite a bit this

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.240 
that stones worn down quite a bit this
method<00:06:54.970> works<00:06:55.300> for<00:06:55.600> me<00:06:55.780> so<00:06:56.080> hopefully<00:06:56.250> maybe

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
method works for me so hopefully maybe

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.980 
method works for me so hopefully maybe
it'll<00:06:57.460> work<00:06:57.490> for<00:06:57.790> you<00:06:57.940> if<00:06:58.060> you<00:06:58.210> decide<00:06:58.660> to<00:06:58.780> try

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
it'll work for you if you decide to try

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:09.140 
it'll work for you if you decide to try
that<00:06:59.230> thanks<00:06:59.500> for<00:06:59.650> watching
