00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
building I've already been to somewhere

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.170 
building I've already been to somewhere
that<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.510> never<00:00:33.510> portal<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.940> great<00:00:35.940> so

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that has the never portal here great so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.850 
that has the never portal here great so
we'll<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.540> through<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:38.930> now<00:00:39.930> I'm<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.620> sure

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
if you can do this on survival I have no

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.340 
if you can do this on survival I have no
idea<00:00:43.079> myself<00:00:43.670> but<00:00:44.670> yeah<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
idea myself but yeah so it's just a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.029 
idea myself but yeah so it's just a
normal<00:00:47.030> world<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> was

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
normal world like that and what I was

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.939 
normal world like that and what I was
trying<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.750> some<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
trying to do was so if we get some of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.880 
trying to do was so if we get some of
those<00:00:56.309> teleport<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.989> end<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> pull<00:00:58.770> up

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
those teleport I the end the pull up

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
those teleport I the end the pull up
pull<00:00:59.129> things<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.300> dig<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> way<00:01:00.809> up

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
pull things and we dig all the way up

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.859 
pull things and we dig all the way up
until<00:01:04.549> we're<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.640> bedrock<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.270> reason<00:01:06.570> i<00:01:06.659> can

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
until we're at bedrock some reason i can

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
until we're at bedrock some reason i can
break<00:01:07.049> bedrock<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:07.950> i'm<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.220> sure<00:01:08.430> if

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
break bedrock up here i'm not sure if

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.880 
break bedrock up here i'm not sure if
that's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.909> glitter<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.470> thing<00:01:10.680> like

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that's a glitter all and the thing like

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.620 
that's a glitter all and the thing like
that<00:01:11.119> this<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.330> pc<00:01:12.750> by<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:14.330> if<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
that this is on pc by the way and if you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.039 
that this is on pc by the way and if you
throw<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> bedrock<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.810> can

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
throw a it through the bedrock you can

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.260 
throw a it through the bedrock you can
glitch<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.500> through<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> bedrock<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:21.150> I'm

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
glitch out through the bedrock so I'm

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.440 
glitch out through the bedrock so I'm
here<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.740> thinking<00:01:23.250> cool<00:01:24.180> I'll<00:01:24.420> walk

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
here now and I'm thinking cool I'll walk

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.740 
here now and I'm thinking cool I'll walk
around<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.500> yeah<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.869> absolutely<00:01:28.650> baron

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
around and yeah so it's absolutely baron

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.260 
around and yeah so it's absolutely baron
also<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> thought<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.579> quite<00:01:32.820> small<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
also I thought so it's quite small you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.170 
also I thought so it's quite small you
can<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.900> quite<00:01:34.020> small<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.939> I'll<00:01:35.939> just

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
can see it's quite small and I'll just

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.499 
can see it's quite small and I'll just
go<00:01:36.329> around<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> perimeter<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.259> i<00:01:37.590> found<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
go around the perimeter and i found this

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
go around the perimeter and i found this
which<00:01:39.509> i<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> glitch<00:01:40.829> or

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
which i don't know if it's a glitch or

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.179 
which i don't know if it's a glitch or
if<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.700> something<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:42.390> going<00:01:43.189> it's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
if it's something that's going it's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.130 
if it's something that's going it's
something<00:01:44.430> that's<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.790> click<00:01:45.240> through<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
something that's like click through the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.450 
something that's like click through the
underneath<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.460> burning

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
underneath of here but it's a burning

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.420 
underneath of here but it's a burning
ring<00:01:52.460> travel<00:01:53.460> strange<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> minnow<00:01:55.399> create<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
ring travel strange so I minnow create a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
ring travel strange so I minnow create a
salt<00:01:56.700> break<00:01:56.909> all<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:59.479> spurning<00:02:00.479> thing<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
salt break all this spurning thing and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.569 
salt break all this spurning thing and
it<00:02:01.439> had<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.009> these<00:02:02.780> diamonds<00:02:03.780> emeralds<00:02:04.579> gold

a fresh tutorial world thought maybe

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330 
a fresh tutorial world thought maybe
maybe<00:02:21.990> it's<00:02:22.260> something<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.650> got<00:02:22.800> added<00:02:22.920> into

the store award so I was just running

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.050 
the store award so I was just running
around<00:02:25.860> looking<00:02:26.250> for<00:02:26.370> something<00:02:26.730> else<00:02:26.850> they

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
around looking for something else they

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820 
around looking for something else they
come<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:27.330> clues<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.960> find<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.380> what<00:02:28.590> that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
come for clues to find out what that

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.260 
come for clues to find out what that
thing<00:02:29.040> was<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.930> while<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.050> had<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.590> i<00:02:32.270> was

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
thing was and while it had and i was

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.360 
thing was and while it had and i was
going<00:02:33.540> round<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:37.200> over<00:02:37.470> here<00:02:37.710> now<00:02:38.340> i

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
going round and this was over here now i

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.130 
going round and this was over here now i
don't<00:02:38.490> know<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.060> net<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.810> has<00:02:40.020> been

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
don't know if this is net this has been

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.960 
don't know if this is net this has been
put<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.410> so<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.040> case<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.460> trapped<00:02:41.760> up

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
put here so in case you get trapped up

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.500 
put here so in case you get trapped up
here<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.360> can<00:02:42.510> leave<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.160> i<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.550> through

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
here you can leave but if i go through

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.020 
here you can leave but if i go through
here<00:02:46.130> you'd<00:02:47.130> think<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.520> would<00:02:47.610> shut<00:02:47.820> me

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
here you'd think it would shut me

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.420 
here you'd think it would shut me

somewhere randomly in the world millions

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.080 
somewhere randomly in the world millions
of<00:02:50.790> miles<00:02:51.030> away<00:02:51.270> from<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.170> thing<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.790> puts

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
of miles away from the thing but it puts

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.760 
of miles away from the thing but it puts
me<00:02:54.360> right<00:02:55.130> outside<00:02:56.690> one<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.140> objectives

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
me right outside one of the objectives

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.250 
me right outside one of the objectives
of<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.640> disorder<00:02:59.940> not<00:03:00.240> really<00:03:00.480> injective<00:03:01.020> but

of the disorder not really injective but

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.920 
of the disorder not really injective but
you<00:03:01.350> need<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.620> collect<00:03:01.800> these<00:03:02.990> things<00:03:03.990> hear

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
you need to collect these things hear

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.090 
you need to collect these things hear
this<00:03:06.930> music<00:03:07.470> disc<00:03:07.890> here<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:09.170> I'm<00:03:10.170> not<00:03:10.530> sure<00:03:10.770> if

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
this music disc here now I'm not sure if

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.990 
this music disc here now I'm not sure if
that's<00:03:11.400> cause<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.880> dental<00:03:12.360> or<00:03:12.510> not<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:14.100> put

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
that's cause a dental or not but it put

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.050 
that's cause a dental or not but it put
me<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:16.140> if<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.590> put<00:03:16.770> me<00:03:16.890> anywhere<00:03:17.060> it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
me you think if it put me anywhere it

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.610 
me you think if it put me anywhere it
would<00:03:18.240> put<00:03:18.390> me<00:03:18.450> randomly<00:03:18.990> somewhere<00:03:19.410> else

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
would put me randomly somewhere else

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.480 
would put me randomly somewhere else
like<00:03:20.040> over<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> sea<00:03:21.120> or<00:03:21.360> whatever<00:03:21.810> but

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
like over in the sea or whatever but

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.060 
like over in the sea or whatever but
we're<00:03:23.490> here<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.110> on<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.260> edge<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.860> world

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
we're here just on the edge of the world

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.520 
we're here just on the edge of the world
just<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:26.970> very<00:03:27.600> close<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.170> edge<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
just like very close to the edge of the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.550 
just like very close to the edge of the
water<00:03:28.740> and<00:03:29.390> we're<00:03:30.390> very<00:03:30.420> close<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
water and we're very close to the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.030 
water and we're very close to the
objective<00:03:32.160> now<00:03:33.080> if<00:03:34.080> i<00:03:34.230> could<00:03:34.290> get<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> bit<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
objective now if i could get a bit of a

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.540 
objective now if i could get a bit of a
perspective<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.770> also<00:03:37.770> see<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> sheep

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
perspective of this is also see a sheep

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
perspective of this is also see a sheep
we're<00:03:39.300> by<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.510> castle<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:42.060> there's

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
we're by the castle and the there's

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.560 
we're by the castle and the there's
another<00:03:42.810> thing<00:03:43.050> somewhere<00:03:43.730> by<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> castle<00:03:45.330> and

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
another thing somewhere by a castle and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.130 
another thing somewhere by a castle and
there's<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.840> village<00:03:46.050> and<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:48.360> is<00:03:48.540> still<00:03:48.810> I

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
there's a village and this is still I

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.390 
there's a village and this is still I
think<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:51.230> lighthouse<00:03:52.230> one<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.920> think

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
think this is the lighthouse one I think

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.960 
think this is the lighthouse one I think
maybe<00:03:53.900> not<00:03:54.900> entirely<00:03:55.170> sure<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:56.700> need<00:03:56.940> a

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
maybe not entirely sure to need a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.430 
maybe not entirely sure to need a
lighthouse<00:03:57.510> and<00:04:00.380> we<00:04:01.380> keep<00:04:01.590> flying<00:04:02.840> will<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:04.110> I

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
lighthouse and we keep flying will be I

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.960 
lighthouse and we keep flying will be I
can't<00:04:04.709> get<00:04:04.830> my<00:04:04.920> bearings<00:04:05.280> because<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.640> trunks

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
can't get my bearings because the trunks

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.360 
can't get my bearings because the trunks
aren't<00:04:06.120> learn<00:04:06.330> so<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.630> don't<00:04:06.840> know<00:04:06.900> where<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.110> am

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
aren't learn so I don't know where I am

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.949 
aren't learn so I don't know where I am
but<00:04:08.370> we're<00:04:08.670> close<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.540> our<00:04:10.280> original<00:04:11.280> point<00:04:11.959> if

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
but we're close to our original point if

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.130 
but we're close to our original point if
I<00:04:13.140> could<00:04:13.320> find<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.270> this<00:04:15.600> is

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
I could find it and this this is

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.990 
I could find it and this this is
obviously<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.650> think<00:04:17.040> publicist<00:04:17.640> or<00:04:17.790> real

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
thing here we are see their doubts where

thing here we are see their doubts where
the<00:04:48.380> lighthouse<00:04:48.680> was<00:04:49.010> that<00:04:49.790> he<00:04:49.850> can<00:04:49.970> give<00:04:50.120> a

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
the lighthouse was that he can give a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
what stop tutorial is and it just seemed

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.770 
what stop tutorial is and it just seemed
a<00:04:55.400> bit<00:04:56.650> weird<00:04:57.650> how<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.040> is<00:04:58.640> formed<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.419> close

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
a bit weird how it is formed so close

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.210 
a bit weird how it is formed so close
and<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:01.930> obviously<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.140> need<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.470> glitch<00:05:03.950> to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
and and obviously you need to glitch to

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.060 
and and obviously you need to glitch to
get<00:05:04.400> up<00:05:04.550> there<00:05:04.790> but<00:05:05.120> I<00:05:05.360> think<00:05:06.260> it<00:05:06.410> I<00:05:06.590> don't<00:05:06.950> know

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
they took it out of here maybe that was

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.540 
they took it out of here maybe that was
an<00:05:40.729> update<00:05:41.090> it<00:05:41.419> was<00:05:41.630> up<00:05:41.810> here<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.340> if<00:05:43.340> there's

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
an update it was up here and if there's

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.510 
an update it was up here and if there's
something<00:05:43.850> that<00:05:43.940> is<00:05:44.180> in<00:05:44.360> that<00:05:44.510> new<00:05:44.690> room<00:05:45.520> which

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
something that is in that new room which

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.200 
something that is in that new room which
is<00:05:46.550> cool<00:05:46.910> and<00:05:47.419> there's<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:48.289> cannon<00:05:48.680> here<00:05:49.210> looks

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
is cool and there's a cannon here looks

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.250 
is cool and there's a cannon here looks
like<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.360> kind<00:05:50.660> of<00:05:50.750> yeah<00:05:51.140> it<00:05:51.470> wasn't<00:05:51.710> there<00:05:53.260> but

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.260 
like a kind of yeah it wasn't there but

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.469 
like a kind of yeah it wasn't there but
I<00:05:54.350> think<00:05:54.530> they<00:05:54.650> must<00:05:54.680> have<00:05:54.890> moved<00:05:55.100> it<00:05:55.370> in<00:05:56.270> an

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
I think they must have moved it in an

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.010 
I think they must have moved it in an
update<00:05:57.039> so<00:05:58.039> if<00:05:58.280> you<00:05:58.400> guys<00:05:58.580> try<00:05:59.090> out<00:05:59.300> this<00:05:59.660> and
