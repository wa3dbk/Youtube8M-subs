00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
straight for this worker line your goal

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.389 
straight for this worker line your goal
is<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> kill<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.109> many<00:00:31.140> workers<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:31.949> possible

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
is to kill as many workers as possible

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.430 
is to kill as many workers as possible
to<00:00:32.520> slow<00:00:32.759> them<00:00:32.969> down<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.420> then<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> can

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to slow them down and then if you can

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
to slow them down and then if you can
start<00:00:34.739> attacking<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.250> base<00:00:35.460> let's<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.300> how

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
start attacking the base let's see how

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
start attacking the base let's see how
this<00:00:36.480> Reaper<00:00:36.840> does<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:38.219> strategy<00:00:38.670> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this Reaper does it the strategy is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700 
this Reaper does it the strategy is
particularly<00:00:39.210> effective<00:00:39.360> against<00:00:40.200> protoss

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
particularly effective against protoss

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.040 
particularly effective against protoss
but<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.219> also<00:00:41.430> effective<00:00:41.910> answered<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.660> you

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
but it's also effective answered if you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.450 
but it's also effective answered if you
can<00:00:43.200> hit<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.530> before<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.340> their

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
can hit them before they have their

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
can hit them before they have their
queen<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.989> Reaper<00:00:46.289> comes<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.680> here

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
queen out so this Reaper comes in here

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
queen out so this Reaper comes in here
he's<00:00:47.460> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> pop<00:00:47.879> some<00:00:48.120> drones<00:00:48.420> he<00:00:48.600> gets

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
he's going to pop some drones he gets

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.740 
he's going to pop some drones he gets
one<00:00:49.610> it's<00:00:50.610> another<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.180> you'll<00:00:51.329> notice<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
one it's another if you'll notice it's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
one it's another if you'll notice it's
three<00:00:52.020> shots<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> kill<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.649> drone<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.190> you're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
three shots to kill a drone so if you're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.860 
three shots to kill a drone so if you're
bringing<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.730> Reapers<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.390> bring<00:00:54.600> in

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
bringing in Reapers you can bring in

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.799 
bringing in Reapers you can bring in
three<00:00:55.649> Reapers<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.550> shot<00:00:56.879> drones<00:00:57.239> he's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
three Reapers to one shot drones he's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.240 
three Reapers to one shot drones he's
going<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> jump<00:00:58.410> off<00:00:58.649> when<00:00:58.829> he<00:00:58.920> sees<00:00:59.129> those

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
going to jump off when he sees those

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.650 
going to jump off when he sees those
zerglings<00:00:59.760> come<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.359> he's<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
zerglings come in and then he's going to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.500 
zerglings come in and then he's going to
come<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> harass<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:02.070> hatchery

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
come down here and harass this hatchery

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.179 
come down here and harass this hatchery
this<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> great<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.350> Reapers<00:01:05.070> do

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
this is great because the Reapers do

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789 
this is great because the Reapers do
excellent<00:01:05.790> damage<00:01:06.210> versus<00:01:06.750> buildings<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
excellent damage versus buildings so it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.740 
excellent damage versus buildings so it
forces<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.430> Zerg<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> come<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
forces the Zerg to come out now the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
forces the Zerg to come out now the
Reapers<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> use<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.560> hiding<00:01:11.010> he's
