my<00:03:17.530> own<00:03:17.680> computer<00:03:18.010> when<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.880> know<00:03:19.000> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
my own computer when the you know the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.789 
my own computer when the you know the
USB<00:03:19.510> modem<00:03:19.840> doesn't<00:03:20.079> work<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.350> can<00:03:20.500> figure<00:03:20.620> it

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
USB modem doesn't work I can figure it

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.229 
USB modem doesn't work I can figure it
out<00:03:21.750> yeah<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.400> problem<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.819> is<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:24.970> it

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
out yeah but the problem is is that it

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.240 
out yeah but the problem is is that it
takes<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.109> step<00:03:26.410> further<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:27.100> be<00:03:27.220> a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
takes it's like a step further to be a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.099 
takes it's like a step further to be a
tech<00:03:27.519> support<00:03:27.910> person<00:03:28.120> mm-hmm<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:28.959> don't

get<00:03:59.200> out<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.410> door<00:03:59.709> complete<00:04:00.519> my<00:04:00.639> project<00:04:00.910> and

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
get out the door complete my project and

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.539 
get out the door complete my project and
be<00:04:01.510> done<00:04:01.720> with<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:01.959> faster<00:04:02.470> right<00:04:02.650> but<00:04:02.889> if

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
be done with this faster right but if

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.699 
be done with this faster right but if
you<00:04:03.760> spin<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.299> time<00:04:04.569> and<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:04.989> really<00:04:05.380> drill

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
you spin the time and you really drill

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.259 
you spin the time and you really drill
down<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.010> what<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.400> root<00:04:06.579> of<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.760> problem<00:04:07.150> is

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
down to what the root of the problem is

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.569 
down to what the root of the problem is
you<00:04:07.480> figure<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:08.019> out<00:04:08.139> you<00:04:08.769> have<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.280> bit<00:04:09.459> of

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
you figure it out you have that bit of

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.800 
you figure it out you have that bit of
knowledge<00:04:09.730> for<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.389> next<00:04:10.630> time<00:04:10.750> you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
knowledge for the next time you

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.440 
knowledge for the next time you
encounter<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.410> problem<00:04:11.889> and<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.639> lot<00:04:12.849> of<00:04:12.880> text

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
encounter that problem and a lot of text

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.339 
encounter that problem and a lot of text
will<00:04:14.109> spend<00:04:14.709> 20<00:04:15.040> minutes<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.519> give<00:04:15.669> up<00:04:15.790> and

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
will spend 20 minutes and give up and

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.870 
will spend 20 minutes and give up and
you<00:04:17.349> can't<00:04:17.680> be<00:04:17.769> afraid<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:18.070> ask<00:04:18.160> it's<00:04:18.609> either<00:04:18.849> I

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
you can't be afraid to ask it's either I

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.069 
you can't be afraid to ask it's either I
would<00:04:19.239> have<00:04:19.450> run<00:04:19.690> into<00:04:19.810> those<00:04:20.049> problems

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
would have run into those problems

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.959 
would have run into those problems
before<00:04:20.410> well<00:04:20.979> but<00:04:21.099> then<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.250> gotta<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:21.820> get
