I had thought that this was one of the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.860 
I had thought that this was one of the
companies<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.079> maybe<00:00:49.500> didn't<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:51.780> know

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870

didn't<00:00:52.230> come<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.590> Canada<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:53.910> are

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
didn't come to Canada because there are

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.189 
didn't come to Canada because there are
some<00:00:54.210> American<00:00:54.600> chocolate<00:00:54.750> bars<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.140> you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
some American chocolate bars that you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.729 
some American chocolate bars that you
just<00:00:55.379> can't<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.860> Canada<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.739> don't

rolled in some peanuts when they were

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.970 
rolled in some peanuts when they were
out<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.329> after<00:02:48.810> they<00:02:48.930> made<00:02:49.379> this<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.680> stick

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
out the after they made this like stick

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.819 
out the after they made this like stick
of<00:02:50.099> caramel<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.670> middle<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.560> that's<00:02:52.709> why

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
of caramel in the middle so that's why

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.349 
of caramel in the middle so that's why
there's<00:02:53.010> peanuts<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.909> the<00:02:54.060> outside

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
there's peanuts on the on the outside

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.699 
there's peanuts on the on the outside
not<00:02:54.659> really<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.319> inside<00:02:55.349> it's<00:02:55.680> just

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
not really on the inside it's just

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.770 
not really on the inside it's just
caramel<00:02:56.159> on<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> inside<00:02:56.579> the<00:02:57.329> caramel<00:02:57.689> is

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
caramel on the inside the caramel is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.539 
caramel on the inside the caramel is
really<00:02:57.959> nice<00:02:58.079> I<00:02:58.200> was<00:02:58.349> just<00:02:58.889> not<00:02:59.099> expecting

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
really nice I was just not expecting

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.220 
really nice I was just not expecting
that<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.670> was<00:02:59.790> expecting<00:03:00.180> like<00:03:00.329> heavier

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that I was expecting like heavier

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.190 
that I was expecting like heavier
peanuts<00:03:01.819> just<00:03:02.819> sort<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.480> don't<00:03:03.810> all<00:03:03.959> mix

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
peanuts just sort of I don't all mix

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530 
peanuts just sort of I don't all mix
together<00:03:04.349> somehow<00:03:05.030> but<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.090> guess<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.420> makes

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
together somehow but I guess this makes

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.119 
together somehow but I guess this makes
sense<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:06.989> probably<00:03:07.349> easier<00:03:07.560> way<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.739> put

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
sense this is probably easier way to put

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.030 
sense this is probably easier way to put
it<00:03:08.220> together<00:03:08.310> if<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.450> were<00:03:09.569> her<00:03:10.439> she<00:03:10.500> making<00:03:10.950> it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it together if I were her she making it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.270 
it together if I were her she making it
the<00:03:11.519> peanuts<00:03:11.879> are<00:03:12.439> salted<00:03:13.439> they<00:03:13.709> taste<00:03:13.919> salted

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the peanuts are salted they taste salted

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.309 
the peanuts are salted they taste salted
to<00:03:14.370> me<00:03:14.459> at<00:03:14.579> least

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
to me at least

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.430 
to me at least
um<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:17.849> that's<00:03:18.329> interesting<00:03:18.840> that's<00:03:19.230> good<00:03:19.410> I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
um so that's interesting that's good I

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.030 
um so that's interesting that's good I
guess

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
guess

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.259
