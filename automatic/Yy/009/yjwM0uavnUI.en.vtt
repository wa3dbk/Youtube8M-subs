the size and form of the grapevine and
this<00:00:24.019> can<00:00:24.199> help<00:00:24.410> with<00:00:24.560> some<00:00:24.590> of<00:00:24.859> our

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
this can help with some of our

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.839 
this can help with some of our
management<00:00:25.939> operations<00:00:27.429> pruning<00:00:28.429> also

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
management operations pruning also

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.329 
management operations pruning also
allows<00:00:29.210> us<00:00:29.240> to<00:00:29.960> select<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.740> number<00:00:30.859> of<00:00:31.039> buds

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339 
allows us to select the number of buds

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.700 
allows us to select the number of buds
that<00:00:31.519> we<00:00:31.699> want<00:00:31.910> to<00:00:32.029> leave<00:00:32.240> on<00:00:32.450> a<00:00:32.480> vine<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.020> this

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
that we want to leave on a vine and this

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.370 
that we want to leave on a vine and this
will<00:00:34.100> influence<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.910> crop<00:00:35.540> or<00:00:35.780> yield<00:00:36.110> of<00:00:36.290> the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
will influence the crop or yield of the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.709 
will influence the crop or yield of the
vine<00:00:36.560> and<00:00:36.829> also<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.309> chute<00:00:37.550> vigor<00:00:37.910> by

vine and also the chute vigor by
selecting<00:00:39.230> these<00:00:39.350> buds<00:00:39.620> we<00:00:39.800> also<00:00:39.950> have

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
selecting these buds we also have

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.540 
selecting these buds we also have
control<00:00:40.579> over<00:00:41.500> how<00:00:42.500> many<00:00:42.680> fruitful<00:00:43.250> shoots

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
control over how many fruitful shoots

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.100 
control over how many fruitful shoots
there<00:00:43.850> are<00:00:44.030> on<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.449> vine<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:44.899> we<00:00:44.960> can

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
there are on the vine and we can

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.139 
there are on the vine and we can
optimally<00:00:45.530> distribute<00:00:46.219> those<00:00:46.399> along<00:00:47.000> the

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
optimally distribute those along the

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.479 
optimally distribute those along the
vine<00:00:47.329> when<00:00:48.050> we're<00:00:48.230> pruning<00:00:48.710> grapevines<00:00:49.190> we're

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
vine when we're pruning grapevines we're

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.060 
vine when we're pruning grapevines we're
aiming<00:00:49.730> for<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:50.210> balance<00:00:50.629> between<00:00:51.070> vegetative

desired wine style cutting or removing
tissue<00:00:59.629> from<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.140> grapevine<00:01:00.410> actually

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
tissue from a grapevine actually

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.130 
tissue from a grapevine actually
stimulates<00:01:01.850> growth<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:02.449> what<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:02.719> does<00:01:02.960> is

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
stimulates growth and what this does is

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.320 
stimulates growth and what this does is
allow<00:01:03.469> us<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.980> build<00:01:04.190> very<00:01:04.460> large<00:01:04.519> frameworks

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
allow us to build very large frameworks

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.810 
allow us to build very large frameworks
and<00:01:05.660> also<00:01:06.200> allows<00:01:06.470> us<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.920> direct<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.520> growth

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
and also allows us to direct that growth

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.480 
and also allows us to direct that growth
in<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.360> vine<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:08.869> this<00:01:09.619> time<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:10.040> year<00:01:10.189> we<00:01:10.340> do

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
in the vine so this time of year we do

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.090 
in the vine so this time of year we do
what<00:01:10.640> we<00:01:10.759> call<00:01:10.970> winter<00:01:11.330> pruning<00:01:11.689> and<00:01:12.080> as<00:01:12.830> part

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
what we call winter pruning and as part

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.070 
what we call winter pruning and as part
of<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:13.400> demonstration<00:01:14.000> we'd<00:01:14.509> like<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.869> show

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
of this demonstration we'd like to show

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.840 
of this demonstration we'd like to show
you<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.290> main<00:01:15.500> types<00:01:15.830> of<00:01:16.070> pruning<00:01:16.490> which<00:01:16.610> are

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
you the main types of pruning which are

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.240 
you the main types of pruning which are
spur<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.479> cane<00:01:17.810> pruning<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.710> over<00:01:18.950> here<00:01:19.159> we

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
spur and cane pruning so over here we

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.870 
spur and cane pruning so over here we
have<00:01:19.280> what<00:01:19.610> we<00:01:19.700> call<00:01:19.880> spur<00:01:20.240> pruning<00:01:21.729> when<00:01:22.729> it

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
have what we call spur pruning when it

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.609 
have what we call spur pruning when it
comes<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.240> pruning<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.659> grapevine<00:01:23.900> it's<00:01:24.320> really

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
comes to pruning a grapevine it's really

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:25.960 
comes to pruning a grapevine it's really
important<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.250> we<00:01:25.369> understand<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
important that we understand the

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.999 
important that we understand the
different<00:01:26.299> parts<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.869> vine<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:27.380> here

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
different parts of the vine so here

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.690 
different parts of the vine so here
we've<00:01:28.159> got<00:01:28.369> a<00:01:28.610> spur<00:01:29.329> pruned<00:01:29.720> grapevine<00:01:30.439> and

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
we've got a spur pruned grapevine and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.249 
we've got a spur pruned grapevine and
this<00:01:31.700> part<00:01:31.970> here<00:01:32.210> is<00:01:32.240> what<00:01:32.479> we<00:01:32.600> call<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.960> trunk

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
this part here is what we call the trunk

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.109 
this part here is what we call the trunk
this<00:01:33.560> offers<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:33.920> lot<00:01:34.159> of<00:01:34.189> support<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
this offers a lot of support to the

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.569 
this offers a lot of support to the
grapevine<00:01:35.390> then<00:01:36.140> you've<00:01:36.350> got<00:01:36.619> what<00:01:36.979> we<00:01:37.100> call<00:01:37.340> a

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
grapevine then you've got what we call a

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.990 
grapevine then you've got what we call a
permanent<00:01:38.420> cordon<00:01:39.350> that's<00:01:40.009> set<00:01:40.250> up<00:01:40.280> along<00:01:40.820> the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
permanent cordon that's set up along the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.050 
permanent cordon that's set up along the
wire<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.509> trellis<00:01:42.020> system<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:43.759> case

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
wire of the trellis system in this case

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.609 
wire of the trellis system in this case
we've<00:01:44.360> got<00:01:44.600> what<00:01:44.780> we<00:01:44.899> call<00:01:45.049> a<00:01:45.110> bilateral

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
we've got what we call a bilateral

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.889 
we've got what we call a bilateral
cordon<00:01:46.250> because<00:01:46.579> it<00:01:46.700> goes<00:01:46.880> in<00:01:47.630> both

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
cordon because it goes in both

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.100 
cordon because it goes in both
directions<00:01:48.939> when<00:01:49.939> it<00:01:50.030> comes<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.479> spur<00:01:50.750> pruning

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
directions when it comes to spur pruning

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.670 
directions when it comes to spur pruning
we<00:01:51.920> set<00:01:52.219> up<00:01:52.250> spur<00:01:53.000> positions<00:01:53.630> along<00:01:54.380> that

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
we set up spur positions along that

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.179 
we set up spur positions along that
permanent<00:01:55.250> cordon<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.439> we<00:01:57.439> try<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.740> make<00:01:58.009> them

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
permanent cordon and we try to make them

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.779 
permanent cordon and we try to make them
as<00:01:58.340> evenly<00:01:58.880> spaced<00:01:59.329> as<00:01:59.600> possible<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.789> you'll

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
as evenly spaced as possible and you'll

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.850 
as evenly spaced as possible and you'll
see<00:02:02.030> here<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.600> these<00:02:03.110> are<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.439> shoots<00:02:03.710> that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
see here that these are the shoots that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.050 
see here that these are the shoots that
developed<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.670> last<00:02:05.439> season<00:02:07.030> what<00:02:08.030> a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
developed in the last season what a

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.150 
developed in the last season what a
natural<00:02:08.390> spur<00:02:08.600> position<00:02:09.080> looks<00:02:09.289> like<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.770> over

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
natural spur position looks like is over

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.390 
natural spur position looks like is over
here<00:02:10.490> and<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.880> can<00:02:11.060> see<00:02:11.240> that<00:02:11.390> two<00:02:12.010> canes<00:02:13.010> or

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
here and you can see that two canes or

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.700 
here and you can see that two canes or
shoots<00:02:13.850> have<00:02:14.120> been<00:02:14.330> produced<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.200> each<00:02:15.470> have

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
shoots have been produced so each have

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.930 
shoots have been produced so each have
come<00:02:15.920> from<00:02:16.100> those<00:02:16.310> two<00:02:16.640> now

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
come from those two now

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.850 
come from those two now
foods<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.300> were<00:02:17.420> left<00:02:17.690> at<00:02:18.080> pruning<00:02:18.590> last

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
foods that were left at pruning last

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.980 
foods that were left at pruning last
year<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.490> as<00:02:20.030> I<00:02:20.150> mentioned<00:02:20.480> before<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.870> want

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
year and as I mentioned before we want

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.110 
year and as I mentioned before we want
to<00:02:21.140> limit<00:02:21.320> that<00:02:21.470> extension<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.550> what<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.820> do<00:02:22.970> is

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
to limit that extension so what we do is

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.090 
to limit that extension so what we do is
remove<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.690> most<00:02:23.900> distal<00:02:24.410> where<00:02:24.650> we<00:02:24.800> where<00:02:25.070> we

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
remove the most distal where we where we

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.430 
remove the most distal where we where we
can<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:26.210> make<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> cut<00:02:26.840> through<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:27.830> and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
can so we make a cut through here and

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.990 
can so we make a cut through here and
then<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:30.590> take<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.130> more<00:02:31.490> often<00:02:31.820> than<00:02:31.970> not

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
then we take this more often than not

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.410 
then we take this more often than not
back<00:02:32.420> to<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:33.050> two<00:02:33.320> node<00:02:33.470> spur<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.240> can

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
back to to a two node spur and you can

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.410 
back to to a two node spur and you can
see<00:02:35.630> here<00:02:36.050> node<00:02:36.350> 1<00:02:36.650> node<00:02:36.950> 2<00:02:37.310> at<00:02:37.850> each<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.270> these

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
see here node 1 node 2 at each of these

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.480 
see here node 1 node 2 at each of these
nodes<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:39.140> what<00:02:39.350> we<00:02:39.440> call<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.680> compound<00:02:40.040> bug

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
nodes is what we call a compound bug

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.010 
nodes is what we call a compound bug
which<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.910> can<00:02:41.060> see<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.420> see<00:02:41.630> sitting<00:02:41.870> on

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
which you can see it see sitting on

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.920 
which you can see it see sitting on
there<00:02:42.230> there<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.330> ideally<00:02:44.330> what<00:02:44.450> will<00:02:44.630> happen

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
there there and ideally what will happen

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.050 
there there and ideally what will happen
is<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.440> chute<00:02:45.770> will<00:02:46.040> be<00:02:46.160> produced<00:02:46.670> from

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
is that a chute will be produced from

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.540 
is that a chute will be produced from
this<00:02:47.690> node<00:02:48.200> position<00:02:48.440> or<00:02:48.830> this<00:02:48.950> from<00:02:49.400> this

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
this node position or this from this

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.590 
this node position or this from this
compound<00:02:50.000> bud<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.820> our<00:02:52.970> new<00:02:53.270> spur

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
compound bud so this is our new spur

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.990 
compound bud so this is our new spur
position<00:02:54.200> for<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.710> up<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.130> coming<00:02:55.370> season<00:02:58.000> ok

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
position for the up and coming season ok

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.880 
position for the up and coming season ok
so<00:02:59.060> what<00:02:59.420> we<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.780> here<00:02:59.810> is<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> vine<00:03:00.590> that's

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
so what we have here is a vine that's

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.950 
so what we have here is a vine that's
been<00:03:01.130> spur<00:03:01.430> pruned<00:03:01.820> previously<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.840> what

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
been spur pruned previously and what

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.330 
been spur pruned previously and what
you'll<00:03:03.080> notice<00:03:03.230> straight<00:03:03.770> away<00:03:03.800> is<00:03:04.310> that

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
you'll notice straight away is that

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.940 
you'll notice straight away is that
these<00:03:05.240> spur<00:03:05.540> positions<00:03:06.110> have<00:03:06.440> been<00:03:06.470> set<00:03:06.920> up

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
these spur positions have been set up

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.730 
these spur positions have been set up
evenly<00:03:07.790> along<00:03:08.300> this<00:03:08.480> permanent<00:03:09.080> cordon<00:03:09.530> I

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
evenly along this permanent cordon I

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.280 
evenly along this permanent cordon I
chose<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:10.880> vine<00:03:11.150> because<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.660> also<00:03:11.810> shows

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
chose this vine because it also shows

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.710 
chose this vine because it also shows
you<00:03:12.560> what<00:03:12.710> can<00:03:12.890> happen<00:03:13.130> when<00:03:13.670> those<00:03:14.390> spur

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
you what can happen when those spur

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.960 
you what can happen when those spur
positions<00:03:15.290> become<00:03:15.710> too<00:03:15.950> extended<00:03:16.580> from<00:03:16.820> that

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
positions become too extended from that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.030 
positions become too extended from that
main<00:03:17.210> cordon<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.110> over<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.350> next<00:03:18.410> few<00:03:18.650> seasons

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
main cordon so over the next few seasons

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.790 
main cordon so over the next few seasons
we'll<00:03:19.460> be<00:03:19.580> trying<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:20.090> set<00:03:21.050> up<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.290> new<00:03:21.470> spear

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
we'll be trying to set up a new spear

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.070 
we'll be trying to set up a new spear
position<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.580> stop<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.630> extension

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
position and stop that that extension

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.190 
position and stop that that extension
that<00:03:24.440> you're<00:03:24.590> seeing<00:03:24.830> here<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.660> this<00:03:26.959> is<00:03:27.080> an

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
that you're seeing here so this is an

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.350 
that you're seeing here so this is an
example<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:28.010> spur<00:03:28.250> pruned<00:03:28.610> via<00:03:28.910> now<00:03:29.239> we'll

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
example of a spur pruned via now we'll

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.710 
example of a spur pruned via now we'll
go<00:03:29.480> have<00:03:29.660> a<00:03:29.690> look<00:03:29.870> at<00:03:29.989> some<00:03:30.170> cane<00:03:30.380> pruning<00:03:31.720> ok

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
go have a look at some cane pruning ok

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.170 
go have a look at some cane pruning ok
so<00:03:32.780> here<00:03:33.230> we've<00:03:33.410> got<00:03:33.620> a<00:03:33.680> cane<00:03:34.100> proven<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:35.060> was

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
so here we've got a cane proven that was

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.330 
so here we've got a cane proven that was
pruned<00:03:35.540> previously<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.560> what<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.130> can<00:03:37.310> see

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
pruned previously and what you can see

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.460 
pruned previously and what you can see
here<00:03:37.790> unlike<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.330> spur<00:03:38.540> pruning<00:03:38.870> line<00:03:39.170> is

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
here unlike the spur pruning line is

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.650 
here unlike the spur pruning line is
that<00:03:39.950> there<00:03:40.100> isn't<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.489> permanent<00:03:41.180> cordon

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
that there isn't that permanent cordon

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.190 
that there isn't that permanent cordon
structure<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.370> here<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:43.760> have<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.450> head<00:03:44.870> trained

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
structure so here we have a head trained

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.979 
structure so here we have a head trained
vine<00:03:45.470> instead<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.250> we<00:03:46.280> still<00:03:46.580> have<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:46.989> trunk

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
vine instead so we still have that trunk

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.990 
vine instead so we still have that trunk
to<00:03:48.380> offer<00:03:48.650> support<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.519> vine<00:03:49.700> but

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
to offer support to the vine but

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.850 
to offer support to the vine but
everything<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.630> trained<00:03:50.989> from<00:03:51.320> what<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:51.680> call

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
everything is trained from what we call

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.580 
everything is trained from what we call
the<00:03:51.980> head<00:03:52.239> you'll<00:03:53.239> notice<00:03:53.630> also<00:03:54.290> with<00:03:54.470> this

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
the head you'll notice also with this

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.050 
the head you'll notice also with this
type<00:03:54.830> of<00:03:54.860> training<00:03:55.160> system<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.760> we're

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
these renewal Spurs here's a renewal

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.350 
these renewal Spurs here's a renewal

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
pruning for cane pruning and what you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.030 
pruning for cane pruning and what you
can<00:04:14.060> see<00:04:14.090> here<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.840> we've<00:04:15.320> left<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.769> two

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
can see here is that we've left a two

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.789 
can see here is that we've left a two
two<00:04:16.940> nodes<00:04:17.180> spur<00:04:17.570> again<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.140> ideally<00:04:18.620> what

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
two nodes spur again and ideally what

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.340 
two nodes spur again and ideally what
will<00:04:18.950> happen<00:04:19.280> here<00:04:19.580> is<00:04:19.700> that<00:04:19.790> will<00:04:20.419> get<00:04:20.720> chutes

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
will happen here is that will get chutes

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.920 
will happen here is that will get chutes
bursting<00:04:21.980> in<00:04:22.220> spring<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.000> these<00:04:23.480> will<00:04:23.720> form

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
bursting in spring and these will form

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.800 
bursting in spring and these will form
the<00:04:24.169> replacement<00:04:24.830> canes<00:04:25.190> in<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.419> following

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
the replacement canes in the following

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.510 
the replacement canes in the following
season<00:04:27.289> which<00:04:27.470> you'll<00:04:27.650> see<00:04:27.680> here<00:04:27.860> so<00:04:28.340> these

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
season which you'll see here so these

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.450 
season which you'll see here so these
have<00:04:28.729> come<00:04:28.910> from

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
have come from

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.390 
have come from
replacement<00:04:30.300> Spurs<00:04:30.569> but<00:04:30.870> it's<00:04:31.050> this

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
replacement Spurs but it's this

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.590 
replacement Spurs but it's this
replacement<00:04:32.400> spare<00:04:32.789> position<00:04:33.240> that's<00:04:33.389> pretty

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
replacement spare position that's pretty

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.770 
replacement spare position that's pretty
important<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.410> cane<00:04:34.800> pruning<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.539> is<00:04:36.660> the

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
important to cane pruning so this is the

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.589 
important to cane pruning so this is the
basics<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.590> cane<00:04:37.860> pruning<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.729> can<00:04:38.940> have<00:04:39.150> one

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
basics of cane pruning you can have one

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
like you see here we've got we've got

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.339 
like you see here we've got we've got
four<00:04:43.470> canes<00:04:43.800> wrapped<00:04:44.490> down<00:04:45.199> one<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.289> the

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
four canes wrapped down one of the

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.920 
four canes wrapped down one of the
reasons<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.039> might<00:04:47.220> choose<00:04:47.639> to<00:04:48.000> apply

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
reasons that you might choose to apply

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.100 
reasons that you might choose to apply
cane<00:04:49.530> pruning<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:50.069> your<00:04:50.250> vineyard<00:04:50.460> is

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
cane pruning in your vineyard is

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.480 
cane pruning in your vineyard is
fruitfulness<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.470> one<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.009> ways<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.340> we

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
fruitfulness and one of the ways that we

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.309 
fruitfulness and one of the ways that we
assess<00:04:53.849> that<00:04:54.180> as<00:04:54.389> I<00:04:54.509> mentioned<00:04:54.569> before<00:04:54.990> in

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:55.319 
assess that as I mentioned before in

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.409 
assess that as I mentioned before in
spur<00:04:55.590> pruning<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.250> we<00:04:56.789> look<00:04:57.000> at<00:04:57.210> the

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
spur pruning is we look at the

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.839 
spur pruning is we look at the
fruitfulness<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.259> those<00:04:58.620> compound<00:04:59.250> buds<00:04:59.520> at

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
fruitfulness of those compound buds at

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.939 
fruitfulness of those compound buds at
each<00:05:00.030> of<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.360> node<00:05:00.539> positions<00:05:01.169> we<00:05:01.740> want<00:05:01.919> a

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
each of the node positions we want a

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.379 
each of the node positions we want a
good<00:05:02.070> internode<00:05:02.550> link<00:05:02.849> so<00:05:03.060> that's<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
good internode link so that's the

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.100 
good internode link so that's the
spacing<00:05:03.930> between<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.560> two<00:05:04.770> nodes<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:06.780> roughly

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
spacing between the two nodes of roughly

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.110 
spacing between the two nodes of roughly
around<00:05:07.320> six<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:07.979> eight<00:05:08.130> centimeters<00:05:08.430> if<00:05:08.970> we

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
around six to eight centimeters if we

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.170 
around six to eight centimeters if we
can<00:05:09.300> get<00:05:09.479> it<00:05:09.630> we<00:05:10.349> also<00:05:10.470> like<00:05:11.009> to<00:05:11.039> have<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.970> good

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
can get it we also like to have a good

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.659 
can get it we also like to have a good
diameter<00:05:12.810> on<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.110> cane<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:13.590> not<00:05:13.860> too<00:05:14.160> thin<00:05:14.460> but

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
diameter on the cane so not too thin but

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.939 
diameter on the cane so not too thin but
also<00:05:14.820> not<00:05:15.240> too<00:05:15.479> thick<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.050> we'll<00:05:16.380> assess<00:05:16.740> that

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
also not too thick so we'll assess that

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.010 
also not too thick so we'll assess that
in<00:05:17.099> the<00:05:17.190> vineyard<00:05:17.520> before<00:05:17.910> we<00:05:18.120> we<00:05:18.539> choose<00:05:18.840> the

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
in the vineyard before we we choose the

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.310 
in the vineyard before we we choose the
comb<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.500> wrap<00:05:19.650> down<00:05:19.889> and<00:05:20.810> preferably<00:05:21.810> if<00:05:22.050> we

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
comb to wrap down and preferably if we

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.620 
comb to wrap down and preferably if we
can<00:05:22.680> get<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:22.979> we<00:05:23.130> would<00:05:23.310> prefer<00:05:23.669> a<00:05:23.880> round<00:05:24.240> came

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
can get it we would prefer a round came

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.629 
can get it we would prefer a round came
rather<00:05:24.900> than<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.169> flat<00:05:25.409> cane<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> flat<00:05:26.099> cane<00:05:26.370> can

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
rather than a flat cane a flat cane can

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.010 
rather than a flat cane a flat cane can
indicate<00:05:26.909> that<00:05:27.090> there<00:05:27.389> might<00:05:27.569> be<00:05:27.599> a<00:05:27.750> higher

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
indicate that there might be a higher

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.870 
indicate that there might be a higher
virus<00:05:28.530> load<00:05:28.800> in<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.039> vine<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:29.490> we<00:05:29.610> wouldn't

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
virus load in the vine so we wouldn't

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.390 
virus load in the vine so we wouldn't
select<00:05:30.240> those<00:05:30.419> particular<00:05:31.110> canes<00:05:31.349> and<00:05:31.830> for

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
select those particular canes and for

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.700 
select those particular canes and for
many<00:05:32.639> wine<00:05:33.419> grape<00:05:33.720> varieties<00:05:34.289> and<00:05:34.560> other

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
many wine grape varieties and other

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.760 
many wine grape varieties and other
grape<00:05:35.039> varieties<00:05:35.550> especially<00:05:35.699> table<00:05:36.389> grapes

the<00:05:37.770> nodes<00:05:38.550> more<00:05:39.090> distal<00:05:39.690> along<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.380> cane<00:05:40.680> are

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
the nodes more distal along the cane are

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.980 
the nodes more distal along the cane are
much<00:05:41.130> more<00:05:41.400> fruitful<00:05:41.970> so<00:05:42.360> what<00:05:42.539> we'll<00:05:42.720> do<00:05:42.960> is

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
much more fruitful so what we'll do is

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.730 
much more fruitful so what we'll do is
is<00:05:43.349> take<00:05:43.680> some<00:05:43.949> dissections<00:05:44.669> of<00:05:45.380> those<00:05:46.380> buds

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
is take some dissections of those buds

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.249 
is take some dissections of those buds
and<00:05:47.039> have<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.340> look<00:05:47.639> at<00:05:47.909> how<00:05:48.270> many<00:05:48.570> what<00:05:48.960> we<00:05:49.080> call

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
and have a look at how many what we call

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:51.290 
and have a look at how many what we call
inflorescence<00:05:50.039> prime<00:05:50.340> order<00:05:50.699> and<00:05:50.909> these<00:05:51.060> are

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
inflorescence prime order and these are

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.330 
inflorescence prime order and these are
what<00:05:51.449> develop<00:05:51.900> into<00:05:52.199> the<00:05:52.320> bud<00:05:52.469> the<00:05:52.770> bunches

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
what develop into the bud the bunches

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.010 
what develop into the bud the bunches
later<00:05:53.639> in<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:54.000> season<00:05:54.180> how<00:05:54.539> many<00:05:54.750> of<00:05:54.870> those

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
later in the season how many of those

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.430 
later in the season how many of those
are<00:05:55.349> present<00:05:55.590> in<00:05:56.099> the<00:05:56.400> compound<00:05:56.820> bud<00:05:57.440> before

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
are present in the compound bud before

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.560 
are present in the compound bud before
pruning<00:05:59.159> and<00:05:59.310> that<00:05:59.699> will<00:05:59.820> help<00:05:59.969> us<00:06:00.150> make<00:06:00.389> the

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
pruning and that will help us make the

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.140 
pruning and that will help us make the
decision<00:06:01.050> of<00:06:01.199> how<00:06:01.380> many<00:06:01.680> nodes<00:06:02.430> we<00:06:02.789> need<00:06:03.000> to

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
decision of how many nodes we need to

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.939 
decision of how many nodes we need to
leave<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:03.570> and<00:06:03.750> also<00:06:04.110> what<00:06:04.320> type<00:06:04.500> of<00:06:04.560> pruning

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
leave and and also what type of pruning

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.879 
leave and and also what type of pruning
system<00:06:05.460> we<00:06:05.610> need<00:06:05.789> to<00:06:06.030> use<00:06:06.289> so<00:06:07.289> this<00:06:07.440> is<00:06:07.590> just<00:06:07.710> an

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
system we need to use so this is just an

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.830 
system we need to use so this is just an
example<00:06:07.979> of<00:06:08.430> what<00:06:08.669> came<00:06:08.909> pruning<00:06:09.389> looks<00:06:09.570> like

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
example of what came pruning looks like

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.480 
example of what came pruning looks like
and<00:06:10.080> this<00:06:10.169> is<00:06:10.229> in<00:06:10.469> one<00:06:10.500> of<00:06:10.650> our<00:06:10.860> experimental

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
and this is in one of our experimental

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.020 
and this is in one of our experimental
vineyards<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:14.310> mentioned<00:06:14.550> before<00:06:14.759> that

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
vineyards so I mentioned before that

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.390 
vineyards so I mentioned before that
grapevines<00:06:15.960> have<00:06:16.289> what<00:06:16.440> we<00:06:16.560> call<00:06:16.800> compound

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
grapevines have what we call compound

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.370 
grapevines have what we call compound
buds<00:06:17.669> and<00:06:18.030> one<00:06:18.240> of<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.419> things<00:06:18.659> we<00:06:18.870> do<00:06:19.050> when<00:06:19.259> we

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
buds and one of the things we do when we

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.260 
buds and one of the things we do when we
set<00:06:19.620> our<00:06:19.800> pruning<00:06:20.250> levels<00:06:20.580> in<00:06:20.789> the<00:06:20.880> vineyard

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
set our pruning levels in the vineyard

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.600 
set our pruning levels in the vineyard
is<00:06:21.599> to<00:06:21.870> actually<00:06:22.289> dissect<00:06:22.500> these<00:06:23.039> compound

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
is to actually dissect these compound

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.520 
is to actually dissect these compound
buds<00:06:23.849> and<00:06:24.180> have<00:06:24.389> a<00:06:24.419> look<00:06:24.690> at<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.930> developing

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
buds and have a look at the developing

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.260 
buds and have a look at the developing
inflorescence<00:06:26.250> primordia<00:06:26.909> now<00:06:27.120> these

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
inflorescence primordia now these

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.990 
inflorescence primordia now these
develop<00:06:27.870> in<00:06:28.050> two<00:06:28.380> bunches<00:06:28.710> so<00:06:29.219> we<00:06:29.669> make<00:06:29.849> an

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
develop in two bunches so we make an

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.909 
develop in two bunches so we make an
assessment<00:06:30.300> of<00:06:30.630> those<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:31.199> get<00:06:31.289> an<00:06:31.440> idea<00:06:31.830> of

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
assessment of those to get an idea of

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.950 
assessment of those to get an idea of
how<00:06:32.280> many<00:06:32.340> nodes<00:06:32.820> we<00:06:33.240> should<00:06:33.509> leave<00:06:33.719> at

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
how many nodes we should leave at

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.499 
how many nodes we should leave at
pruning<00:06:34.469> so<00:06:35.310> what<00:06:35.460> I've<00:06:35.580> set<00:06:35.789> up<00:06:35.820> today<00:06:36.240> is

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
pruning so what I've set up today is

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.019 
pruning so what I've set up today is
I've<00:06:36.690> got<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:37.080> stereomicroscope<00:06:37.699> ready<00:06:38.699> and

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 
I've got the stereomicroscope ready and

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.020 
I've got the stereomicroscope ready and
and<00:06:39.270> a<00:06:39.690> bud<00:06:40.139> compound<00:06:41.039> bud<00:06:41.219> ready<00:06:41.520> for

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
and a bud compound bud ready for

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.790 
and a bud compound bud ready for
section<00:06:42.480> and<00:06:42.690> I'm<00:06:43.140> just<00:06:43.350> going<00:06:43.470> to<00:06:43.500> show<00:06:43.740> you

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
section and I'm just going to show you

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.770 
section and I'm just going to show you
how<00:06:44.100> I<00:06:44.130> dissect<00:06:44.730> that<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.150> then<00:06:45.300> show<00:06:45.540> you<00:06:45.570> the

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
how I dissect that and then show you the

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.350 
how I dissect that and then show you the
visual<00:06:45.990> of<00:06:46.230> what<00:06:46.410> that<00:06:46.590> looks<00:06:47.310> like<00:06:47.400> on<00:06:47.790> on<00:06:48.180> the

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
visual of what that looks like on on the

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.590 
visual of what that looks like on on the
screen<00:06:48.660> here<00:06:49.550> okay<00:06:50.550> so<00:06:50.610> I'm<00:06:50.820> just<00:06:51.060> making<00:06:51.510> a

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
screen here okay so I'm just making a

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.110 
screen here okay so I'm just making a
few<00:06:51.840> transverse<00:06:52.560> sections<00:06:53.250> through<00:06:53.970> the

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
few transverse sections through the

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.930 
few transverse sections through the
compound<00:06:54.540> bud<00:06:54.870> and<00:06:55.470> I<00:06:55.980> try<00:06:56.190> to<00:06:56.250> make<00:06:56.460> these<00:06:56.640> as

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
compound bud and I try to make these as

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.420 
compound bud and I try to make these as
fine<00:06:57.300> as<00:06:57.600> possible<00:06:57.690> so<00:06:58.590> that<00:06:58.620> I<00:06:58.770> don't<00:06:58.920> remove

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
fine as possible so that I don't remove

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.580 
fine as possible so that I don't remove
too<00:06:59.760> much<00:06:59.940> tissue<00:07:00.240> and<00:07:00.600> can't<00:07:00.840> make<00:07:01.080> the

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
too much tissue and can't make the

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.120 
too much tissue and can't make the
assessment<00:07:02.220> and<00:07:02.760> if<00:07:03.270> you<00:07:03.390> see<00:07:03.600> on<00:07:03.630> the<00:07:03.870> screen

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
assessment and if you see on the screen

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.180 
assessment and if you see on the screen
there's<00:07:05.130> a<00:07:05.430> primary<00:07:06.360> and<00:07:06.780> a<00:07:06.930> secondary<00:07:06.960> bud<00:07:07.710> in

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
there's a primary and a secondary bud in

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.190 
there's a primary and a secondary bud in
the<00:07:08.490> image<00:07:08.760> and<00:07:09.090> you'll<00:07:09.630> notice<00:07:09.840> in<00:07:10.110> the

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
the image and you'll notice in the

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.660 
the image and you'll notice in the
primary<00:07:10.590> but<00:07:10.710> we<00:07:10.890> also<00:07:11.010> have<00:07:11.370> what<00:07:11.550> we<00:07:11.580> call

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:11.670 
primary but we also have what we call

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.790 
primary but we also have what we call
the<00:07:11.970> inflorescence<00:07:12.290> primordia<00:07:13.290> that<00:07:13.590> turned

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 
the inflorescence primordia that turned

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.120 
the inflorescence primordia that turned
into<00:07:13.950> the<00:07:14.070> bunches<00:07:14.780> in<00:07:15.780> the<00:07:16.200> following<00:07:16.500> season

into the bunches in the following season

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.560 
into the bunches in the following season
here<00:07:17.460> you've<00:07:17.610> got<00:07:17.790> one<00:07:17.970> in<00:07:18.090> fluorescence

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
here you've got one in fluorescence

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.140 
here you've got one in fluorescence
primordia<00:07:19.170> and<00:07:19.500> here's<00:07:19.980> another<00:07:20.250> and<00:07:20.550> in<00:07:21.060> the

very center is the apical meristem and

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.580 
very center is the apical meristem and
we<00:07:24.240> can<00:07:24.420> make<00:07:24.600> an<00:07:24.750> assessment<00:07:25.320> of<00:07:25.380> how

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
we can make an assessment of how

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:29.000 
we can make an assessment of how
fruitful<00:07:26.220> a<00:07:26.430> particular<00:07:27.260> vineyard<00:07:28.260> block<00:07:28.770> is

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
fruitful a particular vineyard block is

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.110 
fruitful a particular vineyard block is
by<00:07:29.340> doing<00:07:29.610> some<00:07:29.820> of<00:07:29.910> these<00:07:30.030> bug<00:07:30.330> dissections
