00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.120 

I<00:00:15.020> don't<00:00:16.020> know<00:00:16.110> what<00:00:16.289> kind<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.740> hooked<00:00:16.920> me<00:00:17.039> on

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
I don't know what kind of hooked me on

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.740 
I don't know what kind of hooked me on
my<00:00:17.250> watch<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.670> think<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.029> being<00:00:18.270> around<00:00:18.390> them

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
my watch I think just being around them

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.050 
my watch I think just being around them
when<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> was<00:00:19.590> brought<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:19.980> that's<00:00:20.700> all<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.939> ever

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
when I was brought up that's all I ever

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.080 
when I was brought up that's all I ever
knew<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:21.779> dad<00:00:22.230> always<00:00:22.470> had<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.770> bike<00:00:23.040> and<00:00:23.310> you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
knew my dad always had a bike and you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.940 
knew my dad always had a bike and you
know<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> mean<00:00:24.450> like<00:00:24.540> L<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.290> that<00:00:25.439> family<00:00:25.770> I

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
know I mean like L was in that family I

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.420 
know I mean like L was in that family I
screw<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.670> wanting<00:00:27.270> but<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.279> ever

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
screw up wanting but I think all I ever

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.889 
screw up wanting but I think all I ever
wanted<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.150> when<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.390> was<00:00:30.450> younger<00:00:30.599> was

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
wanted to do when I was younger was

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.330 
wanted to do when I was younger was
Drive<00:00:31.230> monster<00:00:31.619> trucks<00:00:31.829> and<00:00:31.980> ride<00:00:32.130> motocross

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
Drive monster trucks and ride motocross

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.000 
Drive monster trucks and ride motocross
so<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.149> got<00:00:33.750> halfway<00:00:33.930> there

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.639 

my<00:00:37.910> guess<00:00:38.089> is<00:00:38.120> crossing<00:00:38.690> over<00:00:38.809> from<00:00:38.870> racing

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
my guess is crossing over from racing

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.279 
my guess is crossing over from racing
tea<00:00:39.890> for<00:00:40.129> me<00:00:40.219> it<00:00:40.280> was<00:00:40.609> kind<00:00:40.789> of<00:00:40.879> easy<00:00:41.510> for<00:00:41.899> me<00:00:42.019> it

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
tea for me it was kind of easy for me it

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.920 
tea for me it was kind of easy for me it
was<00:00:42.440> definitely<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.769> lot<00:00:42.890> more<00:00:43.129> fun<00:00:43.930> riding

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
was definitely a lot more fun riding

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.349 
was definitely a lot more fun riding
proof<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:45.589> that<00:00:45.800> was<00:00:46.010> motocross<00:00:46.969> at<00:00:47.120> the<00:00:47.180> time

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
proof so that was motocross at the time

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.779 
proof so that was motocross at the time
but<00:00:48.229> yeah<00:00:48.409> and<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:48.890> kind<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.159> came<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:49.339> little

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
but yeah and it kind of came a little

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.139 
but yeah and it kind of came a little
bit<00:00:49.969> easier<00:00:50.329> like<00:00:50.870> I<00:00:51.379> didn't<00:00:51.829> really<00:00:52.159> try<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
bit easier like I didn't really try and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.029 
bit easier like I didn't really try and
I<00:00:53.210> kind<00:00:53.420> of<00:00:53.479> still<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:54.019> still<00:00:54.530> try<00:00:54.769> you<00:00:54.829> know

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
I kind of still I still try you know

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.219 
I kind of still I still try you know
real<00:00:55.640> hard<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.000> kind<00:00:56.629> of<00:00:56.719> there's<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.109> lot

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
real hard but kind of there's a lot

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.899 
real hard but kind of there's a lot
easier<00:00:57.500> for<00:00:57.649> me<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.769> do<00:00:58.250> good<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:58.549> freestyle

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
easier for me to do good and freestyle

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.729 
easier for me to do good and freestyle
then<00:00:59.030> everyone's<00:00:59.510> great<00:00:59.719> I<00:01:02.559> guess<00:01:03.559> with

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
then everyone's great I guess with

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.109 
then everyone's great I guess with
sports<00:01:04.039> like<00:01:04.189> this<00:01:04.339> it's<00:01:04.580> different<00:01:04.909> for

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
sports like this it's different for

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.300 
sports like this it's different for
everyone<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.479> know<00:01:05.509> like<00:01:05.799> some<00:01:06.799> people<00:01:07.159> can

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
everyone you know like some people can

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.279 
everyone you know like some people can
train<00:01:07.549> hard<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:08.060> not<00:01:08.270> have<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:08.539> much<00:01:08.689> like

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
train hard and not have it much like

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.590 
train hard and not have it much like
talent<00:01:09.920> as<00:01:10.039> others<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.640> still<00:01:11.090> do<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.450> good

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
talent as others and still do it's good

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.050 
talent as others and still do it's good
and<00:01:11.720> then<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:11.990> look<00:01:12.170> at<00:01:12.289> some<00:01:12.470> people<00:01:12.619> who

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
and then you look at some people who

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.789 
and then you look at some people who
don't<00:01:14.060> really<00:01:14.420> ride<00:01:14.960> much<00:01:15.229> at<00:01:15.409> all<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.679> then

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
don't really ride much at all and then

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.160 
don't really ride much at all and then
can<00:01:15.979> go<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.130> win<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.240> stuff<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:17.690> like<00:01:17.899> to<00:01:18.020> think

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
can go and win and stuff I like to think

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.330 
can go and win and stuff I like to think
I'm<00:01:18.289> kind<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:18.560> somewhere<00:01:18.799> in<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.979> middle<00:01:19.220> you

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
I'm kind of somewhere in the middle you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.520 
I'm kind of somewhere in the middle you
know<00:01:19.369> I've<00:01:19.880> spent<00:01:20.360> every<00:01:20.929> day<00:01:21.080> on<00:01:21.140> my<00:01:21.200> bike<00:01:21.500> but

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.410 
know I've spent every day on my bike but

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
then it definitely came a lot easier

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.120 
then it definitely came a lot easier
