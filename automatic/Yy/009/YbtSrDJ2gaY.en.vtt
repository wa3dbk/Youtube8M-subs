00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
can you guess what that is yes if you're

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.329 
can you guess what that is yes if you're
into<00:00:03.570> jeeps<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.080> neutral<00:00:04.620> safety<00:00:05.040> switches

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
and how much of a pain in the ass they

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.259 
and how much of a pain in the ass they
are<00:00:07.940> this<00:00:08.940> is<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> neutral<00:00:09.480> safety<00:00:10.019> switch<00:00:10.320> /

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
are this is a neutral safety switch /

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.990 
are this is a neutral safety switch /

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
neutral safety switch wire is when I

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.570 
neutral safety switch wire is when I
believe<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.600> backup<00:00:18.930> lights<00:00:19.140> and

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
believe is for the backup lights and

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.540 
believe is for the backup lights and
this<00:00:20.580> one<00:00:20.789> down<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.449> believe<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.769> run

this one down here I believe is for run
position<00:00:24.410> let's<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> look<00:00:26.930> and<00:00:27.930> I

start my problem is I'm doing a swap I'm
going<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.560> plug<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.640> two<00:01:17.970> wires<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going from this plug with two wires and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:27.749 
going from this plug with two wires and
two<00:01:19.409> prongs<00:01:19.740> female<00:01:20.340> end<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.799> plug

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.330 

I<00:01:27.789> think<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.990> plug<00:01:29.320> would<00:01:29.530> be<00:01:29.680> exactly<00:01:30.009> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
I think this plug would be exactly the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.679 
I think this plug would be exactly the
same<00:01:30.369> as<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:32.259> one<00:01:32.320> from<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.009> x-15<00:01:33.759> if<00:01:34.450> it

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
same as this one from the a x-15 if it

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.080 
same as this one from the a x-15 if it
never<00:01:34.930> had<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.350> center<00:01:35.770> pin<00:01:36.009> for<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.759> neutral

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
never had the center pin for the neutral

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.600 
never had the center pin for the neutral
safety<00:01:37.299> switch<00:01:37.750> because<00:01:38.020> this<00:01:39.009> is<00:01:39.280> also

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
safety switch because this is also

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.760 
safety switch because this is also
plugged<00:01:39.939> in<00:01:40.090> inside<00:01:40.929> of<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.140> transmission

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
plugged in inside of the transmission

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.169 
plugged in inside of the transmission

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
when you shift the gear lever at a

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.450 
when you shift the gear lever at a
certain<00:01:43.509> place<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.990> reverse<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:45.069> touches<00:01:45.429> a

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.539 
see and in terms of reverse light zone
and<00:01:51.219> I'm<00:01:51.789> guessing<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.299> bottom<00:01:52.630> one<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:53.549> these

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
and I'm guessing the bottom one is these

and I'm guessing the bottom one is these
division<00:01:55.179> switch<00:01:55.420> output<00:01:55.829> I'm<00:01:56.829> not<00:01:57.159> sure

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
division switch output I'm not sure

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.160 
division switch output I'm not sure
that's<00:01:57.909> my<00:01:58.210> guess<00:01:58.479> on<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:01.179> wiring<00:02:01.390> harness<00:02:01.929> on

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
that's my guess on the wiring harness on

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.859 
that's my guess on the wiring harness on
my<00:02:02.590> Jeep<00:02:02.860> there's<00:02:03.670> three<00:02:03.939> wires<00:02:04.149> of<00:02:04.450> course<00:02:04.689> 1

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
my Jeep there's three wires of course 1

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.190 
my Jeep there's three wires of course 1
2<00:02:04.990> 3<00:02:05.229> because<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.470> had<00:02:05.679> an<00:02:05.799> automatic<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.509> I'm

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
2 3 because I had an automatic so I'm

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
2 3 because I had an automatic so I'm
going<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.470> cut<00:02:08.739> them<00:02:09.869> take<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.049> outer<00:02:11.230> two

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
going to cut them take the outer two

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.770 
going to cut them take the outer two
spliced<00:02:13.900> off<00:02:14.170> course<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.799> solder<00:02:15.370> them<00:02:15.780> to

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
spliced off course and solder them to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.140 
spliced off course and solder them to
that<00:02:16.989> out<00:02:17.230> or<00:02:17.380> two<00:02:17.500> wires<00:02:17.769> or<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.700> two<00:02:18.940> wires

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
that out or two wires or the two wires

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.660 
that out or two wires or the two wires
to<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.510> one<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:21.660> then<00:02:23.160> I'm<00:02:24.160> going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> take

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
to this one and then I'm going to take

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.809 
to this one and then I'm going to take

work one plate does that's why I'm

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.110 
work one plate does that's why I'm
making<00:02:42.130> this<00:02:42.220> video<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:42.730> can<00:02:42.850> get<00:02:42.970> your

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
path here I'm looking up on Jeep forum

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.670 
path here I'm looking up on Jeep forum
and<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.739> forth<00:02:51.209> down<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.329> diagram<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.440> one

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and so forth down this diagram this one

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.300 
and so forth down this diagram this one
is<00:02:53.799> 401<00:02:57.600> all<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:59.079> know<00:02:59.200> is<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.470> have<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.680> ground

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
is 401 all I know is I have to ground

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.280 
is 401 all I know is I have to ground
the<00:03:00.549> center<00:03:00.910> wire<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:01.840> outer<00:03:02.019> two<00:03:02.260> I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the center wire and the outer two I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.250 
the center wire and the outer two I
think<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.980> join<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> other

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
think I have to join to the other

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.229 
think I have to join to the other
connector<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.069> if<00:03:06.190> that's<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.549> case<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:07.090> is

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
connector and if that's the case that is

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.699 
connector and if that's the case that is
another<00:03:07.480> thing<00:03:07.720> that's<00:03:07.870> not<00:03:08.139> mentioned<00:03:08.590> on
