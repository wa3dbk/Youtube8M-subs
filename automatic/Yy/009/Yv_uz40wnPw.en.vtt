 I don't know the shell of the mouth below 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 teeth like that's similar to the human 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.899
 any kind of mutation well like i never 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.200

 Orlovka just gasped for nothing like 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.079

 gorynych and in armor experienced experts in 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.360
 scientific reference books did not find anything 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 similar had to turn to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.229
 overseas encyclopedia mutants 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.479
 the only thing discovered and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.000
 amazing coincidence but in our 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.950
 opinion this 3 drops 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.509
 Is it just armored or kolchuzhny 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.409

 Panama is there this kind of usual but we 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 of course the find it represents

 moles extreme rarity amazon monster 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.670
 in the waters of the Don according to the fisherman Nikolay 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.280
 potapova what he caught is not 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.930
 similar to tropical fish 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.320
 showed it in amazon are found there and in 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.899
 South Africa is something completely different 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.420
 this fish is a mutant and nothing else 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.590
 Nicholas assures the young man there 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.960
 weighty argument 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.000
 because this spring he caught another in the river 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.210
 astounding 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.810
 here itself to this from which poplohelo 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.530
 he caught the most yellow color 4 whiskers 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.300
 bottom 4 top all spikes and here it is 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.790
 he was pricked first, he sang with a 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.440
 then hand to shoulder some miracle after 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.830
 that fishing was cured 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.720
 tells the young man that in 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.730
 Genetic Mutants Bred in the River 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.100
 local fishermen reported to all authorities 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.620
 but to no avail I have repeatedly 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.690
 addressed the lab in the MCH in 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.340
 the lab turned but the girl says 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.440
 what do you want the water so menacing 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.690
 as if the cesspool stinks seems already 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.209
 the authorities have no doubt that the monsters in the river 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.860
 arise because of toxic waste which 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.590
 dumped in dong industrial 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.520
 businesses fishermen are desperate who 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.709
 will protect the beloved issue from those mutants 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.900
 time Voronezh zoologists continue 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.630
 insist on this being in 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.520
 the shell is only Amazonian fish 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.680
 for fun could release but he 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.140
 lovers of exotic living creatures say 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.950
 researchers however fishermen and this is not 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.930
 soothes 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.180
 and what if a predatory alien 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.310
 acclimatized in these waters and will begin 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.080
 to multiply rapidly Alexander
