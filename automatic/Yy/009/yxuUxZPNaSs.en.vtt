00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.680
 and now the effect is back "super awesome" 5 points of his confession 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 it is the second time that I would at that point percent as the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.629
 maybe last shot noticed is not with too much anymore 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.409
 been at this point 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.880
 and the Attensam was the TV Verl's neck broken 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.720
 and then everything has to be done again and lecturers 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.839
 yes that had been boring so quiet 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.250
 different business 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.179
 Percent fought and percent 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.369
 now I'm here 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.369
 and pretext for me back 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 both continue now 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 but missed 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000
 I have to get in there 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.190
 have fun 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.510
 to do the reindeer for the time being on your own 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 I had the best advice 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 Thank you that is visible in the Munich 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.300
 in the poetry that's different to Karben 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.740
 I told myself 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.259
 only the Master of Disaster on the practical forward is the one 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.280
 which height 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.020
 Dr 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.030
 In addition, calls make me hope so now Fitch 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.030
 the Stuttgarter sat down Werder again can get involved 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.750
 Reason is the man can disappear for a moment 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.900
 and sermons are not 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.530
 Gutbrod product 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.530
 Lehmann now is the question is not always the easiest 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.900
 where is damned 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.500
 I'll try it 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 Vitali in Business Class 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.229
 on the internet so now I have my complete and liveliness 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.810
 40 and again from the inside to get to know 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.460
 Aha the show shows 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.380
 pm 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 learn and now climb my abilities 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.640
 Michèle Montas and ten tenth FP 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.240
 But let him tell you that we do not want you now 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.229
 Inform the judge 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.009
 that would not be good for me 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.359
 I stop too much to endure so many phone calls through the place 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.669
 many by again 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.669
 or needs us 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.959
 yes, that 's the way it was and so made for the 4th 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.330
 create the diverse 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330
 what stole that for a congratulatory 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.959
 certain again and now that's up to you 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.379
 they know that I am dying 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.989
 full of gear have enough 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.819
 so first experienced the Master of Disaster 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.299
 because only hurt 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.409
 because he no money new people back 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.219
 Broder to it 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.219
 Schönherr met all three 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.639
 so had to 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.609
 so and not otherwise 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.609
 yes doing this stinging business center 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.419
 Sand loans slightly flattened the job Hoffenheim 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.069
 Percent collapsed he summed up Blettner 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:26.319
 go to the SPD 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.429
 to 4 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.649
 yes, the alarm will be triggered again 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:34.779
 so costs 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:38.379
 and it makes me happy to receive actual slow-motion work 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:39.659
 made 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.269
 Michael Grenzach 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.279
 as Adrian Sutil drives sovereign 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.859
 meditate and percent 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.559
 as in the last episode 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.559
 I am satisfied then we are not equal to every stage of life 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.719
 and he should do that too 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.929
 because then on the wrong man alone gives the fight then won 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.939
 okay that from Reckermann 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.939
 Benz should do just as well 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.229
 he has experienced two of her that is very difficult 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.379
 let me out of here 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.829
 Sauce such on the year together 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.919
 yes picking up course is a nice thing for the fifth always 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.489
 still 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.330
 Münster wants 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.849
 after exactly that it will be a weapon aimed at them 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.569
 she can do the deal I think lions 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.469
 I'll write that in a minute 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.180
 because I just runs to the final opponent me so Bolt 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.860
 the secret number 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.330
 Gelsenkirchen 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
 «Bravo hits» Euro a hit but no hit a relative 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.449
 that was it 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.979
 accompany 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.689
 Trappenkamp for nine days 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.800
 it should delete data we 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.439
 Connect per year 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.429
 not only do not I just want their 100 entry cost anything 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.039
 simply because weight 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.979
 the Cartagena space 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.430
 I am 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.960
 Here immediately a team in the whole awaken and if he now catch up so 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.509
 that he could not use and the other was up there 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:21.499
 Werder stood Euro 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:26.300
 stood around and stood by regulars clean because he stood out there 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.559
 the general tenor 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:31.360
 we have 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.469
 220 won 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.189
 With 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.729
 Einsatzwagen 300 we have won 200 that's a positive balance 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.360
 but it was from the East that must go on 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.819
 but I think so 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.979
 at least it would be a possibility that I would like more from Mo 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.979
 pro must act 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.349
 as she already 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.139
 that was really cool Schloßstr 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.500
 because he knows how to describe 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.900
 that is inadmissible 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.100
 Actually, I did not want to lust so as heir of Tarzan it kept coming back 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.809
 so be the key to success 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:16.620
 I think 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.620
 I have to go up here 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.249
 not further 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 there are no more 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.460
 maybe about it 

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.999
 Yes, there is no such thing as curling in the trench 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.080
 around the back with sensors 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.830
 Rosendahl could be in this 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.539
 Dr October 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.499
 the ARD perspective we want 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:55.609
 I think you will probably everyone can visit here dpa 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.080
 what is that is that shows up in easy of it 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.349
 to continue here 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:05.249
 because the Greens obviously looks like that 

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:08.439
 could you pass on the right shoes prince 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:12.749
 and that we survived 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.539
 Bockhorn granted not quite a bit scared 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.059
 the man wanted to get going 

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:23.059
 because 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:26.330
 yes you can not just perfect a crime 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.800
 when in the game 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.449
 No, I did not want him 

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.159
 Nergal 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:33.800
 Heckhoff and Michalski a focus 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.800
 because even comes very convenient 

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:40.830
 the store is the fifth most important 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.729
 a good omen yes 

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:48.009
 I think that fits very well Schmitz also is his claws because of it 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:51.289
 because i am here on over the episodes and now i should dare i would like to 

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:51.860
 again 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.590
 worked out for social research and it should
