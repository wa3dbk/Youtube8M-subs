bring it over to be I'm always taking
from<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.060> outside<00:02:05.510> sections<00:02:06.050> of<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.530> two

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
from the outside sections of the two

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.070 
from the outside sections of the two
pieces<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.130> hair<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:08.330> you're<00:02:08.539> always<00:02:08.720> taking

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
pieces of hair so you're always taking

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.280 
pieces of hair so you're always taking
from<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.590> furthest<00:02:10.009> away<00:02:10.190> from<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.670> middle

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
from the furthest away from the middle

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.120 
from the furthest away from the middle
so<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:13.159> had<00:02:14.030> brought<00:02:14.389> a<00:02:14.420> piece<00:02:14.870> from<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
so I just had brought a piece from a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.590 
so I just had brought a piece from a
to<00:02:16.310> be<00:02:16.430> now<00:02:16.700> I'm<00:02:16.820> going<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.240> from<00:02:17.480> the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
to be now I'm going to go from the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.510 
to be now I'm going to go from the
outside<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.410> B<00:02:19.510> bring<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.630> over<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:24.520> outside

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
outside of B bring it over to a outside

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.410 
outside of B bring it over to a outside
of<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.970> over<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.780> be<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:28.640> takes<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.030> little<00:02:29.210> bit

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
of a over to be just takes a little bit

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.630 
of a over to be just takes a little bit
of<00:02:29.480> time<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:30.740> develop<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.420> braid<00:02:33.640> B

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
of time to develop this this braid B

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.520 
of time to develop this this braid B
over<00:02:35.060> 2a<00:02:35.210> a<00:02:39.400> over<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.520> be<00:02:41.170> once<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.290> get<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
over 2a a over to be once you get the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.310 
over 2a a over to be once you get the
hang<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.280> does<00:02:43.640> go<00:02:43.880> a<00:02:43.910> lot<00:02:44.180> quicker<00:02:44.320> but

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
hang of it it does go a lot quicker but

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.720 
hang of it it does go a lot quicker but
at<00:02:45.440> first<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.860> definitely<00:02:46.340> will<00:02:46.490> take<00:02:46.700> a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
at first it definitely will take a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.090 
at first it definitely will take a
little<00:02:46.970> bit<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.240> time<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:49.100> just<00:02:49.280> try<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.640> out

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
little bit of time so just try it out

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.330 
little bit of time so just try it out
make<00:02:52.100> sure<00:02:52.130> you're<00:02:52.490> not<00:02:52.550> taking<00:02:53.060> too<00:02:53.240> thick<00:02:53.450> of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
make sure you're not taking too thick of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.710 
make sure you're not taking too thick of
sections<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:55.820> I'm<00:02:56.120> going<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.330> take<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.540> little

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
sections so I'm going to take a little

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.050 
sections so I'm going to take a little
bit<00:02:57.020> from<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.850> bring<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:58.970> over<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.270> be<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:01.520> just

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
bit from a bring it over to be and just

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.770 
bit from a bring it over to be and just
keep<00:03:02.330> doing<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.750> all<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.020> way<00:03:03.140> down<00:03:04.720> okay<00:03:05.720> so

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
keep doing this all the way down okay so

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.830 
keep doing this all the way down okay so
I<00:03:05.990> have<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.770> fish<00:03:06.980> tail<00:03:07.610> braid<00:03:08.000> done<00:03:08.360> as<00:03:08.660> you

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I have the fish tail braid done as you

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.030 
I have the fish tail braid done as you
can<00:03:08.990> see<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.430> I'm<00:03:10.640> leaving<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:11.090> few<00:03:11.330> inches<00:03:12.040> at

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
can see and I'm leaving a few inches at

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.890 
can see and I'm leaving a few inches at
the<00:03:13.280> end<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.030> have<00:03:14.240> something<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.690> work

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
the end so that I have something to work

up<00:04:03.520> one<00:04:04.520> other<00:04:04.640> thing<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:05.180> like<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.390> do<00:04:05.720> is<00:04:06.020> just

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
up one other thing I like to do is just

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.650 
up one other thing I like to do is just
run<00:04:06.980> my<00:04:07.810> skoochy<00:04:08.810> brush<00:04:09.050> over<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:10.040> braid<00:04:10.660> hold

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
run my skoochy brush over the braid hold

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.330 
run my skoochy brush over the braid hold
it<00:04:11.840> tight<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:13.420> just<00:04:14.420> gives<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.990> even<00:04:15.320> more<00:04:16.220> of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
it tight and just gives it even more of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.640 
it tight and just gives it even more of
a<00:04:16.430> messy<00:04:16.820> look<00:04:17.090> I'm<00:04:17.450> going<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:17.989> spray<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.560> a

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
a messy look I'm going to spray it a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.950 
a messy look I'm going to spray it a
little<00:04:18.859> bit<00:04:19.160> just<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:20.660> a<00:04:20.720> little<00:04:20.930> bit<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.380> hold
