00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.070 
leaderboards will now track all kills
deaths<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.460> assist<00:01:23.790> properly<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.990> I'm

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
deaths and assist properly so I'm

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.140 
deaths and assist properly so I'm
guessing<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.100> sometimes<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
guessing that you know sometimes when it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.550 
guessing that you know sometimes when it
you<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> kill<00:01:27.659> streak<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:28.080> something<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you got a kill streak or something it

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
you got a kill streak or something it
wouldn't<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:29.130> record<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:29.909> even<00:01:30.180> your

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
wouldn't really record that or even your

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.789 
wouldn't really record that or even your
win<00:01:30.570> straight<00:01:30.810> i<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:31.200> win<00:01:31.409> streaks<00:01:31.650> at

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
win straight i think my win streaks at

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.940 
win straight i think my win streaks at
three<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.869> truly<00:01:34.140> at<00:01:34.350> around<00:01:34.560> twenty

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
three but it it's truly at around twenty

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
three but it it's truly at around twenty
or<00:01:35.070> something<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.509> know

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
or something like that because you know

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.830 
or something like that because you know
it's<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> broken<00:01:37.320> right<00:01:37.530> now<00:01:38.720> next<00:01:39.720> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it's kind of broken right now next is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.780 
it's kind of broken right now next is
the<00:01:39.900> additional<00:01:40.740> fine<00:01:41.040> tuning<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> audio

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the additional fine tuning of audio

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.630 
the additional fine tuning of audio
levels<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.240> ranges<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:42.869> footsteps<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.859 
audio levels or bomb planners and
diffusers<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> big<00:01:48.720> thing

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
diffusers now this is a big thing

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.719 
diffusers now this is a big thing
because<00:01:49.079> in<00:01:49.320> surgeon<00:01:49.590> destroy<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.100> headset<00:01:50.549> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
because in surgeon destroy a headset is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.910 
because in surgeon destroy a headset is
very<00:01:51.110> important<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> hear<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> bomb<00:01:52.649> being

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
very important to hear the bomb being

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.069 
very important to hear the bomb being
diffused<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.899> can't

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
diffused because you really just can't

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.270 
diffused because you really just can't
hear<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> bombing<00:01:55.649> diffuse<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> be

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
hear the bombing diffuse you have to be

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.429 
hear the bombing diffuse you have to be
pretty<00:01:56.490> much<00:01:56.700> looking<00:01:57.420> at<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> bomb<00:01:57.930> which<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
pretty much looking at the bomb which a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.520 
pretty much looking at the bomb which a
lot<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> times<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> killed<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.820> also

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
lot of times can get you killed and also

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.510 
lot of times can get you killed and also
you're<00:02:01.530> gonna<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.740> able<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.950> hear<00:02:02.070> need<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> pro

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you're gonna be able to hear need to pro

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.770 
you're gonna be able to hear need to pro
a<00:02:02.549> lot<00:02:02.790> better<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.240> i'm<00:02:03.299> hoping<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.570> they're

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a lot better and i'm hoping that they're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.179 
a lot better and i'm hoping that they're
going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.930> tune<00:02:04.140> down<00:02:04.320> some<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> audio

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
going to tune down some of the audio

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.700 
going to tune down some of the audio
even<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.060> wmd<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.110> huge<00:02:07.380> train

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
even like on wmd there's a huge train

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
even like on wmd there's a huge train
and<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.129> hear<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.459> across<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> map

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and you can hear from across the map

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.510 
and you can hear from across the map
which<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.989> irritating<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.709> mean<00:02:11.280> it's

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
which is kind of irritating I mean it's

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.800 
which is kind of irritating I mean it's
alright<00:02:11.910> if<00:02:12.030> you're<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.360> next<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
alright if you're right next to the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.309 
alright if you're right next to the
train<00:02:13.050> but

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
train but

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.319 
train but
be<00:02:13.409> only<00:02:13.560> across<00:02:13.859> the<00:02:14.069> map<00:02:14.219> I<00:02:14.400> kind<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.209> think

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
be only across the map I kind of think

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.569 
be only across the map I kind of think
it's<00:02:15.480> wrong<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.890> also<00:02:17.129> there's<00:02:17.459> any

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
it's wrong now also there's any

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.220 
it's wrong now also there's any
additional<00:02:17.999> online<00:02:18.150> security<00:02:18.659> inhabitants

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
additional online security inhabitants

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.289
