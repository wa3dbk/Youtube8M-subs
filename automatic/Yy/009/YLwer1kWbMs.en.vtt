00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:11.880
 and very good to all the kids and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 urban ball v2 and we return with 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.890
 another chapter to recreate a goal 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.380
 Well, there are those of you who are 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.039
 sevilla and good and very much other people 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.660
 more will remember this goal simply 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.609
 it will have the retina simply with 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.849
 have seen the title not the goal of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.510
 palop to be so good there I leave you os 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.010
 I leave the goal worth the real goal as it was 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.579
 good as you can see dani alves 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.079
 He was still a player of Sevilla FC and is 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 the person in charge of centering 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.899
 that ball so that palop takes care of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.539
 finish it good is one so there is no 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.539
 seen this series tried to recreate a goal 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.120
 in fifa 14 it's ok or you tried to catch a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.129
 goal that has been historical or that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.820
 has been with the host of bonito the goal 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.680
 and try to recreate it not as faithfully 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.870
 possible I know that there will always be 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.270
 many failures such as equipment 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.270
 the positions do not 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 I do not know exactly the same way 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.460
 not all players I will not walk 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.530
 putting all the players of the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.390
 set but if for example then that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.000
 so keep in mind who focuses who 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.429
 finish where to finish in what way 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.380
 finish against what team is that in plays 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:29.869
 outside who plays at home and has seen 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.390
 that the score in the 90th minute was 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 221 losing seville now it's minute 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.429
 90 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.289
 good go ties and good I'll leave the 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.750
 comparative of the two goals as it says 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.220
 the previous time say good to the way 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.500
 this match had ended with this 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.840
 same result 22 so this is the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.689
 return tied at 2 with that goal of palop 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.009
 in the minute 90 in extremis in the minute 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.630
 93 applies specifically and at minute 105 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.030
 of the extension 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.840
 chevantón would take care of well then of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.989
 to aim and to make it happen 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.229
 these eighths of the europa league el el 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:13.260
 sevilla this was in the year 2007 you see 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.299
 well i'm at your a 14 not me like 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.760
 I have dani alves that I have pierced 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.239
 al del barzón al sevilla as a topping of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.340
 head and well then this is the goal that 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.560
 marked me 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.080
 now I am going to leave you as I have done well 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.099
 Well, as I have done as the previous one says 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.480
 Once with the goal of maxi I will leave you 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.510
 Well, it 's just a little comparative 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.700
 so you can see the two goals at once 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.459
 Trying as faithfully as possible 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.549
 you can not do that the two goals 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.060
 fit so that you see more then in the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.819
 I hope that if any of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.330
 you get to score some goal 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.310
 this one of this style then hey that I 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.829
 tell him to pass it to me if he feels like it 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.900
 all I ask is that it be in 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.390
 hd and what the hell that things that have 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.069
 relationship and that resemble not a goal with 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 the other 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.480
 and I will then put it and with much 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.760
 very much pleasure if you can not or not 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.129
 want to participate in that way you can 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.670
 participate by leaving me in the comments 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.129
 that we would like you to recreate worth 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.349
 goals that are impossible or that 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.060
 you believe that they are impossible 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.430
 it will depend on me to put on the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.319
 goal that is I will try to do it then 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.810

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.639

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.819

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.260

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.329
 greeting everyone 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.699

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.530
 the match ends marco palop in a 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.419
 I corner is the title 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.069
 treasures a team in its showcase is the 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.840
 effort to be very short that in 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.389
 Glory is curiosity I'll stop you 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.760

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.379
 munitis and the racing of santander 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.719
 julen warrior made vibrate in san 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.719
