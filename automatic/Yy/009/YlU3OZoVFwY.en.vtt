what<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.770> compare<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.720> loot<00:01:33.720> crate<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
what to compare it to loot crate is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.350 
what to compare it to loot crate is
probably<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> most<00:01:35.070> popular<00:01:35.820> i<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.210> this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
probably the most popular i think this

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.719 
probably the most popular i think this
is<00:01:36.540> smaller<00:01:36.810> than<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> loot<00:01:37.229> crate<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:38.040> i'm<00:01:38.280> not

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
is smaller than a loot crate but i'm not

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.160 
is smaller than a loot crate but i'm not
actually<00:01:38.909> subscribed<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.659> loot<00:01:39.810> crate<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.140> i

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
actually subscribed to loot crate so i

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.929 
actually subscribed to loot crate so i
don't<00:01:40.530> know<00:01:40.799> i<00:01:40.829> also<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.549> cheaper

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
don't know i also think it's cheaper

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.550 
don't know i also think it's cheaper
than<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> loot<00:01:42.270> crate<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.229> might<00:01:43.380> want<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
than a loot crate so you might want to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.980 
than a loot crate so you might want to
keep<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.890> mind<00:01:44.100> anyways<00:01:45.090> first<00:01:45.780> things

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
keep that in mind anyways first things

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.630 
keep that in mind anyways first things
first<00:01:46.079> let's<00:01:46.409> look<00:01:46.560> at<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.040> exclusive

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
first let's look at the exclusive

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.719 
first let's look at the exclusive
t-shirt<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:49.290> says<00:01:49.619> fight<00:01:50.340> fight

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
t-shirt so this says fight fight

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.690 
t-shirt so this says fight fight
revolution<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.899> got<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.770> picture<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.579> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
revolution it's got a picture of I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.249 
revolution it's got a picture of I
believe<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.299> Ryu<00:01:54.750> from<00:01:54.780> Street<00:01:54.990> Fighter

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
believe that's Ryu from Street Fighter

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679 
believe that's Ryu from Street Fighter
on<00:01:55.560> top<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.950> ddr<00:01:56.520> pad<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.570> actually

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
on top of a ddr pad which is actually

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.899 
on top of a ddr pad which is actually
pretty<00:01:57.869> funny<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:59.250> obviously<00:01:59.520> they're

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
pretty funny because obviously they're

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.899 
pretty funny because obviously they're
both<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.409> majorly<00:02:01.409> popular<00:02:02.070> arcade<00:02:02.250> titles

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
both like majorly popular arcade titles

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.749 
both like majorly popular arcade titles
so<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:04.020> pretty<00:02:04.200> cool<00:02:04.409> um<00:02:04.740> they're<00:02:05.610> only

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
so that's pretty cool um they're only

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
so that's pretty cool um they're only
play<00:02:06.000> street<00:02:06.299> fighter<00:02:06.329> too<00:02:06.689> much<00:02:06.869> myself<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
play street fighter too much myself so

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.770 
play street fighter too much myself so
I'm<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.829> sure<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:08.220> real<00:02:08.489> pretty<00:02:09.360> sure<00:02:09.660> it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
I'm not sure that's real pretty sure it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.660 
I'm not sure that's real pretty sure it
is<00:02:09.899> though<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.530> played<00:02:10.800> ddr<00:02:11.250> though<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.640> I

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
is though I have played ddr though so I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
is though I have played ddr though so I
know<00:02:11.760> what<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.150> um<00:02:12.540> CDRs<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:13.170> lot<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.410> fun

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
know what that is um CDRs a lot of fun

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.970 
know what that is um CDRs a lot of fun
although<00:02:13.709> I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
although I

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.309 
although I
probably<00:02:14.340> never<00:02:14.489> play<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.970> where<00:02:15.569> anyone<00:02:16.080> can

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
probably never play it where anyone can

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.880 
probably never play it where anyone can
see<00:02:16.709> me<00:02:16.890> um<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:18.780> being<00:02:19.019> said<00:02:19.319> what<00:02:19.530> else<00:02:19.739> we

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
see me um that being said what else we

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.979 
see me um that being said what else we
have<00:02:19.920> um<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.409> bauble<00:02:23.190> buds<00:02:23.629> it's<00:02:24.629> super

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
have um this is a bauble buds it's super

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.350 
have um this is a bauble buds it's super
street<00:02:25.349> fighter<00:02:25.379> for<00:02:26.099> round<00:02:26.610> two<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.209> guess

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
street fighter for round two so I guess

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.140 
street fighter for round two so I guess
there<00:02:27.540> was<00:02:27.659> like<00:02:27.690> um<00:02:28.519> different<00:02:29.519> like<00:02:29.640> rounds

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
there was like um different like rounds

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.199 
there was like um different like rounds
of<00:02:30.239> these<00:02:30.420> uh<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.410> looks<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.129> be<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:33.030> of

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
of these uh it looks like to be a one of

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.210 
of these uh it looks like to be a one of
four<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> think<00:02:34.379> they<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:34.769> like<00:02:34.980> put<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
four so I think they just like put a

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.000 
four so I think they just like put a
random<00:02:35.610> one<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.879> here<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.830> here's<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
random one in here and here's like the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.830 
random one in here and here's like the
different<00:02:38.370> for<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.299> get<00:02:39.599> on<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
different for that you can get on the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.059 
different for that you can get on the
back<00:02:40.019> there<00:02:40.260> hopefully<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.680> guys<00:02:40.739> can<00:02:40.799> see

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
back there hopefully you guys can see

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.030 
back there hopefully you guys can see
them<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> camera<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.299> we<00:02:43.140> got<00:02:43.379> guile<00:02:43.739> which

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
guiles theme goes with everything but

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.720 
guiles theme goes with everything but
yeah<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.680> sort<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.069> see<00:02:50.220> what<00:02:50.370> he<00:02:50.489> looks

like<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.120> pretty<00:02:51.299> sure<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.629> took<00:02:51.690> him

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
like and I'm pretty sure if I took him

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.960 
like and I'm pretty sure if I took him
out<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.079> here<00:02:52.349> he's<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> head<00:02:53.489> would<00:02:53.790> be

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
out of here he's a head would be

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.809 
out of here he's a head would be
bobbling<00:02:54.660> around<00:02:54.750> but<00:02:55.230> he's<00:02:55.769> nice<00:02:56.129> and<00:02:56.160> snug

imagine might be magnetized or like so

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.849 
imagine might be magnetized or like so
you<00:03:54.989> might<00:03:55.109> be<00:03:55.139> holistic<00:03:55.349> this<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.739> your

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
you might be holistic this on your

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.229 
you might be holistic this on your
fridge<00:03:56.099> or<00:03:56.430> might<00:03:56.609> be<00:03:56.730> one<00:03:56.879> of<00:03:56.940> those<00:03:57.000> things

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
fridge or might be one of those things

anything<00:04:02.340> metal<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.790> can<00:04:02.819> actually<00:04:03.090> stick<00:04:03.510> well

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
anything metal I can actually stick well

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.930 
anything metal I can actually stick well
I<00:04:03.660> mean<00:04:04.220> no<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:05.459> not<00:04:05.549> really<00:04:05.790> metal

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
so not really sure if it's magnetic or

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.680 
so not really sure if it's magnetic or
not<00:04:13.829> but<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.609> decal<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.120> sorts<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.569> might
