they<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.280> indented<00:01:11.990> they're<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
they are indented they're not like the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.020 
they are indented they're not like the
standard<00:01:13.770> black<00:01:14.130> ones<00:01:14.460> where<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.000> the

little grooves on them these are
indented<00:01:16.740> indented<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.150> more

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
indented indented so they have more

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.929

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
comfortable a better grip feel to them

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.090 
comfortable a better grip feel to them
then<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.630> also<00:01:21.780> has<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.380> transforming

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
then they also has the transforming

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
then they also has the transforming
d-pad<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> allows<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.299> flip<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.810> back<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
d-pad it allows you to flip it back and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
d-pad it allows you to flip it back and
forth<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.610> right<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:26.790> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
forth like I'm going to do right here so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.260 
forth like I'm going to do right here so
as<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.790> turn<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> like

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
as you can see if I just turn it like

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.770 
as you can see if I just turn it like
that<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.490> stock<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.570> turn

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that now it is just stock and if I turn

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.490 
that now it is just stock and if I turn
it<00:01:33.960> again<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:36.000> raised<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.229> allows

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it again it is raised up so that allows

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.789 
it again it is raised up so that allows
better<00:01:37.770> accuracy<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.840> also<00:01:40.049> has<00:01:40.500> on

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
better accuracy and then it also has on

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.060 
better accuracy and then it also has on
