various ways that you can use active web

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.080 
various ways that you can use active web
but<00:00:56.100> we're<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.610> something<00:00:56.820> else

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
but we're going to do something else

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.990 
but we're going to do something else
right<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.230> why<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.980> build<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.579> timer

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
right now so why don't we build a timer

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840 
right now so why don't we build a timer
server<00:01:00.559> basically<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:01.980> server<00:01:02.250> time

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
server basically a time server time

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.189 
server basically a time server time
server<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.239> something<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.719> serves<00:01:03.930> time

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
server is something that serves time

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
server is something that serves time
something<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.010> simple<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.760> let's<00:01:05.790> just

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
something very very simple so let's just

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
something very very simple so let's just
say<00:01:06.270> let's<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.930> type<00:01:07.170> time<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> course

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
say let's just type time and of course

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.480 
say let's just type time and of course
we're<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.350> 404<00:01:10.860> researched<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
we're going to get a 404 researched and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.490 
we're going to get a 404 researched and
found<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.939> most<00:01:12.210> importantly<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
found but most importantly we see this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.469 
found but most importantly we see this
class<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.950> found<00:01:14.070> exception<00:01:14.460> time<00:01:15.060> control

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
class and found exception time control

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
class and found exception time control
so<00:01:16.320> let's<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> add<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> time<00:01:17.369> controller

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so let's go and add that time controller

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.679 
so let's go and add that time controller
on<00:01:18.030> fly<00:01:19.009> controllers<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:21.439> new<00:01:22.439> Java<00:01:22.890> class<00:01:26.689> okay

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
on fly controllers a new Java class okay

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.830 
on fly controllers a new Java class okay
ten<00:01:28.080> controllers<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:29.329> let's<00:01:30.329> refresh<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
ten controllers there let's refresh the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740 
ten controllers there let's refresh the
page<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.579> we<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> 404<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> different

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
page and we get a 404 but a different

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
page and we get a 404 but a different
exception<00:01:34.170> basically<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.490> saying

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
exception basically this one is saying

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240 
exception basically this one is saying
that<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.240> time<00:01:36.990> control<00:01:37.350> exists<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.100> it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that the time control exists but it's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.950 
that the time control exists but it's
not<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> controller<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
not really a controller because it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.350 
not really a controller because it
didn't<00:01:40.290> inherit<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> app<00:01:40.860> control<00:01:41.360> lets

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360

first<00:02:23.550> page<00:02:23.880> finally<00:02:24.630> found<00:02:24.810> exception<00:02:25.110> time

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
first page finally found exception time

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.560 
first page finally found exception time
index<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.040> teal<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.820> we're<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.390> to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
index of teal so we're going to have to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.170 
index of teal so we're going to have to
add<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.960> corresponding<00:02:28.680> view<00:02:28.980> for<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:32.180> for

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
add a corresponding view for this for

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.520 
add a corresponding view for this for
this<00:02:33.320> action

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
this action

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.650 
this action
the<00:02:35.040> views<00:02:35.340> are<00:02:35.400> located<00:02:35.910> under<00:02:36.210> web<00:02:36.420> length

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the views are located under web length

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.340 
the views are located under web length
views<00:02:37.320> and<00:02:38.210> there<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.420> see<00:02:39.630> subdirectories

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
views and there you see subdirectories

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.780 
views and there you see subdirectories
that<00:02:40.530> correspond<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.980> controller<00:02:41.370> names

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
that correspond to controller names

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.820 
that correspond to controller names
so<00:02:42.300> obviously<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:43.080> need<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.350> create<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> new

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
so obviously we need to create a new

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.690 
so obviously we need to create a new
director<00:02:44.400> here<00:02:44.640> call<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> time<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:47.130> we

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
director here call a time and then we

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.740 
director here call a time and then we
are<00:02:47.760> going<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.240> add<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.780> new<00:02:49.140> file<00:02:50.100> here<00:02:50.750> index

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
are going to add a new file here index

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.300 
are going to add a new file here index
dot<00:02:52.260> TPL

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
dot TPL

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.450 
dot TPL
the<00:02:53.820> name<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.210> file<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:56.040> represent

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
the name of the file that the represent

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.400 
the name of the file that the represent
of<00:02:56.580> view<00:02:56.760> also<00:02:57.600> corresponds<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.260> name<00:02:58.380> of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
of view also corresponds to the name of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.860 
of view also corresponds to the name of
the<00:02:58.530> action<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:58.980> was<00:02:59.280> executed<00:02:59.520> that's<00:03:00.420> one

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
the action that was executed that's one

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.940 
the action that was executed that's one
of<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.170> many<00:03:01.890> active<00:03:02.460> web<00:03:02.640> conventions<00:03:03.950> so

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
of the many active web conventions so

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.620 
of the many active web conventions so
let's<00:03:05.130> type<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.820> message<00:03:06.000> here<00:03:11.000> at<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.120> time<00:03:12.360> now

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
let's type a message here at a time now

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.900 
let's type a message here at a time now
yes<00:03:12.960> what's<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.710> first<00:03:13.890> page<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.580> what

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
yes what's the first page and see what

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.840 
yes what's the first page and see what
we<00:03:15.450> get<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.900> now<00:03:16.440> we<00:03:16.500> get<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.850> working

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
we get and now we get a working

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.870 
we get and now we get a working
application<00:03:18.290> now<00:03:19.290> all<00:03:19.739> we<00:03:19.860> have<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.070> do<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.520> add

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
application now all we have to do is add

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.410 
application now all we have to do is add
a<00:03:20.910> small<00:03:21.480> piece<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.200> dynamic<00:03:22.890> data<00:03:23.180> let's<00:03:24.180> say

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
a small piece of dynamic data let's say

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:36.350 
a small piece of dynamic data let's say
you<00:03:32.930> import<00:03:33.930> java.util<00:03:34.739> date<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.180> view

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
you import java.util date so the view

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.500 
you import java.util date so the view
method<00:03:36.570> really<00:03:37.200> says<00:03:37.860> view<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:40.320> object

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
method really says view this object

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.240 
method really says view this object
under<00:03:42.510> this<00:03:43.170> name<00:03:45.650> there<00:03:46.650> when<00:03:46.860> we<00:03:46.950> refresh

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
under this name there when we refresh

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.550 
under this name there when we refresh
the<00:03:47.489> view<00:03:47.730> we<00:03:48.360> get<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.660> same<00:03:48.840> page<00:03:49.080> obviously

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
the view we get the same page obviously

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.870 
the view we get the same page obviously
because<00:03:49.800> we<00:03:49.920> didn't<00:03:50.130> do<00:03:50.220> anything<00:03:50.580> on<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
because we didn't do anything on the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.270 
because we didn't do anything on the
page<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.230> page<00:03:52.380> itself<00:03:52.709> all<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.160> have

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
page so on the page itself all we have

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.229 
page so on the page itself all we have
to<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.550> is<00:03:54.300> take<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.110> time<00:03:56.239> interpolated

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
to do is take the time interpolated

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.570 
to do is take the time interpolated
value<00:03:58.370> all<00:03:59.370> right<00:04:00.620> refresh<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.920> now<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.310> get

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
value all right refresh and now we get

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.430 
value all right refresh and now we get
another<00:04:02.970> exception<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.600> one<00:04:03.810> is<00:04:03.959> from<00:04:04.200> free

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
in a date and I really have no idea how

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.890 
in a date and I really have no idea how
to<00:04:11.040> handle<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:11.970> what<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.660> do<00:04:12.750> we<00:04:12.870> can

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
to handle it so what we can do we can

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.220 
to handle it so what we can do we can
use<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.410> built-in<00:04:13.890> date/time<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:15.209> display<00:04:15.600> it

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.700 

all<00:04:19.230> right<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.709> once<00:04:20.609> we<00:04:20.760> refresh<00:04:21.440> now<00:04:22.440> we're

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
all right and once we refresh now we're

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.440 
all right and once we refresh now we're
going<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.890> get<00:04:23.039> now<00:04:23.610> we're<00:04:23.789> getting<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.090> fully

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
I hope you enjoyed it and by the way you

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.800 
I hope you enjoyed it and by the way you
probably<00:04:29.680> noticed<00:04:30.310> that<00:04:30.370> during<00:04:31.330> all<00:04:31.600> this

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
probably noticed that during all this

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.900 
probably noticed that during all this
time<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.260> I<00:04:32.320> added<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.830> new<00:04:32.950> clause<00:04:33.190> in<00:04:33.490> 35

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
time that I added a new clause in 35

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.060 
time that I added a new clause in 35
it's<00:04:34.240> called<00:04:34.570> an<00:04:34.750> edit<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.140> new<00:04:35.260> template<00:04:35.680> and

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
it's called an edit a new template and

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.750 
it's called an edit a new template and
never<00:04:36.370> restarted<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:38.040> container<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.340> that's

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
never restarted the container and that's

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.180 
never restarted the container and that's
the<00:04:40.060> idea

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
the idea

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.370 
the idea
happy<00:04:42.190> coding
