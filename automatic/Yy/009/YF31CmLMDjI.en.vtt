 new this system up and down a 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.140
 system that allows a perfect fit 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.140
 on the back of the cyclist 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.020

 the strap the profile is reflective 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.110
 which gives us a lot of visibility 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.100
 especially in dark stretches and hours 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.360

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.380
 quickly to wash it 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.660
