00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
closer in a Chris territory oh that's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.380

big<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> nice<00:01:20.640> grab<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.299> it's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
big that's a nice grab right there it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.820 
big that's a nice grab right there it's
all<00:01:21.509> timorous<00:01:21.960> comes<00:01:22.170> out<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> they're

all timorous comes out and they're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.160 
all timorous comes out and they're
prolly<00:01:23.450> disintegrating<00:01:24.450> dominate<00:01:24.840> off<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
map and it looks like maybe incinerating

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.730 
map and it looks like maybe incinerating
a<00:01:27.479> few<00:01:27.659> more<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.930> they<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.560> ring

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
a few more if they can get into ring

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.710 
a few more if they can get into ring
which<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> down<00:01:29.280> onto<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.850> mid<00:01:30.090> lane<00:01:30.270> finally

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

Robert<00:02:56.190> Exley<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.670> this<00:02:56.819> fight<00:02:57.090> oh<00:02:57.329> my<00:02:57.630> gosh

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
Robert Exley in this fight oh my gosh

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.229 
Robert Exley in this fight oh my gosh
cop<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.680> dealing<00:02:58.980> with<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.099> live<00:02:59.370> triple<00:03:00.060> kill

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
cop is dealing with a live triple kill

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.059 
cop is dealing with a live triple kill
for<00:03:00.420> Robert<00:03:00.720> Exley<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.319> they're<00:03:01.650> gonna<00:03:01.769> push

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
for Robert Exley and they're gonna push

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.270 
for Robert Exley and they're gonna push
down<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.310> mid<00:03:02.549> lane<00:03:03.290> 441<00:03:04.290> probably<00:03:04.890> becomes<00:03:05.190> a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
down the mid lane 441 probably becomes a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.970 
down the mid lane 441 probably becomes a
martyr<00:03:05.519> for<00:03:05.670> his<00:03:05.940> team<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.450> not<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.349> all<00:03:07.590> in

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
martyr for his team to not go in all in

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.800 
martyr for his team to not go in all in
is<00:03:08.250> really<00:03:08.430> keeping<00:03:08.730> complexity<00:03:09.329> no<00:03:09.420> bearing

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
just Southwest rice jumped right into it

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.039 
just Southwest rice jumped right into it
and<00:03:13.890> said<00:03:14.040> let's<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.549> dominate<00:03:15.299> almost<00:03:15.840> gets

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
and said let's go dominate almost gets

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.509

out<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.530> one<00:03:16.709> but<00:03:16.829> he's<00:03:16.920> pulled<00:03:17.160> back<00:03:17.340> in

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
out of that one but he's pulled back in

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.430 
out of that one but he's pulled back in
by<00:03:17.639> bump<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.000> up<00:03:18.120> West<00:03:18.540> rice<00:03:18.780> almost<00:03:19.260> going

by bump it up West rice almost going

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.410 
by bump it up West rice almost going
down<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.950> somehow<00:03:20.220> stays<00:03:20.700> alive<00:03:21.060> with<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
in and out perfectly they're just gonna

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.650

go<00:03:26.190> back<00:03:26.220> base<00:03:26.549> there's<00:03:27.060> not<00:03:27.239> much<00:03:27.420> more<00:03:27.450> they

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
go back base there's not much more they

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.819 
go back base there's not much more they
can<00:03:27.690> do<00:03:27.870> getting<00:03:28.290> something<00:03:28.500> out<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.739> this

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
can do getting something out of this

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.020 
can do getting something out of this
would<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.130> great<00:03:29.280> but<00:03:29.579> now<00:03:29.730> they<00:03:29.910> are

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
would be great but now they are

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.140 
would be great but now they are
pressured<00:03:30.450> all<00:03:30.630> five<00:03:31.049> back<00:03:31.980> for<00:03:32.220> quoz<00:03:32.400> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
pressured all five back for quoz and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.879 
pressured all five back for quoz and
he's<00:03:33.329> just<00:03:33.569> gonna<00:03:33.720> go<00:03:33.900> ahead<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.799> an

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
he's just gonna go ahead and be an

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.559 
he's just gonna go ahead and be an
alligator<00:03:35.250> well<00:03:35.609> they're<00:03:35.730> gonna<00:03:35.790> kill<00:03:36.060> him<00:03:36.150> at

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
alligator well they're gonna kill him at

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.309 
alligator well they're gonna kill him at
least<00:03:36.780> it's<00:03:37.650> gonna<00:03:37.859> cost<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> Baron<00:03:39.319> just

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
least it's gonna cost of the Baron just

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.069 
least it's gonna cost of the Baron just
reminds<00:03:40.500> me<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.739> old<00:03:40.799> hotshot<00:03:41.420> this<00:03:42.420> one<00:03:42.840> guy

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
reminds me of old hotshot this one guy

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.710 
reminds me of old hotshot this one guy
run<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.709> around<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:44.340> tire<00:03:44.549> team<00:03:44.850> gets<00:03:45.120> baron

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
run it around the tire team gets baron

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.000 
run it around the tire team gets baron
he<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.410> still<00:03:47.650> going<00:03:48.300> baron<00:03:49.300> goes<00:03:49.480> down<00:03:50.010> furnas

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
he is still going baron goes down furnas

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.290 
he is still going baron goes down furnas
GA<00:03:51.190> yeah<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.950> got<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.100> give<00:03:54.310> this<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.610> us<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
GA yeah you got to give this to us the

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.120 
GA yeah you got to give this to us the
right<00:03:55.510> person<00:03:56.130> network<00:03:58.770> that's<00:03:59.770> pretty<00:03:59.920> good

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
right person network that's pretty good

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.460 
right person network that's pretty good
fight<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:01.180> was<00:04:01.360> really<00:04:01.750> hard<00:04:01.960> to<00:04:01.990> take<00:04:02.230> down

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
fight it was really hard to take down

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.220 
fight it was really hard to take down
you<00:04:03.370> team<00:04:03.580> played<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:04.090> strong<00:04:04.630> but<00:04:04.930> today

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
you team played this strong but today

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.870 
you team played this strong but today
we've<00:04:05.470> seen<00:04:05.680> all<00:04:05.980> teams<00:04:06.280> start<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.610> take

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
we've seen all teams start to take

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.160 
we've seen all teams start to take
control<00:04:07.150> when<00:04:07.360> they<00:04:07.480> think<00:04:07.690> they<00:04:07.810> have<00:04:07.840> it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
control when they think they have it

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.930 
control when they think they have it
dominate<00:04:08.740> looking<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.100> put<00:04:09.250> control<00:04:09.580> back<00:04:09.760> in

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
about 60 HP left and it's going to be
