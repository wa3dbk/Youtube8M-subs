 new video bringing you a video of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.779
 good news 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.430
 So I 'm going to start this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.680
 video here apologizing 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.750
 I wish I had recorded this video on the blog 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.079
 but unfortunately type interviews with 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.480
 camera and that's it I learned that I 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.250
 I'm going to do the channel again, that's it. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.220
 what a lot of people are asking 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.989
 lately so without further ado there 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.970
 the video of today to talk about 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.850
 a big x news came back 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.920
 recently the second class of the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.090
 and the rock will be released in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.620
 some months 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.560
 You must be wondering why. 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 of the project name of the classes are 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.780
 evolution of the perfect characters 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.450
 well I'll explain to you of the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.460
 right when it was developed 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.009
 the distributor of the game brought 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 with it an innovative system in Brazil x 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.759
 the hybrid system the junction of mp and p 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.579
 as possible and give rise to hybridization 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.890
 of the other mp characters of the game one 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.260
 objective of trying to standardize and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.409
 balance the old characters with the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.530
 Appendix characters and put them at the same 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.450
 level with this idea to the characters 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.400
 soybeans have already been 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.500
 perfect insufficient 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.450
 only with the skills of his crop 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.780
 of core class talents 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.510
 did you know that by reaching levels 20 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.729
 40 60 to 59 gain additional attributes 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.970
 states as if he had made 10 of 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.830
 class for example the character article 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.320
 in the game when you take a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.930
 second or fourth class of your 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.659
 character he gets next to the new 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.869
 class new attributes like attack 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.240
 defense and vitality and even 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.670
 voting with this idea of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.070
 perfection the kobe game developer 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 did not intend to create new classes for 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.000
 these two characters 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.009
 recently a sudden decision by the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.989
 developer was bring to the game 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.200
 new classes of characters that gave 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.959
 hybridization at last. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.849
 no one had the idea that so 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.340
 look would not have new classes not 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.920
 would be 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.720
 guys so I could tell in a 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.170
 image was published in the second 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.450
 zezinho on facebook of the great x level up 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.920
 games is that it's apparently not good 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.110
 use new weapons 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.599
 so it continues with its vibration 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.310
 wind hammer earning only 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.709
 adaptations and improvements of its 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.650
 gameplay as day 10 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.569
 the profits reiki remembering that this is a 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.810
 My opinion and I do not know if I will change 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.819
 the guns or did not see what lies in the head 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.099
 of players is the speculation of 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.769
 classes what will be the new skills 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.160
 what are the new combos will you guys 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.060
 they will have more booth being contributed will be weak 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 I do not know 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.370
 People, I 'll tell you what I 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.530
 I think I think kobe â€‹â€‹was right on the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.870
 decision to create new classes next 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.090
 holly and i was excited to know that 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.200
 will have new things new gameplay in 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.450
 characters 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.120
 the expectation is that the developer 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.280
 reconstruction talent tree of both 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.230
 characters because they are no longer 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.000
 perfect and absolute with just the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.319
 basic class how they were created 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.940
 to be a thing turned my head 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.549
 heavily what will the cup be 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.819
 planning at last they forgot about the 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:40.079
 and his work is slow in my 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.180
 opinion I think the company should 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.799
 determine the things you already have in the game 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.870
 before trying without creating new 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.970
 characters and class for the game 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.000
 after all, new players want to 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.919
 construction of its usÃª and a class that 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.579
 give to play in a balanced way 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:04:00.340
 emissions pvp is atoa that 90% large x 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.269
 Playing playing with mari only plays with 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.069
 the eagles 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.590
 I will not go into that part of the debate 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.380
 end'm here to give your good news 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.660
 So people talking about it in news. 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.060
 do not stop there do not welcome too 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.919
 announced that they are developing a 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.690
 new character 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.269
 the company also claims that large 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.180
 will receive a new hero throughout the year 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.190
 2013 but the character is 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.979
 development process and they do not 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.280
 has a scheduled release date 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:34.030
 but I got it and I think the character 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.590
 is around September tube but I 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.320
 I also think that the character must also 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.870
 to be the father of leslie galera is the cantucci 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.669
 Garth after all the game has already unfolded 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.740
 enough history so that he can 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.960
 arise in the game remembering that is what I 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.789
 I think the crowd is nothing only official 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.820
 announce a new character is the opinion 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.919
 from gpi to galera 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.180
 What do you expect for new classes? 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.310

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.340
 What do you want as a new character? 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.270

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.880
 be a gamer with 16 sword are 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.260
