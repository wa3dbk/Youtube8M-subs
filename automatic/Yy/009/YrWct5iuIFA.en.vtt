00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.370
 hi girls how are you welcome to the 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.190
 channel today I bring you this 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.139
 video to make a demonstration of 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.449
 an issue that many of you have 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.029
 request on how to apply the 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.950
 extensions I admit I am the girls 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.960
 that use extensions and good me 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.880
 I resort to them to good to give you more 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.430
 volume to my hair that looks a lot 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.380
 longer and I think also to change 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.449
 the appearance at any moment uses 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.629
 the arrests on this occasion I'm 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:40.129
 using these extensions as you see my 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.109
 Natural hair is this is my hair 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.289
 natural and this extension is that I'm 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.690
 using I get to this height about 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.519
 the bibi fashion company this deal 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.460
 these extensions of which I am very 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.940
 happy I chose these which I think 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.299
 which have a very nice brightness very very 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.530
 I would say like that and it came to me 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.379
 youtube and it 's is to give them the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.740
 demonstration and from how I fix them 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.409
 how do you put this makeover to 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.730
 our appearance to our hair I am 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.980
 using this technique that is 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.160
 to make longer waves the 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.540
 better care will last us much longer 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.030
 normally what I do is clear 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.160
 washed with shampoo conditioner either 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.160
 the curl every time I'm going to use them 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.680
 in my hair when doing the curl this and 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.390
 I use them when I remove them 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.880
 You can remove them in the same way 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.310
 delicately forgive her is the way 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.250
 curly and save them so that the next 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.619
 time I'm going to use them this 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.240
 can apply and have that curl that 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.570
 I did them before, I do not know if it's 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.000
 just be me but I do not curl the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.340
 extensions together with my hair I want 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.890
 do it separately since it saves me 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.020
 time and apart I avoid being pulled 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.600
 the hair or that I'm going to pull 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.750
 extension not be struggling and week 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.450
 to work much easier 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.850
 the point both and that your day more with the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.830
 hair started to join and give them shape 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.380
 so that they are lost and go away 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.240
 combining with my hair to look at you 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.130
 use them up the leather 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.680
 scalp because if you have little 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.150
 hair will be noticed for girls who 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.130
 have to very finite audio them 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.410
 I recommend that they use more extensions 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.480
 and for chips that only have a lot 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.930
 hair so doing this helps us 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.610
 Give more volume to our cardio before 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.640
 to apply any hot device 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.670
 applied the heat shield both in my 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.220
 hair like the extensions is to help 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.570
 prevent burning is much more 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.030
 say and that had been a side 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.890
 then when applying the pincer 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.470
 what you are going to do is make them much more 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.600
 without worrying is the area where they can 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.370
 be ready of the hair as they are fixed 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.320
 the extension hair strips are 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.900
 completely covered so I do not know 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.330
 note which separate laugh is going 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.489
 makes it much easier and good to me 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.870
 saving a lot of time they sting is a color 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.970
 very similar 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.549
 and so something completely with all the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.230
 rest is you pull extensions now 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.420
 to start applying them I start with 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.030
 once with the three clicks strip on the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.860
 bottom part not completely down 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.840
 tried to lower a bit of my hair 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.629
 after applying for extension of three 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.730
 fringes perfectly subject of the medium 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.310
 after the sides he lowered a little more than 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.519
 hair about two centimeters 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.470
 separated and applied another strip more than three 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.930
 clips since in that part of something of 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.750
 hair we have a little more and more 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.870
 small who apart from the medium applied 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.760
 perfectly and subject now in the part 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.250
 in the middle that more or less has been 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.099
 as at the level of the ears or of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.930
 eyes is where it is much wider in 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.299
 that area in that area and I apply a 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.560
 expression of four clicks since it is 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.560
 much 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.590
 the widest strip and then it reaches 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.170
 cover perfectly after having 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.659
 applied the from four clips I apply the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.239
 of in clips that is very close to my face 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.060
 that also helped me give it a little more 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.990
 of much longer hair in the part 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.060
 in front 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.190
 then applied a little higher to the 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.800
 of two that take into account 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.920
 uncover these clips perfectly for 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.320
 not be noticed clear as they are too 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.600
 24 inches long what I did 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.820
 made a cut a little closer to me 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.070
 hair so they do not look too fake 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.980
 and well this is the result of how it 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.480
 come with the wavy extensions and 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.570
 well what looks very natural is me 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.530
 like it because it happens with a very hairstyle 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.530
 glamorous they are very striking 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.370

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.690

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.580

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.130
 where I the orders 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.200
