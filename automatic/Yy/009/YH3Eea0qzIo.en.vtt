00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.240
 i am here in wales continental the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.790
 Tire company has invited to one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.160
 Presentation of a new enduro tire 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.260
 and in the meantime I have these 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.960
 Event also used right around 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.480
 just good goretex respectively 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.880
 to test waterproof clothes for it 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.189
 It was clear that it was in Wales 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.260
 then it will rain once and how 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.309
 we are expected to be very nice today 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.559
 has been trained and the clothes must 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.850
 It is said that the services are really good 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.010
 proved I'll start right away 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.649
 Racer to an austrian company 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.920
 known for their high quality 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.809
 especially known for it 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.340
 Of course I have a racer too 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.510
 gloves taken 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.370
 this is the model stratos 2 so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.129
 the second part of the stratos series 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.430
 clearly improves but otherwise I have here 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.049
 just a gore tex membrane inside the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 Really much for me today too 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.400
 has brought in the weather it comes 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.890
 no water in 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.960
 but it is by and large one 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.939
 very soft glove you have to say 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.150
 as through and through leather 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.990
 also in the inner hand are no plastic 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.750
 maybe those protect 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.580
 Many would reduce wearing comfort 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 athletic gloves already have 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.600
 any applications on it 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.950
 but then often press and so on 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.090
 Glove held his hand for himself 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.369
 should be suitable for tours 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.829
 he should be good and sit well 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.380
 nothing has nothing oppressive and that 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.180
 is two with stratus two given 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.100
 So it was very comfortable but still 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.740
 happy protectors on the top 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.689
 So overall a very successful hand 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.390
 instead of just going with the gore tex 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.090
 So membrane can score for each 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.740
 weather suitable 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.770
 Furthermore, I have easily recognizable 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.180
 a touring suit to a two-piece 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 also by razer the move is called sorry 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.459
 the pain is not necessarily wrong 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 is light and airy 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.780
 but not only for the very hot 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.709
 season but 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.870
 pants and jacket have one 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.310
 einzug true thermo lining or a 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.870
 extendable it is inside 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.000
 I have about a minute 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 used to pull the house around it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.990
 get there in about the same amount of time 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.790
 and I do not have that here now 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.640
 because it is now that I am here in 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.709
 the sun and quite a bit 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.020
 top but we were just in the rain 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.209
 on the way and there it became logically 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.860
 cooler but not unpleasantly cool because 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.500
 I can do all the zippers 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.000
 then what is the pants and then what is 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.160
 waterproof jacket but I can too 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.920
 Open the vents and the 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.620
 jacket is well ventilated so there are 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.440
 there are some opportunities to move sorry 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.970
 both jacket and big hot must be around 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.830
 to ventilate properly 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.510
 then of course there are so many 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.970
 Adjustment options on the sleeve 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.800
 I have a zipper and a 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.010
 Velcro, that's pretty much 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.420
 Well thought out because I can fit 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.000
 set a bit 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.790
 what can be done anywhere that you set 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.170
 can down by the shoes, the pants 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.970
 go on because you can also in the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.150
 At that time you can do that very well 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.360
 vary greatly and the huge advantage 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.920
 where the muw light fun racer is 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.739
 in my opinion compared to the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.110
 which are now competitive 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.430
 maybe the functionality 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.150
 Functionality not bad 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.160
 distinguish 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.130
 but the price is amazing that 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.660
 costs together under 400 euro at 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.000
 other companies actually only cost the 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.540
 jacket so much so there he is great 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.670
 put down the product, so to speak 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.650
 are not alone 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.090
 that really all functions 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.090
 which it has to fulfill yes because it 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.859
 Although quite fast here in Wales on the thing 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.799
 So we've got a lot 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:08.329
 decent guide he had behaved before 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.530
 plan is it was one anyway 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:14.700
 event you have to say with 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:19.049
 The travel agency I am mainly on 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.900
 the bmw r 1200 sat and drove 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.020
 and I've got the shiterthat 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.620
 c 3po taken that is a fisherman 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.750
 Watch the helmet at first 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.080
 look may not look like that 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.639
 be a flip-flop is the c3 pro like that 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.240
 name already says that is 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.419
 further development of the c3 and year leaves 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.250
 It's easy to get down there easily 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.810
 of course that works better 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.020
 if you have it to be with you 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.530
 quick closure because very good to that 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.990
 Adjust chin so it fits well 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.819
 Men are closed makes one 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.139
 really extremely stable impression though 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.470
 He just has that open 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.270
 appellen advantage that you really there 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.639
 a lot of air gets into it 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.789
 integrated an integrated 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.759
 Sun visor you see here so that 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:16.270
 is an extremely high quality bright thing 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:20.680
 me now at the bright especially 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.930
 positively noticed are the 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.940
 volume ratio the aero 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.419
 acoustics we call that right at 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.490
 names 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.460
 The acoustics are so insane 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.400
 has there really obviously a lot of time and 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.419
 Money is invested around the helmets 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.139
 level 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.419
 the other one really believes in suspension 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.740
 can not reach that's that 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.380
 really quiet that works 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.789
 excellent 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.099
 cheap it is definitely not 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.669
 but whoever shoves his once 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:55.690
 has then tried in the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.990
 usually think so well that there 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.120
 It is well worth the price it is 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.560
 extremely high quality premium product that 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.990
 to really have some time off 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.690
 Chopin Schubert c 3po also has 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.900
 another integrated antenna so who 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.120
 with communication systems in there 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.620
 then has a bit of work to do 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.000
 Immediately the possibility of an integrated 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.979
 antenna to use 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.130
 Of course, the reception is strong 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.650
 reinforced yes that's the c3 pro 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.560
 Finally we come to the shoe factory 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.800
 I'll leave you completely free 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.940
 will 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:36.789
 it is about the likes 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.770
 balance classic i must confess 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.580
 have a bit misused him 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.860
 because I wanted 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.050
 to have a comfortable comfortable boot 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.610
 for the tour it is actually a 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.840
 Decisive boots 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:53.020
 The advantage is he has a waterproof 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.629
 Membrane inside just for touring 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:59.319
 Driving is very pleasant and one 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:01.449
 relatively soft, yielding sole one 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.949
 could mean now that's me 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.229
 maybe not so sure 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:07.590
 It is a leather boots, it is one 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:11.469
 motorcycle boots and he works 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.909
 also on such tour machines 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:15.340
 excellent even if he actually 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.710
 a one eiler boots is the great 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:21.610
 advantage is just the waterproof 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.169
 The membrane inside is what he is for 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.360
 every weather situation by and large 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:30.370
 usable even now in the heat of 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.719
 wales you unfortunately right now 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:37.270
 again Unterbränd I must confess is 

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:39.550
 he still comfortable to wear because he 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.259
 because he is not that clumsy and and so on 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.050
 is supporting but it is a looser 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:46.979
 Light boots in my opinion 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.979
 looks pretty good too
