quality of the soda high but it's an
endocrine<00:01:05.760> disruptor<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.659> means

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
endocrine disruptor so what that means

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.260 
endocrine disruptor so what that means
is<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> raises<00:01:07.710> estrogen<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> men<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
is it raises estrogen in men and it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.390 
is it raises estrogen in men and it
raises<00:01:09.450> testosterone<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.380> women<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.070> raises

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
raises testosterone and women so raises

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.480 
raises testosterone and women so raises
the<00:01:11.490> opposing<00:01:12.000> hormones<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:13.159> men<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> women

the opposing hormones in men and women
that<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:14.939> want<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.960> top<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that we don't want and on top of that it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.890 
that we don't want and on top of that it
also<00:01:16.470> binds<00:01:16.890> into<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.340> hormones<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
also binds into our hormones and it

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.080 
also binds into our hormones and it
makes<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.320> makes<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.040> not<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.430> available<00:01:20.939> for

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
more rep for a given weight so let's say

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.060 
more rep for a given weight so let's say
you<00:01:59.130> benchpress<00:01:59.960> 135<00:02:00.960> pounds<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.920> going

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you benchpress 135 pounds you're going

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.340 
you benchpress 135 pounds you're going
to<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.340> six<00:02:02.610> reps<00:02:02.820> each<00:02:03.060> workout<00:02:03.930> try

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
to do it for six reps each workout try

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.649 
to do it for six reps each workout try
to<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.610> extra<00:02:05.850> rep<00:02:06.060> total<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.540> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to get one extra rep total so if you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.690 
to get one extra rep total so if you
three<00:02:06.930> sets<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.200> six<00:02:07.439> that's<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.280> team<00:02:08.489> let's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
three sets of six that's a team let's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.760 
three sets of six that's a team let's
try<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:08.970> get<00:02:09.119> 19<00:02:09.569> reps<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> next<00:02:10.080> workout<00:02:10.319> then

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
try to get 19 reps the next workout then

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.619 
try to get 19 reps the next workout then
try<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.280> 20<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.030> obviously<00:02:12.450> you're<00:02:12.599> going

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
try to get 20 now obviously you're going

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.450 
try to get 20 now obviously you're going
to<00:02:12.780> come<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.110> point

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
to come to a point

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.970 
to come to a point
shrinking<00:02:13.940> stop<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.710> can<00:02:15.860> no

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
shrinking stop and then you can no

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.670 
shrinking stop and then you can no
longer<00:02:16.190> if<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.630> way<00:02:17.840> shake<00:02:18.140> you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
longer if you have just a way shake you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.500 
longer if you have just a way shake you
will<00:02:18.830> spike<00:02:19.070> your<00:02:19.250> blood<00:02:19.280> sugar<00:02:19.640> pretty

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
will spike your blood sugar pretty

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.030 
will spike your blood sugar pretty
rapidly<00:02:20.960> then<00:02:21.140> that's<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:21.620> always<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.950> bad

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
rapidly then that's not always a bad

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.460 
rapidly then that's not always a bad
thing<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.300> prefer<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> more<00:02:24.170> advanced

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
thing but I prefer to do a more advanced

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.260
