there where it just comes in and it
starts<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.129> pretty<00:01:05.159> much<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.330 

and<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:16.020> basically<00:01:16.200> repeats<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.920> few<00:01:17.159> times

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.179 
and that basically repeats a few times
and<00:01:18.020> then<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> goes<00:01:19.320> into<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.590> verse<00:01:19.890> where

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189

and then it goes into the verse where
the<00:01:20.280> two<00:01:20.430> guitars<00:01:20.820> are<00:01:21.890> coordinated<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.070> once

switch from those two and basically the
verse<00:04:51.730> is<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.240> same<00:04:52.510> way<00:04:52.750> if<00:04:52.840> you<00:04:52.960> listen<00:04:53.290> to

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
verse is the same way if you listen to

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.550 
verse is the same way if you listen to
it<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.680> just<00:04:53.800> have<00:04:53.950> vibrato<00:04:54.520> on<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:56.290> same

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
it you just have vibrato on the the same

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.040 
it you just have vibrato on the the same
bar<00:04:56.890> chord<00:04:57.190> right<00:04:57.340> here<00:04:57.640> at<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:58.000> end<00:04:58.120> but<00:04:58.900> it

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
bar chord right here at the end but it

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.840 
bar chord right here at the end but it
just<00:04:59.200> sounds<00:04:59.350> really<00:04:59.830> ridiculous<00:05:00.100> without

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
just sounds really ridiculous without

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.630 
just sounds really ridiculous without
another<00:05:01.030> person<00:05:01.510> picking<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:03.040> other<00:05:03.160> part<00:05:03.490> to
