00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.759
 we go from Brazil a Brazilian is the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.410
 protagonist of the play of the day in 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.990
 monterrey new lion 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.540
 demanding armed eyes tigers images 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.269
 clear nothing more and nothing less than the toucan 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.920
 Brazilian ferretti of origin is coaching 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.310
 how Brazilians behave in 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.310
 Mexico 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.660
 if you find it 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 magician 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 Thank you 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.960
 the teacher ferretti the teacher 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:18.290
 teacher says some strong words 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.299
 but he has a prosthesis in the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.909
 hip topped well 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.130
 forgive me and I stay point and ready 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.950
 that they do not agree with me but I 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.810
 I want you to direct me I like a leader to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:37.810
 I like a leader that you act thanks 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.810
 they do not like it 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.080
 the foreigner 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.789
 entering Mexican more that and what 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:02:02.830
 you shoot on the other hand is a 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:02:02.830
 foreign coach that is already that 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.180
 the character is very well the person 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.650
 it's fine but I think there's 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.540
 ways and ways 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.950
 and there are many trained in Mexico who 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.930
 now there are many cameras I feel that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.569
 you can know before there were not many 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.569
 cameras and then it was difficult to there 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.069
 very sincere countries has been the touch what 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.810
 you know well how viable the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.989
 football with that intensity has not stopped 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.670
 to lead in 20 years jesus now lives 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.129
 an unusual case in Mexican soccer 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.739
 but on the other hand if a player in 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.390
 mexico responds with insults something is 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.319
 bad is that the insults something stay 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.780
 electric 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.730
 there are figures including a figure of 30 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.430
 and he needs to be insulted that he 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.569
 cool to work properly 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.220
 it means that professionalism is lacking 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.900
 not feeling that the motivation has to 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.889
 be in the way but in gameplay 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.530
 of a certain level 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.019
 I think it does not work or it should not work 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.040
 with this measure the respect is going to be 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.200
 fundamental in any profession 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.209
 under the circumstances you can 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.569
 have the impotence of the coach that 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.950
 come player is a must say 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.950
 those words or actors 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.270
 in the wind 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.680
 I'm angry they do things right 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.470
 well and also do it a preseason 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.320
 and if they want a later a moment 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.210
 hard the busy season continues 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.860
 it has always been this way with the players 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.440
 with the means of communication I am not 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.680
 apologetic always more and better way 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.940
 to educate a player and instruct them 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.010
 or be angry but bad words for 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.570
 which I put my hands the body 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:49.520
 complete fire in Mexican soccer 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:52.310
 is the word on the playing field or to 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.890
 a companion even or a rival not 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.600
 be arrived players ever to 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.900
 Guests to father can bother you 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:02.000
 but what I see is a wear when 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.640
 there is a wear and tear situations arise 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.370
 little has already been 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.960
 you will not know as a technician part of the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.270
 facet that a technician has to cover 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.310
 is to distinguish the players he directs 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.440
 not everyone is equal to the ring they will like it 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.440
 as faitelson that they speak to them like that for 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.690
 answer but there are others that to a young 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.820
 in short it can motivate what can 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.920
 tell me I insulted you that I'm going to play 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.240
 better tomorrow there are players who are not 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.220
 not everyone responds well that's why the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.950
 technician has to be a psychologist 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.620
 empirical that distinguishes how to motivate 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.940
 Of course I do not think one at the time 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.860
 respond with insults there was another 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.450
 way to motivate I know you others 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 they despised the players not 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.110
 they only insulted but over 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.060
 they despised 10 oratory but 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.390
 finally I took a leader like that with 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.110
 that passion to me and Roberto to undermine his 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.270
 passion but there are players who do not have 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.950
 through the character that have him or david 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.840
 and that does imply that much of the 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.390
 performance because many instead of 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.130
 take out your best side is prohibited and no longer 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.870
 has more strength in ability 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.930
 of doing things as the creator 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.520
 demand then let's say a new change 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.410
 came out lucas wolves came in 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.450
 I agree but the tuca has behaved 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.920
 always without seeing or know but what yes 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.740
 neither are they worth more than the tournament 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.630
 past this one it gave the sensation that tigers 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.270
 everything was fine and it passes end is a 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.420
 technician and Bosnians make marranadas 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.340
 that's not right said no 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.130
 now it came a little no does not either 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.370
 meaning I think everything goes through this 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.410
 a polite treatment respectful already 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.130
 from there the leadership will emerge 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.130
 according 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:48.980
 need needs demands experience 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.940
 as it did not mention that are 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.620
 for the rest that was one of my 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.570
 teachers you have a very strong character 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.150
 as you well say you once said a 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.190
 bad word but sometimes I hang there 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.990
 until they sanctioned it and thanks to what 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.910
 he observed when he set the 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.280
 savior of madrid athletic 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.470
 the name I do not remember kings in the kings 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.340
 and told him you have to mark well 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:16.539
 and he approached someone I listen to him in plan 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.580
 racist got a scandal then 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.469
 we must avoid that now that really 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.080
 the technicians for example told me that 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:25.689
 tomorrow leaves tiger if there are five six 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.789
 seven or eight teams interested in me 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:30.189
 because it 's foreign we have some 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:33.610
 good notes we have some notes in 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:36.719
 spicy football one of them is the 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.719
 first the one
