so I don't think he might stay but I
think<00:00:23.400> city's<00:00:23.820> still<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.869> him<00:00:24.990> so

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
have been the impact of it because it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.249 
have been the impact of it because it
was<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.500> show<00:01:26.100> 4,000<00:01:26.909> people<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.360> guess<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.900> then

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
was a show 4,000 people I guess and then

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.620 
was a show 4,000 people I guess and then
suddenly<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.979> German<00:01:29.579> guys<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:30.090> started

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
and honestly thought this is this is a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.679 
and honestly thought this is this is a
contradiction<00:01:38.340> with<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.090> I've<00:01:39.240> been<00:01:39.390> told

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the most important week of his career

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.259 
the most important week of his career
that<00:02:28.470> they<00:02:28.620> tried<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.950> trick<00:02:29.430> him<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.849> this

that they tried to trick him with this

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.470 
that they tried to trick him with this
so<00:02:30.959> they<00:02:31.890> felt<00:02:32.190> they<00:02:32.370> felt<00:02:32.579> a<00:02:32.640> bit<00:02:32.790> betrayed<00:02:33.180> by

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
so they felt they felt a bit betrayed by

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.720 
so they felt they felt a bit betrayed by
the<00:02:33.540> show<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.409> by<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.709> moderator<00:02:35.400> by<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
the show so by the moderator by the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.420 
the show so by the moderator by the
people<00:02:36.480> made<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> show<00:02:37.079> so<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.950> could<00:02:38.159> this<00:02:38.280> be

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
people made the show so so could this be

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.670 
people made the show so so could this be
the<00:02:38.459> trigger<00:02:38.760> than<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.569> sets<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the trigger than that sets and the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.170 
the trigger than that sets and the
wheels<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.099> motion<00:02:41.159> as<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.849> were<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
wheels in motion as it were for the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.000 
wheels in motion as it were for the
transfer<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.720> think<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.200> wheels<00:02:43.470> were<00:02:43.680> already

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
transfer I think the wheels were already

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.819 
transfer I think the wheels were already
in<00:02:44.250> motion<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:45.390> won't<00:02:45.870> influence<00:02:46.409> the

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
in motion this won't influence the

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.089 
in motion this won't influence the
transfer<00:02:47.400> too<00:02:48.000> much<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.450> think<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.079> think<00:02:49.620> to

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
transfer too much I think I think to

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.890 
transfer too much I think I think to
meet<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.609> meetings<00:02:51.000> day<00:02:51.180> hat<00:02:51.480> or<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
meet the meetings day hat or the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.500 
meet the meetings day hat or the
meetings<00:02:52.290> day<00:02:52.470> will<00:02:52.769> have<00:02:53.250> already<00:02:54.150> planned

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
meetings day will have already planned

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.059 
meetings day will have already planned
so<00:02:54.659> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:54.840> Dixie<00:02:55.379> Bagheera<00:02:55.709> stump

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
so I think Dixie Bagheera stump

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.949 
so I think Dixie Bagheera stump

the<00:05:04.029> champions<00:05:04.419> league<00:05:04.449> but<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:05.229> always

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
the champions league but it's always

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.279 
the champions league but it's always
difficult<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:07.029> predict<00:05:07.389> if<00:05:07.569> we<00:05:07.659> got<00:05:07.810> is<00:05:08.110> he

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
difficult to predict if we got is he

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.200

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.909 
see him in a city share this season I'm
quite<00:05:20.439> confident<00:05:21.009> yes<00:05:21.400> from<00:05:21.759> what<00:05:21.909> I<00:05:22.029> hear<00:05:22.330> is

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
quite confident yes from what I hear is

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.339 
quite confident yes from what I hear is
that<00:05:23.919> he<00:05:24.189> had<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.729> didn't<00:05:25.120> move<00:05:25.270> can<00:05:25.569> happen<00:05:25.990> so

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
that he had it didn't move can happen so
