 there is technology but there is also the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.100
 reminds that in fact on the scope 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.690

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.990
 stop me from thinking about Americans and 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.549

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.069
 futuroscope because there are plenty of 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.209
 things to see and if you like everything 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.069

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.069
 racing sensations only after we want
