00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.220 

all<00:00:02.520> right<00:00:02.730> so<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.240> how<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.419> get<00:00:03.600> the

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
all right so this is how I get the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.330 
all right so this is how I get the
washboarding<00:00:04.980> noise<00:00:05.190> out<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:07.340> cylinder

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
washboarding noise out of the cylinder

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.209 
washboarding noise out of the cylinder
of<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.880> pump<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.900> has<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.290> be<00:00:10.440> honed<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.010> use<00:00:11.190> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
of a pump it has to be honed and I use a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.730 
of a pump it has to be honed and I use a
sandpaper<00:00:11.580> hone<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.240> I've<00:00:12.360> made<00:00:12.690> it's<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
sandpaper hone that I've made it's a

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.730 
sandpaper hone that I've made it's a
custom<00:00:14.190> unit<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.179> couldn't<00:00:15.960> find<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
custom unit I couldn't find one in the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.920 
custom unit I couldn't find one in the
store<00:00:17.010> big<00:00:17.250> enough<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.699> do<00:00:18.119> all<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.630> pump

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
store big enough to do all of the pump

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.179 
store big enough to do all of the pump
sizes<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.770> needed<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> made<00:00:21.330> my<00:00:21.539> own<00:00:22.189> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
sizes that I needed so I made my own to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:01:11.760 
sizes that I needed so I made my own to
get<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.880> sizes<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.480> required

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.430 

and<00:01:12.770> that's<00:01:13.160> it<00:01:13.930> that's<00:01:14.930> all<00:01:15.410> it<00:01:15.650> takes<00:01:17.290> just<00:01:18.290> a

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
and that's it that's all it takes just a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.230 
and that's it that's all it takes just a
little<00:01:18.470> bit<00:01:18.980> of<00:01:19.130> set<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.370> little<00:01:19.610> bit<00:01:19.730> of<00:01:19.910> TLC

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
little bit of set a little bit of TLC

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.270 
little bit of set a little bit of TLC
and<00:01:20.720> you've<00:01:20.840> got<00:01:21.050> a<00:01:21.080> nice<00:01:21.320> round<00:01:21.650> cylinder

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
and you've got a nice round cylinder

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.700 
and you've got a nice round cylinder
again<00:01:22.400> at<00:01:23.330> least<00:01:23.660> just<00:01:23.930> round<00:01:24.200> as<00:01:24.380> you'll<00:01:24.560> ever

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
again at least just round as you'll ever

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.680 
again at least just round as you'll ever
need<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.580> liquid<00:01:26.030> ring<00:01:26.240> vacuum<00:01:27.220> pump

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
need for a liquid ring vacuum pump

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.810 
need for a liquid ring vacuum pump
that's<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.520> flapper<00:01:32.000> sandpaper<00:01:32.510> design

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
that's the flapper sandpaper design

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.260 
that's the flapper sandpaper design
right<00:01:34.820> there<00:01:34.850> real<00:01:35.300> simple<00:01:35.810> easy<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.680> make<00:01:37.270> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
right there real simple easy to make the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.780 
right there real simple easy to make the
material<00:01:40.360> basically<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> crowbar<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.550> ends

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
material basically a crowbar the ends

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.870 
material basically a crowbar the ends
cut<00:01:44.000> off<00:01:44.210> going<00:01:44.570> into<00:01:44.750> a<00:01:44.900> socket<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:46.640> then<00:01:46.820> a

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
cut off going into a socket and then a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.469 
cut off going into a socket and then a
modified<00:01:53.170> extension<00:01:54.399> with<00:01:55.399> some<00:01:55.759> three<00:01:56.210> flat

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
modified extension with some three flat

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.940 
modified extension with some three flat
spots<00:01:56.869> ground<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.619> it

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
spots ground in it

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.350 
spots ground in it
for<00:02:00.160> grip<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:02.479> a<00:02:02.540> regular<00:02:02.960> drill<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:05.060> glove

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
for grip and a regular drill and a glove

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.719 
for grip and a regular drill and a glove
and<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.720> little<00:02:05.990> bit<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.259> common<00:02:07.190> sense<00:02:07.220> don't

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
and a little bit of common sense don't

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.600 
and a little bit of common sense don't
grab<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.209> thing<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.450> grip<00:02:08.810> your<00:02:08.959> hand<00:02:09.140> off

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
grab the thing and grip your hand off

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.710 
grab the thing and grip your hand off
alright<00:02:10.610> should<00:02:10.850> get<00:02:11.000> another<00:02:11.180> handle<00:02:11.630> or

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
alright should get another handle or

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.960 
alright should get another handle or
something<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.230> don't<00:02:12.500> know<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.550> that's<00:02:13.700> what<00:02:13.850> I

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
something I don't know but that's what I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.150 
something I don't know but that's what I
got
