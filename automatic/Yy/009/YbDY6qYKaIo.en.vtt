stable<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.600> now<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:52.289> course<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:52.860> also<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
night we seem to be more stable than the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.510 
night we seem to be more stable than the
stable<00:01:00.000> rom<00:01:00.210> itself<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.559> if<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:01.949> pop<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.340> into

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
stable rom itself so if we pop up into

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670 
stable rom itself so if we pop up into
settings<00:01:03.120> where<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.600> get<00:01:03.809> some<00:01:04.140> interface

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
settings where we get some interface

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039 
settings where we get some interface
options<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.000> three<00:01:06.330> different<00:01:06.510> menus

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the first one is lock screen so if we

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.850 
the first one is lock screen so if we
pop<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.750> me<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.960> lock<00:01:10.170> screen<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.619> could<00:01:10.770> do
