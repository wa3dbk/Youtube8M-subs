Angelina Jolie cat eye look I'm asked to

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.729 
Angelina Jolie cat eye look I'm asked to
do<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.270> look<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.630> lot<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.080> red<00:03:28.230> carpet

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
do this look a lot on the red carpet

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.320 
do this look a lot on the red carpet
because<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.070> think<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.520> pairs<00:03:29.790> really<00:03:29.970> well

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
because I think it pairs really well

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.180 
because I think it pairs really well
with<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.720> nude<00:03:31.050> lip<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.680> makes<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.040> eyes

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
with a nude lip and it makes the eyes

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.460 
with a nude lip and it makes the eyes
pop<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.880> they<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.540> stand<00:03:33.810> out<00:03:34.050> on<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.260> red

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
pop so they really stand out on the red

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.810 
pop so they really stand out on the red
