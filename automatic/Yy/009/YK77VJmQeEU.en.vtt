anybody who's using a computer and on a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.750 
anybody who's using a computer and on a
mouse<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.690> lot<00:00:15.929> when<00:00:16.800> you're<00:00:16.949> using<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.460> standard

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
mouse a lot when you're using a standard

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.929 
mouse a lot when you're using a standard
Mouse<00:00:18.480> there<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.890> micro<00:00:20.430> movements

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
Mouse there are little micro movements

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
Mouse there are little micro movements
that<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.810> move<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.289> whole

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that you have to do to move the whole

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.689 
that you have to do to move the whole
base<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.510> mouse<00:00:24.689> itself<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.699> basically

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
base of the mouse itself and basically

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.250 
base of the mouse itself and basically
when<00:00:26.939> you're<00:00:27.060> doing<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.510> you're<00:00:27.779> activating

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
when you're doing this you're activating

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.080 
when you're doing this you're activating
muscles<00:00:28.800> all<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> way<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.400> through<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> hand

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
muscles all the way up through the hand

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.520 
muscles all the way up through the hand
arm<00:00:30.660> shoulder<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:32.759> upper<00:00:33.059> back<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.600> all<00:00:34.410> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
arm shoulder the upper back and all of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.590 
arm shoulder the upper back and all of
these<00:00:34.680> muscles<00:00:35.040> attach<00:00:35.370> into<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> neck<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
these muscles attach into the neck and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.810 
these muscles attach into the neck and
so<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.469> micro<00:00:37.800> movements<00:00:38.250> over<00:00:38.489> time

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
so with these micro movements over time

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
so with these micro movements over time
you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.390> wind<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> what's<00:00:40.079> called<00:00:40.290> an

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you can wind up in what's called an

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.520 
you can wind up in what's called an
overuse<00:00:40.829> syndrome<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.960> doing

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
overuse syndrome is that the the doing

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.709 
overuse syndrome is that the the doing
this<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.920> eight<00:00:44.610> hours<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.000> day<00:00:45.090> five<00:00:45.420> days<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
this for eight hours a day five days a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.670 
this for eight hours a day five days a
week<00:00:45.870> some<00:00:46.800> weekly<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:48.000> basically<00:00:48.719> you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
week some weekly here basically you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.549 
week some weekly here basically you
develop<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> lot<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.910> chronic<00:00:51.570> issues<00:00:52.260> with

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
develop a lot of chronic issues with

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.040 
develop a lot of chronic issues with
these<00:00:52.739> muscles<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> joints<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.750> can

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
these muscles and the joints it can

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.889 
these muscles and the joints it can
complicate<00:00:55.440> carpal<00:00:56.129> tunnel<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.510> set<00:00:57.780> up

complicate carpal tunnel I can set up

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
complicate carpal tunnel I can set up
tendinitis<00:00:58.649> issues<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> elbow<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.149> a

that those knots are in anchor into the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.840 
that those knots are in anchor into the
neck<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.650> eventually<00:01:13.979> pull<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.610> spine

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

functions of the human body so this can
really<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:20.670> overall<00:01:20.939> health<00:01:21.270> issue<00:01:21.479> not

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
really be an overall health issue not

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
really be an overall health issue not
just<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.470> localized<00:01:22.979> pain<00:01:23.310> syndrome<00:01:23.939> type<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
just a localized pain syndrome type of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.330 
just a localized pain syndrome type of
thing<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.770> are<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.220> about

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
thing so what are you going to do about

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.399 
thing so what are you going to do about
it<00:01:26.520> basically<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:27.960> recommend

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it basically what we do is recommend

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
it basically what we do is recommend
using<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.920> trackball<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.820> trackball<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:32.520> unit

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
using a trackball a trackball is a unit

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
using a trackball a trackball is a unit
that<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.110> doesn't<00:01:34.560> move<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.460> when<00:01:35.549> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
that it doesn't move they think when you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
that it doesn't move they think when you
rest<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:36.060> hand<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.170> little

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
rest your hand on it and this little

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.890 
rest your hand on it and this little
ball<00:01:37.740> moves<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.540> move<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
ball moves on there and you just move it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.450 
ball moves on there and you just move it
with<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.140> fingertips<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.860> clickers<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.369> on

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
with your fingertips the clickers are on

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.660 
with your fingertips the clickers are on
the<00:01:41.579> side<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:43.439> essence<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.220> you're<00:01:44.399> using

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the side so in essence when you're using

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.249 
the side so in essence when you're using
these<00:01:46.909> as<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.780> only<00:01:48.930> thing<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
these as you can see the only thing this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.319 
movie are my finger tips I'm not moving
any<00:01:52.560> muscles<00:01:53.220> all<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> way<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.880> through<00:01:54.119> here

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
any muscles all the way up through here

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.149 
any muscles all the way up through here
so<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.689> takes<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.439> tension<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
so it takes out a lot of tension and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.999 
so it takes out a lot of tension and
stress<00:01:56.250> over<00:01:56.880> time<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.350> start<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> do

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
stress over time and when we start to do

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
stress over time and when we start to do
that<00:01:59.219> you're<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> world<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that you're going to just see a world of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.480 
that you're going to just see a world of
difference<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.469> how<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.680> feel<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> this

difference in how you feel and this

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.200 
difference in how you feel and this
muscle<00:02:02.790> tension<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.450> fatigue<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:05.210> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
muscle tension and fatigue and and the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.850 
muscle tension and fatigue and and the
stress<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.810> physical<00:02:07.170> stress<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
stress the physical stress that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.380 
stress the physical stress that
that<00:02:08.160> you're<00:02:08.340> feeling<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.789> your<00:02:08.940> upper<00:02:09.240> back
