shots a couple different sides and go

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.460 
shots a couple different sides and go
through<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> slow<00:00:35.570> but<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.690> basically<00:00:36.960> seven

head outside high seat right here that's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.319 
head outside high seat right here that's
the<00:00:45.750> first<00:00:45.780> one<00:00:46.310> second<00:00:47.310> one<00:00:47.340> still<00:00:47.970> step<00:00:48.210> in

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the first one second one still step in

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.140 
the first one second one still step in
with<00:00:48.450> your<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.600> leg<00:00:48.750> sweep<00:00:49.350> single<00:00:50.150> right

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
here those are the most basic to head

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.080 
here those are the most basic to head
outside<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.260> see<00:00:55.680> head<00:00:56.100> inside<00:00:56.400> sweep<00:00:56.670> single

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
outside I see head inside sweep single

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.210 
outside I see head inside sweep single
then<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:58.079> start<00:00:58.380> to<00:00:58.530> step<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.040> up<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.130> little

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
then you start to step it up a little

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.880 
then you start to step it up a little
bit<00:00:59.400> to<00:00:59.520> some<00:00:59.640> inside<00:01:00.060> reach<00:01:00.300> stuff<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.930> inside

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
bit to some inside reach stuff so inside

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.329 
bit to some inside reach stuff so inside
reach<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.540> side<00:01:03.780> again<00:01:04.559> always<00:01:05.040> step

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
reach to the same side again always step

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.319 
reach to the same side again always step
with<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:05.729> foot<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> step

single and then number seven your
thought<00:01:48.090> okay<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.950> seven<00:01:50.280> shots<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.570> again

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
thought okay so seven shots do it again

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.580 
thought okay so seven shots do it again
from<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> other<00:01:52.110> side

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
from the other side

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800 
from the other side
that'll<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> little<00:01:53.369> faster<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.420> seven

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
that'll do it a little faster so seven

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.679 
that'll do it a little faster so seven
shots<00:01:55.049> number<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:55.560> head<00:01:56.040> outside

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
shots number one head outside
