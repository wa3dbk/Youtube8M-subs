00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260 

um<00:01:48.860> well<00:01:49.310> we<00:01:49.430> started<00:01:49.700> off<00:01:49.790> pretty<00:01:49.940> hard

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
um well we started off pretty hard

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.750 
um well we started off pretty hard
pretty<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:51.500> all<00:01:51.590> went<00:01:51.740> out<00:01:51.860> pretty<00:01:52.010> solid<00:01:52.550> and

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
pretty we all went out pretty solid and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.150 
pretty we all went out pretty solid and
so<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.480> think<00:01:53.570> that<00:01:53.720> was<00:01:53.900> really<00:01:54.110> good<00:01:54.410> to<00:01:54.620> set

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
so I think that was really good to set

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160 
so I think that was really good to set
us<00:01:55.280> up<00:01:55.400> for<00:01:55.460> like<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.120> good<00:01:56.330> rhythm<00:01:56.540> throughout

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
us up for like a good rhythm throughout

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.560 
us up for like a good rhythm throughout
the<00:01:57.350> race<00:01:57.530> rather<00:01:57.860> than<00:01:57.980> taking<00:01:58.250> off<00:01:58.490> easy<00:01:59.120> so

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
the race rather than taking off easy so

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.870 
the race rather than taking off easy so
I<00:01:59.870> liked<00:02:00.230> that<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.800> I'm<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.700> middle

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
I liked that that I'm in the middle

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.880 
I liked that that I'm in the middle
stages<00:02:02.210> like<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.080> think<00:02:03.410> I<00:02:03.470> got<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.620> bit<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.830> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
stages like I think I got a bit of a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.860 
stages like I think I got a bit of a
lead<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.820> early<00:02:05.120> stages<00:02:05.360> but<00:02:05.690> then

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
lead in the early stages but then

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.200 
lead in the early stages but then
through<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> middle<00:02:07.220> Lauren<00:02:07.820> caught<00:02:08.000> up

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
through the middle Lauren caught up

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.210 
through the middle Lauren caught up
quite<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.780> lot<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.229> put<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.830> big<00:02:09.950> challenge

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
quite a lot and put in a big challenge

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.420 
quite a lot and put in a big challenge
and<00:02:10.520> actually<00:02:10.790> went<00:02:11.750> past<00:02:11.990> me<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:13.280> was

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
and actually went past me so it was

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.280 
and actually went past me so it was
pretty<00:02:13.550> hard<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.910> kind<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.180> had<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.540> try<00:02:15.170> and
