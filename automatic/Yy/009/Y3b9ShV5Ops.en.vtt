00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 hi guys then this is a little one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.620
 video tutorial to show you the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.420
 products and if I have tried leader I have 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.949
 made a fairly simple trick 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.670
 part of the mouth and nothing I show you 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:24.750
 what I used 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 hello here it is then I did one 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:36.050
 base with double wear number 2 n 1 not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.480
 so desert berici 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 after which I used the corrector 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:53.610
 always double wear number one the other is 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 and then the earth here it is to do a little 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:04.379
 feeling with cir in water when 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:09.740
 this 01 light owns points spaces then 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.880
 on the eye I will touch the eye the other 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:18.119
 with you then 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:23.240
 the palette is the number 02 ivory tower e 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.960
 contains these colors here a lot 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.060
 natural 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.130
 then I used this clearer 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 under the eyebrow I go with my fingers 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.770
 so even those without brushes can 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.970
 then do it with this butter-colored ping 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.340
 how like to say to those who do 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:56.850
 they mean trick I go on the eyelid 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:00.109
 mobile is a very simple trick and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.520
 fast beach 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:09.690
 so after that I take mine 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:13.799
 brush the gradient this and I go 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.840
 first with this clearer all with 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:19.830
 dove and I go to outline the banana 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.900
 eye 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.090
 then with this darker little done well 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.650
 I go 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:36.860
 such that happens way to create 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.860
 the most marked shading 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.230
 ok practically the eye makeup is almost 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.370
 made use of this beloved by 0 2 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.069
 coffee double wear always read 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.790
 we never think we will never put the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.599
 fire goes well is a simple pencil 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.930
 pencil and I'm going to use it in the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.930
 rhyme of the eye as if it were a laimer 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:21.280
 the blush I put only on one side 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:27.110
 which is the 17 purecolor blush this 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.900
 here it is and it is a wild suns cm but it is not 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.700
 a lot going out but that otherwise 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:39.520
 I would n't have put it because I was skiing 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.520
 like it has no sbrilluccichio indeed 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:03.660
 the trick is practically completed for 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:08.900
 the day could go very well this way 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:13.500
 if we want to transform it for the evening 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.030
 just add this which is a pencil 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.660
 for the lips and not even seen 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.150
 this is the number 07 clearly 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:31.370
 red 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:31.370
 But first let's fix everything in place 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:43.550
 someone opened it first light medium 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.550
 and the powder is the powder 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:36.220
 the lipstick that is this the 340 light 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:44.080
