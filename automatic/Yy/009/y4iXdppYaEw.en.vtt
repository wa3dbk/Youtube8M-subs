medium when it dries it's very shiny and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.010 
medium when it dries it's very shiny and
hard<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.220> you<00:00:43.370> can<00:00:43.550> mix<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.059> two<00:00:44.090> for<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.600> satin

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
hard and you can mix the two for a satin

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:57.840 
hard and you can mix the two for a satin
finish<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:51.760> let's<00:00:52.760> add<00:00:55.899> this<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:57.110> matte<00:00:57.440> medium

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
finish so let's add this is matte medium

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.819 
finish so let's add this is matte medium
matte<00:00:58.850> medium<00:00:59.059> as<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.630> comes<00:00:59.870> from<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.350> jar<00:01:00.620> is

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
matte medium as it comes from the jar is

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:10.499 
matte medium as it comes from the jar is
pourable<00:01:07.660> that's<00:01:08.660> quite<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:08.960> bit<00:01:09.200> isn't<00:01:09.380> it

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
pourable that's quite a bit isn't it

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.240 
pourable that's quite a bit isn't it
let's<00:01:11.509> see<00:01:11.690> if<00:01:11.720> we<00:01:11.869> can<00:01:12.020> save<00:01:12.380> some<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:12.860> half

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.080 

so<00:01:16.250> we'll<00:01:16.399> mix<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:16.910> together<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:19.090> depending

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
so we'll mix this together and depending

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.920 
so we'll mix this together and depending
on<00:01:20.149> how<00:01:20.509> much<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.020> mix<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:24.590> thins<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.930> extends

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
on how much you mix it thins and extends

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.969 
on how much you mix it thins and extends
and<00:01:27.140> makes<00:01:27.890> your<00:01:28.070> acrylic<00:01:28.580> paints

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
and makes your acrylic paints

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.179 
and makes your acrylic paints
translucent<00:01:30.979> or<00:01:31.130> transparent<00:01:32.060> a<00:01:33.070> little<00:01:34.070> bit

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
translucent or transparent a little bit

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.030 
translucent or transparent a little bit
more<00:01:34.369> paint<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:35.000> mixture<00:01:37.960> there<00:01:39.040> it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
more paint to this mixture there it

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.420 
more paint to this mixture there it
really<00:01:40.430> extends<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.570> volume<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.500> paint<00:01:43.189> that

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
really extends the volume of paint that

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.320 
really extends the volume of paint that
you<00:01:43.460> can<00:01:43.790> get<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:45.530> makes<00:01:45.830> for<00:01:46.220> a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
you can get and it makes for a

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.999 
you can get and it makes for a
transparent<00:01:47.330> layer<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.869> again<00:01:48.259> just<00:01:48.650> like

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
transparent layer and again just like

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.850 
transparent layer and again just like
adding<00:01:49.430> water<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.450> can<00:01:50.720> let<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.259> layer<00:01:51.500> dry

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
adding water you can let that layer dry

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.760 
adding water you can let that layer dry
add<00:01:52.820> matte<00:01:53.330> medium<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.900> another<00:01:54.229> color<00:01:54.530> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
add matte medium to another color and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.640 
add matte medium to another color and
layer<00:01:55.340> over<00:01:55.729> top<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.420> then<00:01:56.900> visually

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
layer over top of it and then visually

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.200 
layer over top of it and then visually
the<00:01:57.830> light<00:01:58.040> will<00:01:58.250> go<00:01:58.280> through<00:01:58.759> both<00:01:58.939> layers

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
the light will go through both layers

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.569 
the light will go through both layers
and<00:01:59.570> you'll<00:02:00.140> get<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.380> mixture<00:02:00.799> of<00:02:00.950> those<00:02:01.310> two

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
and you'll get a mixture of those two

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.200 
and you'll get a mixture of those two
colors<00:02:01.850> using<00:02:02.570> light<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:03.430> have<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.460> brush<00:02:04.850> load

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.890 
this molding paste that's quite a bit
isn't<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:10.040> lot<00:03:11.150> I'm<00:03:12.150> going<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.390> hold<00:03:12.599> this

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
isn't it a lot I'm going to hold this

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.819 
isn't it a lot I'm going to hold this
close<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.530> surface<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.269> force<00:03:15.269> this

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
close to the surface and force this

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.729 
close to the surface and force this
through<00:03:16.829> my<00:03:17.220> screen<00:03:18.170> right<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.709> my

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
through my screen right on to my

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.430 
through my screen right on to my
painting<00:03:20.129> surface<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:24.359> when<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.540> lift<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.200> you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
painting surface and when I lift it you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.210 
painting surface and when I lift it you
get<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.459> very<00:03:27.150> cool<00:03:27.569> raised<00:03:28.379> almost<00:03:29.040> like<00:03:29.190> a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
get a very cool raised almost like a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.660 
get a very cool raised almost like a
relief<00:03:29.989> sculptural<00:03:30.989> effect<00:03:31.799> with<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
relief sculptural effect with the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.080 
relief sculptural effect with the
molding<00:03:33.239> paste<00:03:33.980> allow<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.430> dry<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:36.030> you

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
molding paste allow that to dry and you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.170 
molding paste allow that to dry and you
can<00:03:36.510> paint<00:03:36.900> right<00:03:37.109> over<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:38.519> can<00:03:38.640> also<00:03:38.849> do

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
can paint right over it you can also do

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.080 
can paint right over it you can also do
this<00:03:41.030> here's<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.090> big<00:03:42.359> glob<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:43.129> molding<00:03:44.129> paste

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
this here's a big glob of molding paste

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.280 
this here's a big glob of molding paste
and<00:03:45.390> let's<00:03:45.780> add<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:47.760> CAD<00:03:48.180> red<00:03:48.510> light<00:03:48.989> and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
and let's add this to CAD red light and

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.699 
and let's add this to CAD red light and
my<00:03:50.040> palette<00:03:53.690> will<00:03:54.690> mix<00:03:54.989> those<00:03:55.290> two<00:03:55.560> together

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
my palette will mix those two together

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.830 
my palette will mix those two together
and<00:03:57.739> now<00:03:58.739> we're<00:03:58.919> going<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.099> force<00:03:59.489> this

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
and now we're going to force this

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.660 
and now we're going to force this
through<00:04:00.840> my<00:04:01.019> screen

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.050 

so<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.480> doesn't<00:04:08.810> have<00:04:08.990> to<00:04:09.140> always<00:04:09.350> be<00:04:09.530> just<00:04:10.190> the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
so it doesn't have to always be just the

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.300 
so it doesn't have to always be just the
molding<00:04:11.540> paste<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.990> can<00:04:12.140> add<00:04:12.410> color<00:04:12.770> to<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:13.190> as

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
molding paste you can add color to it as

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.900 
molding paste you can add color to it as
well<00:04:13.490> its<00:04:14.360> neck

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
well its neck

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:27.410 
well its neck
