00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.100
 Hi my chick! You know who called me? 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500
 Chicken, do you know who called me? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.800
 I told you not to talk about my ex! 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 No, it was not him! 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
 This one, very beautiful! The perfect! 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 Who I told you that I see him often! 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.800
 I gave him my number and now 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.800
 he just called me ... 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.300
 He invited me to go for a drink! 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.300
 But I call you because I have a big problem! How should I dress? 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.000
 A lot of literature like Plato, Machado, Paulo Coelho. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 Years of study in the uniform! 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 No, that's not true, because I was not in uniform! 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.800
 Why? 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 If in the end, the big question is: 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.000
 How should I dress? 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.000
 Shit! 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Oh, I do not know! 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000
 Several days to invite him! 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.800
 Just today he called me? 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.200
 I'm horrible! 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 Look at my dark circles! 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 No, and my nails? Catastrophe ... 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 No and this button? 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.800
 Who came out, just today! 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 Hair removal? 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.500
 No, I did not get shaved! 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 How can I be careful? 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.800
 I did not have time for anything this week 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.800
 Do you think it's going to work? 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 What clothes? 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.500
 I do not know anything! 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.700
 A dress? 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.500
 A dress? 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.000
 No, I'm not going in dress 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.000
 He may think that I am very sexy and that I facilitate 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.000
 I know that the dress is sexier! 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 But I have to pretend I do not know he wants me! 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 No no! it can not be anything tight if not he will see my fat and my cellulite! 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.800
 Chicken, We must hide what we are and let him think we are thin until he is in love! 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 It's decided! I'm going in jeans ... 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 And what's the blouse? 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 Sleeveless? 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.500
 Like that, with breasts in the air? 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Or I do not know 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 I have to show my breasts a little? 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
 Anyway, chick if he takes me to the restaurant, 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 I will be the dessert 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 If he takes me to the cinema 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.800
 I will also be the dessert! 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.800
 If he even takes me to an orthodontic congress, 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.500
 I will be the dessert! 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.300
 Just a light makeup! Nothing very strong! 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.000
 I do not want him to believe that I prepared for him! 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.000
 Just make up the eyes 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Because it will begin with historie: Your eyes are the most beautiful of the world. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
 He's going to say that the eyes are the first thing he looks at in a woman. 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.000
 Ok, Ok! I have to go! Prepare myself! 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 Ok, ok, no worries! 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Yes of course I'll call you! Tomorrow I tell you everything, ok? 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.000
 Hi! Kisses! 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
 Wish me good luck! 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.500
 Ok, kisses, chick! 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 Hi! Poulette? 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
 Yes, Yes, I did the make-up! 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.800
 No, I was not in a dress! 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 In jeans! 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 With breasts in evidence! 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.700
 I was very beautiful! Very beautiful! 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And then nothing ... 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 He had not come! 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 And while I pretended I was not disappointed! 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
 I pretended I believed him. He thought I believed him! 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 There you go! At least he phoned me!
