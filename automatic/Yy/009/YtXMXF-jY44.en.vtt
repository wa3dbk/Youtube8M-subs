00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
different atmosphere this greatly

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520 
different atmosphere this greatly
increases<00:01:54.450> my<00:01:54.570> chances<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> player

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
increases my chances that the player

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
increases my chances that the player
will<00:01:55.710> extend<00:01:56.070> his<00:01:56.280> contract<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:57.000> club

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
will extend his contract with my club

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.730 
will extend his contract with my club
and<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:57.780> leave<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.439> he<00:01:58.560> feels

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and not leave because he feels

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.770 
and not leave because he feels
uncomfortable<00:01:59.460> or<00:01:59.640> disrespected

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.840
