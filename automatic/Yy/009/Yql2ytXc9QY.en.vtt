00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.380 

and<00:04:32.800> with<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.100> chef<00:04:33.370> C<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.240> stove<00:04:34.950> it's<00:04:35.950> now

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
and with the chef C in a stove it's now

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.540 
and with the chef C in a stove it's now
quite<00:04:37.390> rigid<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.380> I'm<00:04:38.560> a<00:04:38.650> lot<00:04:38.800> happier<00:04:38.830> with

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
quite rigid and I'm a lot happier with

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.150 
quite rigid and I'm a lot happier with
it<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:41.620> as<00:04:42.250> we<00:04:42.460> can<00:04:42.610> see<00:04:43.560> by<00:04:44.560> putting<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.070> on

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
it and as we can see by putting it on

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.460 
it and as we can see by putting it on
the<00:04:45.370> plane<00:04:48.120> it's<00:04:49.120> quite<00:04:49.570> square

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.189 

so

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.390 

that's<00:04:57.800> good<00:04:58.599> it<00:04:59.599> also<00:04:59.780> runs<00:05:00.409> in<00:05:00.919> a<00:05:01.009> straight

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
that's good it also runs in a straight

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.499 
that's good it also runs in a straight
line<00:05:01.569> without<00:05:02.569> diverting<00:05:03.560> from<00:05:04.330> from<00:05:05.330> the

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
line without diverting from from the

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:17.100 
line without diverting from from the
right<00:05:05.749> to<00:05:06.409> the<00:05:06.560> left

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.950 

also<00:05:18.110> sits<00:05:18.500> quite<00:05:19.040> squarely<00:05:19.520> on<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:20.120> tabletop

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
also sits quite squarely on the tabletop

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:29.790 
also sits quite squarely on the tabletop
as<00:05:21.410> well<00:05:22.660> when<00:05:23.660> you<00:05:23.780> push<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:24.290> the<00:05:24.410> corner

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.770 

so

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
so

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.429 
so
there's<00:05:32.350> no<00:05:33.450> need<00:05:34.450> for<00:05:34.480> any

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.929 

vertical<00:05:41.030> movement<00:05:42.030> or<00:05:42.240> suspension<00:05:42.860> for

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:43.939 
vertical movement or suspension for

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:54.100 
vertical movement or suspension for
compensation<00:05:46.039> but<00:05:47.039> there<00:05:47.280> is<00:05:48.889> when<00:05:49.889> provided

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.640 

lateral<00:05:55.110> movement<00:05:55.679> I<00:05:55.889> think

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:07.040 

this<00:06:00.580> axle

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.810 

which<00:06:07.620> is<00:06:07.800> necessary<00:06:08.580> for<00:06:08.850> points<00:06:10.520> this<00:06:11.520> one's

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
which is necessary for points this one's

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.250 
which is necessary for points this one's
rigid<00:06:12.560> and<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:13.680> wheels<00:06:14.570> learn<00:06:15.570> quite<00:06:15.930> freely

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
rigid and the wheels learn quite freely

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.480 
rigid and the wheels learn quite freely
the<00:06:19.340> compensation<00:06:20.340> isn't<00:06:20.640> required<00:06:22.490> because

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
the compensation isn't required because

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.980 
the compensation isn't required because
I've<00:06:23.820> taken<00:06:24.060> my<00:06:24.390> time

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.529 

and<00:06:29.530> it's<00:06:29.710> perfectly<00:06:30.310> flat<00:06:30.729> and<00:06:31.270> square<00:06:31.509> so

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
and it's perfectly flat and square so

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.310 
and it's perfectly flat and square so
now

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
now

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.780 
now
