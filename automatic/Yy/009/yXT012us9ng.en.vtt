00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.830
 The temperature of objects is only a measure of the vibration of atoms 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.030
 The molecules that make up this vibration thing have a higher temperature 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.090
 Vibration less temperature less 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 Of course when the temperature rises the thing is hot and when it goes down 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.190
 Its temperature is cold. Right? 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.820
 Mmmmmmm not exactly 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.350
 If you touch a metal piece and a book that was in the fridge, it will be a piece of metal 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.640
 Much colder, Derrick experimented with it and published it on his channel (Veritasium) 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.109
 But you have to try it yourself to believe it! The book is actually metal 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.980
 At one temperature as the temperature gauge shows, but the metal feel colder 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.730
 This is not a mental trick, we find the metal colder 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.160
 Of the book for a very physical reason: metal conveyor and insulating paper 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.540
 Energy, or vibrations of particles, is absorbed by our hands faster 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.969
 Even if the heat of the book and the metal were the same 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.350
 The metal causes the temperature of our hands to fall faster and so we feel 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.989
 The metal is colder, because the temperature of our hands is what we really feel 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.289
 It is just as the mercury thermometer measures only its temperature 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:08.740
 Then you can indirectly measure the temperature of things by placing them 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.319
 In contact with him 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.420
 Similarly, the sensory nerves in our skin can only measure temperature 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.799
 The skin itself is nothing else. When we touch something, we do not feel 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.279
 But we feel its impact on our skin, meaning: how fast and 

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:27.929
 It is transferred to its thermal capacity, which is the vibration of molecules from us and to us 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.409
 The heat transfer power is the reason why the heat of the steam is above the top of your stove 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.259
 Look higher than the hot air dry blow of the franc, even if the oven 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.719
 It has a higher temperature, the water vapor moves the vibration of particles to your skin 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:41.810
 More than normal air 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.499
 In fact, it is tempting to say that hot and cold are completely different 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.669
 (High temperature) and (low temperature) even if we confuse the two expressions 

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:55.119
 A word (hot) means: it gives a lot of energy, but (high temperature) means: 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.429
 It has a great deal of energy. As anyone who works in fundraising knows, if someone owns one 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.429
 Too much, does not mean that they are given a lot of it.
