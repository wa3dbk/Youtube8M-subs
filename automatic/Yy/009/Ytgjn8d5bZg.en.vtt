00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.569
 Hi, I'm Manuel Becerra and this is water 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.149
 tv and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.510
 How to install the 150 gallon kit 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.520
 bullrich life time 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.950
 now the kit that is what contains the 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.770
 What kit it contains is this one 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.900
 container cast where to see the membrane goes 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.810
 to have these is like brackets for 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.770
 can hold this on his filter 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.510
 existing and brings no hose to be able 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.300
 do the facilities since they are going to 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.140
 need to make some modifications 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.590
 now first of all because 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.989
 they would need to install this this kit what 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.040
 what you are going to do is reduce the 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.550
 amount of water that are 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.530
 wasting in the system basically 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.150
 what you are going to do is the water that comes out of 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.559
 waste of one of the membranes is 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.350
 is going to put the next one to the other 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.909
 membrane and that membrane will purify 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.720
 water that comes a little bit filtered 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.360
 then the water that we are 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.070
 wasting instead of throwing it away 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.769
 drainage we will go through a second 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.030
 membrane and then we will recover 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.370
 water from there then that's going to help us 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.940
 to reduce water there and therefore the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.140
 spending our water consumption not 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.430
 apart from that it will make the membrane 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.730
 makes the second membrane be more 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.190
 efficient and I do not know 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.990
 it's over so soon now what is it 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.420
 you need to be able to do this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 installation they need that pressure on 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 your home is at least 65 psi not 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.840
 I know if you can see here more or less 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.260
 If you have this valve, you should be 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.510
 the needle here in this part in 65 yes 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.200
 they do not have that pressure they will not be able to 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.180
 install it 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.369
 the kit so nothing else what they are going to have 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.130
 what to do is buy an additional pump 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.060
 what is it like I have here is this 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.979
 pump that is what is going to be 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.530
 practically what he's going to do is 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.869
 increase the pressure of the water that 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.929
 receives the system to a much more 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.689
 high then in my case as my pressure 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.890
 of water in the house is 40 psi is not 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.920
 enough then I have to 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.689
 install this then I bought it and 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.689
 be installed but remember if you already have 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.310
 you the right pressure, I do not know 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.500
 they have to buy this do not waste 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.810
 your money in this very well then 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.599
 now we are going to install this part of 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.459
 here and then he taught them how to install the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.720
 the pump not then what's first 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.810
 that we have to do what we have to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.020
 to do is uncover this membrane 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.970
 this container sorry this note does not 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.290
 still does not have the membrane 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.900
 and make sure that the situation does not 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.240
 undo and we're going to put this part of 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.130
 here, be careful when driving 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.020
 always wear gloves is what 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.310
 recommend in the instructions and the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.560
 way they're going to put it on 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.960
 well it's got some plastic on one side 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.700
 blacks and the other side has nothing the 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.110
 black plastics are going to go in 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.730
 that is where these parts of here are 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.730
 then we are going to put it 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.060
 that is well inside and we're going to 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.040
 close 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.750
 so 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.950
 let me close it well because it has to 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.670
 be tight if there can not be 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.670
 leaks and now we go back 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.650
 because since this was what we're going to 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.710
 do is place the brackets nothing more 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.560
 here in the container so that we 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.660
 help hold the other not 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.680
 so 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.150
 just the pressure comes in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.310
 and what we are going to do now is 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.709
 place it in the system here now 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.180
 Although this kit is from bulkh supply 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.969
 and they recommend it with their system 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.439
 reverse orishas works for 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:32.090
 many others like in my case the spectra 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.500
 worse then if you have this 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.840
 they know that if it's going to be left 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.250
 because I 'm doing it right now 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.810
 well now what is next since 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.689
 they put this here what we are going to do 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.209
 is the following from the hose that comes out 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.469
 of coal from the carbon filter that 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.090
 is here that is what they were with 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.010
 feeding you originally your 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.349
 membrane what we're going to do is take it out 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.610
 and we will connect it in the new 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.550
 membrane 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.880
 then he also has to go there he comes 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.880
 in 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.040
 and now what we have to do is what 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.200
 following 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.640
 This kit has two tubes if they are given 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.250
 one account is shorter than another 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.990
 seeing it from this point of view the 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.410
 shorter is the one that will have the output 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.610
 of clean water and the one that is longer 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.260
 is the one that will have the water outlet 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.459
 dirty then what are we going to 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.000
 do let's get a hose out of here 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.130
 and we are going to connect it here then 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.330
 leave me the piece of hose and 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.330
 I show you how it's done 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:34.869
 look here what I did was pass the 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:37.580
 membrane exit from here of the new 

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:39.080
 and I went through here because I had one 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.949
 little bit then this way 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.389
 what I'm doing is that there was a 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.360
 little bit more aesthetic and not so 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.330
 loose in the little hose and the only thing 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.550
 we have to do is 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.550
 and connect it at the entrance of the last 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.770
 of the first membrane that we have not 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.389
 let me do it but practically what 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.249
 what they have to do is connect you in 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.919
 this membrane and now let's see what 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.620
 is what follows then what follows is 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.509
 of this first membrane in the xii in the 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.550
 next exit that has this water already 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.409
 comes clean or comes purified by 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.960
 this part then what are we going 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.120
 to do we are going to join the outputs of the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.370
 two membranes down in this hose 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.379
 blue is the outlet of clean water from my 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.740
 another membrane and what I'm going to do is 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:25.469
 join these two with one with a connector 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.009
 of and how will I put them together and 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.849
 I'm going to connect to where the 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:33.029
 hose that is in the following stages 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.650
 that's where it will happen this filter 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.330
 here and then to this then let me 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.520
 I connect that and I show you in the end how 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.530
 everything is left 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.300
 because he was already connected here 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.630
 part that was the water outlet 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.160
 wasted from here 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.380
 it is connected to the entrance of the 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.180
 old membrane that I had and in the 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.790
 old membrane had this output that the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.230
 clean water along with clean water 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.420
 I put the new membrane with this 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.700
 connector and they were connected to the 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.930
 next to the connector that I had 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.970
 originally where the water came from 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:08.300
 clean of this membrane and with that 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.220
 finished the installation of the 150 kit 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.440
 gallons then how can you guys see 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.510
 it's something very simple does not take much 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.510
 nothing but time must be 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:21.080
 mind that in the water pressure of your 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.140
 home not now something they recommend is 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.660
 that the first hour of water generated 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.600
 of this filter should not be used in 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.890
 the fish tank because I do not know I do not know but 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.840
 that's what they recommend in the 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.430
 instructions not then nothing else the 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.640
 first time they generate water we are going to 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.260
 throwing is going to waste a lot yes but 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.420
 it has to be this so that it was cleaned 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.230
 ok I guess the filter does not then 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.360
 That would be all 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.830
 in the other video I'm going to show you how 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.569
 the pump is installed to increase the 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.669
 Pressure 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.050
 and I hope that with this it is clear to you if 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.669
 they like my videos I invite you to 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.289
 They subscribe to my channel and all 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.289
 thumbs up thank you very much
