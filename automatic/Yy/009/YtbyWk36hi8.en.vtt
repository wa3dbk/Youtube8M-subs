00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.830
 hello to all guys and welcome back in 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.570
 this brand new video is from today 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.039
 guys, let's go see my first 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.550
 race on ps 4 with american bikes we are 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.490
 and so much a mess now look 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.590
 what beauty we put in first 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 person look rare in first person 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 as you can see there is truly spectacular 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.620
 quartet is what drives me that me 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.280
 he wants to throw it out as he can't 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.559
 attention I take a bit of skiing I take a 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.190
 bit of jade is that we are seconds now we are 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.579
 first in the bastard they want to throw me 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:53.030
 outside they really are if you look no 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.329
 bastards who have set a trap 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.809
 spectacular from the acacia now I am last 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.550
 will improve I can close the race then 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.880
 I can close the race those guys 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.830
 incredible look like avola chamorro 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.159
 I'm too far ahead attention there 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.420
 someone instead here near me 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.819
 and now I know it passed quickly without it 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.490
 take wake and nothing 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:21.259
 let's go quickly we go to recover 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.249
 others to and hopefully someone 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:29.469
 takes the first car in full this way 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:32.780
 let's get some back then my mom 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.490
 the bad thing about this bike is that 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.649
 the brakes are missing 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.740
 if even if subject to the brakes exist 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.250
 but on this way they do not exist 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:46.549
 then there are those who are sixth mothers 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.179
 you believe have made a trap to me 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.659
 they closed in an absurd way 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.700
 I made an absurd flight but then it was 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.579
 the most beautiful thing I have recovered 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.899
 someone but there are the first ones that don't 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.429
 they can no longer recover 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:07.280
 if you look at how bad it is, it's that 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.819
 we are very close and we are close to each other 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.200
 was left quite like if this race 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.590
 I'm already enjoying the purple with the flight 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.989
 wonderful that I did in the beginning 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.519
 by the we are recovering and that 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.230
 we are recovering 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.950
 mammamia from pro from the from the from from the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.950
 come on come on come on 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.060
 but I was taking the mammamia rock 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.440
 look at the devastation it was 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.620
 happening 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.820
 she really managed to hook up 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.430
 all year end attention why 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.440
 all are gone will swear all are 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.370
 went down into the river 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.320
 but i'm pretty quiet and i am 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.200
 managed to take the road into the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.490
 right time then my mom 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.400
 intention to this car we dodged 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.380
 guys the bad thing about this rare e 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.440
 we're on a bike that has nothing to do with it 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.400
 nothing we walk anything in 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.590
 dirt road in the earth 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.890
 this way is not suitable for the earth 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.720
 But we're doing pretty well 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.459
 we are going well enough that we are 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.620
 first 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.430
 give it to us that we can win 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.000
 and that we are now on the road in the street 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:37.070
 it gets a little bit faster and there is a 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.230
 bit of extra hold was bad 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.700
 I would like to put the last one in one 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.849
 I would like my mom 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.920
 how he dodged that incredible 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:55.379
 attention there is someone right behind 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:59.130
 he's pretty good at me but his hands a 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:01.080
 look at him look at him look at me sta 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.980
 going upstairs 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.090
 no no that happened it is not much anyone 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.549
 of the two but less bad or too cold 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.750
 I made a braking too absurd from the 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.060
 come on come on come on 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.019
 and let's take the trail we take 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.470
 the wake 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.079
 let's take the wake of my mom from the give 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.330
 you win at the last second the boys 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.510
 so left a nice like for this 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.490
 race on ps 4 you win at the last second 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.910
 first position 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.280
