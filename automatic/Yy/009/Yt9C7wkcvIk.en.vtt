surprised but it does i do have all the

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.740 
surprised but it does i do have all the
requirements<00:05:30.450> for<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:31.020> now<00:05:31.200> so<00:05:32.479> hopefully<00:05:33.479> i

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
requirements for it now so hopefully i

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.200

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
change in some extent like but not

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.820 
change in some extent like but not
completely<00:05:40.460> like<00:05:41.460> this<00:05:42.419> is<00:05:42.660> it<00:05:43.470> would<00:05:43.650> it

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
completely like this is it would it

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.300 
completely like this is it would it
would<00:05:43.950> differ<00:05:45.200> chop<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.320> change<00:05:46.470> but<00:05:47.220> there

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
would differ chop and change but there

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
would differ chop and change but there
would<00:05:47.430> be<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.520> lot<00:05:47.580> more<00:05:47.639> pika<00:05:47.940> countries
