alright if you go and build the opposite
direction<00:00:47.300> of<00:00:47.630> your<00:00:47.780> staircase<00:00:49.390> let's<00:00:50.390> start

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
direction of your staircase let's start

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.560 
direction of your staircase let's start
building<00:00:50.810> the<00:00:51.110> opposite<00:00:51.560> way<00:00:52.120> hmm<00:00:53.120> you're

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
building the opposite way hmm you're

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.000 
building the opposite way hmm you're
going<00:00:53.840> up<00:00:53.960> to<00:00:54.110> fari<00:00:54.380> oh<00:00:57.850> hmm<00:00:59.650> like<00:01:00.650> just<00:01:00.800> go

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
going up to fari oh hmm like just go

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.770 
going up to fari oh hmm like just go
sideways<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:01.850> then<00:01:02.000> build<00:01:02.210> one<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.600> other

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
sideways and then build one the other

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.870 
sideways and then build one the other
direction<00:01:03.020> going<00:01:03.650> up<00:01:03.800> will<00:01:04.339> probably<00:01:04.760> hit

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
direction going up will probably hit

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.240 
direction going up will probably hit
land<00:01:06.970> so<00:01:07.970> look<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.150> where<00:01:08.890> ya<00:01:09.890> go<00:01:10.100> in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
land so look this where ya go in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.760 
land so look this where ya go in
sideways<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:10.970> then<00:01:11.090> go<00:01:11.270> complete<00:01:11.780> 180<00:01:12.170> or<00:01:12.740> I

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
sideways and then go complete 180 or I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.850 
sideways and then go complete 180 or I
guess<00:01:13.550> no<00:01:13.880> straight<00:01:14.300> that<00:01:14.540> way<00:01:14.570> yeah<00:01:14.930> straight

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
guess no straight that way yeah straight

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.490 
guess no straight that way yeah straight
that<00:01:16.070> way<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.280> would<00:01:16.369> be<00:01:16.490> good<00:01:20.259> we<00:01:21.259> could<00:01:21.380> just

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
that way it would be good we could just

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.020 
that way it would be good we could just
do<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.650> spiral<00:01:22.190> I<00:01:24.640> think<00:01:25.640> that'd<00:01:25.759> be<00:01:25.910> too

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
do a spiral I think that'd be too

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.499 
do a spiral I think that'd be too
difficult<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.540> get<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.810> slimes<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.350> hop<00:01:27.500> up

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
difficult to get the slimes to hop up

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.560 
difficult to get the slimes to hop up
right<00:01:29.509> did<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:29.720> place<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.110> block<00:01:30.550> yeah<00:01:31.570> it's
