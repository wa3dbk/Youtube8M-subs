your feet right now probably your butt

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.170 
your feet right now probably your butt
because<00:00:56.309> you're<00:00:56.430> probably<00:00:56.579> sitting<00:00:56.910> down

it's beneath your butt too but that's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.099 
it's beneath your butt too but that's
just<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> outer<00:00:59.489> core<00:00:59.850> there's<00:01:00.120> also<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
just the outer core there's also the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.139 
just the outer core there's also the

high as on the surface of the Sun but

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.520 
high as on the surface of the Sun but

unlike the outer core the inner core is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.490 
unlike the outer core the inner core is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
iron you heard me right this is a

iron you heard me right this is a
popular<00:01:12.630> misconception<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.560> earth<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.070> like

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
popular misconception the earth is like

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160 
popular misconception the earth is like
an<00:01:14.549> Everlasting<00:01:15.090> Gobstopper<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.869> three

an Everlasting Gobstopper with three

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
an Everlasting Gobstopper with three
different<00:01:16.320> flavors<00:01:16.650> solid<00:01:17.310> liquid<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> then

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
different flavors solid liquid and then

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.460 
different flavors solid liquid and then
solid<00:01:18.570> again<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
solid again and it's not just like a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
solid again and it's not just like a
teeny<00:01:19.710> tiny<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.130> ball<00:01:20.490> either<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> inner

teeny tiny little ball either the inner

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.080 
teeny tiny little ball either the inner
core<00:01:21.540> has<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> radius<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.409> about<00:01:22.880> 760<00:01:23.880> miles

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
core has a radius of about 760 miles

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539 
core has a radius of about 760 miles
that's<00:01:24.930> 70<00:01:25.350> percent<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> size<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> moon

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that's 70 percent the size of the moon

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.340 
that's 70 percent the size of the moon
so<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> earth<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.750> inexpensive

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so if the earth is this inexpensive

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
so if the earth is this inexpensive
basketball<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.729> picked<00:01:29.909> up

basketball that we just picked up

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
basketball that we just picked up
because<00:01:30.210> no<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.900> our<00:01:31.229> office<00:01:31.560> had<00:01:31.740> one

because<00:01:32.100> none<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> us<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:33.180> outside<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.350> then

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
because none of us go outside the then

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.060 
because none of us go outside the then

the the core the solid inner core of the
earth<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.369> about<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> size<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.270> this

earth would be about the size of this
golf<00:01:40.710> ball<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:41.369> doesn't<00:01:41.790> look<00:01:42.060> very<00:01:42.090> big<00:01:42.630> but

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
golf ball now doesn't look very big but

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.149 
golf ball now doesn't look very big but
this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.890> big<00:01:44.610> friggin<00:01:45.270> Earth<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:46.979> that's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
this is big friggin Earth and so that's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
this is big friggin Earth and so that's
it<00:01:47.340> that's<00:01:47.460> pretty<00:01:47.759> good<00:01:47.909> sized<00:01:48.180> ball<00:01:49.020> of

it that's pretty good sized ball of

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.280 
it that's pretty good sized ball of
nickel<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> iron<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.540> nickel<00:01:52.079> and

so hot that it all became molten in
gooey<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.020> why<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.200> earth<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
gooey and this is why the earth is a

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.610 
gooey and this is why the earth is a
sphere<00:02:26.360> which<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.510> convenient<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.080> us<00:02:28.319> when

inner core of the earth that continues
to<00:02:41.910> expand<00:02:42.239> today<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> know<00:02:42.930> what<00:02:43.050> you're

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
to expand today but I know what you're

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.930 
to expand today but I know what you're
thinking<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.709> 90<00:02:44.040> 800<00:02:44.489> degrees<00:02:44.730> down

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.759 
thinking it's like 90 800 degrees down
there<00:02:45.120> why<00:02:45.300> isn't<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.900> big<00:02:46.140> metal<00:02:46.530> ball

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
there why isn't that big metal ball

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.530 
there why isn't that big metal ball
slowly<00:02:47.190> melting<00:02:47.670> away<00:02:47.760> because<00:02:48.269> it's<00:02:48.420> not

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
slowly melting away because it's not

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.270 
slowly melting away because it's not
only<00:02:48.720> very<00:02:48.840> very<00:02:48.900> hot<00:02:49.290> down<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:49.799> it's<00:02:50.130> also

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
only very very hot down there it's also

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.460 
only very very hot down there it's also
under<00:02:50.580> extreme<00:02:51.180> amount<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.840> pressure<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.380> as

under extreme amount of pressure and as

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.830 
under extreme amount of pressure and as
the<00:02:52.620> pressure<00:02:52.890> goes<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.970> does<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.480> melting

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the pressure goes up so does the melting

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
the pressure goes up so does the melting
point<00:02:55.049> of<00:02:55.200> iron<00:02:55.380> which<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.769> good<00:02:56.100> because<00:02:56.489> we

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
point of iron which is good because we

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.970 
point of iron which is good because we

want the outer core to stick around for
as<00:02:59.099> long<00:02:59.130> as<00:02:59.280> possible<00:02:59.790> it's<00:02:59.970> pretty

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
as long as possible it's pretty

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.940 
as long as possible it's pretty

dramatically<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.130> here<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.430> surface<00:03:29.670> of

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.099 
convection is no longer going on maybe
because<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.100> some<00:03:44.250> dramatic<00:03:44.880> asteroid<00:03:45.750> impact

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
and it no longer has a magnetic field so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.729 
and it no longer has a magnetic field so

radiation shielding as for Earth since
we<00:03:53.639> can't<00:03:54.209> imagine<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.959> situation<00:03:55.139> in<00:03:55.680> which<00:03:55.829> we

we can't imagine a situation in which we

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.670 
we can't imagine a situation in which we

earth we'll never really know what's

earth we'll never really know what's
down<00:04:00.420> there<00:04:00.720> we<00:04:00.900> can<00:04:01.019> really<00:04:01.200> say<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.709> that

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
down there we can really say is that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.379 
down there we can really say is that
things<00:04:02.100> out<00:04:02.220> there<00:04:02.340> are<00:04:02.459> very<00:04:02.700> different<00:04:02.910> from

things out there are very different from
what<00:04:03.630> Jules<00:04:03.930> Verne<00:04:04.109> once<00:04:04.380> imagined<00:04:04.889> though

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
what Jules Verne once imagined though

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.410 
what Jules Verne once imagined though
that<00:04:05.250> would<00:04:05.370> be<00:04:05.430> pretty<00:04:05.700> awesome<00:04:05.760> too<00:04:06.209> it

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
that would be pretty awesome too it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.539 
that would be pretty awesome too it
wouldn't<00:04:06.810> be<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.079> Dynamo<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:08.100> makes<00:04:08.340> all

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
wouldn't be the Dynamo that makes all

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.280 
wouldn't be the Dynamo that makes all
