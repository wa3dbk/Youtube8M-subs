because I just lost cable what we can

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.150 
because I just lost cable what we can
say<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:09.840> skateboard<00:02:10.410> first<00:02:10.920> thing<00:02:11.069> you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
what we got here this is 7 ply

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.210 
what we got here this is 7 ply
construction<00:02:14.870> 7<00:02:15.870> ply<00:02:16.140> means<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.099> wood

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

the reason why these silky smooth is

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.770 
the reason why these silky smooth is
because<00:02:38.489> what<00:02:38.670> Barrens<00:02:39.030> we've<00:02:39.150> got<00:02:39.269> been

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
because what Barrens we've got been

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.440

these<00:02:39.959> are<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.349> bet<00:02:40.530> 580<00:02:41.189> bet<00:02:41.489> 5<00:02:41.819> bearings

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
these are you bet 580 bet 5 bearings

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.770 
these are you bet 580 bet 5 bearings
that's<00:02:43.290> there<00:02:43.799> are<00:02:44.190> seals<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.879> know<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.569> don't
