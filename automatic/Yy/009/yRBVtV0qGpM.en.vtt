project<00:05:26.600> over<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.900> past<00:05:27.169> year<00:05:27.410> so<00:05:27.560> what<00:05:27.680> she

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
project over the past year so what she

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.340 
project over the past year so what she
like<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.190> fly<00:05:28.430> compared<00:05:28.910> to<00:05:28.970> say<00:05:29.150> an<00:05:29.690> Apache<00:05:30.050> or

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
like to fly compared to say an Apache or

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.940 
like to fly compared to say an Apache or
the<00:05:30.440> Lynx

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
the Lynx

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.219 
the Lynx
well<00:05:31.220> the<00:05:31.910> aircraft<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:32.479> it's<00:05:32.840> got<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.020> lot<00:05:33.200> of

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
well the aircraft is it's got a lot of

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.830 
well the aircraft is it's got a lot of
heritage<00:05:33.680> from<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.890> Lynx<00:05:34.390> helicopter<00:05:35.390> in

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
heritage from the Lynx helicopter in

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.600 
heritage from the Lynx helicopter in
terms<00:05:36.080> of<00:05:36.200> handling<00:05:36.530> it's<00:05:36.890> very<00:05:37.100> similar<00:05:37.490> to

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
terms of handling it's very similar to

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.229 
terms of handling it's very similar to
the<00:05:37.700> knee

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:38.239 
the knee

00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:39.669 
the knee
there<00:05:38.569> are<00:05:38.659> some<00:05:38.779> tweaks<00:05:39.110> there<00:05:39.439> but

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:39.679 
there are some tweaks there but

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:41.649 
there are some tweaks there but
fundamentally<00:05:40.549> the<00:05:40.669> same<00:05:40.729> but<00:05:41.059> yes<00:05:41.479> you<00:05:41.599> can

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
fundamentally the same but yes you can

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.119 
fundamentally the same but yes you can
see<00:05:41.839> in<00:05:41.959> the<00:05:42.019> cockpit<00:05:42.409> and<00:05:42.499> anybody's<00:05:42.889> in<00:05:43.069> a

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:43.129 
see in the cockpit and anybody's in a

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.609 
see in the cockpit and anybody's in a
Lynx<00:05:43.399> cockpit<00:05:43.819> we'd<00:05:44.659> see<00:05:44.869> there's<00:05:45.049> a<00:05:45.139> big<00:05:45.379> big

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:45.619 
Lynx cockpit we'd see there's a big big

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:47.139 
Lynx cockpit we'd see there's a big big
difference<00:05:45.799> here<00:05:46.189> we're<00:05:46.729> now<00:05:46.819> fundamentally

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:47.149 
difference here we're now fundamentally

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:49.689 
difference here we're now fundamentally
talking<00:05:47.719> about<00:05:47.899> a<00:05:47.929> digital<00:05:48.169> cockpit<00:05:48.589> the<00:05:49.549> way

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
talking about a digital cockpit the way

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.819 
talking about a digital cockpit the way
there<00:05:49.909> the<00:05:50.269> pilot<00:05:50.659> or<00:05:50.869> the<00:05:50.989> aircrew<00:05:51.319> interact

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:51.829 
there the pilot or the aircrew interact

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:54.219 
there the pilot or the aircrew interact
with<00:05:51.979> that<00:05:52.069> cockpits<00:05:52.519> changed<00:05:53.179> and<00:05:53.899> in<00:05:54.139> the

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
with that cockpits changed and in the

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.600 
with that cockpits changed and in the
cockpit<00:05:54.559> so<00:05:54.829> you<00:05:54.889> can<00:05:55.069> see<00:05:55.189> that<00:05:55.339> we've<00:05:55.459> got

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
cockpit so you can see that we've got

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.669 
cockpit so you can see that we've got
four<00:05:55.969> big<00:05:56.179> screens<00:05:56.569> here<00:05:56.779> that<00:05:57.019> gives<00:05:57.259> the

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:57.679 
four big screens here that gives the

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:00.339 
four big screens here that gives the
pilots<00:05:58.099> the<00:05:58.219> information<00:05:58.729> that<00:05:58.879> displays<00:05:59.599> to

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
pilots the information that displays to

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.319 
pilots the information that displays to
him<00:06:00.559> we've<00:06:01.189> also<00:06:01.309> got<00:06:01.699> down<00:06:01.909> here<00:06:02.149> the

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:02.329 
him we've also got down here the

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:04.179 
him we've also got down here the
computers<00:06:02.839> the<00:06:02.959> brains<00:06:03.229> of<00:06:03.439> the<00:06:03.529> aircraft<00:06:03.889> and

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:04.189 
computers the brains of the aircraft and

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:05.229 
computers the brains of the aircraft and
that's<00:06:04.369> fundamentally<00:06:04.999> where<00:06:05.149> the

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:05.239 
that's fundamentally where the

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.719 
that's fundamentally where the
aircraft's<00:06:05.599> brains<00:06:05.959> are<00:06:06.379> and<00:06:06.649> how<00:06:07.069> it<00:06:07.249> you

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
aircraft's brains are and how it you

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.879 
aircraft's brains are and how it you
know<00:06:07.759> how<00:06:08.059> it<00:06:08.179> operates<00:06:08.659> the<00:06:09.019> role<00:06:09.559> that<00:06:09.769> the

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
know how it operates the role that the

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.139 
know how it operates the role that the
army<00:06:10.189> are<00:06:10.249> going<00:06:10.369> to<00:06:10.429> use<00:06:10.549> this<00:06:10.699> aircraft<00:06:11.089> for

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:11.149 
army are going to use this aircraft for

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:13.299 
army are going to use this aircraft for
is<00:06:11.299> a<00:06:11.360> fundamentally<00:06:11.959> find<00:06:12.829> and

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:13.309 
is a fundamentally find and

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:15.249 
is a fundamentally find and
reconnaissance<00:06:13.879> platform<00:06:14.059> although<00:06:14.839> it<00:06:15.110> is<00:06:15.229> a

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:15.259 
reconnaissance platform although it is a

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:16.689 
reconnaissance platform although it is a
multi-role<00:06:15.799> aircraft<00:06:15.860> so<00:06:16.369> we<00:06:16.489> will<00:06:16.579> be<00:06:16.639> able

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
multi-role aircraft so we will be able

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.209 
multi-role aircraft so we will be able
to<00:06:16.849> use<00:06:17.029> it<00:06:17.209> for<00:06:17.449> the<00:06:17.599> traditional<00:06:18.049> Lynx<00:06:18.979> roles

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
to use it for the traditional Lynx roles

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.519 
to use it for the traditional Lynx roles
in<00:06:19.939> those<00:06:20.119> fine<00:06:20.389> roles<00:06:20.749> we'll<00:06:21.019> look<00:06:21.169> to<00:06:21.319> use

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529 
in those fine roles we'll look to use

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:23.979 
in those fine roles we'll look to use
the<00:06:22.209> electro-optic<00:06:23.209> device<00:06:23.479> on<00:06:23.659> the<00:06:23.719> front<00:06:23.929> of

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:23.989 
the electro-optic device on the front of

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:25.149 
the electro-optic device on the front of
the<00:06:24.049> aircraft<00:06:24.169> the<00:06:24.409> biggest<00:06:24.739> sort<00:06:24.860> of<00:06:24.889> nose

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:25.159 
the aircraft the biggest sort of nose

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.759 
the aircraft the biggest sort of nose
and<00:06:25.759> turret<00:06:26.569> there<00:06:26.809> and<00:06:27.199> we<00:06:27.409> will<00:06:27.469> be<00:06:27.529> able<00:06:27.619> to

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:27.769 
and turret there and we will be able to

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:29.619 
and turret there and we will be able to
hand<00:06:28.039> those<00:06:28.249> targets<00:06:28.789> over<00:06:28.999> to<00:06:29.209> an<00:06:29.329> Apache

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
hand those targets over to an Apache

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.799 
hand those targets over to an Apache
either<00:06:30.349> by<00:06:30.679> voice<00:06:30.979> or<00:06:31.309> using<00:06:31.909> a<00:06:31.939> data<00:06:32.479> transfer

on here and sold on the ground we
familiar<00:06:38.239> with<00:06:38.539> Bowman<00:06:38.929> but<00:06:39.319> not<00:06:39.529> something

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:39.739 
familiar with Bowman but not something

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:42.309 
familiar with Bowman but not something
that's<00:06:39.919> been<00:06:40.099> in<00:06:40.389> typically<00:06:41.389> in

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
that's been in typically in
