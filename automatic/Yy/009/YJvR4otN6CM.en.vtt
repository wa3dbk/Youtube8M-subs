00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.590
 I look at me today may more on the Main and another video on 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.579
 resulting damage 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.939
 the a cover seen in the standard on it is on it gives 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:16.589
 in addition 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.070
 a monochrome 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.380
 m covers with the scope of delivery is around if the whole so he is a color 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.460
 and not so militarily driven market of hype around 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.870
 Channels also see the yield side around DAX end back as deep 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.109
 2 megapixel camera we also in another video yet 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.580
 test 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.140
 and around 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 Tiffany shares have a touch screen 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.340
 and it also makes all-day schools a point of view 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 Hanvon opens and handles the 8 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.530
 so 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.830
 and percent in the year when now the menu they had to arrive is that 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.530
 my start screen is still a bit 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.780
 Memminger's turn 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.869
 around there you can already see the hammer 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 harder topic plans Mauritz goes to the camera 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.940
 Drink Sport Cup Lecturers and used be there are several here 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.920
 possibilities 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.439
 mm also held Bluetooth percent Kofler were news and the 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.990
 camera 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.380
 and now he is in Mainz - it starts with the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.990
 phone book 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.340
 not arrived 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.320
 so this is percent so it's not quite as good I served 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.070
 had to me 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 to hit the right silence 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.400
 to get ahead too 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.450
 not now it's not going so well back and forth 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.630
 are as call logs 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.630
 So always too populated 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.240
 she still has me 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.810
 Jana I always come to the legacy in the legs 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.250
 I am physically 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.090
 multimedia 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.429
 play 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.429
 Extras 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.609
 the lucky chain 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.349
 not hectic now 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.769
 Internet services Tapfheim Manager and again phone book 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.509
 As I said, I do not take a position there is not much good food much 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:29.589
 a bit impractical but I can just as well here 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:33.579
 so there it agrees also that will now do everything even if that 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.159
 so it is provided but I can just as well applied for here so he can 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.989
 Phonebook service center call list setting 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.549
 Multimedia Games Extras Services 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.269
 and here's the manager 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.180
 So these are the facial expressions and their FDIC Madsen 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.879
 Spoerri Center 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.849
 because behind it hides 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.269
 the news in the air 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.269
 and I bet a message Zettl 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.219
 just to test the keyboard 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.429
 and the smile around 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.299
 I can now quickly change over the iron language I'm up here 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.209
 on it TÃ¼bke 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.919
 Next up is in German Parents I can now board is big or 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.799
 To be written small 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.489
 Percent or large rush Small further took me a while 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.559
 just try it 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.559
 t9 have found and indeed 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.909
 then ready for a deal 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.499
 and then I can look like a de so for German t9 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.489
 Dincher Fuchs's increase in EBITDA by smoke 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.429
 yes then I am 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:48.429
 the bags 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.759
 and that goes well with itself or you have to press properly 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.759
 so that what happens on the box 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.510
 but what I finally find quite pleasant are the keys 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.719
 we are not very tall 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.959
 nevertheless, it is surprisingly good that I sometimes a bit annoying when 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.849
 you had the UN 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.339
 The frog has things and then how to shake the lower box 

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:25.969
 practically only with the fingertip make if one 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:29.110
 yes, if you want to do with such a prefabricated construction then learn 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.110
 you meet the cash register down poet lord simply no place 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.969
 and also up here it is natural 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.870
 quite close so-called but you can see that 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.069
 Apart from that, apart from that, things are going very well now 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.169
 around 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.789
 It can also hang that sure Linus on the problem that she 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:47.860
 then so 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.010
 because ticks tilt backwards the telecom is actually no problem with that 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.259
 Handy that can be done quite well 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.309
 also the 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.080
 as millions around 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 and can be found well around and Greens good 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.629
 around 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:10.159
 the only field really with the stylus but not on the touch screen i 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.990
 think ELN 'that's not very good 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.720
 So now with the hand that they do not even serve but good 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.360
 you still have him for that 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.120
 Percent ITC will wait a pen more total percent 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.120
 he is not doing very well 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.419
