00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.640 

I'm<00:00:02.100> playing<00:00:02.429> with<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:02.909> little<00:00:03.650> external

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
I'm playing with this little external

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.820 
I'm playing with this little external
microphone<00:00:05.339> that<00:00:05.640> I've<00:00:05.790> made<00:00:06.060> for<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.830> kodak

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
microphone that I've made for the kodak

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.430 
microphone that I've made for the kodak
zi8<00:00:08.099> know<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.910> some<00:00:09.210> comments<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.230> come

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
zi8 know that some comments that come

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.419 
zi8 know that some comments that come
back<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.769> say<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> same<00:00:11.580> these<00:00:11.969> flat<00:00:12.840> and

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
back to say that the same these flat and

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.609 
back to say that the same these flat and
I<00:00:14.429> think<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:15.059> that's<00:00:15.179> right<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.839> that's

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I think I think that's right so that's

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.500 
I think I think that's right so that's
on<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.510> external<00:00:18.510> microphone<00:00:19.010> and<00:00:20.240> this<00:00:21.240> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
on the external microphone and this is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.290 
on the external microphone and this is
on<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.020> internal<00:00:22.890> microphone<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.880> one<00:00:24.029> built

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
on the internal microphone the one built

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.870 
on the internal microphone the one built
into<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.720> camera<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.670> this<00:00:26.670> little

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
into the camera and this little

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.389 
into the camera and this little
microphone<00:00:27.980> is<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:30.019> can<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.410> focus

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.310 

let's<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.120> microphone<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.840> I've<00:00:37.079> made

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
let's see the microphone that I've made

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.569 
let's see the microphone that I've made
and<00:00:39.260> it's<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.040> little<00:00:41.219> hole

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and it's now just got that little hole

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
and it's now just got that little hole
in<00:00:41.910> there<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.570> probably<00:00:42.930> about<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
in there which is probably about the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.529 
in there which is probably about the
same<00:00:43.620> sizes<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.000> front<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
same sizes and it all in front of the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.400 
same sizes and it all in front of the
camera<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.030> gonna<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.379> just

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
camera but what I'm gonna do is I'm just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.130 
camera but what I'm gonna do is I'm just
slipping<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.370> cover<00:00:50.730> off<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.930> gonna

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
slipping that cover off and I'm gonna

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.619 
slipping that cover off and I'm gonna
try<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> microphone<00:00:53.219> without<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.120> cover<00:00:54.360> on

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
try the microphone without the cover on

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.729 
try the microphone without the cover on
before<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> make<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> hole<00:00:55.949> bigger<00:01:03.470> okay<00:01:04.470> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
before I make the hole bigger okay so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.010 
before I make the hole bigger okay so
that's<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.519> same<00:01:05.760> we've<00:01:06.060> added<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> cover<00:01:06.750> on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that's the same we've added the cover on

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.920 
that's the same we've added the cover on
so<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.030> expecting<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.450> bit<00:01:09.689> more

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
so and expecting that to be a bit more

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.310 
so and expecting that to be a bit more
dynamic<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.330> slip<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.049> cover<00:01:13.350> on

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
dynamic and if I just slip the cover on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
dynamic and if I just slip the cover on
yeah<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.530> fully<00:01:16.770> screwed<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
yeah it's not fully screwed on but I

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
yeah it's not fully screwed on but I
guess<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.299> probably<00:01:19.049> what's<00:01:19.350> killing<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
guess that's probably what's killing the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.200 
guess that's probably what's killing the
st.<00:01:21.619> what<00:01:22.619> I've<00:01:22.740> done<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.159> opened<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
st. what I've done now is opened up the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.890 
st. what I've done now is opened up the
hole<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:25.170> five<00:01:25.729> millimeters<00:01:26.729> diameter<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.630> was

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
hole to five millimeters diameter it was

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.980 
hole to five millimeters diameter it was
two<00:01:28.229> point<00:01:28.560> four<00:01:29.040> millimeters<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> we'll<00:01:32.250> just

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
two point four millimeters so we'll just

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.780 
two point four millimeters so we'll just
try<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> obviously<00:01:34.979> that's<00:01:35.490> seen

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
try that so obviously that's seen

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.100 
try that so obviously that's seen
through<00:01:36.119> mine<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.759> that's<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.240> external

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
through mine and that's the external

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.310 
through mine and that's the external
microphone<00:01:40.640> with<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> five<00:01:42.360> millimeter<00:01:42.689> hole

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
microphone with a five millimeter hole

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
microphone with a five millimeter hole
in<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:45.570> what<00:01:45.720> I'm

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
in it so see that is and then what I'm

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.319 
in it so see that is and then what I'm
going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.170> put<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> little<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.860> foam

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
going to do is put a little bit of foam

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.749 
going to do is put a little bit of foam
in<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.020> cut<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> wind<00:01:49.530> noise<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
in there just to cut the wind noise as I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.510 
in there just to cut the wind noise as I
find<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.390> sometimes<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.560> used<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> tape<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
find that sometimes I used to tape a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.230 
find that sometimes I used to tape a
little<00:01:53.850> bit<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:55.710> kitchen<00:01:56.430> towel<00:01:56.700> paper

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
little bit of a kitchen towel paper

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.109 
little bit of a kitchen towel paper
towel<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.469> aperture<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.640> mic<00:01:59.939> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
towel over the aperture of this mic to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.420 
towel over the aperture of this mic to
cut<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> wing<00:02:00.600> noise<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.439> we'll<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:02.280> what<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
cut the wing noise so we'll see what a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:22.330 
cut the wing noise so we'll see what a
bit<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.700> foam<00:02:02.939> does

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.449 

okay<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.370> fitted<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.450> little<00:02:24.480> bit<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.019> foam<00:02:25.459> about

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
okay I fitted a little bit of foam about

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.229 
okay I fitted a little bit of foam about
a<00:02:26.489> millimeter<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.680> thickness<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.459> front<00:02:29.940> of

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
a millimeter of thickness in front of

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.729 
a millimeter of thickness in front of
the<00:02:31.040> little<00:02:32.040> electorate<00:02:32.730> insert<00:02:33.690> then<00:02:34.620> we're

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
the little electorate insert then we're

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.460 
the little electorate insert then we're
gonna<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.130> what<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.489> like<00:02:35.750> outside<00:02:39.470> it's

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
gonna see what it's like outside it's

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.800 
gonna see what it's like outside it's
not<00:02:40.650> not<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.130> particularly<00:02:41.549> windy<00:02:41.940> day<00:02:42.360> today

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
not not a particularly windy day today

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:55.900 
not not a particularly windy day today
the<00:02:42.840> winds<00:02:43.260> as<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.850> light<00:02:45.150> breeze<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.900> would<00:02:46.140> say

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.180 

well<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.060> think<00:02:57.269> all<00:02:57.810> things<00:02:58.080> considered<00:02:58.230> and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
well I think all things considered and
