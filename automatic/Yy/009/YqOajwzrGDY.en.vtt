00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello dear dear 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.599
 Hello, everyone is interested and 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.439
 who are attracted to modern events on 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.010
 Ukraine 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.619
 I have already talked about what 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.289
 all kinds of revolutions 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.920
 always in all cases spawn a layer 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.730
 people who go making their 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.770
 own band matter 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.620
 what did the founders of the ideologues 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.460
 organizers 1 revolutionary wave like 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.789
 horse pale apocalypse arise from 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.690
 non-existence the most incredible personalities and they 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.940
 play their game very recently in 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.949
 13th year several groups 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.289
 united the so-called right 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.579
 left run centrist sector 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.010
 gray-brown-crimson red or black 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.350
 I will not argue the most important thing 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.780
 there is a rigidly nationalistic 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.760
 organizations which are very partially 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.800
 executes orders of Ukrainian 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.700
 official government this 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.500
 naturally wherever comes to power 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.840
 gray show black told not me 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.670
 it is rather Strugatsky 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 wherever grow pink win 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.500
 red said it is not me 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.830
 Once Kalbi his red Ottoman 108 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.560
 it pleases you the archer why the general 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:47.040
 the main thing is where they try to triumph 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.970
 moderate liberal pro-european 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.080
 nationalism appear on the soloist extremely 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.470
 who are not going to limit themselves 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.850
 anything not going 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.590
 obey the government and perform 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.810
 his orders at any moment these right 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.690
 forces can play their game itself 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.480
 play and no matter what 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.100
 offers the central government 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.460
 truce these forces will play their 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.650
 role 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.670
 they have their own politics 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.220
 reality 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.030
 its movement its trajectory of it 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.540
 movements are now in Crimea stay 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.380
 transports with many wounded in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.959
 including the wrong one having lost the tip 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.900
 these people are greatly sacrificed 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.700
 going war meaningless about it 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.220
 killing any stubs any 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.500
 stigma date bad war good you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.950
 in general there is no civil and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.959
 especially and disgusting and in huge 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 degrees 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.830
 participant of events is the right 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.320
 sector and other nationalist rights 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.620
 organizations they will go to the end 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.110
 and there is another side to the conflict 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.130
 Here I still do not remember the names of this 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.600
 wonderful Ukrainian journalist 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.650
 the doctor who was taken prisoner is called 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.860
 paratis there struck me his name 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.670
 articles 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.730
 these people will not give up they will go 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.440
 until the end he suddenly 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.330
 poor openwork official propaganda 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.250
 found a and really in Donetsk from people 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.250
 self-righteous 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.519
 who don't give up are not going not 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.860
 will not give which pair to the end 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:39.710
 in the same and waiting true 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.070
 and here are these worse forces to end 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:48.000
 start to go take off less radical 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.490
 calmer and less 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.450
 ready to enter a war to the last 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.260
 a soldier of his or someone else â€™s 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.750
 the main modern content of the conflict 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.810
 that's the most important thing that happens not 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.480
 execution of orders by the people 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.150
 different forces are just external 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.010
 manifestations 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.090
 happening in southeast Ukraine 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.690
 manifestation of the action of these forces 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.690
 Thanks for attention
