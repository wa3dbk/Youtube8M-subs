00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
if you have a good processor which we

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.690 
if you have a good processor which we
don't<00:03:03.520> our<00:03:03.760> processors<00:03:04.300> need<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> bath<00:03:06.720> mmm<00:03:07.720> now

but I'm going to blend it because the
ice<00:03:16.720> makes<00:03:17.319> everything<00:03:17.590> cold<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:19.299> peter

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540

other chocolate tend to stick to the ice

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.280 
other chocolate tend to stick to the ice
when<00:03:22.209> they<00:03:22.299> get<00:03:22.450> cold<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.900> doesn't<00:03:23.170> get

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
when they get cold and it doesn't get
