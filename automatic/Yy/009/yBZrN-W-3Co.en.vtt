00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.770
 in this video next to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 We can work with systems 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.330
 Windows cryptography called 20 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 lots 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:37.380
 this system was created to record pen 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:41.090
 drive and security for example is and is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.390
 important that any person 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.920
 if the user connects the most 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.989
 who will ask for a password 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.989
 if he does not have this password he can not 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:06.390
 form the data and note that it works 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.470
 very well in 2007 in the mirror too 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 it works 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.510
 however you can not save a 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.640
 windows xp file to pen drive 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.270
 get sims to the odd side of the night 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.830
 cold but the reverse not because the writer 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.970
 our passion 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.680
 one was to start the computer could 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.460
 also be my beautiful suit and tie and the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.700
 my prayer on the directional button activate 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.700
 29 to the process 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.140
 as will a bag're publishing fair 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.420
 we will have to choose a method of breaking 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.119
 of the casual visual culture that she 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.420
 let every soap opera have to use an event 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.119
 and we go there we can mark 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.259
 the eyes studied site but by another 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:02.349
 side the club wants to use a password 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:14.440
 or a password for example 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:19.569
 vote or be easy to face a 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.590
 sentence without putting to save the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.120
 humanity said besson the key to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.400
 recovery of houses 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.290
 then forget the put will serve 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.379
 fair trade tour accompanied by the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.950
 woman but that's what I'm going to do I thought 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:43.000
 york what do you have the key for example 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:48.190
 key b in operation 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.380
 only today they sell for example it was just me who 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.660
 happens is interesting you later 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.769
 now only resolved for example if 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:02.139
 Forget to drink is to leave another son. 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:03.310
 Disc God you can use this 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.450
 file recovery 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.209
 When we 're doing well, we can 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.280
 remove the machine you can forget the 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.049
 machine and may not get from the writer 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.459
 You will not get lost in the system debut 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:19.060
 a vote well what wants to launch a 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.709
 dialogue started on every child after 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.660
 that he finish every time he tried 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.849
 accessing this action will ask for a password or 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.829
 or if the person does not have a password, 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.829
 can see the content has 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:40.849
 at the end of the encryption we can 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:43.760
 close when the access finds that I 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:48.049
 I have access because a little more than 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.470
 So much place I will make it love and I will 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.470
 try again 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.209
 see what the population is capturing 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.910
 the new video about it and will ask for a 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.080
 The sentence does not have this password of ours. 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.730
 session 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.220
 I can always put it for example 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.780
 this force and this pen drive as if 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.790
 it was a true right 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.100
 and I had run my brand did not 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.220
 could leave the solution demarcated 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.760
 connected and already ask for a password but for 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:37.560
 security from there could not 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:41.130
 Block star only has access to 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.800
 who develop in order to 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.040
 to manage the biota, I can come here in 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.630
 start menu system tip panel 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.450
 of security 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.950
 the technical graphical purpose to discuss 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:58.290
 there you can activate other units 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.320
 available to external media can 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.880
 manage the example of what is already 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.160
 on the team will not have 60 to change or not 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.810
 I want more Sheik all the talk a well 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.120
 disabled select publisher varzim 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.190
 The writer speaks and then I told you 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.810
 cares for what you just for it 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:25.560
 if you wanted to remove the photo 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.440
 the couple because it is a situation you 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:32.370
 Are you afraid xp? 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.810
 it speaks of conception the freedom to 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.280
 You, for example, would not be so 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.729
 interesting 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.710
 accounts already use windows 7 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:45.380
 then the future eight matches 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.280
 you can use this feature without 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:54.020
 no problem 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:58.340
 t just wait for the leaves and two 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.480
 happened if I went here and father and 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.620
 functional 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:07.900
 if I go here in the control panel 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.900
 usually the eighth success story in the 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.200
 I see trophy bombs usually wait 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.280
 continue this process the plenary returns 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.280
 to run out of
