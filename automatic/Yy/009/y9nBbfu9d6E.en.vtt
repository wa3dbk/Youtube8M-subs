00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Chinese cars on the roads of Russia 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.000
 getting bigger and bigger 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.859
 what kind of cars are they 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.230
 safe as far as they are able 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.969
 protect your riders in an accident this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.790
 practically no one knows 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.109
 that's why we're autoreview 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.060
 are taking a series of crash tests in 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.050
 Chinese cars we have already carried out 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 crash tests 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.920
 two chinese cars this is chery qq 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.119
 suede 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.650
 he's a copy of the daewoo matiz car and 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.449
 chery amulet 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 chery amulet failed miserably 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.610
 crash test is not durable metal 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.680
 disgusting quality of welding 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 the largest among the tried and tested of three 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.360
 car body deformation and very 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 high loads on his driver's dummy 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.650
 I had to literally get from behind the wheel 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.050
 in parts in a real accident 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.920
 it will surely mean or very 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.470
 serious injuries to the legs and head or rather 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.879
 altogether even death, we decided that the third 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.280
 after chery qq 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.239
 and chery amulet and there will be another car 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.909
 Chinese stamps 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.720
 geely otaka sedan is pretty fresh 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:09.960
 model in china it is called geely 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.570
 Seki released 2005 but not 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.880
 less is not only sold in Russia and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 Ukraine but also going to these two 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.390
 countries the basis of the attack served as a rather 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.000
 old car toyota corolla sample 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.250
 1991 but studying attack before impact 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.590
 we found a lot of progressive 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.210
 technological solutions that must 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.890
 increase security for example 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.770
 telescopic steering column which 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.560
 must be folded upon impact and powerful 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.400
 tube amplifier under the front panel 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 will all of these technology work 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 tricks crash test we as before 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.110
 we spend by the rules and wrong about speed 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.380
 64 kilometers per hour 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.990
 hit the driver's side before to 40 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.290
 percentage overlap about deformable 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.290
 barrier and so overclocking 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.720
 Alas 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.880
 body attack does not hold a similar blow 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.790
 not calculated front of energy 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.130
 absorbing deformation the door broke in 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.680
 the very beginning of the blow despite the durable 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.200
 load amplifier inside body deformation 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.970
 so large that telescopic 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.070
 steering column mechanism and just not 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.170
 manages to work 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.140
 pipe wedges steering column 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.180
 rips off bonding and steering instead 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.560
 to stay in place rushes 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.410
 meet the driver 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.960
 on top note again 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.450
 how easily the driver's door breaks and 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.040
 how powerful and powerful the steering column 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.040
 being introduced inside the cabin 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 left side doors by the way have attack 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.950
 open and rear and driver 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.040
 broken unfortunately this is weak 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.040
 comfort 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.540
 why is geely otaka so bad yourself 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.879
 led on a modern crash test by 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.250
 rules and wrong about obviously 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.790
 old body structure 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.359
 corolla 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.030
 not subjected to serious modifications 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:02.239
 it is also obvious that the quality of the metal 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.099
 not the highest look like 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.549
 deformed body pair 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:15.620
 look how the waves curved under the floor 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:17.209
 kicking the driver even those technological 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.280
 solutions that are provided in 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.380
 attack designs to enhance 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.780
 passive safety in serious 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.320
 blow did not work whether 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.810
 power door or telescopic 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.430
 steering column mechanism 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.770
 Here is the picture that opens to us salon 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.610
 completely detached from their mount 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.190
 steering column 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.410
 even if she was equipped with a pillow 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.419
 security as in expensive attack versions 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.990
 it would hardly be of real use 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.990
 to the driver 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.070
 and grind other driver's knees 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.410
 plastic front panel and the blow was 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.560
 so strong that the driver got it 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:04.120
 knees to the transverse tube amplifier 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:05.410
 under the front panel look at what 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.389
 quality welds 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.210
 we specifically raised the car to 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.610
 follow the bottom and saw this 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.250
 picture numerous breaks 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:20.700
 on the points of welding deformed floor 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.700
 crumpled threshold 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:31.949
 by the way inside the attack thresholds we 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.199
 found foam 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.699
 but not u special that sometimes 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.459
 enjoyed in order to enhance 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:42.149
 structural stiffness 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:44.189
 reminiscent of mounting as a result of those who 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:46.169
 already bought a car geely otaka 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.689
 or those who are just thinking about 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.539
 buying this car we please alas 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.339
 nothing to do with such a serious 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.059
 frontal collision 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:06:00.479
 attack will not be able to protect even fastened 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:04.079
 their driver and passengers are threatened 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.359
 serious head and neck injuries and even 

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:08.519
 the passenger is in danger 

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:11.299
 left knee which he hit hard 

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:13.589
 of plastic near the glove compartment and 

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:16.829
 all the details of our next 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:19.729
 crash test, read the number 20 autoreview for 

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:19.729
 2 thousand and can
