assembled<00:02:05.980> there<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.670> all<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
assembled there and all that and the

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.960 
assembled there and all that and the
original<00:02:09.130> owner<00:02:09.280> had<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.850> tested<00:02:10.110> by<00:02:11.110> Gerry

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
original owner had it tested by Gerry

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.130 
original owner had it tested by Gerry
initially<00:02:12.970> when<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.270> car<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.630> first<00:02:13.840> built

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
initially when the car was first built

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.730 
initially when the car was first built
and<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:15.100> ran<00:02:15.370> back<00:02:15.970> then<00:02:16.330> back<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.900> 91<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.590> ran

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and it ran back then back in 91 and ran

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.850 
and it ran back then back in 91 and ran
a<00:02:17.850> 674<00:02:18.850> on<00:02:19.030> nitrous<00:02:19.510> which<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.230> awesome

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
a 674 on nitrous which is awesome

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.240 
a 674 on nitrous which is awesome
back<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:23.350> never<00:02:23.590> got<00:02:23.860> around<00:02:24.100> to

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
back then and we never got around to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.520 
back then and we never got around to
cars<00:02:24.580> never<00:02:24.940> since<00:02:25.540> we<00:02:25.660> put<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.959> motor<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.290> it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
cars never since we put the motor in it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.370 
cars never since we put the motor in it
and<00:02:26.740> updated<00:02:27.250> everything<00:02:27.660> bigger<00:02:28.660> fuel<00:02:29.050> cell

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
and updated everything bigger fuel cell

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.180 
and updated everything bigger fuel cell

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
best as far as I'm concerned

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.670 
best as far as I'm concerned
that's<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.410> safest<00:02:44.830> car<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:47.080> can<00:02:47.320> go<00:02:47.350> it

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
that's the safest car that can go it

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.160 
that's the safest car that can go it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
the what were your run times on that

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.229 
the what were your run times on that
prior<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.440> new<00:02:53.560> motor<00:02:53.880> any<00:02:54.880> water<00:02:55.060> Mon

that's<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.720> best<00:02:55.959> now<00:02:56.140> we're<00:02:56.620> going<00:02:56.800> back<00:02:57.010> a

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
that's the best now we're going back a

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.120 
that's the best now we're going back a
few<00:02:57.220> years<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.910> understand<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.870> ran<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.140> 74<00:02:59.980> at

few years if I understand we ran a 74 at

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.539 
few years if I understand we ran a 74 at
Bristol<00:03:00.930> running<00:03:01.930> at<00:03:02.050> Bristol<00:03:02.470> for<00:03:02.650> Nationals

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
and yeah that takes money to run that
