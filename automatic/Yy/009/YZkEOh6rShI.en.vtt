00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 very good digital kids I hope that 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.609
 I'm great perfectly welcome to 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.290
 a new video on my channel I bring a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.970
 pretty interesting example is to try 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.679
 the gameplay of funds you already know that 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.230
 well I'm trying to ask for rights 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.320
 to be able to put the little things of the caudi 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.199
 3 white as I still have not contacted 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.970
 with the person that I have to answer 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 contact then I will not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.350
 fix and I'll give you an example and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.019
 black ops 2 background has already come out 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.519
 absolutely everything from the multiplayer or 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.099
 I could make a video talking about 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.980
 Advantages of good accessory streaks 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.750
 but let's go to me personally 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.960
 is what matters most to me that is the subject 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.620
 of the sniper the snej ping in call of duty 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.510
 black ops 3 to start I'm going to leave you 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.700
 in the description two videos the first 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 it's from Mr. Ali and the second from the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.710
 Mr. fame almost autonomous the video of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.629
 for more the truth 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.559
 because several clips come out is a little more 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.559
 Quick 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.150
 playing with the sniper there in the in the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.180
 e3 or explained the as I said already 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.760
 about three months ago the sniper that I saw 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.870
 in the first trailer of black ops 3 yo 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.720
 said 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.110
 I would put my hand in the fire that is the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.600
 ballista and how I'm not going to make a mistake is 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.660
 well, it's very similar to the ready dawn 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.220
 it's not called locus and there's an accessory that 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.290
 he's got this sniper called 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.150
 rapid fire what does this mean already 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.670
 you know that if you choose a submachine gun 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.280
 you put on a rapid fire it increases the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.430
 cadence of the weapon then that has more 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.940
 bullets per minute not this is also going to 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 having the sniper will also have it 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.260
 to do this because if they put you 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.300
 Quick fire accessories the bolt lo 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.250
 going to do a lot faster than if you do not 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.550
 puts that accessory on you on the one hand 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.360
 then Wiifit as I have commented on 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.790
 what I do not like I hope they touch is 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.220
 that the hippie is going very fast is going to 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.560
 fuck here the feedback folha I 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.300
 I hope you'll be touched about the snaith 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 in the locus that is going to be the balita the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.470
 bolt the sniper that goes the most 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.560
 use what I think that I 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.990
 hits eye markers hits does not mean 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.130
 this hits too much himar that I've 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.200
 made the video of the day and the seen 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.990
 practically whole and I did not think 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 that has given more urgent mark of 13 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.060
 seen that nobody has said is another if 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.950
 marquez but it seems that it gives a little if 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.410
 it seems that the sniper will be 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.580
 pretty balanced in this game in 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.470
 this black ops 3 what do you think of everything 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.050
 this I said a long time ago that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.540
 he thought he was going to be the ballista and 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.140
 has actually been the ballista the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.240
 sniper 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.610
 have finally put in but because I 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.230
 I saw I had no doubt is very 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.940
 cool the sniper something else that I 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.680
 quite like the sniper is that when 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.800
 I was pointing is like the sight of 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.810
 punishment 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.550
 and the relief the outline of the peephole 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.160
 we have it in black in the product black 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.920
 ops 3 we have then as it was in cartridges 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.810
 So we had the exterior what is the 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.209
 map itself the one of the environment but we have 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.620
 in a somewhat blurred way that 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.910
 I like that because many times when 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.130
 you are with him is knife is getting 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.350
 Putting looks you are crossed by someone 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.230
 next you do not see it because directly 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.910
 in the black outline of the sight and not you 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.160
 gives the option to see around 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.870
 another thing that I also like a lot that 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.220
 I want nobody to be fixed and not to 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.830
 has commented but that to me personally 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.200
 I like it a lot, it's the fact that it's not going 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.489
 to pass as with the call of duty 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.870
 advanced work because you play with the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.330
 sniper and if you're getting 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.550
 look at a shot automatically 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.290
 remove the look you with the morse you can not 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.910
 shoot and stay aiming for 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.830
 see how the enemies move 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.750
 you can not whites 2 and 3 if you can also 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.970
 returns a weapon that he likes very much 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.660
 which is like a replica of the b-23 that 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.420
 When the target came out, it was my class 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.860
 was the paddler and the b-23 a replica that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.380
 has also carries 15 bullets by 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.500
 charger and also carries strips 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.300
 bursts of detail as would be the 23 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.790
 this call of duty black ops' toxo like 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.360
 it could be as good for the fame of him 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.070
 warfare 2 I liked it a lot 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.780
 personal opinion according to the times 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.210
 that I have seen from sneijder has not 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.610
 displeased eye that when you complete 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.610
 sniper said 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.420
 the bet but now watching the trailer 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.930
 of these multiplayer of the white pÃ©rez the 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.210
 sniper I like I like snipe a lot 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.800
 I do not like the tab so short 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.320
 because although I say but the trust is 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.729
 short people are not going to fix so much 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.610
 in the jewels 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.960
 a cock no matter what the community 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.580
 Spanish and I believe that the community 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.139
 international we are always going to go 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.759
 fixing on faith because I am in fact 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.740
 a very important element as 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.680
 many of you in half but it's going 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.909
 to continue to be present in everything by 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.949
 hundred in the final part of a forest or 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:14.039
 I have a forest or because I'm going to 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:16.229
 see a girl but I'm going to see the streak 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.999
 end of this gameplay that by the way 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.249
 I want to leave the comments all 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:25.319
 your opinion that has appeared in the 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:29.759
 that starts the clip a gesture two 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:34.680
 headsets a single one fit rolling failed 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:36.509
 that triple triple another plus and when 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.520
 I have the color grau the single for 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.620
 paste it four times and the failures are 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.949
 Attach release the command hit a scream of 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.949
 traca 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.250
 I have failed people I hope that I 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.290
 I really like and what you think of is nike 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.480
 they have call of duty black ops 3 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.010
 I thought I did not like what I had 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.870
 seen from the trailers but watching it 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.370
 gameplay of the Lord for more and the Lord 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.960

 a following video I use everyone and up
