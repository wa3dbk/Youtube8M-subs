this is electrical tape I use gorilla

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.090 
this is electrical tape I use gorilla
duct<00:01:45.030> tape<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.960> looks<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.920> like

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
electrical tape only its way thicker way

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.940 
electrical tape only its way thicker way
stickier<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.140> not<00:01:52.350> come<00:01:52.530> off<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.920> mean
