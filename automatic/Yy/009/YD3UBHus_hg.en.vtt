means she's got her period and therefore

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.070 
means she's got her period and therefore
I<00:00:10.320> need<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.860> try<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.719> put<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:13.259> diaper<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.460> her<00:00:15.080> so

I need to try and put a diaper on her so

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.510 
I need to try and put a diaper on her so
that's<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.890> diaper<00:00:17.510> that's<00:00:18.510> how<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.930> looks

that's the diaper that's how it looks

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.529 
that's the diaper that's how it looks
and<00:00:20.779> I<00:00:21.779> think<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.260> need<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.880> tail<00:00:24.180> needs

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
and I think you need to the tail needs

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.290 
and I think you need to the tail needs
to<00:00:24.720> go<00:00:25.019> through<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:26.359> type<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.510> thing<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
to go through here type of thing so I

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.450 
to go through here type of thing so I
think<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.320> gonna<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.740> musing<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> that's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
think it's gonna be musing and that's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
think it's gonna be musing and that's
why<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.640> decided<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.149> try<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.630> record<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.140> if<00:00:34.410> my

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
why I decided to try and record it if my

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.680 
why I decided to try and record it if my
dog<00:00:35.010> will<00:00:35.250> let<00:00:35.430> me<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.030> we'll<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.329> how<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
dog will let me so we'll see how that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:01:15.940 
dog will let me so we'll see how that
goes

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.700 

nah

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:51.510 

cool

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
whoa

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.440 
whoa
that<00:01:54.350> was<00:01:54.560> hard<00:01:56.170> but<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.230> did<00:01:57.320> it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
that was hard but I did it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:24.940 
that was hard but I did it
nice<00:01:59.450> white<00:01:59.750> dog<00:02:00.160> with<00:02:01.160> a<00:02:01.190> diaper

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.650 

I<00:02:25.810> think<00:02:26.980> she<00:02:27.980> needs<00:02:28.160> some<00:02:28.640> time<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.300> get<00:02:29.450> used

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
I think she needs some time to get used

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.229 
I think she needs some time to get used
to<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.880> but<00:02:31.880> uh<00:02:32.950> yes<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.280> that's<00:02:34.640> what<00:02:34.849> happens

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
to it but uh yes so that's what happens

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:52.420 
to it but uh yes so that's what happens
when<00:02:35.540> your<00:02:35.780> dog<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.050> in<00:02:36.380> heat

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.949 
the only reason why I put the diaper on
her<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.579> so<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.299> she'll<00:03:36.480> feel<00:03:36.750> more

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959

her is so that she'll feel more
comfortable<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:37.890> herself<00:03:38.129> while<00:03:38.610> she's<00:03:38.940> on
