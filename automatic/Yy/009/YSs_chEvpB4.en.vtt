00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.049
 Always very special moment 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.299
 we accompany in each stage new 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.830
 episodes and well they come from giving 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.110
 a series of incredible concerts in 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.090
 Argentina and the tour is coming 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.210
 latin america for europe guys a lot 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.920
 emotion or a lot of emotion already 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.780
 we are sharing with the public and in 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.800
 Argentina incredible adrenaline 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.050
 a lot of emotion 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.809
 we want to live it in the other cities 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.850
 countries all places we want to go 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.500
 on tour and have fun with the cast and 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.030
 with all the people talking about the show 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.100
 specifically we make a list of the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.020
 things that produce adrenaline on the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.600
 stage and in the backstage also in 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.120
 camera and for example I always fear 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.170
 to forget some coreo forget the 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.700
 Auto good letter 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.830
 previous seconds of making contact 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.810
 with the stage and obviously with the 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:07.250
 public that causes a lot of adrenaline a lot 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.250
 before leaving always and never 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.480
 do it to say good there are 3500 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.850
 dependent people 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.740
 because we have many functions for 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.660
 medium but what happens is that it is the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 moment of the moment before esteban 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.290
 and there was no 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.970
 because such a moment of adrenaline does not 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.710
 only the beginning also the end of the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.689
 show right at the end could the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.640
 people are very very very caught very 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.380
 happy screaming like crazy already also 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.759
 we are like humans and we dance 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.020
 the triple of strong that we walk in 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.979
 triple the strong changes of 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.840
 costumes are also very important 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.399
 they are a super important part, not that 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.170
 also how it generates that arrive on time 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.860
 and all that people do not see it but there's 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 Nerves back 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.299
 Lots of changes and myth of changing in 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.709
 in 10 seconds that stick in all of me 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.350
 I think if this one has to be up 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:03.539
 a diamond totally dressed with others 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.539
 glasses another story another dress 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.470
 and at the same time what needs to be done 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.670
 is to enjoy it because to enjoy it because 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.860
 there are people who are going to see the show 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.630
 first time and a lot of that participates 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.890
 It is also good and take it into account 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.130
 for the people who are going to see the concert 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.360
 wherever they are seeing us that is 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.310
 very important the participation of the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 people never get bored because like the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.710
 public changes every time what you do is 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.110
 new for him 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.990
 who is watching and transforming 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.600
 for you and what they would say to the parents 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.940
 mums dads who are going to take their children 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.860
 and they are surprised because they sing 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.590
 Seen sing dance enjoy more than 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.090
 the children hear us so much for listening to us 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.720
 every day of the oil in the morning 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.420
 I beat violet and I wake up again 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.780
 and that they will also enjoy themselves 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.580
 they will have a great time equal or more than 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.530
 that the one that the girls are incredible is the one 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.440
 sings in the part go the grandparents 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.690
 will take the grandmothers in family I think 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.760
 that the sensation of seeing a show of these 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.310
 characteristics of these parameters 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.260
 it's amazing to see it and live it with 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.780
 your son next door does not see the faces see 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.010
 how it feels, I think that's all 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.420
 parents I have not lived it because I do not 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.730
 I'm still a father but I think it should be 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.650
 amazing exactly good guys to 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.240
 train yourself in preparing suitcases 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.190
 you have to be experts in that already 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.840
 have traveled several times because they 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.560
 come many concerts a lot of trip that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.560
 Enjoy it a lot
