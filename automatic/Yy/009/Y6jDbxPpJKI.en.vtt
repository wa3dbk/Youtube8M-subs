mid 1800s and then also another one shoe
but<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.550> different<00:00:39.510> design<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:41.000> little<00:00:42.000> bit

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
but a different design a little bit

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.510 
but a different design a little bit
later<00:00:46.610> then<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> two<00:00:48.480> shoe<00:00:49.309> this<00:00:50.309> is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
later then we got the two shoe this is

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.740 
later then we got the two shoe this is
the<00:00:51.050> older<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.289> earlier<00:00:52.680> version<00:00:53.660> you<00:00:54.660> could

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the older or earlier version you could

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.619 
the older or earlier version you could
tell<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> earlier<00:00:55.379> version<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.039> bigger

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.140 

that's<00:01:03.629> why<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.899> call<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.430> Mei<00:01:05.430> hua<00:01:05.610> cold

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that's why they call it the Mei hua cold

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.289 
that's why they call it the Mei hua cold
non<00:01:06.689> Oreo<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.400> then<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> new<00:01:09.060> version

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
non Oreo and then this is a new version

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
non Oreo and then this is a new version
you<00:01:09.600> see<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.869> difference<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.320> mainly<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
you see the difference is mainly the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
you see the difference is mainly the
size<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.460> becomes<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.970> little<00:01:12.090> bit<00:01:12.180> shorter<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
size it becomes a little bit shorter a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.649 
size it becomes a little bit shorter a
little<00:01:12.900> bit<00:01:13.140> smaller<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.540> shin<00:01:16.490> new

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
little bit smaller this is the shin new

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.910 
little bit smaller this is the shin new
non-real<00:01:20.990> basically<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> same<00:01:22.320> design<00:01:22.680> but

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
non-real basically the same design but

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
non-real basically the same design but
just<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.520> bit<00:01:23.610> smaller<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.900> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
just a little bit smaller and this is is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.700 
just a little bit smaller and this is is
a<00:01:27.960> rare<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.759> could<00:01:29.880> say<00:01:30.030> scarce<00:01:30.570> piece<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
a rare or you could say scarce piece the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.319 
a rare or you could say scarce piece the
two<00:01:31.950> shoe<00:01:32.310> Jin<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:33.570> again<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.939> was

the<00:02:43.060> edges<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.400> beautiful<00:02:49.060> piece

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
the edges this is a beautiful piece

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.050 
the edges this is a beautiful piece
almost<00:02:50.080> resembles<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:52.300> modern-day<00:02:54.060> silver

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
almost resembles a modern-day silver

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.479 
almost resembles a modern-day silver
ounce<00:02:55.239> bar<00:02:56.610> but<00:02:57.610> this<00:02:57.760> was<00:02:58.920> made<00:02:59.920> during<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
ounce bar but this was made during the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.920 
ounce bar but this was made during the
1700s<00:03:01.330> in<00:03:02.260> Japan<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:06.520> then<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:07.450> come<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
1700s in Japan and then we come to the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.190 
1700s in Japan and then we come to the
gold<00:03:08.110> pieces<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:10.180> is<00:03:10.300> actually<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.600> electrum

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
gold pieces this is actually a electrum

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.780 
gold pieces this is actually a electrum
which<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.590> basically<00:03:12.390> I'd<00:03:13.390> say<00:03:14.610> 20-30<00:03:15.610> percent

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
which is basically I'd say 20-30 percent

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.220 
which is basically I'd say 20-30 percent
gold<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.630> rest<00:03:16.780> silver<00:03:17.320> mix<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:19.200> some<00:03:20.200> of

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
gold and the rest silver mix so some of

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.510 
gold and the rest silver mix so some of
these<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.410> honing

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.540 

and<00:03:27.610> then<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.170> design<00:03:29.530> shrinks<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.100> bit<00:03:30.130> for

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
and then the design shrinks a bit for

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.500 
and then the design shrinks a bit for
this<00:03:31.110> denomination<00:03:32.110> a<00:03:32.640> little<00:03:33.640> bit<00:03:33.760> smaller<00:03:34.150> a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
this denomination a little bit smaller a

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.190 
this denomination a little bit smaller a
little<00:03:34.930> bit<00:03:35.050> lighter<00:03:36.540> design<00:03:37.540> pretty<00:03:37.990> much

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
little bit lighter design pretty much

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.910 
little bit lighter design pretty much
the<00:03:38.380> same<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:42.010> then<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:42.550> have<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:43.120> Ichi<00:03:44.110> boo<00:03:44.500> kin

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
the same and then we have a Ichi boo kin

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.230 
the same and then we have a Ichi boo kin
which<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.520> basically<00:03:45.790> one<00:03:46.410> one<00:03:47.410> unit<00:03:48.220> one<00:03:48.910> fan

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
which is basically one one unit one fan

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.380 
which is basically one one unit one fan
unit<00:03:49.740> one<00:03:50.740> fraction<00:03:52.920> from<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.130> mid<00:03:54.940> 1700s<00:03:56.070> and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
unit one fraction from the mid 1700s and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.180 
unit one fraction from the mid 1700s and
if<00:03:58.390> you<00:03:58.480> can<00:03:58.600> see<00:03:58.690> here<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.380> mint<00:03:59.680> mark

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
if you can see here that's the mint mark

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.130 
if you can see here that's the mint mark
well<00:04:00.430> not<00:04:00.580> mint<00:04:00.760> mark<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.150> would<00:04:01.330> say<00:04:01.510> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
well not mint mark but I would say the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.520 
well not mint mark but I would say the
designator<00:04:02.770> character<00:04:03.310> telling<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.180> which

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
designator character telling you which

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.160 
designator character telling you which
Emperor<00:04:05.730> issued<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:10.390> then<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.020> have

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
Emperor issued this and then you have

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:25.530 
Emperor issued this and then you have
the<00:04:11.320> two<00:04:12.280> boo<00:04:12.640> kin<00:04:16.470> gold<00:04:17.470> piece<00:04:22.110> and<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:24.540> my

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
the two boo kin gold piece and then my

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.430 
the two boo kin gold piece and then my
best<00:04:25.780> piece

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
best piece

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.890 
best piece
it's<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.870> co<00:04:28.870> bond<00:04:29.110> kin<00:04:29.650> or<00:04:29.890> co<00:04:30.400> bond<00:04:30.900> plate

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
it's the co bond kin or co bond plate

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.010 
it's the co bond kin or co bond plate
money<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:34.540> is<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.750> gold<00:04:34.990> piece<00:04:36.360> file<00:04:37.360> I'd

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
money so this is a gold piece file I'd

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.990 
money so this is a gold piece file I'd
say<00:04:38.200> quite<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.920> high<00:04:39.220> grade<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.520> gold

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
say quite a high grade of gold

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.780 
say quite a high grade of gold
I<00:04:40.560> wouldn't<00:04:41.560> say<00:04:41.650> pure<00:04:42.010> but<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.430> still<00:04:42.580> quite

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
I wouldn't say pure but it's still quite

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.880 
I wouldn't say pure but it's still quite
high<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:44.080> is<00:04:44.140> from<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:45.130> early<00:04:45.490> 1800s

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.100 

not<00:04:50.890> that<00:04:51.160> very<00:04:51.430> easy<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:52.060> come<00:04:52.270> by<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:55.570> you

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
not that very easy to come by and you

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.430 
not that very easy to come by and you
have<00:04:56.230> all<00:04:56.470> these<00:04:56.650> counter<00:04:57.130> marks

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
have all these counter marks

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.460 
have all these counter marks
this<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.950> era<00:05:00.720> designator<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:02.140> tell<00:05:02.350> you

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
this is the era designator to tell you

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.770 
this is the era designator to tell you
which<00:05:02.650> Emperor<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.310> these<00:05:04.240> are<00:05:04.480> probably

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
which Emperor and these are probably

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.040 
which Emperor and these are probably
assayer's<00:05:05.290> marks<00:05:06.390> official<00:05:07.390> assayer's<00:05:07.750> marks

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
assayer's marks official assayer's marks

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.010 
assayer's marks official assayer's marks
and<00:05:08.200> this<00:05:08.320> is<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.770> Gotoh

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
and this is the Gotoh

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.930 
and this is the Gotoh
family<00:05:11.020> crest<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:12.540> Imperial<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:15.510> guess<00:05:16.510> mint

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
family crest the Imperial I guess mint

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.650 
family crest the Imperial I guess mint
maker's<00:05:19.680> crest<00:05:21.630> basically<00:05:22.630> imperial<00:05:23.230> family

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
maker's crest basically imperial family

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.650 
maker's crest basically imperial family
gave<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:26.500> Gotoh<00:05:26.890> family<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:28.030> right<00:05:28.330> to

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
gave the Gotoh family the right to

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.190 
gave the Gotoh family the right to
produce<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:30.010> coinage<00:05:30.370> for<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.060> realm<00:05:31.270> back

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
produce the coinage for the realm back

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.840 
produce the coinage for the realm back
in<00:05:32.350> the<00:05:32.440> day

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.580 

so<00:05:40.850> values<00:05:42.610> generally<00:05:43.610> these<00:05:44.470> probably<00:05:45.470> go

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
so values generally these probably go

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.710 
so values generally these probably go
about<00:05:45.770> eighty<00:05:46.490> two<00:05:47.030> hundred<00:05:47.330> and<00:05:47.420> twenty

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
about eighty two hundred and twenty

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.840 
about eighty two hundred and twenty
dollars<00:05:49.060> this<00:05:50.060> one<00:05:50.330> probably<00:05:50.720> balled<00:05:51.850> twenty

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
dollars this one probably balled twenty

00:05:52.850 --> 00:06:00.190 
dollars this one probably balled twenty
to<00:05:52.970> thirty<00:05:56.410> this<00:05:57.410> one<00:05:58.780> probably<00:05:59.780> about<00:05:59.960> two

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
to thirty this one probably about two

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.450 
to thirty this one probably about two
hundred<00:06:00.320> maybe<00:06:01.130> yeah<00:06:01.910> 250<00:06:03.070> this<00:06:04.070> one<00:06:04.280> a<00:06:04.310> little

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
hundred maybe yeah 250 this one a little

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:11.620 
hundred maybe yeah 250 this one a little
bit<00:06:04.670> less<00:06:06.580> probably<00:06:07.580> like<00:06:07.760> 150<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:09.560> 200<00:06:10.630> this

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
bit less probably like 150 to 200 this

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.500 
bit less probably like 150 to 200 this
one<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.800> trade<00:06:13.100> silver<00:06:13.490> I<00:06:13.700> would<00:06:14.420> say<00:06:14.630> about

one actually the one boo pieces are more

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.420 
one actually the one boo pieces are more
scarce<00:06:56.810> generally<00:06:57.470> speaking<00:06:57.800> than<00:06:57.980> the<00:06:58.070> tubu

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
scarce generally speaking than the tubu

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.970 
scarce generally speaking than the tubu
pieces<00:06:59.980> just<00:07:00.980> like<00:07:01.130> an<00:07:01.400> odd<00:07:01.750> denomination<00:07:02.980> and

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
pieces just like an odd denomination and

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.680 
pieces just like an odd denomination and
usually<00:07:04.490> only<00:07:04.760> the<00:07:05.030> older<00:07:07.150> or<00:07:08.150> the<00:07:08.360> earlier

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
usually only the older or the earlier

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.930 
usually only the older or the earlier
ones<00:07:10.990> the<00:07:11.990> series<00:07:12.320> had<00:07:12.680> these<00:07:13.040> one<00:07:13.340> boo<00:07:13.520> pieces

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
ones the series had these one boo pieces

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.750 
ones the series had these one boo pieces
later<00:07:14.750> on<00:07:14.960> they<00:07:15.140> stopped<00:07:15.440> producing<00:07:15.740> it<00:07:16.040> but<00:07:16.220> I

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
later on they stopped producing it but I

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.840 
later on they stopped producing it but I
would<00:07:17.060> say<00:07:17.240> this<00:07:17.630> probably<00:07:18.320> about<00:07:18.470> two<00:07:19.340> maybe

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
would say this probably about two maybe
