00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:16.629
 and these women that I can not leave like that 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.629
 that already white corrector 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.610
 this 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.610
 or not 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.530
 who told them 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.720
 or is it really who told them who is 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.580
 I told you to use a road 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.980
 white to cover your dark circles does not 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.140
 speak again withdraw speech 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.900
 because all he wants to do is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.730
 ruin their lives or that you have 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.730
 listened to when someone is super 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.860
 fat to tell you babe wear white the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.910
 white will make you look thinner not 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.340
 true precisely because black is going to 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 help disguise dark colors 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.780
 help to disguise light colors and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 specifically the white the only thing that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.990
 they are going to do is highlight more then if 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.410
 we translate this into the makeup to whom 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 it sounds to you if you have some dark circles 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.550
 tremendous or horribly red mud 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 they are not going to wear a white concealer 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.780
 so that people turn to see him more 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.140
 like a look his red mud is now 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140
 White 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.159
 although he knows the truth well and right 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.290
 let's be realistic ok the first thing that 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.690
 we have to know is that the proofreaders 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.320
 of colors are they are specifically 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.930
 designed to neutralize other colors 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.910
 that we have on the skin for example almost 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.160
 correctors are never very necessary 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.979
 of colors with the correctors that do 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.790
 today is enough but when 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.190
 we have blue purple circles under 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.399
 they can practically never be covered with 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.580
 nothing or a bruise or mud too much 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.649
 red acne severe marks we resort 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.350
 then yes to the color correctors 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.600
 because to simplify us a bit more 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.920
 the issue of color correctors 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.869
 the first thing we have to do 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.209
 specifically in the dark circles by 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.280
 example is to see what color you have in 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.769
 our dark circles there are women who look 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.150
 a little blue there are dark circles that look 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.080
 little purple 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.480
 then for dark circles of the purple type or 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.650
 we have to use a concealer 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.330
 yellowish which is the opposite in the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.430
 circle of color and it's going to help us 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.640
 neutralize these shades of it 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.950
 way 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.190
 and their dark circles look a little more 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.650
 as blue or sasso bluish you have to 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.870
 use a peach or salmon corrector 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.180
 since they have their orange tones and it's the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.040
 opposite 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.200
 a good example of a proofreader that 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.580
 I used to not have it at hand 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.520
 but it is this 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.390
 this is from the brand mix and it's called 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.790
 fact of being with concealer something for the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.830
 style that just means that 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.000
 will specifically help us 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.630
 correct that kind of dark circles with 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.980
 purple or blue colorations 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.490
 to cover remove or cover a mud or 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.090
 a really serious skin situation 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.520
 of acne with red pimples what we have 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.720
 what to do is use a green concealer 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.030
 like this that we see here of the same 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.250
 way that the other colors the red and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.400
 the green are opposite and are neutralized to 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.150
 themselves then we can 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.350
 we apply a little green concealer in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.840
 minimum quantities 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.330
 and we use our corrector 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.350
 normal that we use in our day 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.720
 to day and the bar looks 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.580
 and with regard to the consistency that 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.790
 they have the correctors there 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.770
 correctors in pencil there are correctors 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.380
 in a kind of presentation like the 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.900
 lipsticks there are concealers in cream or 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.990
 pasta there are more liquid correctors 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.450
 they are depending on what we are going though 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.400
 so much that we need so much coverage is 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.650
 the concealer that we are going to choose if 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.160
 you for example as I do not present 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.030
 never or rarely present situations 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.730
 of dark circles I can recommend this 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.370
 As you can see, I like it a lot and it's almost 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.460
 there is no this is maybelline is called 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:33.240
 fit or this is the color 10 but there are 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.240
 4 or 5 more colors and you can see it here 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.219
 now if you need a little more 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:42.490
 coverage but not enough to use 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:45.569
 a cream a pastit can opt for 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.569
 something like this 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.100
 this concealer is from the knicks brand of 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.800
 the girl hd or high definition this line 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.460
 of correctors also has the tone 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.590
 green the lilac tone the blue if I do not 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.390
 wrong and yellow if you are 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.060
 truly consider that if 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.640
 they need some color correctors me 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.380
 I use these have left me 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.630
 incredibly well also these are from 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.780
 the costal cents brand is called 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.090
 as concealer quad and the 4 come 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.090
 colors as well as there are also four 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.340
 more neutral corrector tones 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.260
 more normal but good these are the 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.490
 that I use in the case of 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.819
 color correctors and 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:36.080
 and if they want to spend even less and 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.630
 have a super product with the penalty of 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.900
 criticism of the world and of all 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.210
 makeup artists who feel fabulous 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:49.050
 for buying expensive products 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.350
 this is a jewel is a pearl of 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.889
 knowledge is truly the 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.259
 corrector that I personally use 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:00.750
 when I get to have a little ojera or 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.930
 I want to cover a bit of barry everything 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.330
 that this is the corrector is a 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:10.259
 Wonder is great is the brand I saw 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.330
 its called concealer stick honestly 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.699
 is a very good proofreader has a 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.990
 very fine consistency is not heavy but 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.360
 it's pretty opaque 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.240
 and let's go ribbon tip suit what not 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.880
 can do for a mud or a bonfire 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.980
 another very good option, very opaque 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.950
 nothing else that is a little heavier the 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.849
 texture of the consistency is the study 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.039
 mac fix 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.279
 the only disadvantage of this concealer is 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:41.080
 which is a little more expensive is not a 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:44.169
 little clearer is much more expensive 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.580
 but it comes out pretty good and if you guys 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.169
 they are from people this is very 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.669
 important and you are of the people 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.749
 who generally find that their 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:55.240
 corrector is made as cracks or is 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:57.249
 he runs them or things like that is 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.349
 because the area that is under the eyes is 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:02.409
 very sensitive very thin and is very 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:05.349
 dry then before testing 

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:07.779
 any concealer and try this 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:10.119
 cover that kind of dark circles that I know 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:13.149
 they run with a common checker and 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:16.419
 current we should one keep that 

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:20.069
 well hydrated area or opt for a 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.069
 corrector like this one 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.230
 which I find incredible because he already has 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.140
 The function of hydrating and covering the 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.020
 same time it's called sample cover and it's 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.660
 of brand also this is a little 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.770
 rather more expensive but it is the only one 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.260
 I have found that truly 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.740
 It works for those kinds of situations 

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:43.870
 that the corrector runs and without more 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.740
 the moment I think it's about 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:50.010
 mention all the basic points that 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.960
 I think they need to know but good 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:55.990
 maybe later we see it in an example 

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:58.390
 more specific at the moment by my 

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.430
 part is everything I thank you very much for the 

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:03.580
 video if it's useful for you to share what 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:06.729
 subscribe to the channel or like it or all 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:09.120
 together and if not 

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:11.160
 then go back to see parts and it's good 

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.340
 reconsider 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:18.680
 I even here I leave I leave them 

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.680
 I command a besote chau
