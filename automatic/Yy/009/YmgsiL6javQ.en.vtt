but<00:00:05.580> I've<00:00:05.670> now<00:00:05.819> decided<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.330> split<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:06.810> off<00:00:06.960> and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
but I've now decided to split it off and

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.280 
but I've now decided to split it off and
expand<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.799> for<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> few<00:00:08.220> reasons<00:00:08.599> first<00:00:09.599> off<00:00:09.870> it

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
expand it for a few reasons first off it

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.720

would<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.590> made<00:00:10.679> my<00:00:10.860> review<00:00:11.160> just<00:00:11.429> way<00:00:11.670> too

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
would have made my review just way too

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.049 
would have made my review just way too
long<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.599> secondly<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:14.009> covers<00:00:14.490> aspects<00:00:14.940> of

actually<00:00:21.720> read<00:00:22.080> an<00:00:22.320> amorous<00:00:22.680> all<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> way

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
actually read an amorous all the way

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.650 
actually read an amorous all the way
through<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.609> are<00:00:24.029> learning<00:00:24.210> about<00:00:24.420> the

series through my reviews and I figured

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
series through my reviews and I figured
it'd<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.029> fair<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> separate<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.529> it'll

it'd be fair to separate this as it'll

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.040 
it'd be fair to separate this as it'll
