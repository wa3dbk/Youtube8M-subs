00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello friends I am yadira marquÃ©s de tus 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.690
 Roberts and today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.809
 a topic that I love is going to be called 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.799
 formal for everyone what do I mean 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.020
 generally when we talk about a 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.109
 executive clothing composed of 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.599
 three basic pieces that are the suit the 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.490
 shirt and tie we only get to 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.740
 combinations like this that I have here 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.410
 side because because most of the 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.900
 Voice magazines or if you want to communicate 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 power executive put on a suit 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.930
 dark a clear shirt and a tie 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.940
 vinotinto today I 'm going to 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.250
 show that we can all see each other 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.890
 professionals although we belong to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.410
 several areas for example suddenly a 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.750
 creative manager has a meeting with 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.520
 a financial manager but he's also going 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.100
 to go to lawyers and they will also go 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.560
 four psychologists who want to pas 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.080
 see formal in its essence is different 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.290
 one wants to communicate reliability 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.839
 the other fashion the other accessibility and the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.610
 other power and how we will achieve 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.940
 through three very simple things 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.750
 formas textures and colors we are going to 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.750
 work on it 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.270
 very good friends we are here with 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 our three executives 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.320
 retaking our power code 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.509
 originals that we are used to 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.310
 see but we see two other executives 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.930
 that they have clothes very form of 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.850
 carrying all three pieces but 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.850
 communicating totally different things 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.700
 very well here we have two 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.310
 high - level professionals of this 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.740
 side I have the financial director and of 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.500
 this side I have the lawyer how can we 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.390
 change a good player with the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.090
 financial who wants to communicate power 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.640
 first of all we see a combination in blue 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.740
 marine but what does he plays to give him a 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.600
 touch of accessibility with 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.360
 stamped on the tie and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.700
 frightened from the first to the end where is 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.619
 a harmony in dark colors that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.869
 grants power but looks much more 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.300
 avant - garde on this side we have the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.000
 lawyer and we have left the typical 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.580
 always black and blue suit for the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.350
 lawyer not this lawyer knows that in addition 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.230
 to see its powerful has to be seen 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.780
 reliable so I applied a code in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.880
 a gray suit a little lighter than 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.370
 besides giving it accessibility together with 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.959
 the striped shirt makes it reliable 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.830
 he wants everyone to give him his 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.320
 cases 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.480
 still adds a protocol when putting a 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.030
 tie in a monochromatic tone with the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.070
 suit and a scarf put in a very 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.090
 traditional in white tone my two 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.010
 ready executives 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.010
 to succeed communicating something totally 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.840
 next we are with the last 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 two executives obviously they are 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.190
 much more relaxed than the previous ones 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.680
 as we can see it from the beginning 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.260
 color we start to see in both more 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.360
 mix of color plus mix of textures and 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.580
 also more mix prints we're going to 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.500
 start first with the psychologist who 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.410
 I would not trust this psychologist 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.270
 has had much thicker textures has 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.700
 gone by tones in more colors 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.400
 clear but still formal suit 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.980
 shirt and tie in a lot more code 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.020
 accessible on the other hand we have a 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.060
 most fashionable executive that has been a 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.910
 little rebellious but following the rules 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.830
 which he wears his suit also without 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.750
 tie but has replaced a piece 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.540
 fundamental for the businessman 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.940
 the sack has changed it for a raincoat 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.890
 has a lot to do with the season 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.300
 suddenly and it rains suddenly we are not 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.430
 preparations 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.380
 it remains very formal very much 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.660
 more colorful much more daring in their 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.980
 tie combination does not matter the one of 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.980
 fashion likes to be seen 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.030
 Well we have seen that when 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:03.420
 try talking about executive clothes 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.549
 we have many options in colors and in 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.079
 forms for example in brooks brothers 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.120
 where we can find all this 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.980
 variety of clothes this has been all 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.230
 I hope you have understood that the formal 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.219
 it can be for all I am yadira market 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.219
