doesn't mind me showing you and using it
as<00:00:52.199> an<00:00:52.320> example<00:00:52.850> but<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:54.239> here's<00:00:54.600> our

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
as an example but basically here's our

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
as an example but basically here's our
image<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.440> see<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.890> cut<00:00:56.100> off<00:00:56.250> here

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
image and you can see it's cut off here

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
image and you can see it's cut off here
because<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:56.969> too<00:00:57.180> wide<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.289> image<00:00:58.440> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because it's too wide and the image is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.240 
because it's too wide and the image is
actually<00:00:59.539> 675<00:01:00.539> pixels<00:01:01.199> wide<00:01:01.440> by<00:01:01.770> three

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
actually 675 pixels wide by three

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
actually 675 pixels wide by three
hundred<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.699> sixty<00:01:03.090> nine<00:01:03.270> pixels<00:01:03.780> down<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
hundred and sixty nine pixels down so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
yeah so previews the easiest program in

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.880 
yeah so previews the easiest program in
the<00:01:35.820> world<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.180> use<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.570> resize<00:01:36.930> an<00:01:37.140> image<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
the height separately okay so for

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.399 
the height separately okay so for
instance<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.850> say<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.420> 550<00:01:58.350> is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
instance if I say that I think 550 is

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.719 
instance if I say that I think 550 is
going<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.619> hit<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.640> it

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
going to hit you can see it

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.749 
going to hit you can see it
automatically<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> fit<00:02:01.950> sorry<00:02:02.250> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
can see it automatically changes the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.130 
can see it automatically changes the
height<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.950> 301<00:02:05.670> there<00:02:06.060> yet<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.990> I've

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
scale proportionally change that whip to

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.569 
scale proportionally change that whip to
550<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.120> retains<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.810> height<00:02:32.019> yeah<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.920> then

all it does is it squashes it up a
little<00:02:35.170> bit<00:02:35.439> but<00:02:35.799> it<00:02:35.920> retains<00:02:36.189> the<00:02:36.400> height<00:02:36.579> for

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
little bit but it retains the height for

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.240 
little bit but it retains the height for
you<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.299> it<00:02:37.390> just<00:02:37.689> takes<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.709> those<00:02:38.950> sides

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
going to play with it because otherwise

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.520 
going to play with it because otherwise
it<00:04:33.879> starts<00:04:34.210> resizing<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.900> from<00:04:35.110> where<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.409> just

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
it starts resizing it from where it just

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.629 
it starts resizing it from where it just
was<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.919> then<00:04:36.009> it<00:04:36.099> gets<00:04:36.159> very<00:04:36.280> complicated

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
was and then it gets very complicated

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.469 
was and then it gets very complicated
and<00:04:37.300> we<00:04:37.930> undo<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.330> then<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.449> go<00:04:40.599> 550<00:04:41.199> and

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
and we undo that and then we go 550 and

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.990 
and we undo that and then we go 550 and
then<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.629> squashes<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.650> up<00:04:44.770> again<00:04:45.069> and<00:04:45.220> there

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
then it squashes it up again and there

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.580 
then it squashes it up again and there
you<00:04:46.090> go<00:04:46.270> that's<00:04:46.690> how<00:04:46.840> you<00:04:46.900> resize<00:04:47.349> an<00:04:47.500> image

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
you go that's how you resize an image

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.140 
you go that's how you resize an image
and<00:04:47.919> with<00:04:48.039> both<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.370> those<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.699> simply<00:04:49.030> go
