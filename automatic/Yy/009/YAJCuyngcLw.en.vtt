00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 your fucking state with spaghetti 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.730
 zucchini and cheese sauce a recipe 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.580
 delicious and very very easy many people 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.830
 says I do not like tofu I did not know anything 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.289
 it's like eating cardboard you know what has 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.480
 past that they have cooked it without making 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.640
 before a marinade like the one I'm going to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800
 teach let's start by drying the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.380
 tofu we remove the water that comes in the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.869
 container and place the tofu block 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.179
 on kitchen paper or on a cloth 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.520
 well clean cotton we cover with more 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.610
 kitchen paper and now let's put 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 I put another table and on it 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.469
 a couple of books that weigh a lot with 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.110
 careful so they do not fall I leave 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.110
 well over half an hour and look at the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.480
 paper is completely soaked let's go 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.090
 to cut the tofu first divided into five 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.699
 strips cutting in this direction and then 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.800
 I make three more cuts in this way for 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.870
 get me to stay in cubes like 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.120
 this you see here the tofu is cooked 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.280
 better if the pieces are not too 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.559
 big so I go back to cutting each 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.869
 cube in half and you are ready to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.030
 put in adobo the marinade takes two 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.549
 tablespoons of soy sauce 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 remember that we have to look for a 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.470
 soy sauce that does not carry sugar in the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.750
 list of ingredients we add two 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.240
 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar or 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.880
 white wine vinegar a spoonful of 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.100
 lemon or lime juice a teaspoon 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.130
 of dried onion powder and a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.979
 teaspoon dried garlic powder this 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.710
 last ingredient is optional are two or 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.840
 three sachets of stevia powder 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 it is very good but it is not essential 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.119
 let's put the tofu pieces with 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.430
 the marinade in a container like this that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.890
 it has a lid, we close it and we give it a pair 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.200
 of laps so that the marinade covers all 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.240
 the tofu chips we have to leave it 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.490
 a minimum of three hours resting in the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.130
 fridge I leave all this done the day 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
 earlier and so when I get home I have 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.540
 the tofu ready to cook we are going to 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.329
 cooking this is going to be fast just 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.549
 we will take 15 minutes we will start by 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.099
 Put a pan on the fire with a 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.379
 teaspoon of olive oil toss 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.390
 the tofu that will have absorbed all the 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.580
 marinade and cook 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.800
 leaving a minute for the tofu to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.810
 Roasting by one side when 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 golden on that side we turn around 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.910
 and we cook another minute past that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.400
 minute we give another round and so we go 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.860
 browning the tofu dice for all their 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.350
 faces we're going to need a total of 6 to 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.570
 8 minutes when the tofu is golden brown 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.640
 remove from the pan and let's make 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.620
 the zucchini spaghetti I've 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 taught to cut the zucchini for 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.700
 Shape it into spaghetti in a video 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.190
 Previous if you 've missed it, do not 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.530
 worry at the end of this video I'll leave 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.900
 a link to this tutorial of agreement 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.890
 let's cook this zucchini pasta 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.650
 for 3 or 4 minutes on high heat 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.660
 stirring so that it does not stick is very 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.700
 important that you do not put salt when 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.220
 the spaghetti is ready and we take them out 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.540
 from the pan I put them in a colander 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.030
 on a fountain 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.310
 so if they release some liquid then no 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.920
 they will fill the sauce with water we have two more 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.260
 minutes and we can eat we put a 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.090
 can of mushrooms in the pan after 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.160
 of draining the water that the can brings 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.750
 we add 100 grams of spreadable cheese 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.110
 low in fat 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.290
 better if it is 0 we also put 2 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.170
 tablespoons of soy sauce and 3 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.330
 tablespoons of skimmed milk not 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.970
 we have to put salt because the sauce 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.760
 soybeans and the cheese mixture of 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.160
 spread and milk imitates perfectly a 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.370
 cream sauce is done in just 2 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.260
 minutes and it is creamy and very very rich 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.780
 when the cheese has been undone by 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.360
 complete we add the spaghetti 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.030
 zucchini and we take a couple of turns to 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.880
 that are steeped in the sauce we serve the 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.610
 spaghetti with the sauce the toasted tofu and 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.370
 a teaspoon of sesame seeds or
