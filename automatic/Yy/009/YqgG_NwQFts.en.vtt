00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
ridiculous but it's kind of my brain

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
avoiding have been wanting to do this

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.479 
avoiding have been wanting to do this
video<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.320> I've<00:00:40.410> been<00:00:40.500> kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.860> avoiding<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
video but I've been kind of avoiding it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.110 
video but I've been kind of avoiding it
I<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:42.390> sometimes<00:00:43.579> when<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> kind<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I think sometimes when this is kind of

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.660 
I think sometimes when this is kind of
how<00:00:45.180> therapy<00:00:45.629> works<00:00:45.750> too<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.170> once<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
how therapy works too is like once you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.950 
how therapy works too is like once you
verbalize<00:00:47.670> something<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.270> kind<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.660> realize

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
verbalize something you kind of realize

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
verbalize something you kind of realize
how<00:00:49.170> silly<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.430> stopped

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
how silly it is and then you stopped

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
how silly it is and then you stopped
doing<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> particular<00:00:51.750> thing<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> were

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
doing the particular thing you were

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.930 
doing the particular thing you were
doing<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> feeling<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.910> know

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
doing so have a feeling that you know

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
doing so have a feeling that you know
some<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> stuff<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> video<00:00:55.820> feels

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
some of the stuff in the video feels

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.450 
some of the stuff in the video feels
like<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> mute<00:00:57.390> point<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.739> juncture<00:00:59.280> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460

didn't want to say mute point at this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.000 
didn't want to say mute point at this

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.649 
needed to look at and I do think that
you<00:06:04.490> know<00:06:04.610> for<00:06:04.820> a<00:06:04.849> minute<00:06:04.969> there<00:06:05.120> some<00:06:05.449> of<00:06:05.539> my

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
you know for a minute there some of my

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.529 
you know for a minute there some of my
bed<00:06:05.870> eating<00:06:06.430> did<00:06:07.430> have<00:06:07.639> to<00:06:07.820> do<00:06:08.000> with<00:06:08.240> some<00:06:08.449> of

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
bed eating did have to do with some of

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.029 
bed eating did have to do with some of
the<00:06:08.599> anxiety<00:06:09.139> I<00:06:09.169> was<00:06:09.349> feeling<00:06:09.680> some<00:06:09.830> of<00:06:09.889> the

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
the anxiety I was feeling some of the

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.740 
the anxiety I was feeling some of the
worrying<00:06:10.370> I<00:06:10.639> was<00:06:10.940> cheated<00:06:11.270> on<00:06:11.330> in<00:06:11.479> the<00:06:11.570> past

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
worrying I was cheated on in the past

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.260 
worrying I was cheated on in the past
and<00:06:12.169> that's<00:06:12.830> actually<00:06:13.099> when<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.460> gained<00:06:13.759> a<00:06:14.060> lot

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
and that's actually when I gained a lot

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.610 
and that's actually when I gained a lot
of<00:06:14.330> weight<00:06:14.599> and<00:06:14.840> then<00:06:14.900> stopped<00:06:15.169> dating<00:06:15.380> was

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
of weight and then stopped dating was

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.970 
of weight and then stopped dating was
after

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:15.980 
after

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.850 
after
cheated<00:06:16.280> on<00:06:16.660> so<00:06:17.660> I<00:06:17.690> guess<00:06:17.990> sometimes<00:06:18.320> I<00:06:18.590> worry

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
cheated on so I guess sometimes I worry

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.710 
cheated on so I guess sometimes I worry
about<00:06:19.100> that<00:06:19.310> and<00:06:19.520> then<00:06:19.610> I'll<00:06:19.730> start<00:06:19.760> eating<00:06:20.480> in

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
about that and then I'll start eating in

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.530 
about that and then I'll start eating in
