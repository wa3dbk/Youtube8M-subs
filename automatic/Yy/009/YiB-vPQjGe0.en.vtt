00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so we'll work from the left and we'll go

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.910 
so we'll work from the left and we'll go
down<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.960> allows<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> choose<00:01:10.619> which

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
much everyone uses it and then you can

you<00:02:06.119> want<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:06.780> 80

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you want it for 80

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.059 
you want it for 80
and<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.090> 720<00:02:09.509> where<00:02:09.929> 720<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.920> is

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and then you go 720 where 720 that is

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.850 
and then you go 720 where 720 that is
1280<00:02:11.459> by<00:02:11.580> 720<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.810> would<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:12.959> 720p<00:02:13.680> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
1280 by 720 so this would be 720p and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.330 
1280 by 720 so this would be 720p and
then<00:02:14.580> if<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.970> scroll<00:02:15.209> up<00:02:15.590> 1920<00:02:16.590> x<00:02:16.680> 1080<00:02:16.830> this

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
then if I scroll up 1920 x 1080 this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.220 
then if I scroll up 1920 x 1080 this
this<00:02:17.790> will<00:02:17.910> be<00:02:18.030> 1080p<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.810> that's<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.110> one

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
this will be 1080p and that's the one

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.380 
this will be 1080p and that's the one
you<00:02:19.349> want<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:21.030> then<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.239> can

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
you want to go for and then you can

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.390 
you want to go for and then you can
choose<00:02:21.750> your<00:02:21.870> bitrate<00:02:22.200> now<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.390> usually<00:02:24.390> go<00:02:24.780> for

choose your bitrate now I usually go for

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.190 
choose your bitrate now I usually go for
the<00:02:26.400> highest<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:28.730> I've<00:02:29.730> been<00:02:30.150> using<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.140> for

fine add FPS is the you know if you're

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.199 
fine add FPS is the you know if you're
recording<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:55.190> 1080p<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.519> can<00:02:56.670> only<00:02:56.849> record

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
recording in 1080p you can only record

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
in 30 frames per second so that's not

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.059

video<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.750> just<00:03:25.109> doesn't<00:03:25.410> look<00:03:25.590> very<00:03:25.650> good<00:03:25.859> the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
frames kind of lag and it just then it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.039

external audio but I don't need to worry

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.349 
external audio but I don't need to worry
about<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.310> because<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:38.790> starts<00:03:39.060> with<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
about that because it starts with the

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.789 
about that because it starts with the
capture<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.440> gives<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.680> little

capture and I gives you a little

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.470 
capture and I gives you a little
snapshot<00:03:41.069> button<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.670> if<00:03:41.760> you're<00:03:41.880> in<00:03:41.970> game<00:03:42.180> and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
snapshot button so if you're in game and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.410 
snapshot button so if you're in game and
you<00:03:42.600> got<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.720> program<00:03:43.079> open<00:03:43.380> tap<00:03:44.370> f9<00:03:44.730> and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
you got the program open tap f9 and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.059 
you got the program open tap f9 and
that's<00:03:45.569> all<00:03:45.690> done<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:46.889> can<00:03:46.920> make

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
that's all done and you can make

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.590 
that's all done and you can make
different<00:03:47.220> loadout<00:03:47.639> profiles<00:03:48.060> as<00:03:48.239> well<00:03:48.389> and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
different loadout profiles as well and

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.000 
different loadout profiles as well and
then<00:03:48.959> once<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.200> have<00:03:49.350> your<00:03:49.440> profile<00:03:49.799> saved

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
then once you have your profile saved

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.520 
then once you have your profile saved
you<00:03:50.430> literally<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.910> click<00:03:51.060> ready<00:03:51.530> okay

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
you literally to click ready okay

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.849 
you literally to click ready okay
profile<00:03:53.250> saved<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.200> put<00:03:55.500> together<00:03:55.560> this

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
profile saved so I put together this

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.500 
profile saved so I put together this
little<00:03:56.069> video<00:03:56.280> segment<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.090> basically<00:03:57.389> show

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
little video segment to basically show

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.530 
little video segment to basically show
you<00:03:57.750> how<00:03:58.530> little<00:03:58.799> FPS<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.670> drops<00:04:00.000> when

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
you how little FPS it drops when

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.759 
you how little FPS it drops when
recording<00:04:00.870> now<00:04:01.230> you<00:04:01.290> can<00:04:01.440> see<00:04:01.590> at<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.709> top

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
recording now you can see at the top

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.020 
recording now you can see at the top
left<00:04:02.100> corner<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.489> says<00:04:02.579> I'm<00:04:02.760> not<00:04:02.910> recording

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
left corner it says I'm not recording

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.059 
left corner it says I'm not recording
and<00:04:03.540> then<00:04:04.139> it<00:04:04.230> will<00:04:04.319> change<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.739> i'll<00:04:04.829> say<00:04:04.950> i'm

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
and then it will change and i'll say i'm

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.800 
and then it will change and i'll say i'm
recording<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.730> on<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> right<00:04:06.269> hand<00:04:06.420> side<00:04:06.540> in

recording and on the right hand side in

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.950 
recording and on the right hand side in
yellow<00:04:07.109> it<00:04:07.590> has<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.190> FPS

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
yellow it has the FPS

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.550 
yellow it has the FPS
and<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.320> can<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.920> only<00:04:11.370> really<00:04:11.760> drops

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
and you can see it only really drops

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.920 
and you can see it only really drops
three<00:04:13.560> or<00:04:13.710> four<00:04:14.180> frames<00:04:15.180> per<00:04:15.390> second<00:04:15.780> I'm

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
three or four frames per second I'm

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.300 
three or four frames per second I'm
getting<00:04:16.230> a<00:04:16.560> decent<00:04:17.040> playable<00:04:17.670> FPS<00:04:18.060> right<00:04:18.300> now

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
getting a decent playable FPS right now

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.950 
getting a decent playable FPS right now
now<00:04:20.310> preferably<00:04:20.490> you<00:04:21.240> want<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.450> be<00:04:21.510> getting<00:04:21.780> as

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
now preferably you want to be getting as

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.130 
now preferably you want to be getting as
many<00:04:22.260> FPS<00:04:22.590> as<00:04:23.190> possible<00:04:23.910> but<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.420> default<00:04:24.900> for

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
many FPS as possible but the default for

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.590 
many FPS as possible but the default for
YouTube<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:25.950> FPS<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.150> doesn't<00:04:27.450> matter

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
YouTube is the FPS so it doesn't matter

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.400 
YouTube is the FPS so it doesn't matter
if<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:28.320> record<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.770> 720p<00:04:29.340> video<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.660> 60fps

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
if you record a 720p video in 60fps

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.670 
if you record a 720p video in 60fps
because<00:04:32.250> when<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.030> upload<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.420> anyway<00:04:33.960> it

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
because when you upload it anyway it

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.350 
because when you upload it anyway it
will<00:04:34.800> compress<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.280> down<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.730> 30<00:04:35.970> frames<00:04:36.300> per

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
will compress it down to 30 frames per

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.360 
will compress it down to 30 frames per
second<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:36.960> basically<00:04:37.470> as<00:04:37.650> long<00:04:37.950> as<00:04:38.310> you're

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
second so basically as long as you're

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.420 
second so basically as long as you're
getting<00:04:38.520> around<00:04:39.000> 50<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.630> 60<00:04:40.110> FPS<00:04:40.470> that's<00:04:41.220> a

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
getting around 50 to 60 FPS that's a

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.580 
getting around 50 to 60 FPS that's a
good<00:04:41.580> kind<00:04:41.820> of<00:04:41.940> playable<00:04:42.390> FPS<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.290> be<00:04:43.440> at

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
good kind of playable FPS to be at

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.630 
good kind of playable FPS to be at
anything<00:04:44.490> below<00:04:45.420> 30<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:46.650> not<00:04:46.890> playable<00:04:47.310> and

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
anything below 30 it's not playable and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.920 
anything below 30 it's not playable and
it's<00:04:47.940> going<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.150> look<00:04:48.270> terrible<00:04:48.480> when<00:04:48.840> you

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
it's going to look terrible when you

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.070 
it's going to look terrible when you
upload<00:04:49.140> it<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.500> YouTube<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:51.510> if<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.720> can<00:04:51.870> play

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
upload it to YouTube so if you can play

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.580 
upload it to YouTube so if you can play
a<00:04:52.110> game<00:04:52.380> now<00:04:52.410> on<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.400> decent<00:04:53.790> FPS<00:04:53.940> either<00:04:54.630> 50<00:04:55.560> or

a game now on a decent FPS either 50 or

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.920 
a game now on a decent FPS either 50 or
60<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.550> chances<00:04:56.940> are<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.390> will<00:04:57.510> be<00:04:57.630> able<00:04:57.720> to

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
60 the chances are you will be able to

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.200 
60 the chances are you will be able to
record<00:04:58.170> a<00:04:58.440> decent<00:04:58.860> 1080p<00:04:59.400> video<00:04:59.700> with<00:05:00.060> this

this card my computer is not powerful

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.620 
this card my computer is not powerful
enough<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:05.070> record<00:05:05.430> 1080p<00:05:05.730> gameplay<00:05:06.480> with

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
this card allows me to do so the lag

anything<00:06:08.910> like<00:06:09.120> it<00:06:09.180> before<00:06:09.390> but<00:06:10.290> basically<00:06:10.740> it

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
anything like it before but basically it

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.780 
anything like it before but basically it
like<00:06:12.150> low<00:06:12.480> as<00:06:12.600> the<00:06:12.750> bitrate<00:06:13.020> of<00:06:13.230> my<00:06:13.530> screen<00:06:13.950> it

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
looks like so it's extremely hard to

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.840 
looks like so it's extremely hard to
notice<00:06:19.110> at<00:06:19.410> first<00:06:19.440> but<00:06:20.400> when<00:06:20.520> you're<00:06:20.669> looking

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
you get used to this but at first it's

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
four gigabytes per minute so you can see

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.559 
four gigabytes per minute so you can see
the<00:06:55.199> massive<00:06:55.469> difference<00:06:56.060> if<00:06:57.060> I<00:06:57.210> had<00:06:57.330> to<00:06:57.419> rate
