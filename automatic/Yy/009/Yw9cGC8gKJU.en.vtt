to<00:01:30.420> keep<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.960> performance<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> consistent

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to keep the performance is consistent

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.429

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
whereas with this this is really like a

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.830 
whereas with this this is really like a
much<00:01:34.829> more<00:01:35.040> traditional<00:01:35.250> acting<00:01:36.210> job<00:01:36.479> where

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
much more traditional acting job where

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.240 
much more traditional acting job where
you<00:01:37.079> get<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> script<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.710> advance<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.130> get

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you get the script in advance you get

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.710 
you get the script in advance you get
the<00:01:38.369> whole<00:01:38.520> script<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> read<00:01:39.479> what

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the whole script you get to read what

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380 
the whole script you get to read what
the<00:01:39.840> context<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.409> everything<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> you're

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the context of everything is and you're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.149 
the context of everything is and you're
acting<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.840> another<00:01:43.110> actor<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.619> real<00:01:43.920> time

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
acting with another actor in real time

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.679 
acting with another actor in real time
so<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.630> gives<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.560> whole<00:01:46.799> different<00:01:47.250> life<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.689> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so it gives a whole different life to to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.569 
so it gives a whole different life to to
these<00:01:48.840> scenes<00:01:49.170> these<00:01:49.560> these<00:01:49.829> very<00:01:50.070> dialogue

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
these scenes these these very dialogue

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.300 
these scenes these these very dialogue
heavy<00:01:50.759> scenes<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.259> think<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
heavy scenes and and I think that it's a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.039 
heavy scenes and and I think that it's a
great<00:01:53.460> way<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.759> work<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.840> hope<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
great way to work I really hope that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.499 
great way to work I really hope that
this<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.680> an<00:01:56.460> indicator<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.969> things<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> come

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
this is a an indicator of things to come

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.289 
this is a an indicator of things to come
in

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
in

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.999 
in
in<00:01:58.359> video<00:01:58.899> games<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.439> voice-acting<00:01:59.920> in

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
in video games and voice-acting in

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.109 
in video games and voice-acting in
general<00:02:00.310> because<00:02:00.549> I<00:02:00.609> think<00:02:00.789> that<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.000> is

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
general because I think that this is

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.060 
general because I think that this is
really<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.359> way<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:01.539> go<00:02:01.719> this<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.560> actually

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
really the way to go this is actually

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.499 
really the way to go this is actually
