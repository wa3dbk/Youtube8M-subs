00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.209
 in today's video we bring you three 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.440
 different ways of doing a mean 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.440
 tail let's see them 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.480
 for this hairstyle what you're going to need 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.820
 is that you are going to take a lock of the part 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.769
 side of your hair and you're going to start 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.480
 work it but with a braid of 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.669
 fish 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.329
 let's remember this garment what it does is 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.089
 that you separate two million of this 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.460
 bit that you saw and with is a 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.600
 bit of the outside part and the part 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.519
 of the inside part then of each 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.850
 side and you're doing that and he repeated 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.430
 you repeat, and you are transar 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.680
 super well explained in the first video 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.960
 that we have look for the ticket and coffee 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.149
 one 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.399
 there is very very well explained for 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.239
 I also remember to choose a little part of 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.010
 the part on the outside of one of 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.770
 the monthly and move to the part 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.350
 inside of the other and so jatib and so 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.420
 until they form this three which is a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.190
 braid that looks super pretty and 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.479
 remember that the braid to get up 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.800
 half of your head sits the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.409
 braid on the cta that had half and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.200
 then garma with a little bit and go to 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.979
 repeat this same but for the other 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.979
 side of his head 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.370
 and then we repeat the braid of 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.910
 fish that is to catch the outer lock 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.940
 from one of the pieces and pass it 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.530
 on the inside and so on 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.140
 finish 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.180
 and the idea is to form a half tail 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.950
 after treating your videos then already 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.200
 when they have the two hundred lists the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.180
 unite half remove the rubbers that the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.110
 clan were taking then to have them 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.119
 meanwhile and then simply 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.320
 we take a sock all the half and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.869
 ready 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.399
 here is the finished hairstyle 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.450
 We hope you like it is super value 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.450
 do them at home 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.130
 to begin it separates a lock of the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.319
 Top of your hair and start 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.920
 to braid like a French braid a 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920
 normal braid 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.310
 hold them with a little piece to finish 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.830
 Repeat the same procedure for 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.830
 other part 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.530
 we want to tell you dolls that this 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.019
 hairstyle is super easy and it is very 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.939
 nice then when you finish it this 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.159
 hairstyle we are trying to make another 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.599
 combed but did not go destinations seemed 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.599
 very beautiful and we wanted to show 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.849
 when you already have these two as 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.730
 we can see here in the video then 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.799
 you are going to take from the side part another 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.870
 tuft of hair another section and you're going to 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.579
 braid and you will also do the same 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.030
 for the other side so that you stay 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.030
 4 3 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.280
 good dolls for the part of the 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.870
 beginning of the braid braid in the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.030
 backwards because how are we going to carry 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.340
 the 43 backwards as the form must 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.439
 be like for that side and when they go 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.760
 like half of the braid if 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.269
 you can take it forward to 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.269
 Finalize 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.080
 when they already have 430 they join the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.520
 the back and hold them with a 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.680
 cachito 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.200
 then when you have them subject to 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.820
 a little bit all the braids start to 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.660
 remove the little pieces that you put on 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.660
 the others separately 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.410
 and ready to finish let go all the 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.980
 hair and you have your crown of 4 braids 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.980
 of half tail 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.820
 this average with which they come we loved it 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.710
 we hope you like it then 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.840
 what they have to do is take a 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.380
 lock of the side of his head 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.470
 and twist as you see in the video and 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.690
 then repeat the same thing with the other side 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.630
 Meanwhile, let's get them 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.700
 right in the middle and both as both 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.970
 vaquitas that we did in the middle with a 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.310
 hook and what we are going to do is that 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.170
 with this little bit left over 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.960
 let's make a tail braid 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.200
 fish that is that separates this strands 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.280
 He cited that he stayed in two equal sections 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.210
 and one of the sections 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.970
 you pass a bit of the lock to the center or 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.920
 be the other towards the inside of the 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.250
 another lock 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.560
 and repeat that with the other side or a 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.710
 outside piece to the inside 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.170
 the other a bit outside the party 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.900
 inside of the other and so and so and so 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.360
 until we go like weaving our 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.800
 always tense and dolls do not worry 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.810
 because this is a super braid 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.120
 messy then the idea is that they 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.880
 it is as well as relaxed then 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.650
 here you can see that if I doing the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.790
 braid 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.740
 with an outside palace in the middle and 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.259
 towards the middle profile of the interior and so on 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.400
 with both sides remember the key 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.740
 is elusive tranza that choosing 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.750
 tiny strands because if they are very 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.100
 big is not going to notice work as 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.740
 that is going to look like a normal braid 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.740
 then always a lock a bit 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.080
 small to the center and so on and then when 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.650
 already have the proper length is as 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.870
 almost all the hair that was there he 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.229
 You take it with a little bit and put it more 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.240
 thick to landon the sides and list 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.820
 dolls here is the finished hairstyle 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.310
 for us because we loved it looks 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.199
 super nice and then we could take them 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.850
 the little piece of the half but that's how 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:32.360
 they keep more for longer with the 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.360
 bizcochitos 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.830
