00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.510
 in this medium through television ads we have to show 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.669
 what has been the evolution of the roles of men and women in society 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.260
 that spain in recent years we will also see how the undef is the 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.920
 action has also picked up those different mindset is that different 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.790
 view 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.310
 first of all we will see announcements of the 60s in which they get that the 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.180
 woman is inferior to the man who was about to gain subordinate to him besides 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.520
 you just have to devote to the household chores of foster care 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.420
 the sons and the man is the miner of the public aspect ie 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.890
 politics, economics, labor, labor market, etc. 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.620
 this same also reflects the legislation of those years and is the 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.930
 1975 majority membership association and spent 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.930
 they have to start democracy 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.850
 in a second ad block per hundred and demos 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 as it gathers the feminist demands of the years 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.960
 60 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.610
 actually begins to India at the beginning of the 20th century with the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.990
 manifestations of the English and American suffragists who claim the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.030
 vote for women 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.590
 This session also had its achievements in the legislations finally 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.850
 will treat man to woman manuela absorbed in that egalitarian but has its 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.580
 balance because the woman is launched to the market for public life and life 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.770
 private 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.780
 abandoned and nobody takes care of it 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.760
 even admits to the manners of men 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.090
 in a third moment a third block of announcements we raise a new conception 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.220
 d the untouchables of the woman we call today co-responsibility 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.060
 i the controversy is also a greater presence of the male in the home 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.150
 that is to say and a greater presence of women the public space share 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.580
 roles that the two spaces both in the private and in the public 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.910
 in spite of that we will realize that obeid still persist percent and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.350
 two images in it the ads that continue to maintain that mission of 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.009
 subordination of the woman or salesian macho that corresponds to the 60s 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
