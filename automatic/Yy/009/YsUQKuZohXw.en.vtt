00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.900
 well that's a tutorial to learn to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.599
 play the song let me cry from carla 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.999
 love are in the easiest way possible 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.070
 with basic chords and this time not 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.570
 we will use capot up to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.800
 then I will show you the chords 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.850
 that are going to be used in this song 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.850
 which is very simple 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.740
 well the first chord this 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.220
 then we go to sun 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.630
 to me less 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 and finally to the 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.970
 and it would remain that way because of how the pace of 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.970
 the song 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.769
 good of these chords are those that 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.350
 they carry the whole song in that same 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.729
 order so it makes it even easier for them 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.030
 I will show the strum that this 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.030
 song 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.330
 Y 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.230
 Y 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.320
 yes 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.320
 Y 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.310
 i 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.720
 Y 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.660
 and well this has been all 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.550
 It was a very short video because in 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.990
 actually the song is not very complicated 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.420
 In reality, it's very easy 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.510
 the chords are repeated constantly and 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.420
 the strum and the rhythm is the same good 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.190
