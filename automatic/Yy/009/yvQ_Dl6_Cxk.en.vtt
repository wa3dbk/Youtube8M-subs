so<00:03:19.440> um<00:03:19.709> yeah<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:21.390> key<00:03:21.570> is<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> at<00:03:21.989> three<00:03:22.230> men

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
so um yeah the key is the at three men

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.010 
so um yeah the key is the at three men

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
and a rescue energy on Garrity's that's

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.190 
and a rescue energy on Garrity's that's
the<00:03:27.570> ideal<00:03:28.250> setup<00:03:29.250> for<00:03:29.580> garrett<00:03:29.820> us<00:03:30.140> how<00:03:31.140> you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the ideal setup for garrett us how you

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.270 
the ideal setup for garrett us how you

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
the last but not least bulkiness i run

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.160 
the last but not least bulkiness i run
only<00:03:44.220> one<00:03:44.489> Volkers<00:03:45.000> because<00:03:45.330> most<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.080> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
only one Volkers because most of the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.890 
only one Volkers because most of the
time<00:03:46.350> under<00:03:46.769> training<00:03:47.070> lock<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:48.510> might<00:03:48.720> have

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
time under training lock you might have

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.750 
time under training lock you might have
to<00:03:49.340> rely<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.370> Reggie<00:03:51.330> move<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.700> at<00:03:53.700> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
to rely on Reggie move and then at the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.509 
to rely on Reggie move and then at the
last<00:03:54.150> moment<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:54.900> can<00:03:55.080> use<00:03:55.769> Volkers<00:03:56.310> with

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
last moment you can use Volkers with

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.710 
last moment you can use Volkers with
impersonate<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.540> discard<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.049> last<00:03:58.110> match

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.460
