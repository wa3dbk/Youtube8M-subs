00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.469
 for everyone if you come god this tutorial 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.420
 is that you can have a trick sense 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.820
 to convert the way of approach to 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.610
 Show photos to any shape 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.590
 for example a tree a star or 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.259
 even some word that with a little 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.689
 of work we can get for it 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.440
 let's use a reflex camera as 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.350
 a medium bright objective 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.410
 for example the canon 50 millimeters in 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.710
 an opening of 14 and something that is very very 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.679
 pretty or overturn 100 million processes 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.579
 with 8 we can also use 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.760
 some objective 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.739
 for example 70 300 that although it does not have 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.519
 a personal opening in front of large 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.519
 yes that gives us a touch of grace 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.199
 in this photography mine you have the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.420
 natural blur of canon 50 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.590
 millimeters and here you can see from all 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.900
 we continue thanks to a small 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.280
 modification the modification that we are going to 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 use is a simple cardboard 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.690
 with a remembered shape in the inside of 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.380
 the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.380
 fold the cardboard 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.630
 objectives 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.119
 then we cut out a circle with the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.990
 diameter of our objective the 2 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.850
 grams and we are cutting the shapes 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.470
 what we want to get after 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.659
 we simply place it in front of the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.659
 objective and we take the photographs 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 here you can see other other examples of 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.659
 forms that we have recorded from nodes in the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.090
 trattorias such as a letter or 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.310
 the new one of your company or even 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.310
 a word was like comfortable 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.470
 Some things to keep in mind are the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.800
 Thickness of the cardboard has to be 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.920
 completely opaque since yes 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.990
 we use a normal one in a normal way 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.819
 this one is a drastic bit of this 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.030
 will happen the then of the photography 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.190
 will be very little received with 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.780
 effect this free contrast the French 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.150
 the notes you have to bear in mind that 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.250
 the compounds should be pretty 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.020
 attentive to the camera and wherever a 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.150
 little more separated to get a 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.560
 Major blur is technique but only 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.270
 for photographs but also for 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.190
 video the cameras of three modern 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.480
 incorporate those functions by a brush 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.580
 perfectly does that little trick 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.530
 to get the lights that are 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.040
 behind that touch the way that 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.040
 you want 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.360
 this is all for today I hope you have 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.700
 liked all join our channel

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.900
 on facebook.com 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.230
 they wonder why the pressure 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.230
 I was upside down
