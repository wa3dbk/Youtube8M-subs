00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.770
 that a friend brings you review of a 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.230
 game that I hope you like this kind of 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.619
 games I almost never do them review no 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.759
 it's called strike soccer 2 it's a game 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.880
 football and well maybe it's not a what 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.809
 it's like we 're going to remove this 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.380
 the bubbles here and good is not what 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.180
 we can say a fifa as such but it is 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.520
 a great soccer game because good 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.060
 to begin with they do not bring the real ones 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.700
 teams that are like in Barcelona 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.500
 the america blue cross but it brings about 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 teams that look alike in their name I think 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.170
 which it is why copyright and 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.030
 all that did not really put him 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.880
 your command when you started create this 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.860
 team and everything and good is what they are 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.960
 competitions that is cup the challenge that 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.890
 it's like campaign mode you can edit 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.450
 your teams 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:11.570
 friendly and friendly children and friendly 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.700
 party I do not know why those two come 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.680
 new good but good in competitions 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.180
 you will be able to play with what are several 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.990
 example equipment here is the barcelona 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.610
 export that is like Barcelona and the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.830
 Mexican league that comes on the continent 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.020
 american that is like the america 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.840
 hence, not in this case, what is going to happen 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.140
 like the American 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.759
 hence, let's see in this case 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.009
 you have what all your players are 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.799
 you can modify your speed your attack 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.929
 or ability to leave 99 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.340
 hundred also well in what they are all 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.219
 the equipment of each one offers 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.069
 the athletic one of guadalajara that would be 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:50.110
 as the file the new lion that is 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.179
 like jon in town society that is 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.810
 as puebla union of lion grows and I do not know 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.140
 what would be pachuca michoacán and juana 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 Chiapas comes with other names like 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.420
 blue crosspiece what good asshole 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.970
 winning matches but good 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.930
 they are like that as the league 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.850
 from there on the other fucking continent I do not 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.370
 agreement which is where the barcelona of 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.680
 what can you have to play certain 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.440
 song are days or long leagues are not 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.500
 they are not short like those here of fag 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.550
 there you can buy players comes tails 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.950
 borghetti falcao 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.850
 efe as falcao campaign I do not know what it is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.700
 as running 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.610
 hang 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.379
 today that andré iniesta but is iniesta 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.870
 fatal change the names is not 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.209
 cool this I in my case I have for 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.200
 here you have marquez as neymar makes a 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.840
 month and that is like I read messi and has returned 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.519
 which is like ronaldo for learning to 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.019
 this good principle is very 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.000
 entertaining more than anything because I do not 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.260
 you can change the difficulty in this 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.260
 case is very difficult and all that 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.750
 Let's go with time the graphs are not the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.000
 better but it has very good graphics 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.160
 you can change your uniform 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.990
 also yours 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.850
 and well let's see you can also 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.010
 modify your equipment you can buy 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.160
 here what would be like that cards for 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.720
 ability and you can modify the time 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.180
 being a team or if you get 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.760
 right now where I said edit a 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.410
 you could modify it at 100% cost 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.180
 that I will teach you those effects that you see 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.010
 now it's because of the cards that I have 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.069
 that is, if it looks like that with fire, it's because of 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.790
 card that I put that today 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.439
 miami - aragon 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.140
 you do not have to know the name because it 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.930
 active 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.189
 the little button below 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.189
 but I think that 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.819
 I spent 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:04.780
 the other one was stupid 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.920
 pause but good and as I say the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.700
 way to play this game is very 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.700
 easy very simple 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.829
 what I do not understand is how to make changes 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.870
 in the game because he does not leave me in 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.830
 this danger take out the clamp and red 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.960
 referee comes another pencil and red to see 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.810
 If it was like that, being mothers is never 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.910
 thrown none these dollar shots 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.129
 that the yellow one was taken out 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.599
 severe crock 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.599
 look grace the main 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.050
 Peanut peanuts as I tell them I do not know how 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.620
 what statistical goals how to make 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.620
 changes 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:52.139
 but before the other I think that yes 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:55.199
 could skin black role plays 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.440
 and you have to be very animal in the game the 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:03.680
 players apart it 's very difficult 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.680
 but still I 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.000
 I brought a lot of pinches culero and I did not 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.800
 tan culero game 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.670
 pinche monterrey face of bread and then 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.670
 away 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.669
 let's see take out 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.230
 we go and we go to the people and they throw it 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.410
 jan throw shot 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.460
 let's see christian bermúdez I think 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.780
 that the teams are somewhat 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.900
 outdated because out there I 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.060
 I found a benitez pooch 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.979
 but other than that everything is fine in 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.600
 serious the game becomes very 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.169
 entertaining has a history has 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.060
 for here, I shot the goal of Jesus 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.860
 zavala I do not know who bergesse is jesús 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.860
 zavala but is not a great golazo 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.110
 and there are more who like this type 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.770
 of soccer games I know that it's going to 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.870
 love it will not be a fifa but it has this 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.169
 very lively is very good has good 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.909
 graphics itself does not weigh much and I do not know what 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.430
 more you can order does not weigh more than 100 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:06.490
 megabytes that pulls it strip pulls shit 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.060
 with step start gender law law web 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.180
 because they have hair 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.710
 blond and the blonde missed her throws hit her 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.710
 but the takeoff the outside 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.960
 with this good bastard as this one and another 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.140
 another other good asshole shoots with goal another 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.300
 Once, sergio pérez, we're not going, let's go 330 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.040
 we are going back to the monarchs to the mountain 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.420
 to the monarch over the monterrey to what 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.890
 it's supposed to be the monterrey 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.890
 comes this wey did not take it off 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.090

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.370
 I do not even notice it there is indeed 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.510
 some that can not be removed 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.510
 work shit 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:06.700

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.200

 so they go unlocking they're going 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.630

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:29.190
 and good in this case here where I say 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.410

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.090
 here where it says team edition is 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.770
 where they can edit all the equipment or 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.690
 whether you want, you can change 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.080
 any in here to say here 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.080

 is in the Spanish league in this the 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.630
 Barcelona

 mother's aviation and they can change you 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.910
 as much as the uniform as the 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:54.419
 stripes like everything not until then the 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:56.130

 nothing of everything depends on you until your

 you want to put your name there 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.940
 because it put in place to 

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:04.860
 ronaldo in the ronaldinho depends on 

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.240
