00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.974
- Well, my name's Naimah...

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.675
- And I'm Rondelynn.
- Her name's Ronde.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.611
So we decided to call
our business Niro.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.347
- We actually met
in high school.

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:16.315
I was a transfer student
from another area.

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.284
She was new--
moved from Philadelphia.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.921 line:0%
So we both entered a school
system where we knew no one,

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.890 line:0%
but we had a similar style.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.391 line:0%
We both stood out, and--

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:26.992 line:0%
- We had on the same boots,
actually.

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:30.696
- Yeah, it was a pair of boots,
and we became friends that way.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:34.934
We kind of clicked,
and we never un-clicked...

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.736
But during school--and we were
going through some times--

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:40.572
we both were teenage par--
teenage moms--

00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:43.276
and our parents were going
through some difficulties,

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:45.678
and we kind of leaned
on each other for support

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.514
to get through those--
those times.

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.250
But then we started our fashion.
We started making our clothes.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.251
We would make clothes
for ourselves first,

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.253
you know, and that's truthfully
how it happened.

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:55.755
We would make things
for ourselves.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.291
We would wear them, the students
would, like, like them,

00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:01.293
and we created them over
and over again for our peers.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.395
Which, money came in,
and we kind of--

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.930
- We said...
- One night--yeah.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.133
A lightbulb clicked, like--
- This is a business.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.635
- Yeah.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:11.170
If we fast forward, we ended up
going to school together

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.339
in New York, to F.I.T.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.840
We came back to Connecticut,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.410
and we ended up working
in a social service arena,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.811
working with kids.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.682
So in that--
it was an employment program,

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.351
but we actually built
the first fashion program

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.220
within that employment program.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.921
But we kind of reached
a glass ceiling because

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.157
it was more programmatic,
and we wanted to take it--

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.758
again, we wanted to create
an entrepreneur.

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.594
We want to show you
how to make money.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.563
We don't just want to show you
how to make something

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.964
and then hang it up on the wall.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:39.565
And Ni and I would talk, like,

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.567
"This is crazy. They're not
gonna make any money."

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.903
- We said we needed
a tangible place

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.239
where they could apply these
skills that they're learning.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.942
And we love fashion,
you know,

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:51.844
and this was always our dream,
to have a boutique and a store,

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:56.048
and so we said, "All right,
it's gonna be Niro boutique."

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:58.751
And here, everything that
we're teaching them upstairs

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.952
or in the back room,

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:02.822
they can come out on the floor
and apply it.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.459
- So instead of just teaching
you what it is to inventory,

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.162
or teaching you from a book
what it takes to dress a window,

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:11.597
you're doing it.

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:13.766
So you're actually applying
those skills

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.935
as we're telling you what to do,
so it's different.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.937
And a lot of kids
learn that way, by doing.

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.840
- And our mission is Niro will--
- Yes, here--

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.075
both: "Excite,
encourage, educate,

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:24.677
and empower through fashion."

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.846
- And we kind of excite them
with the fashion.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.381
We get 'em interested with
the fashion.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.383
- We encourage them
that they can do it,

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.051
and then their brains
are opened.

00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.655
So then that's when we throw
the education in,

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.524
and then the empowerment in,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.059
and with education
comes empowerment.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.427
- Our work is fun.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.129
You know, we're doing
what we love.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.331
We love fashion.
We love youth.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.999
We tried to create
an environment

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.501
that we would want to stay in,

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.002
that people
would want to stay in,

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:52.204
and I think we've--
we got lucky; we did it.

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:55.375
So it's kind of cool.
