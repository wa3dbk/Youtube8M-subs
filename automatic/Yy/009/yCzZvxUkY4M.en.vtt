hard to find anything to complain about
I<00:01:39.600> guess<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.810> one<00:01:41.140> thing<00:01:41.410> that<00:01:41.590> defines<00:01:42.100> into

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
I guess the one thing that defines into

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.430 
I guess the one thing that defines into
the<00:01:42.760> Nexus<00:01:43.180> more<00:01:43.480> than<00:01:43.630> anything<00:01:43.900> else<00:01:44.110> is

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
the Nexus more than anything else is

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.590 
the Nexus more than anything else is
that<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.100> gameplay<00:01:45.400> is<00:01:45.670> constantly<00:01:46.420> evolving

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
that the gameplay is constantly evolving

run and frankly I mean like who decided
what<00:02:26.269> was<00:02:26.720> too<00:02:26.989> short<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.500> video<00:02:27.709> game<00:02:27.799> I

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
what was too short for a video game I

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.830 
what was too short for a video game I
think<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.579> perfect<00:02:28.849> length<00:02:29.209> think

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
think this is a perfect length think

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.420 
think this is a perfect length think
about<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.200> maybe<00:02:30.379> have<00:02:30.530> studies<00:02:31.190> show<00:02:31.400> that

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
about it maybe have studies show that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.610 
about it maybe have studies show that
like<00:02:31.700> 90%<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.810> people<00:02:33.140> never<00:02:33.349> actually

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
like 90% of people never actually

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.470 
like 90% of people never actually
finished<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.370> games<00:02:34.549> they're<00:02:34.760> playing<00:02:35.000> so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
finished the games they're playing so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.869 
finished the games they're playing so
maybe<00:02:35.690> six<00:02:36.110> hours<00:02:36.290> isn't<00:02:36.860> too<00:02:37.010> short<00:02:37.340> maybe

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
maybe six hours isn't too short maybe

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.119 
maybe six hours isn't too short maybe
twenty<00:02:38.360> six<00:02:38.629> hours<00:02:38.989> is<00:02:39.200> too<00:02:39.470> freaking<00:02:39.950> long

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
twenty six hours is too freaking long

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.849 
twenty six hours is too freaking long
anyway<00:02:41.060> what<00:02:41.239> matters<00:02:41.599> is<00:02:41.810> however<00:02:42.440> long<00:02:42.739> you

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
anyway what matters is however long you

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:52.580 
anyway what matters is however long you
play<00:02:43.069> it<00:02:43.220> it's<00:02:43.640> fun<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.209> entire<00:02:44.629> time

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.930 

look<00:02:53.590> as<00:02:53.800> much<00:02:53.860> as<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.340> hate<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.610> character

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
look as much as I hate the character

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.600 
look as much as I hate the character
design<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:56.200> levels<00:02:56.590> really<00:02:56.830> surprised<00:02:57.340> me

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
design the levels really surprised me

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.530 
design the levels really surprised me
but<00:02:57.879> there<00:02:58.030> are<00:02:58.060> some<00:02:58.239> pretty<00:02:58.450> cool

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
but there are some pretty cool

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.990 
but there are some pretty cool
environments<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.379> this<00:02:59.500> game<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.000> unexpected

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000

from<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> ceiling<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.769> game<00:03:11.920> always

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
from the ceiling but the game always

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.370 
from the ceiling but the game always
takes<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.730> somewhere<00:03:12.970> cool<00:03:13.330> even<00:03:13.989> if<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.319> a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
there's a real addictiveness to a game

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.270 
there's a real addictiveness to a game
like<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.360> it's<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.319> perfect<00:03:20.620> storm<00:03:20.950> of

these habit-forming game elements you
know<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.620> mean<00:03:23.860> they're<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.519> things

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
bolts which of course you can use to buy

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.479 
bolts which of course you can use to buy
more<00:03:30.940> gadgets<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.720> upgrading<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.040> easy

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
more gadgets and upgrading it's so easy

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.880 
more gadgets and upgrading it's so easy
and<00:03:33.880> relatively<00:03:34.630> fast<00:03:35.019> but<00:03:35.560> you're<00:03:35.680> just

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
and relatively fast but you're just

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.039 
and relatively fast but you're just
compelled<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.579> keep<00:03:36.760> going<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.299> really<00:03:37.930> is

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
so it's not to like well there's

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.670 
so it's not to like well there's
definitely<00:03:45.830> some<00:03:46.250> cool<00:03:46.460> platforming<00:03:47.150> but<00:03:47.180> I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
of those flat levels and more perilous

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.610 
of those flat levels and more perilous
jumps<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.210> stuff<00:03:53.480> like<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.870> I<00:03:54.080> mean<00:03:54.380> you've

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.990 
platforming and then again I mean look
I'm<00:04:03.080> probably<00:04:03.380> nitpicking<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:04.280> criticizing

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
I'm probably nitpicking like criticizing
