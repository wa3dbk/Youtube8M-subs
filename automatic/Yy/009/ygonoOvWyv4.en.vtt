taskmaster
and<00:00:56.400> over<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.880> years<00:00:57.240> I've<00:00:57.540> realized<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
and over the years I've realized that

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.560 
and over the years I've realized that
whenever<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.280> two<00:00:59.340> numbers<00:01:00.060> come<00:01:00.360> together

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
whenever these two numbers come together

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.770 
whenever these two numbers come together
either<00:01:01.560> in<00:01:01.800> an<00:01:01.950> on<00:01:02.190> your<00:01:02.400> name<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:03.060> your<00:01:03.510> date

they<00:01:09.030> attract<00:01:09.950> more<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.390> Saturn<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.479> Uranus

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
they attract more of Saturn and Uranus

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
they attract more of Saturn and Uranus
that<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.259> more<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:14.100> force<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.579> AIDS<00:01:14.759> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
that is more of more force and AIDS and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.719 
that is more of more force and AIDS and
what<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.110> does<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> creates<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.399> very

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
what that does is it creates a very

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.209 
what that does is it creates a very
challenging<00:01:18.060> situation<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.219> stepping

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
challenging situation it's like stepping

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.029 
challenging situation it's like stepping
into<00:01:20.310> quicksand<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.359> then<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.499> very<00:01:22.770> hard

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
into quicksand and then it is very hard

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.919 
into quicksand and then it is very hard
to<00:01:23.249> extricate<00:01:23.969> one<00:01:24.240> out<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
to extricate one out of it

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.910 
to extricate one out of it
so<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.340> relate<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.210> information<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.109> the

the five five ten hundred three so
that's<00:02:57.570> another<00:02:57.900> four<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.520> that<00:03:00.030> energy

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
that's another four and and that energy

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.330 
that's another four and and that energy
was<00:03:00.630> also<00:03:00.750> attracted<00:03:01.140> by<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> name<00:03:01.830> Solyndra

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
was also attracted by the name Solyndra

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.220 
was also attracted by the name Solyndra
that<00:03:02.490> has<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.910> lot<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.209> sat<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.750> energy<00:03:04.140> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that has a lot of sat and energy a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.780 
that has a lot of sat and energy a
number<00:03:04.500> eight<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:04.740> four<00:03:05.070> is<00:03:05.220> pulling<00:03:05.610> more

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
number eight so four is pulling more

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.040 
number eight so four is pulling more
aids<00:03:06.830> so<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.220> was<00:03:08.310> another<00:03:08.520> one<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.910> then<00:03:09.630> if

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
aids so that was another one and then if
