00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.090
 Hello, people , welcome, one more. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.900
 pearl program episode 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.849
 gospel in the previous episode we 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.539
 We commented on an expression 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.770
 quite curious in the gospels kingdom of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.160
 God is giving continuity to the theme 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.280
 We'll talk about another expression. 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.670
 also linked to the kingdom of God or Kingdom of 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600
 because the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.710
 God 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.400
 are synonymous expressions god was seen 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 as purely spiritual and his 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.180
 government with a purely 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.440
 spiritual 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.049
 hence the reference to the kingdom of heaven one 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 kingdom that was not of the land that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.310
 has the material elements and this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.450
 kingdom owns your game 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 play the kingdom of God or judge 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.190
 kingdom of heaven 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:25.049
 was also a widely used term 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:28.500
 at the time what means game we have to 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.549
 remember that it was a people of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.270
 farmers who cared for animals and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.640
 it was very common to plow the land 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.930
 placed a pair on two oxen 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 a kind of wood holding neck 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 so that these animals did not stray 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:56.130
 the moment they pulled the plow 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:59.970
 this wooden apparatus that led and 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.710
 kept the animals locked alvarado era 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:09.030
 called a game and this expression becomes 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.979
 also metaphorically referred to juice 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.159
 of the kingdom of heaven 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.330
 what does this mean nothing more? 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:22.070
 nothing less than the requirements 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.100
 What does God do to his children through 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.930
 his immutable divine law 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:34.280
 we also want to have access to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.150
 this divine providence to this kingdom of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.640
 God 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.720
 we have to comply with certain 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.400
 behavior requirements 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.340
 behavior towards god and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.910
 behavior towards the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.220
 the set of these behaviors 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.810
 were known at the time as 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.560
 I judge of the kingdom of heaven, or the yoke of the kingdom. 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.890
 of God and then an expression that 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.620
 very well known that it is that 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:15.260
 When Jesus says my yoke is soft, my 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:19.880
 fate and bring about a revelation of the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:24.820
 divine law a new aspect of the law of 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.560
 God, Jesus says that your game is soft 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.650
 that makes it clear that there is 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.340
 but also makes 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.840
 stress that it is gentle because it 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:44.150
 Requirements of love is love is always 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:49.690
 soft is always mild and always fills the 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.690
 heart of delights of joy
