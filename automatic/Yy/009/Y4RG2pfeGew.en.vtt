00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
so ping pong no anyway I've come up with

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.819 
so ping pong no anyway I've come up with
a<00:00:39.360> great<00:00:39.719> way<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.899> remember<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.440> atomic

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
a great way to remember the atomic

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.170 
a great way to remember the atomic
weight<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> elements<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
weight of the elements see what I do it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.360 
weight of the elements see what I do it
yeah<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.510> where<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.329> damn<00:00:48.329> stairs<00:00:49.370> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
yeah what where are you damn stairs you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.350 
yeah what where are you damn stairs you

feel<00:01:05.549> pretty<00:01:05.760> well<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.299> chemistry<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.840> know

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
feel pretty well in chemistry you know

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.480 
feel pretty well in chemistry you know
but<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.530> my<00:01:07.799> strongest<00:01:08.280> subject

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
but it's not like my strongest subject

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.190 
but it's not like my strongest subject
and<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.299> test<00:01:09.540> tomorrow<00:01:09.720> comes<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.170> a
