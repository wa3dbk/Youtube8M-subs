we're here at Avanti plus white a curry

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.250 
we're here at Avanti plus white a curry
to<00:00:18.820> discuss<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:19.300> difference<00:00:19.660> between<00:00:19.750> a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
to discuss the difference between a

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.519 
to discuss the difference between a
streak<00:00:20.680> BMX<00:00:21.100> bike<00:00:21.340> and<00:00:21.580> a<00:00:22.390> race<00:00:22.570> BMX<00:00:22.810> bike<00:00:23.260> if

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
streak BMX bike and a race BMX bike if

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.160 
streak BMX bike and a race BMX bike if
you're<00:00:24.520> new<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.000> sport<00:00:25.119> of<00:00:25.330> BMX<00:00:25.509> racing

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
you're new to the sport of BMX racing

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.710 
you're new to the sport of BMX racing
the<00:00:26.710> differences<00:00:27.250> may<00:00:27.520> not<00:00:27.820> appear<00:00:28.210> obvious

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
the differences may not appear obvious

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.109 
the differences may not appear obvious
to<00:00:28.900> you<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.860> aim<00:00:29.980> of<00:00:30.009> this<00:00:30.310> video<00:00:30.520> is<00:00:30.730> to

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
to you so the aim of this video is to

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.090 
to you so the aim of this video is to
cover<00:00:31.330> the<00:00:31.509> basic<00:00:31.989> differences<00:00:32.470> between<00:00:32.529> the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
cover the basic differences between the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.100 
cover the basic differences between the
two<00:00:33.250> bikes<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:34.329> help<00:00:34.540> you<00:00:34.720> make<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.079> best

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
two bikes to help you make the best

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.110 
two bikes to help you make the best
decision<00:00:35.800> when<00:00:36.040> it<00:00:36.160> comes<00:00:36.340> to<00:00:36.550> buying<00:00:36.700> a<00:00:36.940> bike

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
decision when it comes to buying a bike

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.319 
decision when it comes to buying a bike
so<00:00:37.809> let's<00:00:37.989> get<00:00:38.110> into<00:00:38.320> it<00:00:38.970> one<00:00:39.970> of<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.180> key

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
so let's get into it one of the key

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.959 
so let's get into it one of the key

indeed now the key difference in the
weight<00:01:08.110> comes<00:01:08.590> down<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.400> materials<00:01:10.300> used

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
much an afterthought and they're often

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.990 
much an afterthought and they're often
just<00:01:51.940> very<00:01:52.270> bare<00:01:52.600> plastic<00:01:53.350> platforms<00:01:54.000> not

BMX is the placement of the rear brakes

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.810 
BMX is the placement of the rear brakes
you'll<00:02:05.440> note<00:02:05.620> that<00:02:05.650> these<00:02:05.980> rear<00:02:06.340> brakes<00:02:06.580> are

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
you'll note that these rear brakes are

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.339 
you'll note that these rear brakes are
placed<00:02:07.090> within<00:02:07.450> what<00:02:07.660> we<00:02:07.690> call<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.080> rear

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.979 
light as possible the cranks here are
also<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> lightweight<00:03:58.750> aluminium

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
also a lightweight aluminium

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.920 
also a lightweight aluminium
construction<00:03:59.949> and<00:04:00.150> there's<00:04:01.150> no<00:04:01.299> front<00:04:01.660> brake

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
construction and there's no front brake

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.319 
construction and there's no front brake
so<00:04:02.650> there's<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.919> few<00:04:03.190> key<00:04:03.489> things<00:04:03.519> visually

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
so there's a few key things visually

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.539 
so there's a few key things visually
that<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.750> can<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:05.019> very<00:04:05.049> quickly<00:04:05.549> that

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
that you can see very quickly that

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.670 
that you can see very quickly that

differentiate this bike from a street

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.740 
differentiate this bike from a street

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
BMX well there you have it hopefully
