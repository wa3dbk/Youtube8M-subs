00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 premiere where we know about ourselves alongside 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.769
 the conductor supports a temple 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.180
 indicates 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.470
 when the last note has sounded 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.580
 the audience turns out to be crazy 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.320
 enthusiasm 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.670
 but better not notice it because there 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 with his back to the audience 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.949
 the soloist must turn it over 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.540
 5 standing ovations follow and around beethoven 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.320

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:58.259
 this link 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.259
 this measure to one must be done with the symphony 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.130
 who see that the impact is the symphony 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.810
 actually i'm still shocking to date 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.780

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.340
 picos this is not just a great symphony 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.860
 this is not just a great work of art 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.140
 something something a moral testament 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.610
 something there statement or principles 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:33.630
 reviewing and it was a well-known secret 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.630
 that which to freude to join 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.390

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.600
 was becomes was moment was also then 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.600
 pretty hard cases grows 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.520
 well this was a special issue for that 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.110
 beethoven to be coral gets as i get 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.360
 into that was necessary 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.400
 the story 1012 bye bye pots friendly 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.680

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.740
 necessary to do in large bis 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.050
 grinder funfair whatever the director interest 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.490
 that which my coach dragons from sailing into 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.570
 that means 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:22.470
 van veer or terror with which is ideal 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.470
 read the sloan or you need the shutter 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.819
 so this oil shuttle is there blown 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:33.090
 away by this fun fair or taylor 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:37.319
 which then the scarf in the most we span 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.580
 with the music that leather will be some with 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.700
 the base 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.700
 we put the word french note in the stable 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:52.099
 misha find more happy tunes the deal 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.099
 direction of the professor 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.580
 I started with the still existing one 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.590
 folk music 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.700
 school program but you are the recorder 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.329
 you learn to play 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.360
 and that became a concept there and 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:28.760
 through the guitar and guitar ensemble and me 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.760
 when was up 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:41.260
 here is strong so we get the chance 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.639
 to do something we put into our work 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.500
 as a double bass player of course more often 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.490
 must do 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.540
 there is a huge excitement and and threatens 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.820
 derail 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.820
 and then the double bass comes in 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.690
 again that chaos you are still still 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.690
 not resting 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.879
 what not finished now we can the 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.019
 and you who introduce where it is in it 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.019
 very visually 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.600
 now have a very striking role 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.170
 often the role is more on the 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.670
 background 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:08.840
 but i think it is throughout the orchestra 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:12.500
 sounded good playing bass group gives 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:16.100
 cement from the sound fills all gaps 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.960
 that you would otherwise have and give 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.810
 strong and therefore is better now about such 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.670
 fantastic gives very strong the 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.670
 the rhythmic power of it 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.960
 we produce yes it is not one 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.620
 instrument which of itself is a huge 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.820
 has volume but that to powerful that 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.280
 energetic 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.420
 that is what we are looking for what we are 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.420
 like to make 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.570
 and 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.009
 it is the ball brother well it is about 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.030
 love it is about god and relationship 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.620
 people 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:23.719
 it's about all the strings that every 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.710
 region and and leave you and i change nut 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:29.860
 oil change 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.860
 the course or music history 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.090
 that is to come and i think it 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:37.729
 literally changer people every single 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:41.680
 time but they go to performance series 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:41.680
 This can never never be Sam 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.389
 we wish you a special evening with the 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.589

 beethoven through the dutch 

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:58.339
 philharmonic orchestra with cooperation 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:00.529
