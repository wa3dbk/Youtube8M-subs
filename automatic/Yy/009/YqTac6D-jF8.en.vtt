00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:09.000
 Good day, hello everyone 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.599
 welcome today i would like to take off 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.400
 video tell again one more time because 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.590
 that I shot a video about the baofeng walkie talkie and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.519
 The program has a lot of questions on this 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.560
 and so I decided to make a video and in this 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 video answer many questions and so 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:38.670
 means as for the radio station station or rather 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:43.170
 baofeng uv-5r to the radio is very popular 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.980
 very demanded portable points 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.629
 Overall very crediting and catches all that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.780
 could be and cleanliness in the range variation 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.000
 Frequency all to get caught in two 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 all you need is just to know those frequencies 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.329
 who do you want to catch and she 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.020
 calmly catch all that you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.500
 From her want so now the program has sat down 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.710
 and repeater means what i wanted 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.150
 say here I was filming the past video 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.009
 so the repeater is big 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.290
 tower on which there is a transmitter 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.299
 which transmits a signal that is she 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 amplifies and transmits the signal further 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:33.180
 understandable repeaters peter repo here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 it means being far away where there is no straight 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.040
 communication between walkie-talkies can be used 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.270
 repeater yes the so-called turnip here 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.590
 Now for the program is still exceedingly 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.229
 once I say all whether Peter should 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.840
 keep the program green not all 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.939
 repeaters support this program then 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.850
 there is if you want to communicate 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.399
 via repeater through zello program 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.850
 through your phone you should find out 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.979
 does the program support green 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.060
 which using repite he supports 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.560
 I will also tell you that the repeater is 28 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.440
 kilometers away and free little catches 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.610
 the signal is transmitted in the evening let's say conditionally 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.030
 saying there is formed a group 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.730
 like minded hams who 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.150
 communicate and in general everything is fine itself 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.610
 feel again well need to you 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.140
 let in turnips ask permission 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.870
 repo host 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.480
 have your callsign here and so on here 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.870
 Now I want to demonstrate how I am 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.359
 I can from the phone to communicate with the radio 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 on the contrary, here's to show that all this 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:03:00.700
 it works but I think nobody we are right now 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:07.390
 interfere and so time two three 4 5 check 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:10.569
 check once two three 4 5 you can see yes what 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.269
 hear the signal pass again 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.810
 I speak 28 kilometers that is, I am with 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.209
 Internet can with the phone is 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.980
 other city to hear all of its from 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.859
 home contact and with all 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.000
 correspondents very convenient function 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.299
 here so in general well yes let's 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.440
 try the opposite 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:38.639
 from radio to phone two three 4 5 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.639
 communication check and 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.849
 see yes that everything works everything 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.099
 binds the signal just in the past 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.120
 video I have a little vanilla signal was 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:56.590
 bad so i'm showing that everything 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.040
 works quite credibly claims to 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.799
 it doesnâ€™t mean guys if any 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.129
 I will answer questions with pleasure 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:08.440
 ask if you liked the video finger 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.420
 up if not sorry i tried 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.239
 subscribe to the channel I think further 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.239
 it will be interesting to all thanks bye
