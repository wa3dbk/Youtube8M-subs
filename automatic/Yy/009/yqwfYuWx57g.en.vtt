in<00:00:13.180> this<00:00:14.180> lesson<00:00:14.420> we're<00:00:14.660> going<00:00:14.690> to<00:00:14.809> learn<00:00:14.900> how

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
in this lesson we're going to learn how

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.980 
in this lesson we're going to learn how
to<00:00:15.200> play<00:00:15.380> an<00:00:15.590> open<00:00:15.980> e<00:00:16.160> minor<00:00:16.550> chord<00:00:16.910> as<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:17.930> can

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
to play an open e minor chord as you can

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.510 
to play an open e minor chord as you can
see<00:00:18.200> in<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.349> call<00:00:18.529> block<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.980> E<00:00:19.010> minor<00:00:19.400> chord

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
see in the call block the E minor chord

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.660 
see in the call block the E minor chord
utilizes<00:00:20.360> six<00:00:20.630> strings<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.920> there<00:00:22.250> are<00:00:22.279> two

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
utilizes six strings so there are two

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.999 
utilizes six strings so there are two
fretted<00:00:23.509> strings<00:00:23.869> which<00:00:24.110> are<00:00:24.230> on<00:00:24.380> the<00:00:24.529> 5th<00:00:24.770> and

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
fretted strings which are on the 5th and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.830 
fretted strings which are on the 5th and
4th<00:00:25.310> strings

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
4th strings

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.420 
4th strings
and<00:00:27.920> for<00:00:28.920> open<00:00:29.460> strings<00:00:29.900> open<00:00:30.900> 6<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.160> open

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and for open strings open 6 and the open

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.040 
and for open strings open 6 and the open
one<00:00:32.669> two<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.300> three

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
one two and three

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.270 
one two and three
now<00:00:36.050> what<00:00:36.200> going<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.410> do<00:00:36.560> is<00:00:36.650> just<00:00:36.800> break<00:00:37.130> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
now what going to do is just break the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.950 
now what going to do is just break the
cord<00:00:37.490> down<00:00:37.640> a<00:00:37.700> little<00:00:37.940> just<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.270> show<00:00:38.510> that<00:00:38.540> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
cord down a little just to show that the

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.690 
cord down a little just to show that the
easiest<00:00:39.140> way<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.770> quickest<00:00:40.070> way<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:40.280> get<00:00:40.490> this

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
easiest way and quickest way to get this

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.630 
easiest way and quickest way to get this
cord<00:00:41.570> sounding<00:00:42.020> good<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.920> second<00:00:43.370> finger

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
cord sounding good the second finger

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.980 
cord sounding good the second finger
like<00:00:43.850> some<00:00:44.090> of<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.240> other<00:00:44.390> cause<00:00:44.630> were<00:00:44.810> done

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
like some of the other cause were done

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.940 
like some of the other cause were done
previously<00:00:45.820> should<00:00:46.820> actually<00:00:47.150> be<00:00:47.480> closer

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
previously should actually be closer

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.970 
previously should actually be closer
towards<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.040> first<00:00:49.340> fret<00:00:49.700> so<00:00:50.470> don't<00:00:51.470> move

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
towards the first fret so don't move

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.860 
towards the first fret so don't move
higher<00:00:52.340> up<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.670> fretboard<00:00:52.910> move<00:00:53.660> back

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
higher up the fretboard move back

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.530 
higher up the fretboard move back
towards<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> nut<00:00:54.700> to<00:00:55.700> give<00:00:55.880> yourself<00:00:55.970> room<00:00:56.480> to

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
towards the nut to give yourself room to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.560 
towards the nut to give yourself room to
slot<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:56.990> third<00:00:57.350> finger<00:00:57.740> underneath<00:00:58.070> there

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
slot the third finger underneath there

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.260 
slot the third finger underneath there
if<00:00:59.570> you<00:01:00.500> have<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.770> too<00:01:00.980> close<00:01:01.520> to<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.880> second

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
if you have it too close to the second

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.570 
if you have it too close to the second
fret<00:01:02.510> there's<00:01:03.470> no<00:01:03.650> room<00:01:03.890> for<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.100> finger<00:01:04.460> to

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
fret there's no room for that finger to

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.609 
fret there's no room for that finger to
slot<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.000> comfortably<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:06.080> move<00:01:06.260> back<00:01:06.880> and

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.850 

and<00:01:12.619> that's<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:13.070> perfect<00:01:13.550> d<00:01:13.670> minor<00:01:13.910> chord<00:01:14.860> now

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
and that's so perfect d minor chord now

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.500 
and that's so perfect d minor chord now
some<00:01:16.369> people<00:01:16.520> when<00:01:16.850> they<00:01:16.940> first<00:01:17.210> learn<00:01:17.390> the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
some people when they first learn the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.830 
some people when they first learn the
guitar<00:01:17.920> some<00:01:18.920> books<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:19.430> some<00:01:19.840> instructional

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
guitar some books and some instructional

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.109 
guitar some books and some instructional
DVDs<00:01:21.590> might<00:01:21.860> say<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.130> use<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.670> first<00:01:22.880> and

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
DVDs might say to use the first and

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.300 
DVDs might say to use the first and
second<00:01:23.450> fingers<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.020> there's<00:01:24.890> nothing<00:01:25.190> wrong

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
second fingers and there's nothing wrong

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.950 
second fingers and there's nothing wrong
with<00:01:25.369> that

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
with that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.800 
with that
and<00:01:27.380> later<00:01:27.979> on<00:01:28.159> we<00:01:28.280> will<00:01:28.310> play<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.450> minor

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
and later on we will play the minor

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.440 
and later on we will play the minor
chord<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.350> way<00:01:30.560> for<00:01:31.340> more<00:01:31.520> fancy<00:01:31.940> Accords

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
chord this way for more fancy Accords

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.739 
chord this way for more fancy Accords
like<00:01:32.690> ones<00:01:33.409> like

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.730 

but<00:01:36.749> right<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.140> we're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.469> to<00:01:37.530> just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
but right now we're going to just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.859 
but right now we're going to just
concentrate<00:01:38.429> on<00:01:38.880> line<00:01:39.149> it<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> second

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
concentrate on line it with the second

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.200 
concentrate on line it with the second
and<00:01:39.990> third<00:01:40.280> simply<00:01:41.280> because<00:01:41.549> later<00:01:41.819> on<00:01:41.939> we'll

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and third simply because later on we'll

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.690 
and third simply because later on we'll
learn<00:01:42.359> any<00:01:42.600> major<00:01:42.840> chord<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.189> lot

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
learn any major chord and it's a lot

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
learn any major chord and it's a lot
easier<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.149> play<00:01:45.359> this<00:01:45.539> chord<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.020> by<00:01:46.170> adding

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
easier to play this chord just by adding

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.670 
easier to play this chord just by adding
a<00:01:46.619> finger<00:01:47.009> on

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
a finger on

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.350 
a finger on
and<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.010> as<00:01:50.550> you'll<00:01:51.479> notice<00:01:52.520> e-minor<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and so as you'll notice e-minor as is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.830 
and so as you'll notice e-minor as is
open<00:01:54.840> G<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.580> an<00:01:56.670> E<00:01:56.790> major<00:01:57.030> chord<00:01:57.300> actually

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
open G but an E major chord actually

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
open G but an E major chord actually
utilizes<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.590> G<00:01:58.770> sharp<00:01:59.010> note<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.119> push<00:02:00.360> our

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
utilizes the G sharp note so we push our

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.980 
utilizes the G sharp note so we push our
first<00:02:00.869> finger<00:02:01.970> onto<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.300> first<00:02:03.570> fret<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
first finger onto the first fret of the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.779 
first finger onto the first fret of the
3rd<00:02:04.260> string<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.350> lot<00:02:07.500> easier<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:08.220> we

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
3rd string so it's a lot easier if we

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.160 
3rd string so it's a lot easier if we
use<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> second<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.810> third<00:02:09.869> fingers

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
use the second and third fingers

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.070 
use the second and third fingers
initially<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:12.120> gets<00:02:12.270> us<00:02:12.450> used<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.810> playing

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
initially and it gets us used to playing

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.380 
initially and it gets us used to playing
this<00:02:13.290> way<00:02:13.560> also<00:02:14.220> swapping<00:02:14.820> between<00:02:14.940> an<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this way also swapping between an a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.530 
this way also swapping between an a
minor<00:02:15.690> chord<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.910> lot<00:02:18.150> easier<00:02:18.330> because

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
minor chord is a lot easier because

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.970 
minor chord is a lot easier because
we're<00:02:18.959> literally<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.500> dropping<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
we're literally just dropping the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.880 
we're literally just dropping the
fingers<00:02:20.340> down<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.290> point<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.709> time

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
fingers down so at this point in time
