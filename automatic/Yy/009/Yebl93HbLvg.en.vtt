one<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.920> quite<00:00:14.190> different<00:00:14.460> than<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.849> first

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
one is quite different than the first

one is quite different than the first
one<00:00:16.490> if<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.609> look<00:00:17.760> through<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.119> videos<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.720> my

one if you look through my videos on my
channel<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> first<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.220> that

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
channel you can see the first one that

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.550 
channel you can see the first one that
had<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:22.070> motor<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.990> Triangle<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.170> ran<00:00:25.380> on

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
had a motor in the Triangle that ran on

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
had a motor in the Triangle that ran on
the<00:00:25.710> crank<00:00:26.010> back<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> hub

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the crank back to the hub

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.240 
the crank back to the hub
this<00:00:28.199> time<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> went<00:00:28.740> with<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> Bionics<00:00:29.990> setup

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
this time I went with the Bionics setup

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
this time I went with the Bionics setup
and<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.640> far<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.660> happy<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
and so far I'm really happy with it the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
and so far I'm really happy with it the
last<00:00:36.899> one<00:00:37.110> ended<00:00:37.320> up<00:00:37.440> being<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.829> moped<00:00:38.190> with

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
last one ended up being a moped with

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.080 
last one ended up being a moped with
pedals<00:00:39.379> and/or<00:00:40.379> cranks<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.790> more<00:00:42.000> of

derailer<00:01:14.049> there's<00:01:15.049> your<00:01:15.320> suspension<00:01:16.039> I

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.370 

pivoted<00:01:23.329> this<00:01:23.509> one<00:01:23.719> on<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> bottom<00:01:24.140> bracket

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
pivoted this one on the bottom bracket

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.919 
pivoted this one on the bottom bracket
again<00:01:26.619> like<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.799> last<00:01:27.829> one<00:01:28.630> seems<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.750> work

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
again like the last one seems to work

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.639 
again like the last one seems to work
for<00:01:30.140> me

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.459 

and<00:01:33.700> then<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:34.759> went<00:01:34.880> with<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.149> no<00:01:35.299> lean<00:01:35.539> fork

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
and then I went with the no lean fork

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:46.190 
and then I went with the no lean fork
again<00:01:37.989> with<00:01:38.989> new<00:01:39.200> tubes

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:58.110 

and<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:46.950> got<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> surly<00:01:47.549> front<00:01:47.820> hook<00:01:48.030> also

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.060 

but<00:01:58.660> so<00:01:58.810> far<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.170> seems<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.560> perform<00:01:59.920> really

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
but so far it seems to perform really

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.540 
but so far it seems to perform really
well<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.900> we<00:02:02.410> just<00:02:02.620> got<00:02:02.770> three<00:02:03.040> inches<00:02:03.160> of<00:02:03.460> new

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
well and we just got three inches of new

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.250 
well and we just got three inches of new
snow<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.560> was<00:02:05.650> gonna<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.870> out<00:02:08.050> for<00:02:08.170> a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
snow so I was gonna take it out for a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:48.210 
snow so I was gonna take it out for a
little<00:02:08.380> spin

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.809 

you

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:04:05.320 

you

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.640 

well<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.420> battery<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.990> camera<00:04:07.470> died

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
well the battery and the camera died

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.500 
well the battery and the camera died
before<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.040> was<00:04:08.130> quite<00:04:08.430> finished<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.360> got

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
before I was quite finished but you got

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.330 
before I was quite finished but you got
the<00:04:09.660> idea<00:04:09.960> out<00:04:11.510> here<00:04:12.510> was<00:04:12.690> pretty<00:04:12.980> sticky<00:04:13.980> and

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
the idea out here was pretty sticky and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:37.280 
the idea out here was pretty sticky and
deep<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.070> don't<00:04:35.280> think<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:36.780> could<00:04:37.110> get

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
deep so I don't think that I could get

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.410 
deep so I don't think that I could get
through<00:04:37.440> it<00:04:37.560> without<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:38.130> bionics<00:04:38.970> motor<00:04:39.240> on

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
through it without the bionics motor on

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.710 
through it without the bionics motor on
there

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
there

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.510 
there
I'm<00:04:40.530> sure<00:04:40.770> though<00:04:40.920> there's<00:04:41.070> others<00:04:41.340> that

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
I'm sure though there's others that

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.940 
I'm sure though there's others that
could<00:04:43.100> help<00:04:44.100> me<00:04:44.250> out

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.250 

now<00:04:49.950> I<00:04:49.980> gets<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> get<00:04:50.460> torn<00:04:50.760> down<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.260> ready

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
now I gets to get torn down and ready

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.430 
now I gets to get torn down and ready
for<00:04:52.350> paint<00:04:52.530> I<00:04:53.480> just<00:04:54.480> wanted<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.050> make<00:04:55.170> a<00:04:55.230> video

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
for paint I just wanted to make a video

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.780 
for paint I just wanted to make a video
while<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:55.830> had<00:04:56.070> snow<00:04:57.050> before<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.080> tore<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.380> down

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.000 

I'll<00:05:02.790> probably<00:05:03.060> put<00:05:03.330> some<00:05:03.570> cable<00:05:03.900> guides<00:05:04.110> and

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
I'll probably put some cable guides and

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.480 
I'll probably put some cable guides and
clean<00:05:05.310> up<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.640> cable<00:05:06.000> system<00:05:07.190> before<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.220> paint

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
clean up the cable system before I paint

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.530 
clean up the cable system before I paint
it<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:09.030> put<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.980> water<00:05:10.980> bottle<00:05:11.340> cage<00:05:11.370> on<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.880> and

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
it and put a water bottle cage on it and

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.590 
it and put a water bottle cage on it and
then<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.780> should<00:05:12.930> be<00:05:13.020> done<00:05:15.170> that's<00:05:16.170> it<00:05:16.320> for<00:05:16.500> now
