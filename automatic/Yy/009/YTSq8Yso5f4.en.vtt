00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
not like the most intriguingly design

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.130 
not like the most intriguingly design
level<00:00:58.680> I've<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> say<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.609> some<00:01:00.140> small

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
level I've got to say it's some small

level I've got to say it's some small
lighter<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.520> guess<00:01:02.699> but

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
lighter out of all of them I guess but

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.570 
lighter out of all of them I guess but
you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.420> guess<00:01:04.350> 'sir<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.890> hire<00:01:05.100> too<00:01:05.369> many

architects<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.330> killed<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.810> beta

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
architects very killed in like beta

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.859 
architects very killed in like beta
probably<00:01:07.409> does<00:01:07.560> um<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.729> makings<00:01:09.150> house<00:01:09.390> may

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
probably does um when makings house may

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
probably does um when makings house may
jump<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.409> suppose<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.950> official

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
jump I suppose it official

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
jump I suppose it official
this<00:01:11.970> gun<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.270> terrible<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.409> um<00:01:13.560> yeah<00:01:13.710> I'm

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this gun is terrible but um yeah I'm

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.109 
this gun is terrible but um yeah I'm
guessing<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.250> high<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> many<00:01:14.700> architects

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
guessing it in high to many architects

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.370 
guessing it in high to many architects
so<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> pretty

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so what do you get you get a pretty

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.399 
so what do you get you get a pretty
clean<00:01:16.650> job<00:01:16.920> lots<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.460> things<00:01:17.700> um<00:01:18.170> then<00:01:19.170> share

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
clean job lots of things um then share

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.859 
clean job lots of things um then share
this<00:01:19.590> unknown<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.369> level<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.270> difficult

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
this unknown this level it's difficult

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
this unknown this level it's difficult
but<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.590> very<00:01:22.830> first<00:01:23.070> time<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.880> do

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
but for the very first time going to do

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140 
but for the very first time going to do
it<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.330> um<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.320> guess<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> thing<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it like um I guess a thing with all the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.039 
it like um I guess a thing with all the
levels<00:01:27.600> cost<00:01:28.170> level<00:01:28.380> 9<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.400> level<00:01:29.729> 8

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
levels cost level 9 actually level 8

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.569 
levels cost level 9 actually level 8
level<00:01:31.049> 8<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.200> onwards<00:01:31.770> everything<00:01:32.369> level

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
level 8 and onwards everything level

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.100 
level 8 and onwards everything level
from<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.450> you're<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> play

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
the moment especially after cancer

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.980 
the moment especially after cancer
slowness<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> now<00:02:00.240> even<00:02:00.450> cut<00:02:00.630> through<00:02:00.840> there

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
slowness to now even cut through there

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.539 
slowness to now even cut through there
he<00:02:01.110> comes<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> bomb<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> kind

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
he comes to the bomb because that kind

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.090 
he comes to the bomb because that kind
of<00:02:02.610> ice<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.060> bottom<00:02:03.329> sir

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
of ice on the bottom sir

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.039

you<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:04.909> cut<00:02:05.090> through<00:02:05.270> them<00:02:05.420> but<00:02:05.540> destroy<00:02:05.930> the

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
you can cut through them but destroy the

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.919 
you can cut through them but destroy the
bomb<00:02:06.229> first<00:02:06.560> jump<00:02:06.950> over<00:02:07.159> there<00:02:07.479> um<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:08.780> that's

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
bomb first jump over there um so that's

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.300 
bomb first jump over there um so that's
not<00:02:09.140> really<00:02:09.350> necessary<00:02:09.500> because<00:02:10.009> when<00:02:10.190> I'm

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
not really necessary because when I'm

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.920 
not really necessary because when I'm
getting<00:02:10.399> timed<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:11.240> can<00:02:11.360> go<00:02:11.420> back<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:11.720> do<00:02:11.810> the
