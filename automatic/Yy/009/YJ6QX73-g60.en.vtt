classic man versus alien so I'm playing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.950 
classic man versus alien so I'm playing
guard<00:00:15.410> gyro<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.440> playing<00:00:16.920> dudes<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.900> let<00:00:18.900> me

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
guard gyro is playing dudes and let me

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.070 
guard gyro is playing dudes and let me
talk<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> scenario<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:21.210> this

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
talk to you about the scenario so this

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.620 
talk to you about the scenario so this
is<00:00:22.260> an<00:00:22.410> alien<00:00:22.890> planet<00:00:23.070> as<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:24.150> notice<00:00:24.449> it's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is an alien planet as you notice it's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.870 
is an alien planet as you notice it's
packed<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.019> pretty<00:00:25.289> thick<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.010> here's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
packed in pretty thick here and here's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.810 
packed in pretty thick here and here's
why<00:00:27.060> we've<00:00:27.330> each<00:00:27.449> only<00:00:27.779> taken<00:00:28.109> 500<00:00:28.769> points<00:00:28.949> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
why we've each only taken 500 points so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.749 
why we've each only taken 500 points so
this<00:00:30.480> regiment<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.859> very<00:00:32.160> depleted

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
this regiment this very depleted

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.650 
this regiment this very depleted
regiment<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.390> Guardsmen<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:35.239> captured<00:00:36.239> some

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
regiment of Guardsmen has captured some

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
regiment of Guardsmen has captured some
Lichter<00:00:37.050> DNA<00:00:37.500> which<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.010> vital<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
Lichter DNA which is vital for the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030 
Lichter DNA which is vital for the
engineering<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.510> biochemical<00:00:40.350> weapons<00:00:40.739> for

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
engineering of biochemical weapons for

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.779 
engineering of biochemical weapons for
use<00:00:41.219> against<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> alien<00:00:42.629> menace<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.430> at<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
use against the alien menace and at this

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
use against the alien menace and at this
so<00:00:44.969> they've<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.230> drop

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so they've got to get to the to the drop

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
so they've got to get to the to the drop
zone<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.289> too<00:00:49.680> thick<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:51.210> all

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
zone and it is it is too thick with all

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.580 
zone and it is it is too thick with all
the<00:00:52.230> alien<00:00:52.710> foliage<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.579> these<00:00:53.789> spires<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the alien foliage and these spires to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.569 
the alien foliage and these spires to
have<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> transport<00:00:59.100> come<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.430> pick

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
have a to have a transport come and pick

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.689 
have a to have a transport come and pick
them<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.629> called<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.770> from<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> front<00:01:02.430> is

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
them up so called in from the front is

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.750 
them up so called in from the front is
an<00:01:03.539> imperial<00:01:04.049> guard<00:01:04.290> vendetta<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.610> has

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
an imperial guard vendetta which has

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.050 
an imperial guard vendetta which has
been<00:01:05.909> damaged<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.750> its<00:01:07.680> various<00:01:08.130> conflicts<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
been damaged in its various conflicts so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.330 
been damaged in its various conflicts so
it's<00:01:09.360> missing<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.780> set<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.830> twin<00:01:11.100> length

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it's missing one set of twin length

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.020 
it's missing one set of twin length
Lance<00:01:11.640> cannons<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> guardsman

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
Lance cannons and so as the guardsman

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990 
Lance cannons and so as the guardsman
pass<00:01:15.320> through<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.439> fungal<00:01:17.040> cloud<00:01:17.400> produced

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
pass through this fungal cloud produced

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.100 
pass through this fungal cloud produced
by<00:01:18.270> these<00:01:18.950> alien<00:01:19.950> plants<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
by these alien plants they see the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.670 
by these alien plants they see the
hulking<00:01:22.619> forms<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.240> tyranids<00:01:25.939> moving<00:01:28.520> and

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
hulking forms of the tyranids moving and

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.740 
hulking forms of the tyranids moving and
so<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> first<00:01:32.549> contact<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.329> battle<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so with the first contact the battle is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.800 
so with the first contact the battle is
on<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.320> here's<00:01:37.680> how<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.890> works

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
on and this is so here's how it works

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.340 
on and this is so here's how it works
three<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.079> these<00:01:40.229> guys<00:01:40.579> have<00:01:42.350> phosphorescent

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
three of these guys have phosphorescent

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.080 
three of these guys have phosphorescent
markers<00:01:43.799> underneath<00:01:44.340> their<00:01:44.549> bases<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
markers underneath their bases that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
markers underneath their bases that
looks<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.930> as<00:01:48.930> jayro<00:01:49.890> kills<00:01:50.220> my

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
looks like this and so as jayro kills my

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.859 
looks like this and so as jayro kills my
guys<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.290> he<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.470> kill<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> lot<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.869> he

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
guys and he will kill a lot of them he

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
guys and he will kill a lot of them he
gets<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> look<00:01:55.470> under<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> base<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.490> for

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
gets to look under the base and for

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.149 
gets to look under the base and for
every<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.869> those<00:01:57.990> markers<00:01:58.439> he<00:01:58.590> finds<00:01:58.860> he

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
every one of those markers he finds he

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.080 
every one of those markers he finds he
gets<00:01:59.390> three<00:02:00.390> victory<00:02:00.990> points<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.820> 3

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
gets three victory points and i get 3

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.630 
gets three victory points and i get 3
victory<00:02:03.450> points<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.049> live<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
victory points if they live and get to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
victory points if they live and get to
the<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.540> other<00:02:06.659> side<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> board

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the get to the other side of the board

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.999 
the get to the other side of the board
so<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.619> burden<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.979> definitely<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.729> me

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
so the burden is definitely on me

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.780 
so the burden is definitely on me
so<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.789> hive<00:02:10.970> mind<00:02:11.360> has<00:02:11.750> sensed<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.860> has

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
so the hive mind has sensed this and has

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.479 
so the hive mind has sensed this and has
basically<00:02:14.290> mustard<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.650> only<00:02:15.980> troops<00:02:16.280> it

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
basically mustard the only troops it

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.089 
basically mustard the only troops it
could<00:02:16.640> find<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.209> has<00:02:18.140> extended<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.920> hive

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
could find and has extended the hive

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.030 
could find and has extended the hive
mind<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> two<00:02:19.970> mile<00:02:20.209> radius<00:02:20.980> there's<00:02:21.980> a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
mind to a two mile radius there's a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.229 
mind to a two mile radius there's a
dominatrix<00:02:22.819> nearby<00:02:23.329> and<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.610> these<00:02:25.939> guys<00:02:26.180> are

30 yeah so it's pretty scary so nothing
ranged<00:02:54.379> nothing<00:02:55.010> ranged<00:02:55.400> at<00:02:55.519> all<00:02:55.989> the

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
ranged nothing ranged at all the

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.819 
ranged nothing ranged at all the
vendetta<00:02:58.060> has<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.090> special<00:02:59.840> rule<00:03:00.079> called<00:03:00.409> super

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
vendetta has a special rule called super

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.059 
vendetta has a special rule called super
hover<00:03:01.069> which<00:03:02.000> means<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.629> can<00:03:02.900> effectively<00:03:03.889> be

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
hover which means it can effectively be

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.839 
hover which means it can effectively be
flying<00:03:04.639> but<00:03:05.180> not<00:03:05.389> have<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.840> move<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
flying but not have to move and so the

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.740 
flying but not have to move and so the
vendetta<00:03:08.239> is<00:03:08.420> not<00:03:08.659> allowed<00:03:09.019> into<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.650> area

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
vendetta is not allowed into this area

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.869 
vendetta is not allowed into this area
so<00:03:11.750> what's<00:03:12.079> interesting<00:03:12.319> is<00:03:12.889> if<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.310> hold<00:03:13.609> back

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
so what's interesting is if I hold back

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.509 
so what's interesting is if I hold back
and<00:03:14.180> shoot<00:03:15.220> then<00:03:16.329> that<00:03:17.329> means<00:03:17.599> my<00:03:18.410> guy<00:03:19.069> can't

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
and shoot then that means my guy can't

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.930 
and shoot then that means my guy can't
get<00:03:20.180> in<00:03:20.389> there<00:03:20.629> and<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.220> can't<00:03:22.519> actually

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
get in there and so I can't actually

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.970 
get in there and so I can't actually
score<00:03:23.510> any<00:03:23.780> points<00:03:23.870> actually<00:03:24.379> have<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.739> make

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
score any points actually have to make

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.409 
score any points actually have to make
it<00:03:25.129> to<00:03:25.250> this<00:03:25.370> clearing<00:03:25.879> on<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.090> other<00:03:26.209> side

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:26.419 
it to this clearing on the other side

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.659 
it to this clearing on the other side
and<00:03:26.569> we<00:03:26.660> cut<00:03:26.930> off<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.349> other<00:03:27.949> two<00:03:28.340> feet<00:03:28.639> of

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.520 
and we cut off the other two feet of
that<00:03:28.970> board<00:03:29.209> that's<00:03:29.389> just<00:03:29.690> not<00:03:29.840> use<00:03:30.139> only<00:03:30.440> a

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
that board that's just not use only a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.460 
that board that's just not use only a
four<00:03:30.799> foot<00:03:31.010> square<00:03:31.699> board<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:32.720> let's<00:03:33.260> take<00:03:33.410> a

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
four foot square board so let's take a

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.930 
four foot square board so let's take a

could be strategic in this scenario

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.629 
could be strategic in this scenario
because<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.080> narrow<00:05:10.400> access<00:05:11.400> ways

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639
