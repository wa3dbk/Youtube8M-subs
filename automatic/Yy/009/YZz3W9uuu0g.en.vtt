and come down there we go we'll pull his

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.930 
and come down there we go we'll pull his
head<00:02:58.730> up<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.060> was<00:02:59.330> back<00:02:59.540> here<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:01.760> can<00:03:01.850> get

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
head up that was back here we can get

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.360 
head up that was back here we can get
hold<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:04.240> there<00:03:05.240> we<00:03:05.360> go<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.470> rotate<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.190> head

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
hold it there we go and rotate the head

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.830 
hold it there we go and rotate the head
and<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.210> smokestacks<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:09.770> will<00:03:10.390> out<00:03:11.390> here

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
and the smokestacks they will out here

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.880 
and the smokestacks they will out here
I'm<00:03:12.710> truck<00:03:13.160> mode<00:03:13.400> they'll<00:03:13.760> rotate<00:03:14.890> behind

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
I'm truck mode they'll rotate behind

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.150 
I'm truck mode they'll rotate behind
right<00:03:16.370> there<00:03:16.580> have<00:03:17.090> a<00:03:17.120> pulse<00:03:17.800> how's<00:03:18.800> he<00:03:18.950> falls

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
right there have a pulse how's he falls

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.729 
right there have a pulse how's he falls
down<00:03:19.280> you'll<00:03:20.240> have<00:03:20.480> volume<00:03:20.960> and<00:03:21.140> there<00:03:21.650> you

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
down you'll have volume and there you

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.090 
down you'll have volume and there you
have<00:03:21.770> cyberverse<00:03:22.400> crime<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.060> robot<00:03:23.510> mode<00:03:24.100> you

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
have cyberverse crime and robot mode you

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.729 
have cyberverse crime and robot mode you
know<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.640> I<00:03:26.060> actually<00:03:26.900> really<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.530> guy

and<00:03:27.980> I've<00:03:28.070> seen<00:03:28.370> some<00:03:28.430> reviews<00:03:28.940> where<00:03:29.150> folks

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
and I've seen some reviews where folks

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.320 
and I've seen some reviews where folks
are<00:03:29.870> kind<00:03:30.080> of<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.709> him<00:03:30.860> he's<00:03:31.760> not<00:03:31.880> as<00:03:32.060> good

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
are kind of in on him he's not as good

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.670 
are kind of in on him he's not as good
as<00:03:32.570> bulkhead<00:03:33.230> um<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.520> he's<00:03:35.360> not<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:36.020> quite<00:03:36.530> as

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
as bulkhead um and he's not as quite as

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.140 
as bulkhead um and he's not as quite as
good<00:03:36.800> as<00:03:36.920> Megatron<00:03:37.250> really<00:03:37.730> doesn't<00:03:38.060> look

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
good as Megatron really doesn't look

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.030 
good as Megatron really doesn't look
quite<00:03:38.360> as<00:03:38.540> good<00:03:38.810> as<00:03:38.959> Megatron<00:03:39.260> dozen<00:03:39.739> robot

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
quite as good as Megatron dozen robot

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.280 
quite as good as Megatron dozen robot
move<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:41.090> his<00:03:41.239> alt<00:03:41.540> mode<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.870> definitely

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
move but his alt mode is definitely

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.170 
move but his alt mode is definitely
better<00:03:42.410> than<00:03:42.530> Megatron's<00:03:43.070> off<00:03:43.280> boat<00:03:43.520> and<00:03:44.090> if

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
better than Megatron's off boat and if

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.570 
better than Megatron's off boat and if
about<00:03:44.480> modal<00:03:44.810> looks<00:03:44.959> pretty<00:03:45.290> good<00:03:45.470> um<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.550> I

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
about modal looks pretty good um so I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.910 
about modal looks pretty good um so I
really<00:03:46.850> like<00:03:47.000> him<00:03:47.150> he's<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> I'd<00:03:48.680> put<00:03:48.890> him

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
really like him he's a I'd put him

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.979 
really like him he's a I'd put him
probably<00:03:49.310> third<00:03:49.730> out<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.180> commanders

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
probably third out of the commanders

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.900 
probably third out of the commanders
that<00:03:51.050> we've<00:03:51.230> gotten<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.620> far<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:52.459> bulkhead

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
that we've gotten so far the bulkhead

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.810 
that we've gotten so far the bulkhead
being<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.300> best<00:03:53.510> followed<00:03:53.870> by<00:03:53.989> Megatron<00:03:54.820> then

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
being the best followed by Megatron then

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.160 
being the best followed by Megatron then
Prime<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.630> Starscream<00:03:57.590> last<00:03:58.540> um<00:03:59.540> got<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.020> nice

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
looking I'm articulation you guys rotate

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.690 
looking I'm articulation you guys rotate
at<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.100> shoulders<00:04:10.850> back<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:13.130> forth<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.550> the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
at the shoulders back and forth that the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.610 
at the shoulders back and forth that the
arm<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:14.300> actually<00:04:14.720> on<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.870> ball-joint<00:04:15.080> here<00:04:15.560> at

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
arm is actually on a ball-joint here at

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.199 
arm is actually on a ball-joint here at
the<00:04:16.340> elbow<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.330> can<00:04:17.510> go<00:04:17.600> in<00:04:18.260> circles<00:04:18.470> two

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
the elbow so you can go in circles two

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.480 
the elbow so you can go in circles two
turns<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.510> rotates<00:04:20.870> at<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.230> head<00:04:21.440> back<00:04:22.340> and

turns and rotates at the head back and
forth<00:04:22.790> at<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.950> hips<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:26.120> Anthony's<00:04:27.020> um<00:04:27.800> he

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
forth at the hips and Anthony's um he

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.750 
forth at the hips and Anthony's um he
does<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.729> guess<00:04:28.940> have<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.180> little<00:04:29.390> bit

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
does I guess have a little bit

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.680 
does I guess have a little bit
AB<00:04:30.690> upper<00:04:31.560> chest<00:04:32.210> articulation<00:04:33.210> kinda<00:04:33.540> but

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
AB upper chest articulation kinda but

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.420 
AB upper chest articulation kinda but
that's<00:04:33.840> mainly<00:04:33.990> for<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.320> transformation<00:04:35.040> I'm

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
that's mainly for the transformation I'm

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.470 
that's mainly for the transformation I'm
not<00:04:35.550> sure<00:04:35.700> that<00:04:35.730> you<00:04:35.910> could<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.150> a<00:04:36.180> whole<00:04:36.300> lot

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
not sure that you could do a whole lot

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.850 
not sure that you could do a whole lot
with<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:36.840> pose<00:04:37.740> wise<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:39.680> let's<00:04:40.680> not<00:04:40.710> forget
