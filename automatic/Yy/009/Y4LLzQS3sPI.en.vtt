00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone here is for the 21 and we 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.460
 to talk about the news that arrived yesterday from 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.920
 that this sister finally belongs to the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.380
 Marvel's cinematic universe is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.020
 so one thing is clear to expect from 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.449
 Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man is already 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.400
 his reign ended as a spiderman 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.890
 it's a shame since they have drugs and for me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 is the definitive sparkman may not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.900
 be the perfect peter parker but as 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.130
 the superman was incredible so good 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 let's talk about the possible 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.710
 participations that will have the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.680
 sperm in the cinematic universe 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.210
 of marvel because one thing is very clear 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550
 which is that this weapon will not be in the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.270
 america civil war film capture as 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.829
 this is something true measure to bad 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 because the script of that movie is already 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 written and with the participation of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.180
 shots will have to change 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.100
 some things surely the character 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 will be on some camel in some scene 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.109
 post credits and I have a theory that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 very unlikely but it is that it is for 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.000
 man and will be in the post-credit scene 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.680
 the avengers 26 or filter but good is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.950
 only one theory of mine one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.710
 to smoke in the head and I would like to see 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.800
 in cardboard blue america work at the iron is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.600
 for it would be spectacular maybe they expected 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.970
 in that movie is not a character 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.620
 main or essential as in comics 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.930
 but I would like you to have some 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.550
 change something very possible that happens in 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.590
 cardboard america civil works that is for 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.390
 brothers reveal their identity in public 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 as it did in the comics as 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 surely ironman convinces him so that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.070
 do that and then we'll have the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.200
 film apart from the programs and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.390
 consequences that led to that act 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.479
 the individual movie of sperm is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.979
 will launch on July 28 , 2017 and this 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.080
 movie causes the delay of other 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.110
 marvel movies like thor randall or 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.130
 the marvel captain 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.240
 black thunder 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.340
 and what else humans think they are 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 will call this new batman franchise 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.490
 I think it's going to be or spider-man 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.409
 spectacular spiderman or last is for 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.019
 they arm and do not necessarily have to 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.580
 be based on the ultimate you eat 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:11.080
 simply bear the name something else 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.370
 that asks me is in what universe is 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.849
 will base this new franchise of 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.040
 spiderman in the amazing universe or the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.780
 ultimate universe we know that the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 mission franchise for mana marc 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.920
 webb has been released in the latest that in 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.349
 the 100 but taking into account that 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.200
 usually based on the comics of 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.080
 616 universe that is the amazing comics 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.090
 surely this new franchise 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.549
 will be based on comics to missions for 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.709
 keep another thing that worries me is the 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.860
 I brought the costume of the amazing spider-man 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.299
 2 was perfect it was spectacular 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.280
 I wish marvel can keep 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.730
 to this costume or at least be very 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.140
 similar with the big lenses the spider 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.780
 if they want it to be very similar to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.209
 ie comics 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.490
 of the small chest and of the back 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.319
 quite another thing is that the 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.450
 movie to tell you if it's been delayed 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.040
 which is normal since this movie 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.350
 positive results in schools of 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 missions for commands but now that he 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.910
 has the rights of spider man in 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.470
 black blah blah the date of the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.270
 movie has been delayed and now not 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.620
 we know the release date in a 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.560
 beginning was going to be on November 11 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.010
 of 2006 but now we do not know the date 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.980
 and very probably after 2017 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.380
 by 2018 when this movie comes out 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.180
 now I want to give my theories of 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.190
 the possible plots that we will see in the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.320
 new movie of this sister the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.120
 villains the story and the connection with 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.860
 the movie universe of marvel 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.350
 as for movie villains 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.260
 I have two candidates who are believing in the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.450
 hunter and mystery and to some extent I 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.730
 I go more for ministry than for crime 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.110
 leaving my theory about the plot of the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.580
 movie is that people already know who 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.280
 it's his sperm since he revealed his 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.280
 identity in cardboard america civil word and 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.900
 because their enemies their villains because 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.080
 they know who are going to go for the day 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.970
 what are you? 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.770
 On the other hand I imagine Mystery 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.480
 trying to steal a gem from infinity 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.100
 so that this movie has a relationship 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.530
 with the cinematic universe of 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.690
 marvel and spiderman will have to stop it 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.330
 On the other hand we know that this sister 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.300
 will be yes or yes in avengers infinity ward 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.220
 part 1 and part 2 regarding the new 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.290
 actor who can interpret to be more 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.030
 I'm going more for logan lerman than for 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.940
 true of our a good performance in 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.180
 steel hearts and it has everything is a 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.590
 Pretty young actor is 23 years old is 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.100
 in the life of loving seeing to interpret 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.010
 to the character and he already has experience as 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.960
 typical nerdy kings who has no life 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.330
 social with others and so on 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.310
 etcetera this we saw in percy jackson 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.450
 and well this is all for the companion 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.160
 I hope you liked this one 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.100
 video do not forget to deny your like 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.100
 comments and see you later 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.590

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.590
 contagion
