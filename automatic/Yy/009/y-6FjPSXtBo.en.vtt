00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
packets they're loaded with sugar which

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.630 
packets they're loaded with sugar which
means<00:00:15.090> they're<00:00:15.300> heavy<00:00:15.769> if<00:00:16.769> you<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.070> want<00:00:17.580> the

flavor and you can get a skinny little

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.279 
flavor and you can get a skinny little
thing<00:00:20.759> that<00:00:20.970> would<00:00:21.329> treat<00:00:21.509> the<00:00:21.570> exact<00:00:22.019> amount

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
thing that would treat the exact amount

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.489 
thing that would treat the exact amount
of<00:00:23.009> water<00:00:23.339> like<00:00:24.329> this<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.079> that<00:00:25.319> has

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:25.499 
of water like this and that has

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.609 
of water like this and that has
nutrasweet<00:00:26.429> in<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:27.289> pretty<00:00:28.289> big<00:00:28.439> difference

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619

use a tomato sauce but I like using

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.870 
use a tomato sauce but I like using
pesto<00:05:39.110> now<00:05:39.710> i'm<00:05:39.830> going<00:05:39.949> to<00:05:40.009> repackage<00:05:40.370> this<00:05:40.699> as

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
pesto now i'm going to repackage this as

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.779 
pesto now i'm going to repackage this as
well<00:05:41.000> in<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.240> little<00:05:41.389> tiny<00:05:41.570> nalgene<00:05:42.199> container

but<00:05:43.789> pesto<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:44.300> awesome<00:05:44.690> because<00:05:44.810> it<00:05:44.900> packs<00:05:45.139> a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
but pesto is awesome because it packs a

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.520 
but pesto is awesome because it packs a
lot<00:05:45.349> of<00:05:45.650> fat<00:05:45.889> a<00:05:46.190> lot<00:05:46.490> of<00:05:46.639> energy<00:05:46.789> and<00:05:47.300> a<00:05:48.169> little
