00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.090
 disease 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.850
 hey where again my channel which 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.870
 be the wave that reads and my name is 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:18.029
 Alberto and I bring you a tag he made 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.649
 my friend raiza from the ryser channel 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 99 rebels and I did not feel that all tops 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:27.329
 so I decided to make that tag in addition to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.700
 I came out in his video and it was the countess 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.860
 more jozami so this track is called 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.260
 the diseases of the books and it consists 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.320
 in several questions that have to do 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.110
 with diseases but related to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.120
 the books besides closing allow you to go 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.970
 to understand the first question is 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.150
 diabetes a very sweet book seriously very 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.760
 sweet good I really do not read books 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.460
 sweet but after thinking a lot I 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.530
 I think I decided between the eyes of 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.989
 my princess by Carlos Cuauhtémoc 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.060
 Sanchez because I think it is the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.850
 only book that I read that is that as 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.489
 of romance and this book and I read it because 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.009
 they cheated me 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.950
 a teacher was in the second year of 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:15.049
 secondary my son alberto the eyes me 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.030
 they like it a lot and I do not know what then I read it 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.369
 and strapless all and I really liked it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.680
 but action like that the only book that 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.679
 I've read of love then that's why 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.869
 I put in this question the second 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.720
 Question is chicken pox a book you read 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.659
 once and you will never read a book again 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.229
 I read once and I will not read again 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.539
 the phantom of the opera 'and really not 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.659
 I know I did not like the book I do not know if because 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.399
 does not sell or the following ones but it is 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.920
 it did very strange the way it was 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.709
 written well liked I did not like it and suffer 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.659
 a lot to finish it then I think 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.479
 that I would not read this book again 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.399
 to question number 3 says influenza a 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.619
 book that spreads like a virus and 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.959
 well I think that the lord I do not 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.939
 I have I think that a book that is being 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.990
 is doing as a book is from the 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.229
 of 50 shades of gray because I do not know with 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.440
 what is very popular and everyone has it 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.170
 is the book and yes yes round number 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.379

 it kept you up all night good 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.989
 in this case it is skeleton creek by 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.900
 patrick carman and this is because then 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.150

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.549
 I scared a lot and I could not sleep and in fact 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.030
 when I saw that video I said nothing I can not 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.950
 keep reading this book killing I do not know 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.079

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.740
 impression in your mind good in this case 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.800
 would be the book of habano by molière and 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.110

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.110

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.220

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.220

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.610
 princess by carlos cortez monk sanchez 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.340

 number that lacked food for the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.720
 brain and good this is would be the book 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.360
 of beauty salon by mario bellatín and 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.680

 good time and space because in this case 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.570

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.280
 Jules Verne and this is because that is guaje 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.440

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.980
 plan that you already know what they are about 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.890

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.680
