on<00:00:12.400> transferring<00:00:13.120> some<00:00:13.389> some<00:00:13.900> of<00:00:13.990> your<00:00:14.139> files

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
on transferring some some of your files

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.140 
on transferring some some of your files
from<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:15.219> from<00:00:15.900> Xbox<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:17.830> Xbox<00:00:18.280> so<00:00:18.610> let's<00:00:18.940> say

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
from the from Xbox to Xbox so let's say

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.339 
from the from Xbox to Xbox so let's say
you<00:00:19.210> picked<00:00:19.720> up<00:00:19.840> a<00:00:19.960> new<00:00:19.990> Xbox<00:00:21.660> slim<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:22.990> you

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
you picked up a new Xbox slim and you

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.109 
you picked up a new Xbox slim and you
had<00:00:23.859> information<00:00:24.609> that<00:00:24.789> you<00:00:24.880> want<00:00:25.029> to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
had information that you want to

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.150 
had information that you want to
transfer<00:00:25.330> transfer<00:00:26.140> over<00:00:26.439> to<00:00:26.650> your<00:00:26.830> new<00:00:26.980> one

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
transfer transfer over to your new one

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.370 
transfer transfer over to your new one
such<00:00:27.640> as<00:00:27.820> game<00:00:28.060> saves<00:00:28.420> and<00:00:28.840> possibly<00:00:29.289> even

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
such as game saves and possibly even

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.220 
such as game saves and possibly even
game<00:00:30.009> downloads<00:00:30.550> and<00:00:30.789> stuff<00:00:30.970> like<00:00:31.150> that<00:00:31.359> this

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
game downloads and stuff like that this

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.570 
game downloads and stuff like that this
can<00:00:32.470> be<00:00:32.680> done<00:00:32.890> without<00:00:33.520> ordering<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.720> cable<00:00:35.580> I

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
can be done without ordering the cable I

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.060 
can be done without ordering the cable I
guess<00:00:37.360> you<00:00:37.510> would<00:00:37.630> only<00:00:37.810> order<00:00:38.260> that<00:00:38.500> transfer

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
guess you would only order that transfer

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.400 
guess you would only order that transfer
cable<00:00:39.430> is<00:00:39.580> if<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.180> had<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.690> hard<00:00:40.900> drive<00:00:41.140> and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
cable is if you had the hard drive and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
cable is if you had the hard drive and
you<00:00:41.620> had<00:00:41.770> no<00:00:42.040> way<00:00:42.250> of<00:00:42.280> getting<00:00:42.910> another

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
you had no way of getting another

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.680 
you had no way of getting another
another<00:00:46.360> Xbox<00:00:46.990> to<00:00:47.200> connect<00:00:47.500> it<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.650> because

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
another Xbox to connect it to because

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.830 
another Xbox to connect it to because
this<00:00:49.690> method<00:00:49.930> which<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.820> been<00:00:51.820> available<00:00:52.120> on

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
this method which is been available on

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.040 
this method which is been available on
the<00:00:53.290> Xbox<00:00:53.410> since<00:00:54.070> spring<00:00:54.700> of<00:00:54.910> 2010<00:00:55.630> I<00:00:55.690> believe

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
the Xbox since spring of 2010 I believe

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.380 
the Xbox since spring of 2010 I believe
I<00:00:56.290> could<00:00:56.470> be<00:00:56.620> wrong<00:00:56.800> but<00:00:56.860> they<00:00:57.190> just<00:00:57.430> made<00:00:58.270> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
I could be wrong but they just made the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.020 
I could be wrong but they just made the
feature<00:00:58.600> part<00:00:59.470> of<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.950> Xbox<00:01:00.250> where<00:01:00.700> you<00:01:00.790> can

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
feature part of the Xbox where you can

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.770 
feature part of the Xbox where you can
transfer<00:01:01.510> all<00:01:01.660> your<00:01:02.140> files<00:01:02.470> onto<00:01:03.150> USB<00:01:04.150> key<00:01:04.560> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
transfer all your files onto USB key and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.510 
transfer all your files onto USB key and
connect<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:07.929> to<00:01:08.079> your<00:01:08.259> new<00:01:08.469> hard<00:01:08.799> drive<00:01:08.979> new

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
connect it to your new hard drive new

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.630 
connect it to your new hard drive new
Xbox<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.689> just<00:01:11.289> transfer<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.829> files<00:01:12.039> right

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
Xbox and just transfer the files right

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.569 
Xbox and just transfer the files right
over<00:01:13.030> I've<00:01:13.240> tried<00:01:14.109> this<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.469> it<00:01:14.560> works<00:01:14.799> so

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
over I've tried this and it works so

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.789 
over I've tried this and it works so
we're<00:01:16.240> going<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:16.390> get<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.840> camera<00:01:17.259> from

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
we're going to get the camera from

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.730 
we're going to get the camera from
another<00:01:18.159> angle<00:01:18.549> here<00:01:18.840> onto<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.020> onto<00:01:20.530> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
another angle here onto the onto the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.450 
another angle here onto the onto the
monitor<00:01:21.219> to<00:01:22.149> show<00:01:22.329> you<00:01:22.390> how<00:01:22.600> it's<00:01:22.810> done

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
monitor to show you how it's done

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.730 
monitor to show you how it's done
and<00:01:25.210> I<00:01:25.600> think<00:01:25.780> they<00:01:25.870> introduced<00:01:26.320> this<00:01:26.410> because

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
and I think they introduced this because

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.150 
and I think they introduced this because
they<00:01:26.860> got<00:01:27.010> rid<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.880> memory<00:01:28.600> card<00:01:29.320> slots<00:01:29.890> on

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
they got rid of the memory card slots on

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.540 
they got rid of the memory card slots on
the<00:01:30.190> new<00:01:30.400> Xbox<00:01:30.910> so<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:33.040> is<00:01:33.160> something<00:01:33.430> that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
the new Xbox so this is something that

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.080 
the new Xbox so this is something that
the<00:01:33.640> PlayStation<00:01:34.180> 3<00:01:34.420> does<00:01:34.870> already

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the PlayStation 3 does already

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.950 
the PlayStation 3 does already
transferring<00:01:37.090> game<00:01:37.300> saves<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.750> all<00:01:37.840> that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
transferring game saves and all that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.130 
transferring game saves and all that
stuff<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.440> memory<00:01:38.800> keys<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:40.330> let's<00:01:40.870> get<00:01:40.990> on

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
stuff to memory keys so let's get on

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.610 
stuff to memory keys so let's get on
with<00:01:41.170> it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
with it

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.120 
with it
this<00:01:42.100> is<00:01:42.310> transferring<00:01:43.090> your<00:01:43.180> data<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:44.619> one

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
this is transferring your data from one

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.670 
this is transferring your data from one
hard<00:01:45.729> drive<00:01:45.880> one<00:01:46.660> Xbox<00:01:47.050> hard<00:01:47.200> drive<00:01:47.470> to

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
hard drive one Xbox hard drive to

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
hard drive one Xbox hard drive to
another<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:49.000> you'll<00:01:49.300> need<00:01:49.950> both<00:01:50.950> systems<00:01:51.520> to

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
another but you'll need both systems to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.670 
another but you'll need both systems to
do<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:51.970> so<00:01:52.119> let's<00:01:52.150> say<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.630> do<00:01:52.930> have<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.170> hard

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
do this so let's say you do have a hard

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.310 
do this so let's say you do have a hard
drive<00:01:53.920> I<00:01:54.220> mean<00:01:55.000> there's<00:01:55.180> tons<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.479> X<00:01:55.660> boxes<00:01:56.140> out

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
drive I mean there's tons of X boxes out

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.350 
drive I mean there's tons of X boxes out
there<00:01:56.619> I'm<00:01:56.770> sure<00:01:57.009> several<00:01:57.550> of<00:01:57.880> your<00:01:58.000> friends

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
there I'm sure several of your friends

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.730 
there I'm sure several of your friends
have<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:58.899> mean<00:01:59.020> it's<00:01:59.200> just<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.470> matter<00:01:59.649> of

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
have it I mean it's just a matter of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.469 
have it I mean it's just a matter of
going<00:01:59.920> over<00:02:00.280> there

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
going over there

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.600 
going over there
connecting<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.200> key<00:02:02.470> transferring<00:02:03.430> stuff

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
connecting the key transferring stuff

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.560 
connecting the key transferring stuff
you<00:02:03.759> may<00:02:03.880> have<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.060> do<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.210> two<00:02:04.390> three<00:02:04.509> times

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
you may have to do it two three times

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.240 
you may have to do it two three times
depends<00:02:05.140> how<00:02:05.229> much<00:02:05.410> stuff<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.649> have<00:02:05.860> because

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
depends how much stuff you have because

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.630 
depends how much stuff you have because
you're<00:02:06.369> obviously<00:02:06.580> limited<00:02:07.270> by<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.509> size<00:02:07.780> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you're obviously limited by the size of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.850 
you're obviously limited by the size of
memory<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.940> have<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:11.080> think<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.440> Xbox

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
memory you have and I think the Xbox

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.510 
memory you have and I think the Xbox
only<00:02:12.280> recognizes<00:02:12.850> up<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.090> 16<00:02:13.510> gigs<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.520> that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
only recognizes up to 16 gigs so that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.220 
only recognizes up to 16 gigs so that
should<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:15.790> enough<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.450> mean<00:02:16.959> unless<00:02:17.170> it's

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
should be enough I mean unless it's

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.979 
should be enough I mean unless it's
video<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.890> movies<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.340> stuff<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.760> that

we're going to go to system settings
memory<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:39.450> go<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> your<00:02:39.960> USB<00:02:40.290> key<00:02:40.680> and
