Loggins<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:08.300> I've<00:00:09.300> heard<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.599> song<00:00:09.780> before<00:00:09.990> I

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
Loggins and I've heard the song before I

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.080 
Loggins and I've heard the song before I
hadn't<00:00:10.710> played<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.980> before<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.700> think<00:00:12.000> I

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
hadn't played it before but I think I

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.830 
hadn't played it before but I think I
figured<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.480> out

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
figured it out

figured it out
and<00:00:13.340> I<00:00:14.340> always<00:00:14.519> think<00:00:14.849> if<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.839> figure<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and I always think if I can figure it

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.330 
and I always think if I can figure it
out<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.279> too<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.480> I'll<00:00:18.960> send<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.680> where
