not spider-man's gonna appear in those
films<00:01:25.159> but<00:01:25.580> I<00:01:25.640> think<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.940> odds<00:01:26.090> are<00:01:26.300> pretty

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.450 
films but I think the odds are pretty
good<00:01:26.690> okay<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:27.470> thinking<00:01:27.890> ahead<00:01:28.070> what<00:01:28.340> does

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
good okay so thinking ahead what does

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.920 
good okay so thinking ahead what does
this<00:01:28.610> actually<00:01:28.850> mean<00:01:29.240> what<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.630> actually

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
gonna be the one to co-produce the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.270

film's<00:03:29.870> with<00:03:29.989> Kevin<00:03:30.260> Feige<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.590> Marvel<00:03:30.980> they

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
film's with Kevin Feige and Marvel they

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.099 
film's with Kevin Feige and Marvel they
can<00:03:31.459> still<00:03:31.700> weave<00:03:31.940> him<00:03:32.180> into<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.599> universe

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
can still weave him into that universe

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.720 
can still weave him into that universe
so<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.650> eventually<00:03:33.980> he<00:03:34.340> could<00:03:34.459> become

spider-man

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
spider-man

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.330 
spider-man
so<00:03:35.690> his<00:03:35.840> chances<00:03:36.230> are<00:03:36.380> dramatically<00:03:36.920> rising

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
so his chances are dramatically rising

exactly like it was in the comics it'll
be<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> little<00:03:42.049> bit<00:03:42.139> different<00:03:42.590> although<00:03:42.769> they

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
be a little bit different although they

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.650 
be a little bit different although they
do<00:03:43.069> have<00:03:43.250> spider-man<00:03:43.730> now<00:03:43.910> I've<00:03:44.299> already<00:03:44.450> made

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
do have spider-man now I've already made

do have spider-man now I've already made
a<00:03:44.690> whole<00:03:44.900> bunch<00:03:45.079> of<00:03:45.139> videos<00:03:45.410> about<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:45.859> I'll

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
a whole bunch of videos about it so I'll

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.009 
a whole bunch of videos about it so I'll
add<00:03:46.099> some<00:03:46.280> links<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.700> description<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:47.780> I

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
add some links in the description but I

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.960 
add some links in the description but I

think the most recent big development is

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.339 
think the most recent big development is
that<00:03:50.120> Daniel<00:03:50.540> Bruhl<00:03:50.690> was<00:03:50.810> pretty<00:03:51.169> much

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
that Daniel Bruhl was pretty much

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.349 
that Daniel Bruhl was pretty much
confirmed<00:03:51.799> as<00:03:51.919> Baron<00:03:52.160> Zemo<00:03:52.340> when<00:03:53.090> else<00:03:53.209> do<00:03:53.299> we

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
confirmed as Baron Zemo when else do we

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.520 
confirmed as Baron Zemo when else do we
