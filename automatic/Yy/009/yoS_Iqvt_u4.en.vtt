00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
mixed colors to me look a lot more

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.039 
mixed colors to me look a lot more
realistic<00:01:18.790> for<00:01:19.180> some<00:01:19.390> reason<00:01:19.750> even<00:01:19.869> though

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
realistic for some reason even though

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.310 
realistic for some reason even though
we're<00:01:20.439> not<00:01:20.590> really<00:01:20.920> born<00:01:21.310> with<00:01:22.320> highlights

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
we're not really born with highlights

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.270 
we're not really born with highlights
and<00:01:23.590> lowlights<00:01:23.950> like<00:01:24.610> these<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:26.470> maybe<00:01:26.650> some

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
and lowlights like these or maybe some

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.530 
and lowlights like these or maybe some
are<00:01:27.460> but<00:01:27.790> at<00:01:28.060> least<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.509> wasn't<00:01:28.869> um<00:01:30.270> yet<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.420> me

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
are but at least I wasn't um yet to me

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.050 
are but at least I wasn't um yet to me
it<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.750> looks<00:01:32.020> a<00:01:32.500> lot<00:01:32.799> more<00:01:32.860> realistic<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
it just looks a lot more realistic the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.210 
it just looks a lot more realistic the
color<00:01:34.299> that<00:01:34.630> way<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:34.899> that's<00:01:35.470> why<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.740> picked

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
color that way so that's why I picked

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.550 
color that way so that's why I picked
that<00:01:36.520> color<00:01:37.030> what<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.479> want<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.840> say<00:01:37.990> about<00:01:38.229> this
