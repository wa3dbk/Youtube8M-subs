00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.059
 also in this minute and second and you 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.830
 I have the review in a way that in 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.109
 personal opinion is very necessary for 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.740
 any mancherster or that is the tumen 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.480
 and we'll do that by opening the menu with the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.420
 key or according to how they have it 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 configured will open a menu here 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.210
 on your right from your normal inventory 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 where they will have easy access to their 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.290
 to the things they want to have in their 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 inventory for saying I want iron gives me 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.410
 64 fast 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.530
 I want bone gives me 64 fast I want a 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.950
 main cut expose here I already have it 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 that lets you use pictures that are 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.710
 different that we can find in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.110
 the normal creative menu like this 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.840
 lava box that is instead of the bucket 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.160
 the lava table or also the water 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.590
 that's very good and very useful 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.350
 that right now the inventory that I have 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.350
 can i give in sep 1 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.390
 and it's going to save we're going to throw everything 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.450
 this 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:17.180

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.820
 put it out and fly it brings us 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.920
 new all the items that we just finished 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.390
 to pull that helped us a lot for the 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.880
 worlds in which we die in 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.340
 survival that we do not like we have 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.430
 everything else we carry 6 2 and I have it 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.920
 well I want we are in thousand 636 3 also 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.750
 it is not easy to control what 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.140
 is creative 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.360
 let's take off and put us on survivor 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.820
 let's put them in creative instead of 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.540
 be writing about the game mode all 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.550
 that's how fast it also lets us control 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.830
 what is day and night to say 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.290
 here we put it at noon we are going to 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.580
 put it where the sun is entering what 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.460
 let's put it in the middle of the night 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.990
 let's do it by day also gives us 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.390
 easy control of what is the difficulty 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.600
 of the game that instead of putting tips 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.490
 let's get in difficult in peaceful and 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.850
 well here it does not also give you a choice of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.650

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.470
