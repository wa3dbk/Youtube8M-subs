we're sitting sort of like in the bridge
of<00:00:39.560> my<00:00:39.590> nose<00:00:40.540> so<00:00:41.540> it's<00:00:41.780> rather<00:00:41.989> close<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:45.500> my

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
of my nose so it's rather close to to my

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.770 
of my nose so it's rather close to to my
eyes<00:00:45.860> but<00:00:46.430> I<00:00:46.489> mean<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.300> actually<00:00:47.420> like

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
eyes but I mean it's actually like

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.540 
eyes but I mean it's actually like
sexually

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
sexually

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.770 
sexually
less<00:00:50.770> obstructive<00:00:51.770> they<00:00:51.980> know<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:53.420> I<00:00:53.450> had<00:00:53.690> it

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
less obstructive they know so I had it

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.660 
less obstructive they know so I had it
before<00:00:53.899> I<00:00:54.350> guess<00:00:54.559> because<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:54.739> closer<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.370> my

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
before I guess because it's closer to my

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.850 
before I guess because it's closer to my
face<00:00:55.970> or<00:00:56.210> something<00:00:56.390> like<00:00:56.780> over<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:57.739> my

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.710 
face or something like over to the to my
nose<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:58.309> therefore<00:00:58.730> doesn't<00:00:59.420> really

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
nose so therefore doesn't really

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.950 
nose so therefore doesn't really
