the liver is an important organ that

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.300 
the liver is an important organ that
sits<00:00:02.550> just<00:00:03.210> under<00:00:03.570> your<00:00:03.780> ribcage<00:00:04.160> mostly<00:00:05.160> on

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
place in the small intestine fats need

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.870 
place in the small intestine fats need
to<00:02:26.840> be<00:02:26.959> dissolved<00:02:27.350> so<00:02:27.950> they<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.280> be<00:02:28.400> absorbed

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
to be dissolved so they can be absorbed

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.260 
to be dissolved so they can be absorbed
into<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.390> bloodstream<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:30.850> order<00:02:31.850> for<00:02:32.030> bile

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
into the bloodstream in order for bile

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.900 
into the bloodstream in order for bile
to<00:02:32.540> get<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.959> your<00:02:33.140> small<00:02:33.440> intestine<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.640> liver

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
to get to your small intestine the liver

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.090 
to get to your small intestine the liver
cells<00:02:35.300> are<00:02:35.570> connected<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.320> small<00:02:36.620> tubes

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
cells are connected to small tubes

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.699 
cells are connected to small tubes
called<00:02:37.520> ducts<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.900> eventually<00:02:39.260> come

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
called ducts that eventually come

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.479 
called ducts that eventually come
together<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.490> form<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.850> larger<00:02:41.360> passageway

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
together to form a larger passageway

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.590 
together to form a larger passageway
this<00:02:43.489> passage<00:02:44.090> called

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
this passage called

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.320 
this passage called
the<00:02:44.959> bile<00:02:45.350> duct<00:02:45.739> carries<00:02:46.730> bile<00:02:46.970> from<00:02:47.239> the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
the bile duct carries bile from the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.449 
the bile duct carries bile from the
liver<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.110> gall<00:02:48.290> bladder<00:02:48.320> which<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.430> a

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
liver to the gall bladder which is a

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.930 
liver to the gall bladder which is a
holding<00:02:50.000> area<00:02:50.360> for<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.690> bile<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:52.430> bile<00:02:52.700> is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
holding area for the bile the bile is

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940 
holding area for the bile the bile is
then<00:02:53.180> eventually<00:02:53.570> delivered<00:02:54.260> into<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.709> small

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
then eventually delivered into the small

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.020 
then eventually delivered into the small
intestine<00:02:56.620> because<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.860> liver<00:02:58.130> does<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:58.790> many

intestine because the liver does so many
important<00:02:59.690> things<00:02:59.930> for<00:03:00.140> your<00:03:00.290> body
