00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.510
 Game of Ryukyu Golden Kings wanted Saitama Broncos performed on Ototsuki 3 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:31.190
 I rushed to start the New Year with King's victory 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.190
 I would like to show the best play to about 3500 fans 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.140
 Does not tangy 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.110
 Big leaves, etc., such as a lay-up and the path to the silver kuk 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.410
 Broncos also begins abandoning 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.310
 Development of low score in the early stages lacking in vividness 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.310
 Hmm 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.129
 But this changed the voxy mood completely 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.129
 Barn j 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.000
 3 points fall winter decided to go away 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.110
 pane 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.110
 Fool data free throw is firmly explained and 4 votes go 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:23.060
 Bron cost in the center of the foreign players such as on Humphrey and Michael Joiner 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.060
 You will attack and fight back 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:33.160
 King one will outperform the certainty submerged fight back the free throws from the foul 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.160
 Today 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.050
 It is good to boost the team from the defense 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.440
 Yamauchi 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.640
 Or a Gesu has such a Aggregation scene to say what you can 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.400
 8 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 I always keep in mind that it is a front run and such play , I want a game to it 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.880
 Because 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:16.220
 Therefore, the voltage at the hall will reach its peak when the shot is decided 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:23.680
 Final coater is 76% more successful than Broncos with a difference 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.680
 Let the king eat the rate and decorate two consecutive games in a row in the new year 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:36.630
 Even though the first is I told you try to play hard for 40 minutes 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.720
 It was a game that wasn't very cool even if it was a time zone that it was able to work 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.470
 Kedomo we are in a little reflection Fu that I wonder if 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:47.850
 I think it was good to have won 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.770
 The other really from here 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:58.300
 I'm going to be a game so I'm going to be a solid King's Bosket 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.330
 8 match positions through Posuke among yourself no matter what opponent comes up 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.770
 If you win 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.160
 I think that the results will follow naturally, so I want to do it without blurring 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.160
 I'm sorry
