 There is a window of settings you can connect 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.330
 we have an incoming connection port 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.530
 it will be necessary then to write standard 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.970
 port in the meantime we go into the game itself not 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.440
 pay attention that i have 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.899

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:03.750
 there's nothing to explain here 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.380
 standard and very easy after 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.250
 we entered the world turn off the game about 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.390
 it is important that the game be welding after 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 How did you create the server before 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.660
 we fold and enter standard here 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.650
 ope ope speak port standard wan port 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.220
 thorns 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.080
 apply push and atki and all can 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.040
 check 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.810
 open port, or there is a well-known 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.540
 site two and five point ru 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.200
 if you do not know the circuit more accurately for the first time 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.070
 see hear there I will leave 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.770
 link in the description you can at any 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.410
 time to go and check your api 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:57.880
 Oleg January yes yes ip address and port 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:02.230
 check the port check on enter here 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:07.360
 port adventurous from which you wrote on 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:11.000
 knife check and you will have written 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:16.610
 the port is open and mine is closed because 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.600
 i'm damn model model and if u 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.170
 you have wired internet and you have a port 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.100
 is closed 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.730
 it means the provider is to blame 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.750
 before 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.750
 to blame for everything 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.240
 you must call 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.870
 your provider and tell them to 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.260
 opened ports for you and then you have everything 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:50.330
 great will open ports new 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.330
 I mean everything I think this guide ends 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.610
 let's summarize this method will only help 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.950
 owner of the wired internet and to 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.480
 open more accurately making and owning 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.180
 wired internet and hidden ports 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.410
 after this way then call you 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.260
 your provider 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.340
 and carriage on them so they immediately 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.400
 opened ports and all that stuff you can 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:27.180
 Express everything you think about them all 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.890
 I think well to find out the ip address you need it 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.030
 copy and send to a friend 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:36.330
 and each other each other 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.360
 play connect friend should write 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.290
 ip friend address and port as 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.070
 standard remote 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.740
