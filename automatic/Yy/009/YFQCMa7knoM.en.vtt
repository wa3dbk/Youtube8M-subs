something get that off there
it's<00:00:10.770> got<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> digital<00:00:11.190> readout<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.480> can

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
it's got a digital readout so you can

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.630 
it's got a digital readout so you can
tell<00:00:12.900> which<00:00:13.050> fan<00:00:13.350> speed<00:00:13.680> it<00:00:13.800> is<00:00:13.970> get<00:00:14.970> them<00:00:15.330> that

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
tell which fan speed it is get them that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.220 
tell which fan speed it is get them that
delay<00:00:17.640> there's<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> delay<00:00:18.330> feature<00:00:18.600> out<00:00:18.930> here

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
delay there's a delay feature out here

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.710 
delay there's a delay feature out here
then<00:00:19.830> control<00:00:20.310> there's<00:00:20.580> also<00:00:20.760> an<00:00:20.970> alarm<00:00:21.300> for

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
then control there's also an alarm for

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
then control there's also an alarm for
the<00:00:21.960> filter<00:00:22.410> okay

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the filter okay

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490 
the filter okay
on/off<00:00:23.880> into<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> reset<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:25.110> for<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
on/off into the reset that's for the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.160 
on/off into the reset that's for the
filter<00:00:25.800> control<00:00:26.190> okay<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:29.360> obviously<00:00:30.360> that

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
filter control okay so obviously that

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.709 
filter control okay so obviously that
unit<00:00:31.500> pops<00:00:31.770> out<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.579> countertop<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.390> sucks

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
unit pops out of the countertop it sucks

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.919 
unit pops out of the countertop it sucks
air<00:00:33.929> down<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.409> varying<00:00:35.129> rates<00:00:35.539> six-speed<00:00:36.539> fan

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929 
air down at varying rates six-speed fan

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.160 
air down at varying rates six-speed fan
there's<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> fan<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.219> there<00:00:38.429> so<00:00:39.420> I'm<00:00:39.929> gonna<00:00:40.050> go

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
there's the fan in there so I'm gonna go

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.989 
there's the fan in there so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:40.409> and<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.710> through<00:00:40.920> some<00:00:41.069> motions<00:00:41.519> here

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:41.999 
ahead and go through some motions here

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:43.489 
ahead and go through some motions here
I<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> pan<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.019> turned<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.499 
I don't know if the pan can be turned on

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.739 
I don't know if the pan can be turned on
without<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.609> gonna<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.999> popped<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.569> let<00:00:45.719> me

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:45.749 
without the gonna be popped up let me

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.840 
without the gonna be popped up let me
see<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.579> yeah<00:00:47.579> let's<00:00:47.879> go<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.059> bed<00:00:48.510> control

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
see here yeah let's go for bed control

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.639 
see here yeah let's go for bed control
so<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.969> doesn't<00:00:51.239> allow<00:00:51.389> you<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.569> pay<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.289> so

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
so it doesn't allow you to pay it out so

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.829 
so it doesn't allow you to pay it out so
first<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.519> have<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> put<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
first thing you have to do is put the

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.160 
first thing you have to do is put the
vent<00:00:55.049> up

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.209 

so

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
so

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.029 
so
there<00:01:00.730> goes<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:00.940> bed<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.390> will<00:01:01.539> pop<00:01:01.719> up

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
there goes the bed that will pop up

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.340 
there goes the bed that will pop up
about<00:01:03.039> six<00:01:03.370> or<00:01:03.519> eight<00:01:03.579> inches

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.320 

and<00:01:08.860> then<00:01:09.070> now<00:01:09.310> we<00:01:09.370> can<00:01:09.700> start<00:01:09.909> working<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
and then now we can start working the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.270 
and then now we can start working the
fan<00:01:10.479> control<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.290> I'm<00:01:11.350> going<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.560> have<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.860> do

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
fan control so I'm going to have to do

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040 
fan control so I'm going to have to do
the<00:01:12.400> FEA<00:01:12.610> tab<00:01:12.820> first<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.510> it<00:01:14.550> let's<00:01:15.550> go<00:01:15.729> on<00:01:16.050> okay

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
the FEA tab first of it let's go on okay

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.380 
the FEA tab first of it let's go on okay
so<00:01:17.110> that's<00:01:17.470> inside<00:01:18.130> six<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:18.729> it's<00:01:18.940> out<00:01:19.090> speed

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
so that's inside six so it's out speed

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.560 
so that's inside six so it's out speed
six<00:01:19.660> right<00:01:19.840> now<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:20.950> anyway<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:22.360> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
six right now so anyway that's the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.620 
six right now so anyway that's the
highest

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.990 

okay<00:01:28.630> it's<00:01:29.410> got<00:01:29.530> six<00:01:29.860> feet<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:30.370> it's<00:01:30.610> time<00:01:30.820> you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
okay it's got six feet so it's time you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.960 
okay it's got six feet so it's time you
press<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> pan<00:01:31.630> control<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.920> will<00:01:33.220> go<00:01:33.430> up<00:01:33.730> for

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
press the pan control it will go up for

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:42.230 
press the pan control it will go up for
the<00:01:34.180> out<00:01:34.300> of<00:01:34.330> speed<00:01:34.720> five<00:01:36.540> four<00:01:37.540> three<00:01:40.380> two<00:01:41.380> one

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the out of speed five four three two one

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.600 
the out of speed five four three two one
now<00:01:43.240> when<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.140> goes<00:01:44.260> back<00:01:44.530> down<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.280> next<00:01:45.520> time

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
now when it goes back down the next time

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.310 
now when it goes back down the next time
you<00:01:45.730> pop<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.090> up<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.270> turn<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.540> fan<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.960> it'll

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
you pop it up and turn the fan on it'll

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.050 
you pop it up and turn the fan on it'll
go<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:48.220> sooner<00:01:48.400> you<00:01:48.610> go<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.850> the

go to this the sooner you go to the

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.780 
go to this the sooner you go to the
speed<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.630> had<00:01:49.840> read<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.110> last<00:01:50.410> time<00:01:50.790> so

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
speed that you had read the last time so

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.830 
speed that you had read the last time so
here<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.060> go<00:01:52.180> pain<00:01:52.390> control<00:01:52.690> up<00:01:52.840> speak<00:01:53.650> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
here we go pain control up speak to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:13.560 
here we go pain control up speak to
speed3<00:01:56.970> for<00:02:11.670> whatever<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.880> says<00:02:13.300> right

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
speed3 for whatever that says right

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.750 
speed3 for whatever that says right
there<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.880> bottle<00:02:16.330> liver<00:02:16.530> VIP<00:02:17.530> r16<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.550> if<00:02:18.610> you

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
there so bottle liver VIP r16 so if you

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.920 
there so bottle liver VIP r16 so if you
want<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:18.970> look<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.209> up<00:02:19.890> anyway<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.490> there<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.730> is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
