00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
like I said this drawing on these two

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.410 
like I said this drawing on these two
pages<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.320> did<00:03:02.500> over<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.920> series<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.490> several

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
pages I did over a series of several

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.270 
pages I did over a series of several
different<00:03:04.810> live<00:03:04.990> streams<00:03:05.500> that<00:03:05.740> were<00:03:05.890> but

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
different live streams that were but

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.880 
different live streams that were but
chunks<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.300> maybe<00:03:07.600> 2<00:03:08.320> or<00:03:08.350> 3<00:03:08.590> or

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
chunks of you know like maybe 2 or 3 or

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.740 
chunks of you know like maybe 2 or 3 or
4<00:03:08.920> hours<00:03:09.160> each<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:12.370> in<00:03:12.700> total<00:03:12.970> both<00:03:13.450> these

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
4 hours each I think in total both these

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.090 
4 hours each I think in total both these
drawings<00:03:14.080> together<00:03:14.890> took<00:03:15.550> me<00:03:15.820> about<00:03:16.950> 11<00:03:17.950> or<00:03:18.040> 12

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
drawings together took me about 11 or 12

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.550 
drawings together took me about 11 or 12
hours<00:03:20.220> which<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> lot<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:22.090> mean<00:03:22.480> no<00:03:23.230> no<00:03:23.380> that's

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
hours which is a lot I mean no no that's

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.250 
hours which is a lot I mean no no that's
longer<00:03:23.890> than<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.220> usually<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.960> think

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
longer than it usually is and I think

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.220 
longer than it usually is and I think
that's<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.650> part<00:03:26.680> because<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.960> was<00:03:28.960> a<00:03:29.020> little

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
that's in part because I was a little

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.050 
that's in part because I was a little
bit<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.620> was<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> little<00:03:30.250> bit<00:03:30.340> distracted<00:03:30.940> but

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
bit I was a little bit distracted but

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.310 
bit I was a little bit distracted but
I'm<00:03:31.180> not<00:03:31.270> saying<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.720> like<00:03:31.870> it's<00:03:32.020> a<00:03:32.110> bad

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
I'm not saying that like it's a bad

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.290 
I'm not saying that like it's a bad
thing<00:03:32.350> I've<00:03:32.890> just<00:03:33.370> having<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.910> really<00:03:34.150> good

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
thing I've just having a really good

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.660 
thing I've just having a really good
time<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.600> whole<00:03:34.840> time<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.080> cut<00:03:35.500> I'll<00:03:36.310> just

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
time the whole time I cut I'll just

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.010 
time the whole time I cut I'll just
spending<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.150> little<00:03:37.240> more<00:03:37.420> time<00:03:37.480> every<00:03:37.900> now

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
spending a little more time every now

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.240 
spending a little more time every now
and<00:03:38.110> then<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.260> between<00:03:38.560> each<00:03:38.770> line<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.010> would

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
and then like between each line I would

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.820 
and then like between each line I would
look<00:03:39.430> up<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.910> talk<00:03:40.450> for<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.720> second<00:03:41.110> and<00:03:41.290> go

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
look up and talk for a second and go

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.830 
look up and talk for a second and go
back<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.220> drawing<00:03:42.460> lines<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.880> talking<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.480> just

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
back to drawing lines and talking I just

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.540 
back to drawing lines and talking I just
wasn't<00:03:44.110> working<00:03:44.440> quite<00:03:44.680> as<00:03:44.860> quickly<00:03:45.310> and

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
wasn't working quite as quickly and

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.460 
wasn't working quite as quickly and
efficiently<00:03:45.930> because<00:03:46.930> what<00:03:47.110> I'm<00:03:47.200> saying

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
efficiently because what I'm saying

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.960 
efficiently because what I'm saying
