00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
mom's passing everything so could be

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.459 
mom's passing everything so could be
from<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> sink<00:00:33.899> round<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.110> mentioned

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
from the sink round I mentioned

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.049 
from the sink round I mentioned
evidently<00:00:35.070> she's<00:00:35.250> not<00:00:35.399> she<00:00:35.610> was<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.820> part<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
evidently she's not she was like part of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.639 
evidently she's not she was like part of
some<00:00:36.149> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> like<00:00:36.450> biker<00:00:36.660> gang<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.559> they

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
some kind of like biker gang where they

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
some kind of like biker gang where they
add<00:00:37.950> old<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.250> stuff<00:00:38.399> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.239> know

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
add old and stuff which is you know

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880 
add old and stuff which is you know
really<00:00:39.570> similar<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.870> five<00:00:40.110> DS<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.530> everything

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
really similar to five DS and everything

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
really similar to five DS and everything
but<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.090> hoping<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.660> she'd<00:00:42.809> at

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
but I was really hoping that she'd at

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
but I was really hoping that she'd at
least<00:00:43.050> use<00:00:43.170> synchro<00:00:43.559> monsters<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.129> something

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
least use synchro monsters or something

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.529 
least use synchro monsters or something
and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> guess<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.059> still<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> chance

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and I guess there's still a chance

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.380 
and I guess there's still a chance
because<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.730> duel<00:00:47.940> doesn't<00:00:48.270> finish

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
because you know the duel doesn't finish

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.060 
because you know the duel doesn't finish
in<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.690> episode<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.649> haven't<00:00:49.890> seen<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
in this episode and I haven't seen a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.470 
in this episode and I haven't seen a
spoiler<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.329> doubt

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
spoiler so I don't know I kind of doubt

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.880 
spoiler so I don't know I kind of doubt
she<00:00:51.629> will<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.230> guess<00:00:52.440> there's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> chance

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
she will but I guess there's a chance

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310 
she will but I guess there's a chance
right<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.850> anyway<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.899> happened<00:00:55.230> this

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
there still is a bunch of stuff like we

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
there still is a bunch of stuff like we

the<00:01:25.080> big<00:01:25.770> bin<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.939> said

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the big bin I think was in this said

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.749 
the big bin I think was in this said
Oliver<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:28.140> paris<00:01:28.500> eiffel<00:01:28.799> tower<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.579> all

Oliver like paris eiffel tower and all

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:30.770 
Oliver like paris eiffel tower and all
kind<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.060> versus<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.420> thought<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.689> was

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
kind of see versus I thought that was

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780 
kind of see versus I thought that was
kind<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:30.990> cool<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.860> guess<00:01:32.579> though

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
kind of cool I don't know I guess though

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.060 
kind of cool I don't know I guess though
in<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.619> guess<00:01:34.740> synchro

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in the what is it I guess synchro

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.380 
in the what is it I guess synchro
dimension<00:01:35.460> technically<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.210> they're

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
dimension technically you know they're

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.289 
dimension technically you know they're
the<00:01:36.720> first<00:01:36.869> three<00:01:37.790> series<00:01:38.790> they're<00:01:39.119> supposed

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the first three series they're supposed

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.670 
the first three series they're supposed
to<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.960> guess<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.320> Jane<00:01:40.530> was

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to be in there and I guess that Jane was

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
to be in there and I guess that Jane was
in<00:01:40.860> perished<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.850> thought<00:01:41.939> was<00:01:42.060> kind

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
in perished so I just thought was kind

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.429 
in perished so I just thought was kind
of<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> know<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.290> their

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
of you know that was actually in their

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.889 
of you know that was actually in their
world<00:01:43.619> too<00:01:43.860> anyway

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
world too anyway

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
world too anyway
yeah<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.710> pretty<00:01:47.009> much<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.759> tell

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
yeah that's pretty much they just tell

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.010 
yeah that's pretty much they just tell
every<00:01:48.149> what's<00:01:48.390> happening<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.930> in

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
every what's happening on that in

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
every what's happening on that in
Flanders<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> also<00:01:49.829> tell<00:01:50.009> people<00:01:50.040> they<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.549> be

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
Flanders to also tell people they can be

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
Flanders to also tell people they can be
recruited<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.240> Lancers<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.170> better

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
recruited as Lancers if they get better

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.450 
recruited as Lancers if they get better
and<00:01:52.530> rolling<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.100> there

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and rolling in there

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
and rolling in there
then<00:01:53.820> Elias<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.659> called<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
then Elias is going to be called the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740 
then Elias is going to be called the
Lance<00:01:56.009> defense<00:01:56.490> soldiers<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.240> believe<00:01:57.570> what's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
Lance defense soldiers I believe what's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.899 
Lance defense soldiers I believe what's
the<00:01:57.840> name<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.890> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> interesting

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the name of it so kind of interesting

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.039 
the name of it so kind of interesting
you<00:02:00.240> know<00:02:00.390> they're<00:02:00.509> gonna<00:02:00.630> change<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
you know they're gonna change from a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.410 
you know they're gonna change from a
school<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.439> more<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> Defence<00:02:02.909> Force<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
school to more of the Defence Force I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.929 
school to more of the Defence Force I
guess<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.960> better<00:02:04.079> way<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.259> saying<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.680> but

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
guess the better way of saying it but

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.459 
guess the better way of saying it but
which<00:02:05.939> sounds<00:02:06.270> pretty<00:02:06.479> cool<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.320> kind

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
which sounds pretty cool and just kind

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.660 
which sounds pretty cool and just kind
of<00:02:07.500> announce<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.069> world<00:02:08.250> basically

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
of announce that to the world basically

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.520 
of announce that to the world basically

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.730 
happened basically and that yuzu he
thinks<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:20.180> guess<00:02:20.420> taken<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.050> fusion

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
thinks is I guess taken to the fusion

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.620 
thinks is I guess taken to the fusion
dimension<00:02:22.130> which<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:22.700> know<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:23.030> she<00:02:23.209> hasn't

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
dimension which we know that she hasn't

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.620 
dimension which we know that she hasn't
met<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.319> he<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.640> course<00:02:25.670> right<00:02:26.239> he's<00:02:26.420> going<00:02:26.540> to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
met and he of course right he's going to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.910 
met and he of course right he's going to
get<00:02:26.750> her<00:02:26.810> back<00:02:26.989> and<00:02:27.020> even<00:02:27.410> use<00:02:27.530> his<00:02:27.680> status

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
get her back and even use his status

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.430 
get her back and even use his status
upset<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.580> wondering<00:02:28.850> where<00:02:29.000> he<00:02:29.270> can<00:02:29.360> go<00:02:29.480> to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
upset and wondering where he can go to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.229 
upset and wondering where he can go to
go<00:02:30.800> get<00:02:30.980> her<00:02:31.040> back<00:02:31.190> out<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.700> would<00:02:31.940> think<00:02:32.060> it'd

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
go get her back out I would think it'd

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.809 
go get her back out I would think it'd
be<00:02:32.330> really<00:02:32.480> cool<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.780> see<00:02:32.900> him<00:02:33.650> go<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.430> guess

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
be really cool to see him go to I guess

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.979 
be really cool to see him go to I guess
the<00:02:34.940> synchrony<00:02:35.300> mention<00:02:35.510> which<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.690> guess<00:02:35.840> is

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
the synchrony mention which I guess is

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.930 
the synchrony mention which I guess is
where<00:02:36.140> they're<00:02:36.260> gonna<00:02:36.319> be<00:02:36.440> headed<00:02:36.890> very<00:02:37.640> soon

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
where they're gonna be headed very soon

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.000 
where they're gonna be headed very soon
because<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.420> kind<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.590> guess<00:02:39.980> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
because this is kind of this I guess a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.280 
because this is kind of this I guess a
few<00:02:40.190> episodes<00:02:40.570> or<00:02:41.570> future<00:02:41.900> episodes<00:02:42.170> we're

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
few episodes or future episodes we're

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.420 
few episodes or future episodes we're
gonna<00:02:42.380> have<00:02:42.530> for<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.680> while<00:02:42.830> are<00:02:43.010> gonna<00:02:43.220> be

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
gonna have for a while are gonna be

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.490 
gonna have for a while are gonna be
based<00:02:44.209> on<00:02:44.360> sink<00:02:44.690> rosier<00:02:44.989> than<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.230> syncro

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
based on sink rosier than the syncro

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.050 
based on sink rosier than the syncro
world<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:46.040> it'd<00:02:46.160> be<00:02:46.190> really<00:02:46.400> cool<00:02:46.580> Pecos<00:02:46.880> prime

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
world so it'd be really cool Pecos prime

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.400 
world so it'd be really cool Pecos prime
ministers<00:02:47.450> -<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.630> think<00:02:47.780> cuz<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.320> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
ministers - I think cuz I like the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.250 
ministers - I think cuz I like the
monsters<00:02:48.739> he<00:02:48.860> used<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.730> anyway<00:02:50.510> he<00:02:50.930> realizes

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
monsters he used but anyway he realizes

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.890 
monsters he used but anyway he realizes
I<00:02:51.380> guess<00:02:51.560> he<00:02:51.769> really<00:02:52.010> can't<00:02:52.220> go<00:02:52.340> after<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.940> we

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
I guess he really can't go after and we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.699 
I guess he really can't go after and we
have<00:02:55.090> Yuya<00:02:56.090> and<00:02:56.390> going<00:02:57.050> against<00:02:57.410> his<00:02:57.500> mom

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
have Yuya and going against his mom

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.160 
have Yuya and going against his mom
which<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.519> think<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.420> was<00:02:59.510> like<00:02:59.630> an<00:02:59.750> old<00:02:59.959> arcade

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
which I think it was like an old arcade

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.380 
which I think it was like an old arcade

we see a flashback what happened how I

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.720 
we see a flashback what happened how I
use<00:03:59.690> mom<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.019> dad<00:04:00.109> meet<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.590> basically<00:04:01.430> she's

use mom and dad meet and basically she's

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.560

like<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.329> leader<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.260> as<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:04.130> dueling<00:04:05.060> gang<00:04:05.269> I

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
like the leader of a as a dueling gang I

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.940 
like the leader of a as a dueling gang I
guess<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.019> what<00:04:06.170> you'd<00:04:06.260> call<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.500> biker<00:04:06.799> gang

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
guess is what you'd call a biker gang

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.330 
guess is what you'd call a biker gang
but<00:04:07.760> for<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:09.130> evidently<00:04:10.130> tall

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
but for you you and evidently tall

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.830 
but for you you and evidently tall
female<00:04:10.489> gang<00:04:10.880> and<00:04:11.120> then<00:04:11.420> she<00:04:11.720> would<00:04:11.810> always

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
female gang and then she would always

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.509 
female gang and then she would always
doing<00:04:12.140> his<00:04:12.230> people<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:12.650> she<00:04:12.890> was<00:04:13.040> kind<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.340> a

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
doing his people and she was kind of a

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.979 
doing his people and she was kind of a
rougher<00:04:14.000> person<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.480> guess<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.720> best<00:04:14.840> way<00:04:14.900> to

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
rougher person I guess the best way to

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.599 
rougher person I guess the best way to
put<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.350> where<00:04:15.739> she<00:04:15.950> would<00:04:16.100> just<00:04:16.220> roll<00:04:16.370> against

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
put it where she would just roll against

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.860 
put it where she would just roll against
everyone<00:04:17.000> didn't<00:04:17.209> care<00:04:17.359> who<00:04:17.510> she<00:04:17.539> made

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
everyone didn't care who she made

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.930 
everyone didn't care who she made
enemies<00:04:18.049> with<00:04:18.229> and<00:04:18.590> stuff<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.010> whenever
