00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.450 

alright<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.779> lab<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:06.990> called<00:00:07.440> seaweed<00:00:08.099> worms

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
alright this lab is called seaweed worms

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.089 
alright this lab is called seaweed worms
and<00:00:08.910> what<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:09.870> does<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.290> takes<00:00:10.590> advantage

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
and what it does is it takes advantage

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.940 
and what it does is it takes advantage
of<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.280> fact<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.670> when<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.030> put<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.950> mixture

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
of the fact that when you put a mixture

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.250 
of the fact that when you put a mixture
of<00:00:14.070> alginate<00:00:14.730> into<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> solution<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.139> calcium

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
of alginate into a solution of calcium

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.680 
of alginate into a solution of calcium
chloride<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:17.039> forms<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.670> skin<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> polymer

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
chloride it forms a skin it's a polymer

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.120 
chloride it forms a skin it's a polymer
reaction<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.320> let's<00:00:19.500> go<00:00:19.619> ahead<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:19.949> this

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
reaction so let's go ahead and do this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550 
reaction so let's go ahead and do this
open<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.490> your<00:00:20.580> calcium<00:00:20.820> chloride<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.630> add

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
open up your calcium chloride and add

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.650 
open up your calcium chloride and add
four<00:00:23.269> scoops<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.779> calcium<00:00:25.439> chloride<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.660> your

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
four scoops of calcium chloride to your

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.380 
four scoops of calcium chloride to your
cup<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.230> water<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:29.070> calcium<00:00:29.609> chloride<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
cup of water now calcium chloride is a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.380 
cup of water now calcium chloride is a
salt<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:31.920> used<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.820> snowbelle

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
salt it's actually used to snowbelle

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.530 
salt it's actually used to snowbelle
it's<00:00:33.660> added<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> snow<00:00:34.350> melter<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.860> help<00:00:35.540> keep

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
it's added to snow melter to help keep

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080 
it's added to snow melter to help keep
sidewalks<00:00:37.010> clean<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> case<00:00:38.820> what

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
sidewalks clean but in this case what

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.979 
sidewalks clean but in this case what
we're<00:00:39.210> going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.570> we're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> take

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.389 
we're going to do is we're going to take
advantage<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> fact<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.219> also

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
advantage of the fact that it also

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.150 
advantage of the fact that it also
splits<00:00:41.940> into<00:00:42.320> calcium<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.770> chloride<00:00:44.129> ions

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
splits into calcium and chloride ions

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
splits into calcium and chloride ions
and<00:00:44.910> those<00:00:45.210> calcium<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> chloride<00:00:46.110> ions<00:00:46.140> are

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and those calcium and chloride ions are

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.110 
and those calcium and chloride ions are
actually<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.489> react<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
actually going to react with the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.840 
actually going to react with the
alginate<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.590> form<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.010> polymer<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.520> I'll<00:00:50.610> stir

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
alginate to form a polymer so I'll stir

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.229 
alginate to form a polymer so I'll stir
that<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> disappear<00:00:53.030> it's<00:00:54.030> going

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that up get it to disappear it's going

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.240 
that up get it to disappear it's going
to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> little<00:00:54.750> bit<00:00:55.050> cloudy<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:56.010> you're

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
to be a little bit cloudy as you're

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.229 
to be a little bit cloudy as you're
stirring<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:57.829> but<00:00:58.829> it'll<00:00:59.129> eventually<00:00:59.430> settle

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
stirring it but it'll eventually settle

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.150 
stirring it but it'll eventually settle
out<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.379> we're<00:01:01.530> doing<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.949> we're

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
out then what we're doing is we're

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
out then what we're doing is we're
creating<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.699> physical<00:01:03.239> change<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.840> we're

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
creating a physical change because we're

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.859 
creating a physical change because we're
going<00:01:04.140> from<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> solid<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.909> liquid<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
going from a solid to a liquid so this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
going from a solid to a liquid so this
is<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> solution<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.950> calcium<00:01:08.130> chloride<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is a solution of calcium chloride it's

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.870 
is a solution of calcium chloride it's
about<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> two<00:01:09.450> percent<00:01:09.869> solution<00:01:10.729> now<00:01:11.729> when

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
about a two percent solution now when

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.219 
about a two percent solution now when
you<00:01:11.970> look<00:01:12.119> at<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.360> solution<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.049> see

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
you look at your solution you can see

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.539 
you look at your solution you can see
it's<00:01:13.350> clear<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.799> colorless<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.340> there's<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it's clear and colorless but there's a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.190 
it's clear and colorless but there's a
whole<00:01:14.670> bunch<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> calcium<00:01:15.630> ions<00:01:15.930> floating

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
whole bunch of calcium ions floating

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.260 
whole bunch of calcium ions floating
around<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.799> they're<00:01:16.890> waiting<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
around there and they're waiting for the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.700 
around there and they're waiting for the
seaweed<00:01:18.720> eat<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.200> ahead<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.380> take<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
seaweed eat up so go ahead and take the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.580 
seaweed eat up so go ahead and take the
bottle<00:01:20.040> off<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> seaweed<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.229> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> count

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
bottle off the seaweed and on the count

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.030 
bottle off the seaweed and on the count
of<00:01:22.680> three<00:01:22.979> drizzle<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> seaweed<00:01:24.509> into<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
of three drizzle the seaweed into the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.660 
of three drizzle the seaweed into the
one<00:01:26.490> two<00:01:26.700> three<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:28.320> about<00:01:28.979> half<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.460> bottle

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
one two three go and about half a bottle

one two three go and about half a bottle
and<00:01:30.150> put<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> cap<00:01:31.290> back<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.860> bottle<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and put the cap back on the bottle and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.100 
and put the cap back on the bottle and
take<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:35.820> popsicle<00:01:36.299> stick<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.570> kind<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
take your popsicle stick and kind of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
take your popsicle stick and kind of
wiggle<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.920> worms<00:01:38.130> around<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.850> bit<00:01:41.000> and

the<00:01:52.070> way<00:01:52.220> out<00:01:52.250> all<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.030> way<00:01:53.150> I'll<00:01:53.330> pull<00:01:53.600> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
the way out all the way I'll pull the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.610 
the way out all the way I'll pull the
whole<00:01:53.870> thing<00:01:53.900> there<00:01:54.320> yeah<00:01:58.630> yeah<00:01:59.630> does<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.470> feel

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
whole thing there yeah yeah does it feel

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.220 
whole thing there yeah yeah does it feel
like<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.890> gummy<00:02:01.190> worm<00:02:01.340> yeah<00:02:02.060> yeah<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.110> the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
like a gummy worm yeah yeah this is the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.870 
like a gummy worm yeah yeah this is the
exact<00:02:03.590> same<00:02:03.830> stuff<00:02:04.190> that<00:02:04.220> they<00:02:04.460> pull<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.790> out
