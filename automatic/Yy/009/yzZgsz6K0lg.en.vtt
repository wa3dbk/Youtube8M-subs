00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 a warm welcome to anno 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.910
 on-line 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.130
 My name is the coffee and I showed 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.860
 Now just a few impressions of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.230
 anno online to online is a 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.450
 browser game or will soon be 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.810
 it will be a browser game 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.189
 currently in the closed beta that is 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.970
 of course you have to cut back many 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.949
 There are many resets and and and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.990
 the work with high pressure on this 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.310
 I 've got it 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.210
 now for several days already 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.469
 looked at and my first conclusion the same 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.180
 beforehand it is addictive i am from 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.420
 generally, they do not play bare 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.309
 Enthusiastic but anno I have long 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.750
 again the feeling wow I want 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.750
 I want to play it on 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.780
 difficult as casual www blog a log 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.710
 Login and farm and construction &amp; farm it 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.660
 is the madness 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.420
 I even wish I had to last longer 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.670
 anticipate I wish that all 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.920
 online a normal game would be so 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 not browser but sometimes because that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.140
 make his city fun again 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.400
 build up so typical in the old days 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.610
 you just do not want anything anymore 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 play because it is just so old and 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.990
 the newest was a bit too 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.820
 a lot of future but that you bring exactly 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.860
 to the point but even as 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.100
 Browserspiel makes it so much 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.360
 fun also in the closed beta show now 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.430
 I just give you a little bit 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.560
 with which impression can do and so 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.460
 far is an open or the open beta 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 i can really do it for people who are us 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.040
 Not only interested in it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.900
 I really enjoy myself anyway 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.119
 say about the beginning of the so 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.840
 the beginning looks like this little piece 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.030
 Here you see that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.070
 Hopefully, first thing is 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.509
 unlocked this is with fog 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.570
 Covered like here the island 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.520
 It was only possible to unlock it, of course 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.619
 one does not even later in the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.899
 closed beta later buy mobile 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.750
 Of course, you know it 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.280
 but you invest a little money 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.670
 all this does not so be prepared 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.500
 it not 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.540
 absolute rubbish because of that I leave 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.149
 Just try it over the shop 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.200
 and you do not need that 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.600
 So this little piece so 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.880
 another beginning and then unlocked 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.560
 If you put him you have every one here 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.970
 Crowd quests at the beginning are so 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.930
 a bit again so extreme things go 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.640
 here 800 gold so this typical of this 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.930
 typical guide to understand 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.210
 that one should do so 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.110
 this is about the tree with am 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:35.670
 beginning with lumberjack stock fish milk 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:38.900
 So ten color fabrics owned things 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.670
 public the church and chapel 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.410
 marketplace and then of course the us 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.120
 standard houses streets 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.430
 Of course everything will be a little more 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.350
 and as soon as you get up something I have 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.170
 have just started up again until 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.310
 you just built a few houses 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.010
 market place so i can get my wood cases 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.670
 Park my fishing huts like you do here 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.030
 able to see 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.190
 Lumberjack huts can be seen here 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.870
 ver.di wants to know everyone here 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.540
 It's not 100 percent that's not 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.190
 Well built but it should not 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.720
 long as I stay will indeed only houses 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.170
 I would like to sit next to one 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.330
 lumberjack department here tinkering and 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.350
 yes, of course, there are also mining 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.450
 so dismantle 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.130
 This is a very typical anno feeling 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.769
 available here and it 's taking too 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.510
 not for months until you are next 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.549
 So I can build Haussler 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.280
 Right now, just aim for enough wood 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.400
 I can do it properly too 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.709
 continue building 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.450
 You know, it just does not take everything 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.450
 as long as you think and when you are good 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.860
 For example, invest in lumberjacks 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.810
 warehouse 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.800
 then came a relatively short time 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.530
 I can say it every 112 hours 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.120
 you can build something good again and that's how it works 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.890
 right alu many yes so I have 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.960
 I've been busy for some days now 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.550
 and I have the principle for hours 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.470
 built 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.770
 So I'm going to spend hours in this 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.180
 browser and dismantled then thought 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.980
 I am my half hour hours 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.210
 have gone to play or something with me 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.910
 get a little bit of resources again 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.620
 I came back quickly 20 houses or so 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.570
 built that it is really not that way 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.590
 bad 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.359
 Of course, it's still a browser game 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.919
 sometimes takes a little longer you have to 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.950
 just respond to it is like that 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:26.480
 has long-term project, so to speak otherwise even 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.070
 not much to say everyone is you on 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.080
 canon on the whole 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.570
 and it really works very much 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.980
 well it's just really like a game 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.230
 browser and it really makes it extreme 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.210
 fun and that is not so 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.950
 easy but it is not difficult 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.790
 So who alba knows he has I believe 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.130
 no problem 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.900
 Here are my first case yet 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.510
 I have a small grant now 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.729
 the same - so you have the 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.090
 population of farmers craftsmen 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.040
 merchants investing here you have to be 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.340
 one orders here now that he is me 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.229
 the company does not fill up already 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.740
 build a Christmas tree for free 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:13.460
 get here is new menu help 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.440
 ready 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.290
 Here you have so you can his 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.750
 make your own avatar 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:30.530
 I just happen to be very good 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:32.630
 from random mushroom topfschnitt 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.290
 I thought that's exactly what it meant 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.060
 Let's just take one 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.610
 pot cut otherwise you can 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.340
 of course there is still a chat 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.919
 of course a global help sets 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.919
 news whispering friends you can 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.139
 Add 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.740
 news system knows everything 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:55.120
 but at the old league makes up here 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.490
 disturbs only here you can see his 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.530
 population and which are upgradeable 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.449
 Here you can look at his resources 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.100
 are a little less would be extreme 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.680
 Errors all the menus are coming 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:11.050
 as soon as I continue, of course 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:12.490
 wills typical of oem shipping there 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.740
 then later a bit 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.750
 different of course as franz knows but 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.210
 You can also buy other islands 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.610
 For example, wheat islands peninsula 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.410
 You also have to research them for now 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.310
 and and there is loads to do 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.050
 anno online 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.690
 I hope you which of these impressive 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.820
 If I'm here in the now 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.889
 I'll continue to build cosmopolitan city 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.139
 you again a gameplay two of them 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.900
 show that you see again like me 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.310
 have come a bit further and 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.050
 I would also like a few comments 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.539
 happy and perhaps there is also 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.520
 already a few tester service synonymous test 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:48.130
 and then you can print your impressions 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.169
 I have a nice comment on that 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.110
 personally can only really recommend if 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.820
 so far this game is and 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.229
 Therefore , say goodbye to me and now 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.950
 I wish you all the best 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.950
 good at cash
