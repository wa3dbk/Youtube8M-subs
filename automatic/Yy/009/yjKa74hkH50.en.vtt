everyone<00:03:13.939> loves<00:03:14.120> selfies<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.109> why<00:03:15.199> don't<00:03:15.319> we

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
everyone loves selfies so why don't we

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:16.390 
everyone loves selfies so why don't we
go<00:03:15.469> to<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.680> country<00:03:15.829> where<00:03:16.129> we<00:03:16.219> don't

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
go to a country where we don't

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.710 
go to a country where we don't
understand<00:03:16.729> the<00:03:16.790> language<00:03:16.939> and<00:03:17.269> see<00:03:17.389> what<00:03:17.599> we

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
understand the language and see what we

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.809 
understand the language and see what we
can<00:03:17.870> get<00:03:18.019> when<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.650> give<00:03:18.799> them<00:03:18.919> the<00:03:19.069> red<00:03:19.310> dragon

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
what they would naturally do is if

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.110
