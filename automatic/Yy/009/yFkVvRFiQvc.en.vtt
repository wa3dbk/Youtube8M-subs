00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the digit ez+ is like a silver color and

the digit ez+ is like a silver color and
the<00:02:04.079> difference<00:02:04.409> between<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the difference between this is that the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
are included and so that's important in

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.460 
are included and so that's important in
some<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.280> United<00:02:11.700> States<00:02:11.940> Chess<00:02:12.360> Federation
