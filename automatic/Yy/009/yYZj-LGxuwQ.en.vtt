00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.630
 I thought that where else if not 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.630
 here 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.980
 say the beach is the whole area 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.670
 it all changed completely 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.599
 Nostalgia is no longer what 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.599
 she was hector 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.219
 what lilly 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.420
 because 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:56.489
 on the 8th 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.489
 since vastly child that has never 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.730
 mummy sector 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.189
 decide 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 Hello 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.730
 the researchers tell us again and again 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.450
 you do not like luck for money 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.550
 can buy 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.970
 I know what you think now how much 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.680
 All this research deserves on the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:39.820
 the world is getting bigger and only with luck 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.820
 it goes down 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.750
 Who of us wonder I remember 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.150
 still to his childhood where you are lucky 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.280
 are just merely as a for life 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.310
 the condition has been remembered 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.970
 to the moments where everything was pure joy 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:05.410
 the moment where everything is in ours 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:09.430
 world in us and only to us was good 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.430
 everything was just right 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.230
 and now we are the salad 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.910
 grown up and everything is just wrong 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.860
 everything and that always it is almost as 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.900
 We would be looking for this 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.790
 we lost more and more 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.370
 Focus on finding happiness again 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.050
 the more back it seems to me 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.170
 only in the moments we are in 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.150
 Do something completely different if we try hard 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.250
 engage in something with others 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.710
 to understand things to learn to dance when 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.750
 They also want us that way 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.400
 to experience something like happiness when he is next to you 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.130
 product as a gift on the edge 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.740
 that means we should not be so much 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.350
 with the much-vaunted search for the 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.360
 but rather deal with that 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:01.550
 good luck while searching 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.680
 you will go on a journey what is there 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.190
 Otherwise I see satisfaction and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.080
 good luck with you 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.600
 Once upon a time there was a psychiatric name 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.280
 sector at the evening am at the end of my 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.020
 forces that led a full life 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.550
 Apparently they wanted something so worried 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.550
 not at all your style 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.310
 I have to get out of here I want something 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.430
 explore and know what happiness is where 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:38.160
 should go her way because I have 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:40.350
 kenya thought in china 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.730
 I come from afar and try too 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.870
 understand what people are happy 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.250
 it's monday we have 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.390
 they would shut themselves as one 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.390
 looking at happy people 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.040
 is that or pleasure I want to know 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.040
 what makes people happy 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.020
 i am hey in africa 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.450
 at home 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.380
 not yet finally back to mine 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.380
 meaningless reading 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.400
 the stock 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.350
 we should not be so concerned with that 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.860
 a lot of people are looking for happiness 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.550
 but rather with happiness 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.550
 while searching
