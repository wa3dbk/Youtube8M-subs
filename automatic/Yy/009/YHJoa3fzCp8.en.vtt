00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.090
 a mother of family is making sure that 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.740
 in two years they came to the water 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.360
 potable housing is located in the 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.630
 block 3 of the jirón san martín between the 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.630
 Photo 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 at the precise moment that this mother of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.470
 family was preparing to collect water from 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.009
 this big pipe was his surprise to see 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.180
 that two worms also fell 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.550
 immediately called the press for 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.230
 show your discomfort against the map the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.520
 fact occurred in block 13 of the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.520
 jirón san martín in tarapoto 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.920
 called 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.350
 at first they believed that it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.320
 it was about a snake hit more 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 known and still of sutiss has 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.830
 blanquito and they have rohinton de negri 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.020
 crises tend to canacar if it 's a 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.300
 process also the bell decided 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.619
 place the worms in a bottle like 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.619
 evidence of what happened 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.270
 He made an appeal to emapa san martín to 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.910
 investigate this case we are taking care of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.300
 ddm to see this case because it is dangerous 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.780
 also because to go to the stomach 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.780
 intensity 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.110
 and of course that could not stay 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.390
 there immediately I take this sample 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.950
 towards the reference laboratory of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.790
 let's see what were the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.620
 results 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.420
 Given this fact, we turn to 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.860
 reference laboratory of health and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.440
 we chat with the microbiologist 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.750
 edilberto arévalo who indicated that these 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.390
 worms are dirt and that this shows 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.970
 of water is totally contaminated what 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.530
 that is observed in this water sample 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.960
 are nematodes 33 nematodes that could 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.330
 be the earth nematodes so they 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.070
 you see the characteristics of what 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.030
 you have here you can make a selection 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.850
 microscopic and good the presence is 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.240
 evidence of direct contamination 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.520
 of significant amounts of land 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.250
 because that way we can have 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.560
 access to this type of subjects and if there 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.530
 nematodes then it means that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.350
 these waters 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.330
 with bacteria are highly 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.310
 polluted the risk of consumption of 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.620
 contaminated water is that it can cause 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.340
 allergies and diarrhea the risk is that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.650
 as such there are not many problems to 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.140
 what is consumable and can have a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.790
 allergic reaction but if there are nematodes 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.459
 there are bacteria and if there are bacteria 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.010
 contaminants such as enterobacteria 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.800
 the coliforms that are called them 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:03.160
 produce diarrhea and some could be 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.810
 acute enough serious and put at risk 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.760
 the health of fact that sick not 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.350
 He also recommended for San Martin to do 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.360
 permanent monitoring of their 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.270
 reservoirs to avoid this kind of 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.490
 made the claims that the staff 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.160
 that distributes the water 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.170
 I put that we will not be light on the subject 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.630
 it will be another provider 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.340
 the correct change collection map 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.160
 then let him do 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.349
 the permanent surveillance of their systems 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.180
 of water to detect this because 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.510
 who should detect first are 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.510
 they
