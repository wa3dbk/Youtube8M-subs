00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.789 
s'mores protein bar
so<00:00:11.299> 13<00:00:11.690> grams<00:00:11.930> of<00:00:12.110> fiber<00:00:12.410> in<00:00:12.650> this

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
so 13 grams of fiber in this

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.490 
so 13 grams of fiber in this
that's--there<00:00:13.610> grams<00:00:13.969> than<00:00:14.469> their<00:00:15.469> other

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
that's--there grams than their other

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.340 
that's--there grams than their other
protein<00:00:16.129> bars<00:00:16.400> only<00:00:16.760> one<00:00:17.060> gram<00:00:17.300> of<00:00:17.330> sugar<00:00:17.539> 6

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
protein bars only one gram of sugar 6

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.250 
protein bars only one gram of sugar 6
grams<00:00:18.650> over<00:00:19.100> it's<00:00:19.430> all<00:00:19.580> sugar<00:00:19.940> alcohol<00:00:20.540> ok<00:00:21.200> so

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
grams over it's all sugar alcohol ok so

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.170 
grams over it's all sugar alcohol ok so
here's<00:00:21.710> what<00:00:21.950> it<00:00:21.980> looks<00:00:22.130> like<00:00:22.640> you<00:00:22.820> can<00:00:22.940> see

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
smokiness from the campfire that you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.709 
smokiness from the campfire that you
would<00:01:07.280> get<00:01:07.490> when<00:01:07.729> you're<00:01:07.939> in<00:01:08.119> front<00:01:08.600> of<00:01:08.659> the

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
would get when you're in front of the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.690 
would get when you're in front of the
darn<00:01:08.990> campfire<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.889> you're<00:01:10.280> roasting<00:01:10.639> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
darn campfire and you're roasting the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.849 
darn campfire and you're roasting the

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
dang marshmallow and you're putting it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.099 
dang marshmallow and you're putting it
constructing<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.850> all<00:01:13.969> together<00:01:14.149> that's

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
constructing it all together that's

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.410 
constructing it all together that's
basically<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.310> only<00:01:16.369> thing<00:01:16.789> missing<00:01:17.179> it<00:01:17.270> this

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
basically the only thing missing it this

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.840 
basically the only thing missing it this
boy<00:01:18.229> if<00:01:18.289> they<00:01:18.409> could<00:01:18.560> replicate<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:19.340> smoky

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
boy if they could replicate that smoky

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.300 
boy if they could replicate that smoky
flavor<00:01:19.880> from<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.569> campfire<00:01:20.869> huh<00:01:21.259> is<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.009> my

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
flavor from the campfire huh is it my

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.370 
flavor from the campfire huh is it my
favorite<00:01:22.579> no<00:01:23.029> it's<00:01:23.240> probably<00:01:23.959> not<00:01:24.139> my

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
favorite no it's probably not my

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.599 
favorite no it's probably not my
favorite<00:01:25.029> right<00:01:26.029> now<00:01:26.889> but<00:01:27.889> maybe<00:01:28.100> it'll<00:01:28.459> grow

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
favorite right now but maybe it'll grow

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.429 
favorite right now but maybe it'll grow
on<00:01:28.850> me

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
on me

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.719 
on me
overall<00:01:30.439> this<00:01:30.590> will<00:01:30.740> probably<00:01:30.920> a<00:01:31.130> low<00:01:31.310> 5<00:01:31.579> out

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
overall this will probably a low 5 out

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.839 
overall this will probably a low 5 out
of<00:01:31.759> 5<00:01:31.969> it<00:01:32.719> probably<00:01:33.439> would<00:01:33.560> be<00:01:33.649> a<00:01:33.679> higher<00:01:33.950> 5<00:01:34.369> if

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
of 5 it probably would be a higher 5 if

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.719 
of 5 it probably would be a higher 5 if
you<00:01:35.599> know<00:01:35.719> you<00:01:35.840> heated<00:01:36.139> this<00:01:36.349> up<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:36.950> maybe

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
you know you heated this up and maybe

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.260 
you know you heated this up and maybe
got<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.569> campfire<00:01:39.819> experience<00:01:40.819> when<00:01:41.119> you're

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
got that campfire experience when you're

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.029 
got that campfire experience when you're
when<00:01:41.569> you're<00:01:41.599> eating<00:01:41.959> this<00:01:42.109> so<00:01:42.439> basically<00:01:42.619> all

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
when you're eating this so basically all

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.120 
when you're eating this so basically all
