00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.589
 and then people who bring another video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 You and the courses are coming to play. 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.030
 a little deforestation and I'll give a 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.650
 tips for you how to play artemis 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.090
 I intend on other videos give other 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.170
 tips about other gods then it is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.190
 It's interesting that you sign up for 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.780
 channel to accompany these others. 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 videos and I think you please 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.439
 these videos also because it is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.900
 to reward the work I'm doing 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.760
 having and I think if you enjoy the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.550
 a minimum you can do for this 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.519
 then the following is the goddess Artemis 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.019
 Greek if I'm not mistaken and she 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.829
 use this bow and arrow to attack 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.600
 enemies and the tower finally inss flash 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.360
 physical damage it is not a magic power 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.890
 not physical power and april you have 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.230
 that build on that you have to 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.379
 build building on top of speed 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.430
 attack on physical damage damage 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.110
 and over a critical year 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.449
 so let's go after interesting attack 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.120
 why take God that usa is a bow and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.399
 arrow and consequently the more 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 flashes you shoot more flashes you go 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.149
 hit the enemy and the more there 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.070
 jesus and satan and the enemy nearest you 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.570
 stop killing him faster than he 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.820
 image so this is very interesting 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.189
 also easier to knock down towers than 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 she had sert this kind of thing then 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.600
 It's very interesting that you invest in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.939
 attack speed in the area and damage 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.380
 physique is interesting because it is a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.299
 goddess who despite an attack on the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.240
 distance she emphasized in her physical 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.220
 will not use a magic year so it's 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.700
 interesting you go back to physical damage 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.400
 and use those three items here to give a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.610
 critical because the critic is as follows 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.220
 art 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.119
 She is a goddess that she is very weak. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.829
 defense 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.110
 at least for me not to build 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.759
 building defense then it is interesting that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.770
 you but your enemies faster 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.200
 possible and with these three items here 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.990
 you will give an average of 90% damage 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.600
 critical ie every ten shots 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.450
 you will give new critics if you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.090
 critical year hit on the enemy 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.509
 You'll shoot more or less in a 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.060
 average of 300-300 hp 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.399
 since then it's interesting that you use 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.560
 these three items because you will 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.930
 will be 45 pounds depending on your 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.519
 enemy will you finish it and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.579
 consequently it will become easier to 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.840
 to win as much is the arena as with this 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.829
 or any other game mode that you 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.920
 is playing 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:27.150
 elza also the sprint which is very good 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.250
 and that one regenerates the hp during 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.349
 sixty seconds or denying 60 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.670
 seconds , and I also use the posts for 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.989
 keep in the law 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.489
 so one other thing that I thought was fine 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.859
 interesting was the application for 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.340
 android he gives you some bild already 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.450
 formed by the smart community and I 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.389
 I'll let you sign up for 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.280
 download is very cool it has some 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.099
 some pictures of a photo gallery here 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.720
 for you to use as the cell of the coup and 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.799
 This I found very cool. 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.569
 interesting I'll leave it here 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.090
 subscription is a fucking tip to 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.120
 you and now a party of 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.500
 training against a boat I will demonstrate 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.900
 which to you as the first 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.700
 priority is basically this 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.340
 branch that puts in the art 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.079
 show and she learns her enemy so that 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.209
 You have time to kill him or 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.849
 here is your pack tower so that your 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.669
 team together mate him but he has the 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.410
 aim to trap your enemy on the ground 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:21.150
 and the second skill she'll give you a 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.129
 buffet both of speed of locomotion 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.230
 speed of attack and how to 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.340
 said earlier this is going to be very good 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.900
 because of the artemis theme bild focused on 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.430
 a critical year you will get more 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.049
 title will consequently hit more 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.699
 times your enemy and if you hit more 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.569
 one of the easiest critics you will 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.430
 kill him 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.540
 and as I just showing here promised 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.970
 I will not be able to do right but 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.229
 when you activate she looks you go 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.639
 throw more shots theft second guess 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.500
 will take the style by second one 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.449
 average about 10 once you 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.949
 active after you upgrade and 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:57.989
 It will will improve the skill and also 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:00.239
 will give you a speed of locomotion 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.400
 how are you seeing the third 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.319
 ability is basically a rain of 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.659
 flashes you play up to her to fall 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.970
 where you want to end the 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.609
 swallow your enemy and if you focus 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.349
 your bild going on the physical she'll stay 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.440
 stronger will still be much better 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.090
 So the last of the artemis I go 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.889
 explaining along with the combo that is the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.200
 the last time a little 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.980
 You will come back and he will die. 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.600
 the enemy is stabilizing at one point 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.310
 facilitating the flow of the team and 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.070
 the enemy has ended or you and I 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.320
 as it is the following will paralyze the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.580
 took his list and he's taking 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.770
 here with the second skill you 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.200
 end the enemy very easy too 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.550
 quiet and is basically 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.500
 This is what I wanted to show you. I 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.290
 I'm practically already lost from here. 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.850
 and she was just explaining to you 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.220
 but in fact a game as bad as it is 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.810
 and I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.790
 video I hope it has been useful for 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.470
 you found it useful if you liked it 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.020
 pass on to your friends who also enjoy 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.100
 this game and would also find it useful and also 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.220
 sign up for the channel I want 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.190
 do or more days of another others 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.470
 gods here in ismat, that's it 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.980
 Thanks for having had and even more. 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.980
 went
