I'm<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.869> is<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> cut<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
I'm going to do is to is to cut in the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
I'm going to do is to is to cut in the
sides<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.300> war<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.140> brush<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
sides of the war with the brush and the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.760 
sides of the war with the brush and the
paint<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:33.090> will<00:00:33.270> give<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.200> basis<00:00:34.620> for

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
paint that will give the the basis for

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.639 
paint that will give the the basis for
us<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.130> roll<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.820> will<00:00:35.880> take<00:00:36.120> our<00:00:36.649> paint

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
us to roll and it will take our paint

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
us to roll and it will take our paint
all<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.340> edge<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.210> that's<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
all the way to the edge so that's the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.060 
all the way to the edge so that's the
first<00:00:39.660> thing<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.410> take<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:40.860> brush

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
first thing we do so we take our brush

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.450 
first thing we do so we take our brush
we're<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:41.940> using<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.420> tip<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.160> lightly

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
we're just using the tip and we lightly

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090 
we're just using the tip and we lightly
dab<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.059> along<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.300> edge<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
dab it along the edge and then we

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.220 
dab it along the edge and then we
slightly<00:00:47.700> cut<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:51.020> all<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> way

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
slightly cut in like this all the way

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:05.229 
slightly cut in like this all the way
down<00:00:53.239> like<00:00:54.239> this<00:01:00.379> like<00:01:01.379> that

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.270 

and<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:05.960> don't<00:01:06.079> need<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.409> have<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.590> lot<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:06.890> paint

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
and we don't need to have a lot of paint

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.580 
and we don't need to have a lot of paint
just<00:01:07.460> enough<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.970> cover<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.899> get<00:01:09.110> into<00:01:09.500> the

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
just enough to cover and to get into the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.590 
just enough to cover and to get into the
corner<00:01:09.979> that's<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.399> main<00:01:10.610> purpose<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.360> this

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
corner that's the main purpose of this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.960 
corner that's the main purpose of this
so<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.530> roller<00:01:12.799> can<00:01:13.130> take<00:01:13.340> up<00:01:13.520> we<00:01:13.820> can

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
so that the roller can take up we can

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.370 
so that the roller can take up we can
take<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.240> roll<00:01:14.420> all<00:01:14.689> the<00:01:14.720> way<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.200> edge

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
take the roll all the way to the edge

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.530 
take the roll all the way to the edge
without<00:01:15.860> actually<00:01:16.460> getting<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.820> big<00:01:17.030> mess<00:01:17.299> on

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
without actually getting a big mess on

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.069 
without actually getting a big mess on
the<00:01:18.229> woodwork<00:01:19.000> okay<00:01:20.000> now<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.240> we've<00:01:20.600> cut<00:01:20.899> it

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
the woodwork okay now that we've cut it

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.620 
the woodwork okay now that we've cut it
in<00:01:21.289> we're<00:01:22.220> going<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.520> use<00:01:22.759> our<00:01:22.909> roller<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.420> roll

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
in we're going to use our roller to roll

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.210 
in we're going to use our roller to roll
the<00:01:23.869> wall<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:24.500> is<00:01:24.619> what<00:01:24.770> we're<00:01:24.920> going<00:01:25.039> to

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
the wall so this is what we're going to

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.870 
the wall so this is what we're going to
do<00:01:25.369> right<00:01:25.640> now<00:01:27.130> take<00:01:28.130> our<00:01:28.310> roller<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.429> dip

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
do right now take our roller and we dip

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.730 
do right now take our roller and we dip
it<00:01:32.030> in<00:01:32.149> our<00:01:32.299> paint<00:01:32.600> once<00:01:32.840> we've<00:01:33.049> dipped<00:01:33.229> in<00:01:33.439> we

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
it in our paint once we've dipped in we

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.460 
it in our paint once we've dipped in we
wrote<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.130> off<00:01:34.280> just<00:01:34.580> to<00:01:34.759> take<00:01:34.970> any<00:01:35.470> excess

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
wrote it off just to take any excess

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.169 
wrote it off just to take any excess
paint<00:01:36.740> off<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.369> should<00:01:37.549> be<00:01:37.580> able<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:38.000> hold

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
paint off so you should be able to hold

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.180 
paint off so you should be able to hold
your<00:01:38.390> roller<00:01:38.630> without<00:01:39.590> actually<00:01:40.069> having

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
your roller without actually having

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.880 
your roller without actually having
paint<00:01:40.610> dripping<00:01:41.110> all<00:01:42.110> over<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.530> see<00:01:42.770> I'm

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
paint dripping all over you see I'm

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.850 
paint dripping all over you see I'm
pretty<00:01:43.190> clean<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.670> we<00:01:44.659> take<00:01:44.899> our<00:01:45.080> roller<00:01:45.319> and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
pretty clean so we take our roller and

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.770 
pretty clean so we take our roller and
we<00:01:46.039> put<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.369> roller<00:01:46.610> on<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.209> wall<00:01:47.360> like<00:01:47.539> this

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
we put the roller on the wall like this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.639 
we put the roller on the wall like this
and<00:01:48.409> do<00:01:48.709> it<00:01:48.830> in<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.039> diamond<00:01:49.369> pattern<00:01:49.909> like<00:01:50.360> this

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
and do it in a diamond pattern like this

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.559 
and do it in a diamond pattern like this
what<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.860> does<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.159> spreads<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:53.030> paint<00:01:53.299> out

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
what that does is spreads the paint out

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.350 
what that does is spreads the paint out
so<00:01:54.289> it<00:01:54.409> we<00:01:54.649> get<00:01:54.799> an<00:01:54.920> even<00:01:55.280> coat<00:01:55.549> once<00:01:56.119> we've

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
so it we get an even coat once we've

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.660 
so it we get an even coat once we've
spread<00:01:57.229> out<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.649> paint<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.429> roller

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
spread out the paint so that the roller

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.690 
spread out the paint so that the roller
is<00:01:58.939> almost<00:01:59.569> dry<00:01:59.869> ie<00:02:00.709> that<00:02:00.920> there's<00:02:01.250> no<00:02:01.399> paint

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
is almost dry ie that there's no paint

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.539 
is almost dry ie that there's no paint
