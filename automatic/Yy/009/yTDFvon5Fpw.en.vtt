makes a mistake usually it's national
headlines<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
headlines and so that's that's a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.999 
headlines and so that's that's a
priority<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> believe

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
priority for me also you know I believe

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.120 
priority for me also you know I believe
in<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.579> team<00:01:51.270> concept<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.110> basically<00:01:52.920> that's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
in a team concept and basically that's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.819 
in a team concept and basically that's
my<00:01:53.340> philosophy<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:54.320> building<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> team<00:01:55.619> from

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
my philosophy of building a team from

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.789 
my philosophy of building a team from
the<00:01:55.979> ground<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.840> understanding<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.049> you're

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
the ground up understanding that you're

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.230 
the ground up understanding that you're
going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> need<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.310> guy<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> right<00:01:59.939> side

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
going to need that guy on the right side

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.370 
going to need that guy on the right side
of<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> you're<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> need<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.170> guy<00:02:01.350> on

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
of it you're going to need that guy on

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.200 
of it you're going to need that guy on
the<00:02:01.560> left<00:02:01.799> side<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.939> can't

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the left side of you because you can't

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.049 
the left side of you because you can't
do<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> by<00:02:03.600> yourself
