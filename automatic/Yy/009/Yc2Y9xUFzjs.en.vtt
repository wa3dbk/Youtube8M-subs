blood<00:00:33.630> spacer<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.950> keep

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
blood spacer here so that I can keep

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.869 
blood spacer here so that I can keep
them<00:00:35.520> separated<00:00:35.969> by<00:00:36.270> by<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> batches<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
them separated by by the batches and it

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
them separated by by the batches and it
takes<00:00:39.090> 16<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> 17<00:00:39.960> days<00:00:40.290> for<00:00:40.800> these<00:00:40.950> guys<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
takes 16 to 17 days for these guys to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.940 
takes 16 to 17 days for these guys to
hatch<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.899> want<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.140> keep<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.530> incubator

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
hatch you want to keep this incubator

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.580 
hatch you want to keep this incubator
around<00:00:44.520> 100<00:00:45.000> degrees<00:00:45.719> right<00:00:46.020> around<00:00:46.170> 100

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
around 100 degrees right around 100

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.959 
around 100 degrees right around 100
between<00:00:46.879> 99.5<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.710> 102<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.489> as<00:00:50.730> long<00:00:50.820> as

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
between 99.5 and 102 so as long as

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.250 
between 99.5 and 102 so as long as
you're<00:00:51.090> fluctuating<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.690> between<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> air

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you're fluctuating in between the air

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.610 
you're fluctuating in between the air
for<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.719> think<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:54.989> 15<00:00:55.379> days

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
for the first I think the first 15 days

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.459 
for the first I think the first 15 days
you're<00:00:56.579> also<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> want<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> turn<00:00:58.260> these

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
you're also going to want to turn these

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
you're also going to want to turn these
eggs<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.920> least<00:00:59.100> four<00:00:59.309> times<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.670> day<00:00:59.699> they<00:01:00.300> say

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
eggs at least four times a day they say

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.110 
eggs at least four times a day they say
every<00:01:00.780> four<00:01:00.960> hours<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.430> minimum

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
every four hours but I think minimum

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.520 
every four hours but I think minimum
four<00:01:03.359> times<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.750> day<00:01:04.189> what<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> did<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:06.140> add<00:01:07.140> this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
four times a day what I did was add this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740 
four times a day what I did was add this
computer<00:01:08.100> fan<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.640> old<00:01:08.820> computer<00:01:09.330> fan<00:01:09.510> from

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
computer fan this old computer fan from

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.310 
computer fan this old computer fan from
an<00:01:09.840> old<00:01:09.990> PC<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:11.070> my<00:01:11.220> incubator<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.080> pretty

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
an old PC to my incubator it was pretty

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.560 
an old PC to my incubator it was pretty
simple<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.220> heard<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> you're<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
simple I I heard that you're going to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.550 
simple I I heard that you're going to
get<00:01:15.720> better<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:17.540> better<00:01:18.540> hatch<00:01:18.840> ratio<00:01:19.320> if

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
get better a better hatch ratio if

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
get better a better hatch ratio if
instead<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.310> using<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> still<00:01:20.880> air<00:01:20.909> Fiat<00:01:21.450> if

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
instead of using the still air Fiat if

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.399 
instead of using the still air Fiat if
you<00:01:21.750> use<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:22.049> air<00:01:22.439> circulator<00:01:23.810> so<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> do

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you use an air circulator so what I do

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.770 
you use an air circulator so what I do
is<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.740> took<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.070> off<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.970> old<00:01:27.150> computer<00:01:27.450> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is I took this off an old computer and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.910 
is I took this off an old computer and
each<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.040> screws<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.930> made<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> mark

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
each of these screws I just made a mark

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.969 
each of these screws I just made a mark
with<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> toothpick<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.259> styrofoam

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
with a toothpick on on the styrofoam

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
with a toothpick on on the styrofoam
where<00:01:35.460> one<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> them<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.119> poked<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.229> through

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
where one of them and poked them through

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.300 
where one of them and poked them through
you<00:01:38.540> see<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:39.990> web<00:01:40.259> space<00:01:40.979> right

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you see I put a little web space right

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.859 
you see I put a little web space right
there<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:42.240> keep<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.600> up<00:01:42.689> off<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.350> off<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
there to keep it up off of the off of

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.330 
there to keep it up off of the off of
the<00:01:45.869> styrofoam<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:46.950> clearance

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the styrofoam so you have some clearance

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
the styrofoam so you have some clearance
when<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> make<00:01:49.049> sure

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
when you do this you want to make sure

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
when you do this you want to make sure
that<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.619> glowing<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.759> don't<00:01:50.880> want

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
that it is glowing down you don't want

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.340 
that it is glowing down you don't want
to<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.509> second<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.520> from<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:54.649> and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
to have it second up from what I see and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.270 
to have it second up from what I see and
everything<00:01:58.350> everything<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.830> wasn't<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.100> was

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
everything everything I wasn't that was

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.270 
everything everything I wasn't that was
pretty<00:01:59.430> simple<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> screws<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.980> did

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
pretty simple for the screws what I did

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.510 
pretty simple for the screws what I did
was<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.490> used<00:02:02.850> these<00:02:03.090> wall<00:02:04.080> anchors<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:05.400> were

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
was I used these wall anchors they were

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.380 
was I used these wall anchors they were
perfect<00:02:06.020> all<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.230> had<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.440> do<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:07.770> uh<00:02:07.800> just<00:02:08.390> hand

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
perfect all I had to do was uh just hand

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.390 
perfect all I had to do was uh just hand
tighten<00:02:09.600> them<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.500> they<00:02:10.950> were<00:02:11.009> good<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.370> go

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
tighten them up and they were good to go

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.940 
tighten them up and they were good to go
I<00:02:11.730> took<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:15.440> what<00:02:16.440> do<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.560> call<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
I took this this what do you call it the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.730 
I took this this what do you call it the
universal<00:02:17.580> power<00:02:17.820> adapter<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.170> used<00:02:19.470> for

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
universal power adapter that I used for

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.530 
universal power adapter that I used for
the<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> power<00:02:20.520> cable<00:02:20.970> on<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.480> is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the for the power cable on this this is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
the for the power cable on this this is
a<00:02:21.720> 12-volt<00:02:22.200> fan<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:23.750> what<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> did<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:33.560> there

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
a 12-volt fan so what I did was there

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.220 
a 12-volt fan so what I did was there
you<00:02:34.740> go<00:02:34.890> focusing<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:36.959> will

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
you go focusing in so this this will

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.420 
you go focusing in so this this will
control<00:02:37.860> my<00:02:38.100> fan<00:02:39.020> 3.43<00:02:40.020> volts<00:02:40.740> is<00:02:40.890> not<00:02:41.100> enough

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
control my fan 3.43 volts is not enough

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.100 
control my fan 3.43 volts is not enough
to<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.150> turn<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> as<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.010> switch<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.400> down

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
to get it to turn so as I switch it down

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.050 
to get it to turn so as I switch it down
you<00:02:46.110> know<00:02:46.290> that's<00:02:46.470> five<00:02:46.740> volts<00:02:49.760> six<00:02:50.760> point

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
you know that's five volts six point

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.120 
you know that's five volts six point
five<00:02:51.680> eight<00:02:52.680> point<00:02:53.010> four<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.750> nine<00:02:55.709> point

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
five eight point four and nine point

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.340 
five eight point four and nine point
five<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.450> enough<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.810> stir<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.200> air

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
five so just enough to stir the air

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.660 
five so just enough to stir the air
around<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.709> don't<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.040> want<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> blow<00:02:59.520> on

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
around you don't really want to blow on

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
around you don't really want to blow on
it<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:02.340> I'm<00:03:02.640> gonna<00:03:02.820> I'll<00:03:03.300> play<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
it so I'm gonna I'll play with the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.630 
it so I'm gonna I'll play with the
different<00:03:03.810> settings<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.890> see<00:03:05.160> which

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
different settings on it and see which

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.509 
different settings on it and see which
one<00:03:05.930> works<00:03:06.930> best<00:03:07.230> but<00:03:07.530> I'll<00:03:07.920> probably<00:03:08.070> started

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
one works best but I'll probably started

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.030 
one works best but I'll probably started
what<00:03:08.910> was<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.239> lower<00:03:09.390> side<00:03:09.720> maybe<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.140> 5.0<00:03:11.010> or

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
what was the lower side maybe the 5.0 or

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.759 
what was the lower side maybe the 5.0 or
the<00:03:11.310> 6.5<00:03:13.459> but<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.550> was<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.760> very<00:03:14.940> very<00:03:15.209> simple

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
the 6.5 but it was a very very simple

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.460 
the 6.5 but it was a very very simple
adjustment<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:18.239> low<00:03:18.660> voltage<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.320> it's

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
adjustment and it's low voltage so it's

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.630 
adjustment and it's low voltage so it's
pretty<00:03:19.650> safe<00:03:19.890> I'm<00:03:20.190> not<00:03:20.610> really<00:03:20.760> worried<00:03:21.120> about

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
pretty safe I'm not really worried about

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.009 
pretty safe I'm not really worried about
got<00:03:23.640> really<00:03:23.880> worried<00:03:24.120> about<00:03:24.150> zapping<00:03:24.660> myself

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
got really worried about zapping myself

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.699 
got really worried about zapping myself
off<00:03:25.370> or<00:03:26.370> anything<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:31.260> was<00:03:31.500> just

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
off or anything on it so this was just

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.460 
off or anything on it so this was just
the<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.220> junction<00:03:32.760> just<00:03:33.150> make<00:03:33.870> sure<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.320> wire

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
the the junction just make sure the wire

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.509 
the the junction just make sure the wire
is<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> separate<00:03:35.190> when<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.549> tape<00:03:36.120> them<00:03:36.269> in<00:03:37.519> good

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
is a separate when you tape them in good

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.080 
is a separate when you tape them in good
to<00:03:38.670> go<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:40.350> that's<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.310> hopefully<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:41.880> get

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
to go so that's that and hopefully I get

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.410 
to go so that's that and hopefully I get
myself<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.690> nice<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:42.870> flock<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:44.420> quail

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
myself a nice little flock of quail

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.190 
myself a nice little flock of quail
going<00:03:47.450> we'll<00:03:48.450> try<00:03:48.630> not<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.780> bounce<00:03:48.989> them

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
going we'll try not to bounce them

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.330 
going we'll try not to bounce them
around<00:03:49.290> too<00:03:49.560> much<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.660> so<00:03:51.660> that's<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.340> wish

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
around too much so so that's it and wish

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.699 
around too much so so that's it and wish
me<00:03:53.370> luck<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.910> hopefully<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.299> get<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.690> go<00:03:55.440> well

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
me luck and hopefully I get this go well

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.259 
me luck and hopefully I get this go well
and

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
and

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.610 
and
within<00:03:58.700> six<00:03:59.700> weeks<00:03:59.790> or<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.780> dispatch

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
within six weeks or so the dispatch

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.890 
within six weeks or so the dispatch
should<00:04:02.099> be<00:04:02.280> should<00:04:03.060> be<00:04:03.150> ready<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.390> wake<00:04:03.629> after

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
should be should be ready to wake after

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.199 
should be should be ready to wake after
they<00:04:04.260> hatch<00:04:04.409> I<00:04:04.590> mean<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.840> guys<00:04:07.110> will

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
they hatch I mean so these guys will

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.910 
they hatch I mean so these guys will
these<00:04:09.209> guys<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.659> guess<00:04:09.810> they<00:04:09.930> mature<00:04:10.230> in<00:04:10.440> five

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
these guys I guess they mature in five

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.830 
these guys I guess they mature in five
six<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.640> eight<00:04:11.790> weeks<00:04:12.090> they'll<00:04:12.420> start<00:04:12.659> laying

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
six to eight weeks they'll start laying

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.199 
six to eight weeks they'll start laying
eggs<00:04:13.049> once<00:04:13.379> they<00:04:13.620> hatch<00:04:13.860> they'll<00:04:14.640> hatch<00:04:14.879> again

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
eggs once they hatch they'll hatch again

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.400 
eggs once they hatch they'll hatch again
16<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.229> 17<00:04:16.530> days<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.810> important<00:04:19.229> things

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
16 to 17 days and the important things

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.080 
16 to 17 days and the important things
are<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.620> humidity<00:04:20.130> which<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.609> think<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:20.910> got

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
are the humidity which I think I got

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.700 
are the humidity which I think I got
wrong<00:04:21.269> last<00:04:21.570> time<00:04:21.720> which<00:04:22.079> this<00:04:22.350> hopefully

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
wrong last time which this hopefully

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.830 
wrong last time which this hopefully
this<00:04:22.860> fan<00:04:23.070> will<00:04:23.280> help<00:04:23.430> me<00:04:23.580> with<00:04:23.729> and<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
this fan will help me with and the
