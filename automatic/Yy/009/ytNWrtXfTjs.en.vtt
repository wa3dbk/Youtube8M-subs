00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.590
 in this store 50 years of 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.290
 formula 1 5 decades of competition and the 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.820
 who have played 730 races of the 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.920
 who have achieved 182 victories 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.810
 these single-seaters have uploaded some 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.960
 of the greatest pilots who have 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.529
 conquered the podium 483 times 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.320
 a story that began in 1963 with 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.260
 this shield 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.310
 and is the beginning of his McLaren team 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.020
 history and his shield have gone 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.910
 evolving into the 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.610
 second most important team of the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.489
 Formula 1 the second victory is imposed 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.110
 ferrari championships and only surpass him 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.210
 but it seems that in recent years the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.780
 British team is going through a 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.120
 small crossing through the desert 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.800
 2004 was the last great year of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.539
 ferrari schumacher dominated and the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.820
 atmosphere in mclaren was up here 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.649
 the results of raikkonen pulsar and the 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.570
 team seemed very far from achieving a 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.210
 victory to the point that a 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.579
 British journalist said mclaren not 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.100
 would win any race that year and that in 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.050
 if he did, he would run naked 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.780
 five kilometers of silverstone per year 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.340
 next then came spa and raikkonen 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.350
 I disguise the poor results of 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.210
 team with the only victory that year 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.780
 and desisted that the journalist or image 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.060
 sic in 2005 that yes fortunately 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.759
 I went with the colors of mclaren 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.530
 in 2006 they were lurching and it was the 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.350
 last year in which the woking team 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.980
 he did not get wet in champagne zero victories in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.050
 your locker 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.660
 his greatest successes reached the second 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.640
 put raikkonen twice motorcycle and 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.190
 another one and after overtaking 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.260
 michael schumacher of the rose achieved his 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.840
 only podium in the formula a second and 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.240
 of the Hungarian grand prize but that was 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.080
 all that year and this in its 50 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.000
 birthday goes way to repeat itself 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.830
 the performance of their cars are 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.480
 very far from the best but their 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.550
 pilots are also not up to 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.860
 Patton does not find the rhythm and his 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.930
 rivals pass him as actions 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.030
 and pÃ©rez that wants to show why 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.160
 of his signing teaches the aggressiveness that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.679
 He lacks his partner and sometimes he 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.450
 It also remains to himself 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.290
 To top it all, their relationships on the track have 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.290
 had tightness 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.690
 but canada was especially sad 64 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.330
 races later and mclaren did not get 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.709
 score with none of your two cars 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.959
 broke the absolute record in the formula 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.900
 1 the last time it happened was that in 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.930
 the grand prize of abu dhabi of 2009 have 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.390
 past more than 3 years of these images 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.069
 50 years since its founding but still 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.409
 more painful was that in the grand prize 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.530
 of Great Britain in your own home 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.480
 they returned from emptiness they added their second 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.120
 consecutive race without any single 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.909
 point 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.980
 in this time bruce mclaren left a lot 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.680
 more than a name and has some memories 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.720
 become an example and inspiration and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.500
 they should work hard to be at 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.500
 height of this name
