 advice to be able to ignore all your

 family in case it suits you 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.930

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.369
 worked perfect I will raise 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.320
 different scenarios where you 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.060
 you could find for example your dad is 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.680
 a very hardworking man who year after year 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.090
 has been able to leave the middle class and today 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.470
 has a prosperous job in which you 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.849
 can pay for a university or a 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.140
 good people's school no problem is 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.790
 that your dad has been able to take away that 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 pint of naco that characterizes it since 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.760
 that came out of the valley because well not 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.960
 you worry the first thing is to understand that 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.670
 the fact that you are ashamed of your 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.620
 family does not mean you do not want them 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.420
 for that it is very simple to say are your 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.850
 employees and someone asks you who is 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.379
 you just say your driver or maybe it's a 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.210
 man who wants to harass you and because 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.140
 everyone observes the ways of parents 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.370
 because he is also my secretary 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.370
 and notice that right now 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.820
 to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.120
 and in my head 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.370
 the one that the grandfather that is not so much 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.060
 you would also like 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.440
 or it's done as much as you know a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.850
 man there is nothing like a drama 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.140
 telenovelesco to be able to leave 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.490
 any situation like this 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.170
 Another possible situation is that the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.550
 portrayed inept your brother is approaching 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 while you are doing homework with your 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.820
 companions as if in the case of 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.190
 clouds there would not be enough space to 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.320
 not have to run into anyone because it is 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.860
 he injected decides to wink at one 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.860
 of your friends 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.299
 The humanity 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.299
 and who is 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.770
 the son of much zone 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.250
 they are still 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.950
 efe 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.950
 but not 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.320
 another possible situation is that you're 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.180
 trying to park in polanco with 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.860

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.910
 the street in front that bear 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.070
 in conclusion if you are not able to 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.790
 hide your family maybe the easiest 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.379
