don't want the dough to stick in goes
the<00:03:08.910> dough<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.890> we're<00:03:11.069> going<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.400> make<00:03:11.580> sure

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
the dough and we're going to make sure

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.050 
the dough and we're going to make sure
that<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.480> dough<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.750> oiled<00:03:13.410> as<00:03:13.680> well<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.910> it

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
that the dough is oiled as well so it

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.670 
that the dough is oiled as well so it
doesn't<00:03:15.270> form<00:03:15.599> a<00:03:15.720> crust<00:03:15.930> because<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.500> will

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
doesn't form a crust because this will

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.030 
doesn't form a crust because this will
prevent<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.190> from<00:03:17.220> rising<00:03:17.900> here<00:03:18.900> we<00:03:19.110> go<00:03:19.290> we

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
prevent it from rising here we go we

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.699 
prevent it from rising here we go we
cover<00:03:20.610> it<00:03:20.850> up<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.209> we're<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.290> leave<00:03:22.500> it

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
cover it up and we're going to leave it

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.040 
cover it up and we're going to leave it
for<00:03:22.739> I'm<00:03:23.640> guessing<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.209> hour<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.660> half<00:03:24.840> to

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
for I'm guessing one hour and a half to

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.080 
for I'm guessing one hour and a half to
two<00:03:25.200> hours<00:03:25.230> until<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:26.040> doubles<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.580> size<00:03:26.790> it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
two hours until it doubles in size it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.540 
two hours until it doubles in size it

a pretty thin we're trying to make a
rectangle<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:59.269> I'm<00:04:00.269> usually<00:04:00.450> aiming<00:04:01.110> for

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
rectangle and I'm usually aiming for

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.569 
rectangle and I'm usually aiming for
around<00:04:01.830> three<00:04:02.340> millimeters<00:04:02.910> then<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.540> like<00:04:04.260> my

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
the crispier they're going to break

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.500 
the crispier they're going to break
later<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.370> when<00:04:11.370> using<00:04:11.609> pizza<00:04:12.150> cutter<00:04:12.390> and

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
lines oh and then we twist them around

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.379 
lines oh and then we twist them around
just<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:21.400> make<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.609> more<00:04:21.910> fancy<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:24.120> then<00:04:25.120> on

they go onto the baking sheet and when

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.510 
they go onto the baking sheet and when
we<00:04:31.330> have<00:04:31.539> baking<00:04:32.139> sheet<00:04:32.380> full<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.860> that<00:04:33.160> sticks

poppy seed here or sesame seed they
don't<00:04:46.330> stick<00:04:47.050> much<00:04:47.919> but<00:04:48.490> enough<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.940> make<00:04:49.120> it

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
don't stick much but enough to make it

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
look fancy and taste good and this is an

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.210 
look fancy and taste good and this is an
expressway<00:04:54.820> here<00:04:55.360> so<00:04:55.900> we<00:04:56.050> have<00:04:56.199> a<00:04:56.229> rectangle

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
expressway here so we have a rectangle

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.800 
expressway here so we have a rectangle
I'm<00:04:57.370> cutting<00:04:57.699> it<00:04:57.820> in<00:04:57.970> half<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.419> then<00:04:58.570> I'm

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
I'm cutting it in half and then I'm

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.459 
I'm cutting it in half and then I'm
cutting<00:04:59.699> sticks<00:05:00.699> just<00:05:01.479> like<00:05:01.720> that

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
cutting sticks just like that

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.899 
cutting sticks just like that
all<00:05:04.469> of<00:05:04.949> them<00:05:05.129> at<00:05:05.310> once<00:05:07.460> now<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.669> is<00:05:08.789> my

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
all of them at once now this is my

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.600 
all of them at once now this is my
everyday<00:05:09.469> way<00:05:10.469> of<00:05:10.650> preparing<00:05:11.009> the<00:05:11.340> sticks

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
everyday way of preparing the sticks

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.070 
everyday way of preparing the sticks
because<00:05:11.819> I'm<00:05:12.090> preparing<00:05:12.479> them<00:05:12.629> pretty<00:05:12.870> often

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
because I'm preparing them pretty often

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.990 
because I'm preparing them pretty often
I<00:05:13.409> do<00:05:13.469> not<00:05:13.740> twist<00:05:13.979> them<00:05:14.250> every<00:05:14.580> time<00:05:14.789> because

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
I do not twist them every time because

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.309 
I do not twist them every time because
it<00:05:15.150> takes<00:05:16.099> it<00:05:17.099> takes<00:05:17.400> time<00:05:17.729> so<00:05:18.599> I<00:05:18.629> just<00:05:19.050> cut

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
it takes it takes time so I just cut

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.270 
it takes it takes time so I just cut
them<00:05:19.530> like<00:05:19.680> this<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:21.560> then<00:05:22.560> just<00:05:22.590> brush<00:05:23.009> them

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
them like this and then just brush them

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.649 
them like this and then just brush them
with<00:05:23.400> olive<00:05:23.639> oil<00:05:23.939> and<00:05:26.090> transfer<00:05:27.090> them<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.330> the

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
with olive oil and transfer them to the

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:28.490

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.089 
baking sheet
now<00:05:28.949> those<00:05:29.250> don't<00:05:29.939> have<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.479> rise<00:05:31.319> anymore

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
now those don't have to rise anymore

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.570 
now those don't have to rise anymore
