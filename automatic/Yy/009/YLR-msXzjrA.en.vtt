00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.180
 Ukraine is in chaos and balancing on 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.340
 the brink of default the Ministry of Finance 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.460
 stated that the country was threatened 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.309
 bankruptcy to overcome the crisis of Kiev 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.080
 need help in size 35 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.270
 billion dollars by the end of 2015 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 despite the fact that the external debt of Ukraine 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.199
 is 140 billion dollars and this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.250
 about 80 percent of the country's GDP 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.070
 Kiev debt for Russian gas 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 reached nearly two billion dollars 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.629
 for deliveries in 2014 and 2013 without money 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
 Ukraine is unlikely to be able to maintain its 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.270
 energy that would jeopardize 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.270
 gas supply agreement with europe 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.920
 let's see how this scheme works 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.469
 a quarter of Europe's gas imports from 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.539
 Russia passes through Ukraine after 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.820
 numerous warnings Moscow 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.699
 declared that from April will cease 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 sell gas to Kiev at a discount what if 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.799
 Ukraine will cease to comply with the agreement 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.710
 on fuel transit this was before 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.369
 in 2006 when Ukraine failed 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.260
 to pay their debts Russia gates were 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.530
 twisted this led to the fact that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.909
 half and europe froze with cold then 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 the same thing happened in late 2008 early 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.439
 2009 gas supplies were again stopped 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.000
 just that moment when they were 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.579
 urgency 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.299
 I am trying to provide uninterrupted transit 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.990
 fuel to europe russia has created 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.770
 alternative routes 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 this pipeline is the north stream which with 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.140
 2012 connects the EU and Russia through 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.920
 Baltic Sea and South Stream 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.520
 the opening of which is scheduled for the end 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.979
 2015 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.950
 both of these pipelines bypass Ukraine 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.040
 which Moscow considered not reliable 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.409
 partner and in the light of recent events 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 another controversy over gas 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.909
 can cause serious 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.909
 financial problems in Ukraine
