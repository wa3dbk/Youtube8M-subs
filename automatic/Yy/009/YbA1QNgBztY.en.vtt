00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.370 
obviously it was always different
because<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:07.580> started<00:03:07.820> in<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.840> eSports<00:03:09.320> scene

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
because we started in the eSports scene

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.590 
because we started in the eSports scene
you<00:03:09.710> know<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:09.980> when<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.250> created<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.610> team<00:03:10.970> it

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
you know like when I created the team it

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.180 
you know like when I created the team it
was<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.780> lot<00:03:11.960> different<00:03:11.990> because<00:03:12.380> we<00:03:12.740> didn't

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
was a lot different because we didn't

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
was a lot different because we didn't
come<00:03:13.340> from<00:03:13.460> anywhere<00:03:13.670> else<00:03:13.940> like<00:03:14.150> optic<00:03:14.540> and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
come from anywhere else like optic and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.380 
come from anywhere else like optic and
phase<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.920> know<00:03:16.010> how<00:03:16.160> they<00:03:16.910> started<00:03:17.300> on

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
phase you know how they started on

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.760 
phase you know how they started on
YouTube<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.870> then<00:03:17.990> transitioned<00:03:18.620> into

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
YouTube and then transitioned into

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.500 
YouTube and then transitioned into
competitive<00:03:19.160> we<00:03:19.940> did<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.210> other<00:03:20.240> way<00:03:20.480> around

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
competitive we did the other way around

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.780 
competitive we did the other way around
so<00:03:21.020> I'm<00:03:21.260> sure<00:03:21.500> as<00:03:21.770> it<00:03:21.950> was<00:03:22.070> for<00:03:22.280> optics<00:03:22.610> when

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
so I'm sure as it was for optics when

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.430 
so I'm sure as it was for optics when
they're<00:03:22.910> first<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.270> long<00:03:23.420> time<00:03:23.630> ago<00:03:23.750> they're

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
they're first a long time ago they're

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.300 
they're first a long time ago they're
probably<00:03:24.590> going<00:03:24.860> through<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.100> same<00:03:25.250> thing

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
probably going through the same thing

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.130 
probably going through the same thing
you<00:03:25.640> know<00:03:25.730> that's<00:03:25.880> awesome<00:03:26.570> feeling<00:03:26.750> and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
you know that's awesome feeling and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.040 
you know that's awesome feeling and
definitely<00:03:27.830> happy<00:03:28.100> for<00:03:28.250> them<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.820> do<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:29.720> think

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
definitely happy for them and do I think

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.510 
definitely happy for them and do I think
they're<00:03:30.170> gonna<00:03:30.230> repeat<00:03:30.620> in<00:03:30.770> the<00:03:30.830> playoffs<00:03:31.220> I'm

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
they're gonna repeat in the playoffs I'm

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.370 
they're gonna repeat in the playoffs I'm
not<00:03:31.880> sure<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.450> be<00:03:32.480> honest<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.930> actually<00:03:33.050> think

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
not sure to be honest I actually think

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.310 
not sure to be honest I actually think
it's<00:03:33.500> gonna<00:03:34.070> be<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.670> surprise<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.480> don't<00:03:36.050> think

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
it's gonna be a surprise I don't think

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.440 
it's gonna be a surprise I don't think
it<00:03:36.770> will<00:03:37.010> be<00:03:37.160> them<00:03:37.370> not<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.090> think<00:03:38.300> that<00:03:38.420> I

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
it will be them not that I think that I

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.729 
it will be them not that I think that I
think<00:03:38.930> they're<00:03:39.020> one<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> best<00:03:39.350> team<00:03:39.530> if

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
think they're one of the best team if

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.979 
think they're one of the best team if
not<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.220> best<00:03:40.370> team<00:03:40.580> in<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.730> game<00:03:40.880> um<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.900> just

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
not the best team in the game um I just

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.690 
not the best team in the game um I just
think<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.410> game<00:03:42.530> is<00:03:42.590> flukey<00:03:43.100> you<00:03:43.370> know<00:03:43.489> like

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
think this game is flukey you know like

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.880 
think this game is flukey you know like
uh<00:03:43.910> there's<00:03:44.720> not<00:03:44.930> really<00:03:45.110> much<00:03:45.350> they<00:03:45.590> can<00:03:45.650> do

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
uh there's not really much they can do

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.830 
uh there's not really much they can do
to<00:03:45.980> prevent<00:03:46.160> winning<00:03:46.850> or<00:03:47.060> losing<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.540> feels

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
to prevent winning or losing it feels

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.030 
to prevent winning or losing it feels
like<00:03:47.989> you<00:03:48.170> know<00:03:48.200> obviously<00:03:48.350> they<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.800> play<00:03:48.950> on

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
like you know obviously they can play on

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.979 
like you know obviously they can play on
point<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.430> stuff<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.850> all<00:03:50.420> those<00:03:50.540> dudes<00:03:50.780> are
