00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.700 

so<00:00:02.310> basically<00:00:02.750> the<00:00:03.750> reason<00:00:03.990> we<00:00:04.319> have<00:00:04.470> move

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
so basically the reason we have move

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.570 
so basically the reason we have move
amount<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.930> if<00:00:06.930> we<00:00:07.470> didn't<00:00:07.799> have<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.370> we

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
amount is if we didn't have that and we

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.640 
amount is if we didn't have that and we
move<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.940> gun<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.110> move<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.410> same

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
move the gun it's going to move the same

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.610 
move the gun it's going to move the same
speed<00:00:11.040> it's<00:00:11.820> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> move<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.530> exactly<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
speed it's going to move on exactly the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.849 
speed it's going to move on exactly the
same<00:00:13.830> as<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> mass<00:00:14.519> itself<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:16.410> speed<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> you

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
same as the mass itself the speed of you

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.590 
same as the mass itself the speed of you
in<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> mouse<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.609> everyone<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.449> want

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
in the mouse and everyone that we want

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.090 
in the mouse and everyone that we want
to<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> little<00:00:18.930> delayed<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:19.920> like

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
to have a little delayed so it's like

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.640 
to have a little delayed so it's like
following<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.789> mouse<00:00:21.470> x-axis<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
following the mouse x-axis and the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.210 
following the mouse x-axis and the
y-axis<00:00:23.060> so<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.150> kind<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.420> gives<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
y-axis so it kind of gives it a like a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.300 
y-axis so it kind of gives it a like a
realistic<00:00:26.220> effect<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.670> thus<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:29.010> line<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
realistic effect and thus the line of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
realistic effect and thus the line of
code<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.490> makes<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> happen<00:00:30.439> now<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.500> need

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
code that makes that happen now we need

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.240 
code that makes that happen now we need
the<00:00:31.769> same<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:32.390> for<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.450> y<00:00:33.660> axis<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.170> well<00:00:34.350> so

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the same thing for the y axis as well so

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.410 
the same thing for the y axis as well so
just<00:00:35.489> copy<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.450> line<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:41.180> paste<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
just copy this line and paste it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.979 
just copy this line and paste it
underneath<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:44.030> change<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> y<00:00:45.570> axis

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
underneath it and change this to y axis

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
underneath it and change this to y axis
and<00:00:47.120> change<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.480> y<00:00:48.660> axis<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.620> well<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.980> save

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and change this to y axis as well I save

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
and change this to y axis as well I save
it<00:00:51.829> I've<00:00:52.829> got<00:00:53.070> those<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.370> done<00:00:55.160> now<00:00:57.050> now<00:00:58.050> we're

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
it I've got those two done now now we're

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.039 
it I've got those two done now now we're
going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> use<00:00:58.530> the<00:01:02.210> i'm<00:01:03.210> missing<00:01:03.570> available

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
going to use the i'm missing available

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.850 
going to use the i'm missing available

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
let's define new verbal quickly let's

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.380 
let's define new verbal quickly let's
call<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> public<00:01:12.290> war<00:01:14.000> new<00:01:15.409> gun<00:01:16.580> pause<00:01:17.580> pause

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
call it public war new gun pause pause

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
call it public war new gun pause pause
will<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.930> call<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.229> position<00:01:19.710> basically

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
will be on a call it position basically

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.560 
will be on a call it position basically
short<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.670> its<00:01:21.390> effect<00:01:21.689> free<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.110> well

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.000 

save<00:01:26.290> that<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.750> i'm<00:01:29.080> going<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.409> explain<00:01:29.800> why

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
save that now i'm going to explain why

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.219 
save that now i'm going to explain why
we<00:01:30.159> need<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:31.180> put<00:01:31.450> here<00:01:31.659> new<00:01:33.030> campos<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
we need that so put here new campos the

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.300 
we need that so put here new campos the
reason<00:01:35.620> we<00:01:35.770> need<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:39.130> we're

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
reason we need this is because we're

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.590 
reason we need this is because we're
going<00:01:39.430> we're<00:01:39.880> going<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.060> be<00:01:40.150> changed<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.540> the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
going we're going to be changed in the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.280 
going we're going to be changed in the
vector<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.340> guns<00:01:42.550> position<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:44.170> no

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
vector of the guns position so it's no

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.930 
vector of the guns position so it's no
longer<00:01:44.500> going<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.770> be<00:01:44.830> in<00:01:44.979> its<00:01:45.100> default

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
longer going to be in its default

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.060 
longer going to be in its default
position<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.590> do<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:49.470> after<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.619> put<00:01:50.830> your

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
position so do that after you put your

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.190 
position so do that after you put your
global<00:01:51.850> for<00:01:52.210> equal<00:01:52.540> sign<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:52.869> put<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.110> new

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
global for equal sign and put a new

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.410 
global for equal sign and put a new
vector<00:01:53.590> free<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.880> we<00:01:54.910> giving<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.360> new

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
vector free so we giving it new

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.100 
vector free so we giving it new
positions<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:01.090> I'm<00:02:01.270> confusing<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.899> guys

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
positions if I'm confusing you guys

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.980 
positions if I'm confusing you guys
really<00:02:02.560> sorry<00:02:02.970> just<00:02:03.970> leave<00:02:04.539> a<00:02:04.570> comment<00:02:04.840> below

and I'll get back to you and then what
we're<00:02:09.369> going<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:10.500> we're<00:02:11.500> going<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.650> put

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
we're going to do is we're going to put

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.370 
we're going to do is we're going to put
open<00:02:12.010> bracket<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:13.330> we're<00:02:13.989> going<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.170> say<00:02:14.260> we

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
open bracket and we're going to say we

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:22.050 
open bracket and we're going to say we
get<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.770> default<00:02:15.130> position<00:02:21.060> default

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
get the default position default

get the default position default
position<00:02:23.670> dot<00:02:24.670> X

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.710 

and<00:02:27.629> we<00:02:28.349> want<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.650> plus<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.129> with<00:02:29.370> our<00:02:29.450> x<00:02:30.450> axis

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and we want to plus that with our x axis

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.520 
and we want to plus that with our x axis
on<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:31.530> mouse<00:02:34.970> which<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.239> also<00:02:37.019> called<00:02:37.290> move

move on X there we go comma I'm going to

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.440 
move on X there we go comma I'm going to
the<00:02:47.200> same<00:02:47.379> for<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.620> y<00:02:47.739> axis<00:02:48.159> to<00:02:48.819> default

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
the same for the y axis to default

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.379 
position dot dot y and we're going to
plus<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:56.920> our<00:02:57.959> Y<00:02:58.959> mouse<00:02:59.290> axes<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:01.030> move

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
plus that with our Y mouse axes so move

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.360 
plus that with our Y mouse axes so move
on<00:03:02.159> why<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:04.319> as<00:03:05.319> well<00:03:05.500> as<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.739> ax<00:03:05.889> is<00:03:06.129> it's

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
on why and as well as that ax is it's

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.149 
on why and as well as that ax is it's
completely<00:03:06.670> dead<00:03:07.120> when<00:03:07.389> it<00:03:07.510> using<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.870> so

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
completely dead when it using it so

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:15.000 
completely dead when it using it so
let's<00:03:09.159> just<00:03:09.370> put<00:03:09.609> default<00:03:12.269> position<00:03:13.530> dot<00:03:14.530> said

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
let's just put default position dot said

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.649 
let's just put default position dot said
and<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.900> closed<00:03:17.230> bracket<00:03:19.709> save<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:21.659> ok

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
and then closed bracket save it ok

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.599 
and then closed bracket save it ok
brilliant<00:03:22.870> now<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.709> new<00:03:23.829> position<00:03:24.340> set

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
brilliant now that the new position set

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.849 
brilliant now that the new position set
up<00:03:24.730> for<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.090> gun<00:03:25.269> now<00:03:26.200> we<00:03:26.260> need<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.620> start

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
up for the gun now we need to start

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.759 
up for the gun now we need to start
applying<00:03:27.189> it<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.549> gun<00:03:27.790> itself<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> now

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
applying it to the gun itself so now

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.780 
applying it to the gun itself so now
we're<00:03:29.889> going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.069> use<00:03:30.189> our<00:03:30.340> gun<00:03:30.609> very

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
we're going to use our gun very

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.789 
we're going to use our gun very
lucrative<00:03:31.299> which<00:03:31.689> was<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> game<00:03:32.079> object<00:03:32.500> so

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
lucrative which was a game object so

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.190 
lucrative which was a game object so
enough<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.400> i<00:03:33.430> knows<00:03:33.700> what<00:03:34.030> game<00:03:34.569> objects<00:03:35.019> can

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
enough so i knows what game objects can

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:43.530 
enough so i knows what game objects can
move<00:03:35.469> in<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.010> gun<00:03:40.290> dot<00:03:41.290> transform<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.540> we're

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
move in so gun dot transform and we're

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.970 
move in so gun dot transform and we're
going<00:03:43.659> to<00:03:43.689> moving<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.109> local<00:03:44.500> change<00:03:44.829> in<00:03:44.919> the

going to moving the local change in the
local<00:03:45.280> position<00:03:45.669> so<00:03:45.939> dot<00:03:46.389> local<00:03:46.870> position

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269

should be moving when we move to the

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.159 
should be moving when we move to the
left<00:04:58.199> and<00:04:58.590> if<00:04:59.069> you<00:04:59.159> look<00:04:59.310> up<00:04:59.840> there<00:05:00.840> we<00:05:01.020> go

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
left and if you look up there we go

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.559 
left and if you look up there we go
perfect<00:05:03.650> but<00:05:04.650> what<00:05:05.039> if<00:05:05.069> someone<00:05:05.159> does<00:05:05.699> a<00:05:05.729> you

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
perfect but what if someone does a you

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.140 
perfect but what if someone does a you
know<00:05:06.719> doesn't<00:05:07.259> want<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.710> there's<00:05:08.610> only<00:05:08.879> the

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
know doesn't want it there's only the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.110 
know doesn't want it there's only the
gun<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.539> way<00:05:09.659> it<00:05:09.779> was<00:05:10.400> so<00:05:11.400> we<00:05:11.580> should<00:05:11.879> truly

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
gun the way it was so we should truly

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.200 
gun the way it was so we should truly
make<00:05:12.449> a<00:05:13.099> ruling<00:05:14.099> which<00:05:14.400> allows<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:14.819> to<00:05:14.939> enable

make a ruling which allows you to enable

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.959 
make a ruling which allows you to enable
it<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:15.919> later<00:05:16.919> on<00:05:17.129> it<00:05:17.279> could<00:05:17.430> be<00:05:17.520> set<00:05:17.759> as<00:05:17.879> an

it's a boolean and i'm going to set
default<00:05:41.939> value<00:05:42.539> as<00:05:42.719> false<00:05:45.199> save<00:05:46.199> that<00:05:46.469> and<00:05:46.669> on

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
default value as false save that and on

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.450 
default value as false save that and on
the<00:05:47.909> stop<00:05:48.289> function<00:05:49.289> i'm<00:05:49.770> going<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.039> set<00:05:50.250> on

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
the stop function i'm going to set on

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.730 
the stop function i'm going to set on
and<00:05:50.669> off<00:05:53.029> to<00:05:54.029> equals<00:05:54.719> true<00:05:55.849> now<00:05:56.849> if<00:05:56.909> it's<00:05:57.120> true

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
and off to equals true now if it's true

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.260 
and off to equals true now if it's true
we<00:05:58.740> want<00:05:59.009> are<00:05:59.099> going<00:05:59.339> to<00:05:59.490> meet<00:05:59.639> the<00:05:59.819> movements

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
we want are going to meet the movements

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:09.650 
we want are going to meet the movements
so<00:06:00.930> if<00:06:01.219> on<00:06:02.219> and<00:06:02.909> off<00:06:03.569> is<00:06:05.089> equally<00:06:06.089> goes<00:06:06.419> to<00:06:06.569> true

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.240 

then<00:06:10.290> open<00:06:11.220> bracket<00:06:11.640> sorry<00:06:12.680> do<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.830> movement

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
then open bracket sorry do the movement

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:24.290 
then open bracket sorry do the movement
out<00:06:16.790> open<00:06:17.790> bracket<00:06:19.640> close<00:06:20.640> bracket<00:06:21.980> else<00:06:23.300> on

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
out open bracket close bracket else on

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.410 
out open bracket close bracket else on
off<00:06:27.260> equals<00:06:28.260> false<00:06:31.130> so<00:06:32.130> if<00:06:32.220> it's<00:06:32.370> equal<00:06:32.520> equal

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
off equals false so if it's equal equal

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.500 
off equals false so if it's equal equal
to<00:06:33.570> folks<00:06:33.980> we<00:06:34.980> want<00:06:35.220> to<00:06:35.370> leave<00:06:36.060> it<00:06:36.210> in<00:06:36.330> its

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
to folks we want to leave it in its

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.790 
to folks we want to leave it in its
default<00:06:36.840> position<00:06:37.160> so<00:06:38.160> if<00:06:38.220> we<00:06:38.520> go<00:06:38.700> in<00:06:38.970> and<00:06:39.150> we

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
default position so if we go in and we

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.450 
default position so if we go in and we
say<00:06:42.050> insert<00:06:43.050> a<00:06:43.110> new<00:06:43.350> position<00:06:43.560> let's<00:06:44.220> set<00:06:44.430> it

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
say insert a new position let's set it

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.420 
say insert a new position let's set it
back<00:06:44.640> 50<00:06:45.000> fold<00:06:45.180> so<00:06:45.420> default<00:06:46.100> position<00:06:47.100> there

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
back 50 fold so default position there

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.940 
back 50 fold so default position there
we<00:06:47.520> go<00:06:47.640> save<00:06:48.630> it<00:06:48.660> off<00:06:48.870> and<00:06:49.290> this<00:06:49.740> should<00:06:49.890> work

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
we go save it off and this should work

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:58.220 
we go save it off and this should work
perfectly<00:06:53.630> let's<00:06:54.630> run<00:06:55.200> it<00:06:57.020> there<00:06:58.020> you<00:06:58.110> go

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:00.390 
perfect as you can see this variable was

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.750 
perfect as you can see this variable was
enabled<00:07:00.990> in<00:07:01.140> the<00:07:01.200> beginning<00:07:01.590> and<00:07:01.740> if<00:07:02.580> i<00:07:02.700> turn
