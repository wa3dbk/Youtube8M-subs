00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
and it's so easy to subconsciously like

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.930

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
doing but I know for a long time on the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.190 
doing but I know for a long time on the
KTM<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.400> was<00:02:12.550> snapping<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.060> throttle<00:02:13.420> off<00:02:13.540> or<00:02:14.140> I

KTM I was snapping the throttle off or I

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.370 
KTM I was snapping the throttle off or I
was<00:02:14.440> doing<00:02:14.650> what<00:02:14.800> does<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.930> that's<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.230> when

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
was doing what does and that's like when

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.860 
was doing what does and that's like when
the<00:02:17.440> bike<00:02:17.620> starts<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.069> come<00:02:18.190> up<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:19.600> let<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
the bike starts to come up you let the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.630 
the bike starts to come up you let the

got<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> lean<00:02:23.709> with<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.010> bike<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.459> it's<00:02:24.640> it's

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
got a lean with the bike and it's it's

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.630 
got a lean with the bike and it's it's
it<00:02:25.300> feels<00:02:25.480> weird<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.440> for<00:02:27.069> me<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.310> took<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.519> long

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
it feels weird and for me it took a long

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.070 
it feels weird and for me it took a long
time<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.940> get<00:02:28.030> past<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:28.630> mental<00:02:29.049> block

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
time to get past like this mental block

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.009 
time to get past like this mental block
but<00:02:29.530> once<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.769> did<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:30.160> was<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.610> lot<00:02:31.540> easier<00:02:31.600> after

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
but once I did it was a lot easier after

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.809 
but once I did it was a lot easier after
that<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.799> don't<00:02:32.950> ever<00:02:33.100> try<00:02:33.250> clutching<00:02:33.670> up<00:02:33.760> a

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
that just don't ever try clutching up a

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.630 
that just don't ever try clutching up a
concourse<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.540> was<00:02:35.260> not<00:02:35.500> cool<00:02:35.739> it's<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.400> bad

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
