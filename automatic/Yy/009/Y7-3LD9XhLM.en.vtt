00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.130
 hello today we are going to learn how to do this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.529
 folder for daily use 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.380
 we are going to need flexible cardboard and 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.580
 thin cardboard type boxes 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.670
 of gifts that are given in stores 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.800
 departmental as the folder is going to be 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.920
 for letter size sheets we are going to 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.710
 cut out the 46-centimeter cardboard 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.660
 width by 40 centimeters high where 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.340
 We are going to fold a 10 tab 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.170
 centimeters 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.260
 the way we 're seeing it in the 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.419
 picture we are going to divide in half and 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.250
 we mark the fold 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.110
 in the lower part of the eyelash 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.840
 the 10 centimeters we are going to mark the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.610
 half an inch on each side and let's go 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.260
 to join towards the center 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.260
 then we are going to cut it 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.910
 we already have the base of our folder 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.040
 is going to bend it up and the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.400
 let's fold it in half 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.410
 in this way we mark the fold 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.140
 ready to finish the base of our 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.480
 folder we are going to have to mark 4 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.540
 points as follows 2 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.030
 centimeters that will separate them from the edge 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.000
 inward and 8 centimeters that the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.850
 they separate from the corner to the right and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.759
 from the corner down as we see 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.830
 the measurements in the photograph we are going to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.330
 make the holes in those points that 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.610
 we have marked 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.470
 now we are going to line our folder 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.810
 with the decorative paper you want 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.790
 I recommend you use the glue in 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 bar so you apply it to all the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.090
 decorative paper and that all the paper 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.210
 decorative is well pegadito to the cardboard 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.219
 let's put a decorative paper in the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.109
 part inside to cover the color 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.240
 of the cardboard has to be a little more 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.920
 small and we're going to hit it with 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.509
 glue stick I recommend the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.450
 glue stick so you do not 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.659
 crease both the paper 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.509
 and we're going to mark the holes that 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.460
 we had previously made in the carton 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.320
 with your finger we go feeling where they are 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.140
 the holes and we're doing the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.640
 drilling in the four holes by 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.400
 inside and outside to do it 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.350
 larger 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.540
 I also recommend that you be the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.790
 folder with paper contact is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.300
 transparent so that more protection is 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.300
 binder 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.819
 once we finish we will go back to 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.819
 mark the holes 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.019
 and let's put the elastic we're going to 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.540
 go through the first hole outside 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.300
 inward and let's make a knot 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.940
 inside 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.240
 with the other end of the elastic we're going 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.800
 to insert from the outside in and in 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.130
 the third hole inside to 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.890
 outside 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.010
 and in the fourth hole from outside towards 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.040
 inside we are going to pull and adjust the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.020
 elastic that is preferably a 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.160
 little bit loose as we are seeing 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.470
 in the video 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.210
 inside can be straight but the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.300
 outside if they should stay a little longer 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:06.480
 loose once we have the measure 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.569
 we cut the elastic and we make a knot 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.360
 and we finished the way to close it would be 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.519
 in this way and you will not be created 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.629
 the documents will be well subject 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.629
 It fits perfectly a letter size sheet 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.129
 as you have contact paper you can paste 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:26.010
 Sticky notes without any problem 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:29.129
 hit and take off to put your 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.180
 reminders you can make of 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.180
 different sizes 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.580
