is<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.179> a<00:01:54.210> unique<00:01:54.600> feature<00:01:54.869> i<00:01:55.229> think<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:56.369> i

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
is that a unique feature i think so i

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.219 
is that a unique feature i think so i
think<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.999> smallest<00:01:57.420> matte<00:01:57.600> box<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.109> its

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
think it's a smallest matte box of its

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
think it's a smallest matte box of its
type<00:01:58.469> currently<00:01:58.950> nobody<00:01:59.549> else<00:01:59.729> builds

matte<00:02:04.289> box<00:02:04.469> well<00:02:05.189> now<00:02:05.460> we're<00:02:05.670> moving<00:02:05.789> away

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
matte box well now we're moving away

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
matte box well now we're moving away
from<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> MV<00:02:06.630> 28<00:02:07.109> we're<00:02:07.289> moving<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.740> its

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
from the MV 28 we're moving on to its

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.219 
from the MV 28 we're moving on to its
little<00:02:08.130> brother<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> mb<00:02:08.910> 29<00:02:09.390> actually

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
little brother here the mb 29 actually

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
little brother here the mb 29 actually
you'll<00:02:10.350> see<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.800> looks<00:02:11.190> quite<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> bit<00:02:12.240> similar

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you'll see it looks quite a bit similar

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.630 
you'll see it looks quite a bit similar
and<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.650> we're<00:02:13.800> dealing<00:02:14.100> with<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.250> lot<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.460> our

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and what we're dealing with a lot of our

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.100 
and what we're dealing with a lot of our
new<00:02:14.790> matte<00:02:14.940> box<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.420> we're<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
new matte box is we're going with the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.420 
new matte box is we're going with the
modular<00:02:16.500> approach<00:02:16.650> allowing<00:02:17.610> them<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.030> share

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
modular approach allowing them to share

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.399 
modular approach allowing them to share
as<00:02:18.640> many<00:02:18.909> parts<00:02:19.269> as<00:02:19.420> possible<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.079> makes<00:02:20.290> a

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
as many parts as possible that makes a

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.869 
as many parts as possible that makes a
lot<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.560> sense<00:02:20.680> yeah<00:02:21.219> that's<00:02:21.459> good<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
lot of sense yeah that's good for the

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.130 
lot of sense yeah that's good for the
rental<00:02:22.090> houses<00:02:22.269> who<00:02:22.659> want<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.930> see<00:02:23.049> the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
rental houses who want to see the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.539 
rental houses who want to see the
maximum<00:02:23.530> out<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.620> utilization<00:02:24.280> between

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.030 

and<00:03:52.849> the<00:03:53.840> mff<00:03:54.290> one<00:03:54.530> which<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.890> actually

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
and the mff one which is actually

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.470 
and the mff one which is actually
something<00:03:55.400> we<00:03:55.610> came<00:03:55.790> out<00:03:55.940> earlier<00:03:56.270> this<00:03:56.330> year

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
something we came out earlier this year

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.940 
something we came out earlier this year
but<00:03:56.930> it's<00:03:57.110> probably<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.560> first<00:03:57.709> time<00:03:57.920> that

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
but it's probably the first time that

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.860 
but it's probably the first time that
it's<00:03:58.190> been<00:03:58.310> seen<00:03:58.520> here<00:03:58.550> in<00:03:58.700> Amsterdam<00:03:58.910> has

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
it's been seen here in Amsterdam has

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.900 
it's been seen here in Amsterdam has
some<00:04:00.050> unique<00:04:00.170> features<00:04:00.319> in<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:00.890> okay<00:04:01.550> other

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
some unique features in it okay other

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.360 
some unique features in it okay other
mini<00:04:02.390> follow<00:04:02.660> focus<00:04:02.900> units<00:04:03.319> don't<00:04:03.530> have<00:04:03.739> for

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
mini follow focus units don't have for

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.180 
mini follow focus units don't have for
example<00:04:05.080> it's<00:04:06.080> snap-on

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.190 

for<00:04:09.820> applications<00:04:10.330> with<00:04:10.510> lenses<00:04:10.870> having

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
for applications with lenses having

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.750 
for applications with lenses having
differing<00:04:11.530> focus<00:04:11.860> directions<00:04:12.400> ah<00:04:14.700> okay<00:04:15.700> you

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
differing focus directions ah okay you

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.820 
differing focus directions ah okay you
just<00:04:15.880> drop<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.390> out<00:04:16.480> of<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.690> rock<00:04:16.840> right<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:17.709> can

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
just drop it out of a rock right you can

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.259 
just drop it out of a rock right you can
reverse<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.190> drive<00:04:18.370> direction<00:04:18.790> without<00:04:18.970> any

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
reverse the drive direction without any

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.770 
reverse the drive direction without any
extra<00:04:19.570> parts<00:04:19.930> that's<00:04:20.110> cool<00:04:20.380> just<00:04:21.600> one<00:04:22.600> tool

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
extra parts that's cool just one tool

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.320 
extra parts that's cool just one tool
necessary<00:04:23.430> but<00:04:24.430> that's<00:04:24.790> not<00:04:24.880> the<00:04:25.060> only<00:04:25.120> thing

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
necessary but that's not the only thing

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.720 
necessary but that's not the only thing
for<00:04:26.200> lenses<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.740> have<00:04:26.800> no<00:04:27.160> hard<00:04:27.430> stops

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
for lenses that have no hard stops

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.890 
for lenses that have no hard stops
because<00:04:28.060> some<00:04:28.420> lenses<00:04:28.600> rotate<00:04:29.140> endlessly<00:04:30.900> we

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
because some lenses rotate endlessly we

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.780 
because some lenses rotate endlessly we
have<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.200> unique<00:04:32.410> feature<00:04:32.710> where<00:04:33.250> you<00:04:33.520> can

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
have the unique feature where you can

set these two screws push the plunger in

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.260 
set these two screws push the plunger in
and<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.790> have<00:04:36.880> heart<00:04:37.090> stops<00:04:37.330> fascinate<00:04:37.870> yeah

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
about the problem of the moving cameras

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.670 
about the problem of the moving cameras
in<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:07.480> old<00:05:07.630> system<00:05:07.870> that<00:05:08.200> you<00:05:08.260> used<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.530> have

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
in the old system that you used to have

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.050 
in the old system that you used to have
all<00:05:08.770> these<00:05:08.860> cameras<00:05:09.280> well

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.840 

you<00:05:14.060> just<00:05:14.240> lock<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.600> camera<00:05:14.780> in<00:05:15.200> yeah<00:05:15.730> but<00:05:16.730> you

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
you just lock the camera in yeah but you

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.280 
you just lock the camera in yeah but you
know<00:05:16.940> where<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.150> problem<00:05:17.540> was<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:21.110> problem

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
know where the problem was the problem

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.960 
know where the problem was the problem
was<00:05:21.440> always<00:05:21.500> in<00:05:21.770> this<00:05:21.920> part<00:05:22.160> right<00:05:22.220> here<00:05:22.370> these

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
was always in this part right here these

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.340 
was always in this part right here these
parts<00:05:23.300> are<00:05:23.390> not<00:05:23.540> always<00:05:23.720> finished<00:05:24.140> very

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
parts are not always finished very

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.680 
parts are not always finished very
exactly<00:05:24.920> as<00:05:25.280> to<00:05:25.760> where<00:05:25.970> as<00:05:26.180> well<00:05:26.390> for<00:05:26.600> my

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
exactly as to where as well for my

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.020 
exactly as to where as well for my
memory<00:05:28.210> and<00:05:29.890> what<00:05:30.890> we've<00:05:31.070> got<00:05:31.280> here<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.880> a

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
memory and what we've got here is a

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.380 
memory and what we've got here is a
possibility<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:33.200> adjust<00:05:33.740> the<00:05:33.920> play<00:05:34.100> okay<00:05:34.790> so

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
possibility to adjust the play okay so

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.960 
possibility to adjust the play okay so
that<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.350> camera<00:05:36.710> is<00:05:36.740> always<00:05:37.190> rock-solid<00:05:37.640> and

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
that the camera is always rock-solid and

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.700 
that the camera is always rock-solid and
tight<00:05:39.730> outside<00:05:40.730> side<00:05:40.910> yeah<00:05:41.270> and<00:05:41.900> what<00:05:42.530> that

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
tight outside side yeah and what that

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.410 
tight outside side yeah and what that
means<00:05:42.950> is<00:05:43.280> shooting<00:05:43.790> with<00:05:43.910> a<00:05:43.940> broadcast

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
means is shooting with a broadcast

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.210 
means is shooting with a broadcast
camera<00:05:44.810> doesn't<00:05:45.230> necessarily<00:05:45.830> mean<00:05:45.980> you<00:05:46.190> have

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
camera doesn't necessarily mean you have

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.740 
camera doesn't necessarily mean you have
to<00:05:46.490> accept<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:46.850> wiggly<00:05:47.150> camera<00:05:47.540> anymore

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
to accept a wiggly camera anymore

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.140 
to accept a wiggly camera anymore
perfect<00:05:48.410> okay<00:05:49.160> so<00:05:49.220> we<00:05:49.430> saw<00:05:49.550> some<00:05:49.760> really<00:05:50.000> neat

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
perfect okay so we saw some really neat

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.520 
perfect okay so we saw some really neat
stuff<00:05:50.360> with<00:05:50.510> the<00:05:50.570> manual<00:05:50.840> follow<00:05:51.020> focus<00:05:51.200> gin

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
stuff with the manual follow focus gin

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
but for those applications where you

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.390 
but for those applications where you
think<00:06:44.690> the<00:06:44.780> clm<00:06:45.170> three<00:06:45.200> might<00:06:45.650> be<00:06:45.800> too<00:06:46.010> strong

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400
