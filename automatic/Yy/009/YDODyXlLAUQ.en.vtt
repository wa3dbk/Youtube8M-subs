00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.000
 as difficult with the wind and yes it was 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.070
 sometimes difficult to estimate but that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.050
 balls would end up 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.779
 And yes that of course that it extension 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.250
 you could feel that the legs were 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.660
 I think we've played pretty well 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.270
 do not have what i say not the best 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.610
 works with our best game played 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.780
 but we have managed to finish a lot 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.730
 forcing thing that have much chance 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.050
 certainly created in the last in the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.059
 have an extension in the last half hour 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.980
 I really said in half an hour 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 still appear so often that is 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.489
 only compliments to 010 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.840
 yes i just don't think in law 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.940
 creates the same and sufficient opportunities 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.789
 have both the 1st and the 2nd half 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.320
 I have enough opportunity to really score 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.600
 throw totally i must make you be 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 I do n't think many opportunities have been created 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.480
 to that one in exile while one 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.369
 and so in the end we always 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.020
 felt as a team that yes thank you very well 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.770
 yes unfortunately not able to conclude winning 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 but yes I am so proud of that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.280
 I am part of it here and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.869
 you so sour now but I think like us 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.790
 also look back this season that two yes 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.110
 then you forget this 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.810
 that just a shame that your wind just 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.409
 we turned the season so good and yes that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.590
 predominates i think 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.479
 after a few days I think that will prevail 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.710
 i can easily go it can of 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.539
 the netherlands champion the netherlands and belgium 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.729
 to then pick up the cup for a moment at 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.859
 yes an area must say that that 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.450
 that in your fall with us as a group there 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.340
 totally did not live and then it becomes momentary 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.390
 would definitely do one with it 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.649
 would get tough match would 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.289
 of course what to make up for the 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.590
 previous game but grows and others 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.020
 side year you know you finally have to 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.640
 yes i found a new fall in in in 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.289
 the competition cell by which it earns 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.849
 actually there to win but good 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:05.520
 so it is with penalties are also 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:05.520
 and yes yes this is this is experienced and yes 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.890
 TURNED game of the season is 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.380
 immediately leave of four player 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.510

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.770
 match like pill lover who go 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.730
 you already knew where the heart of the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.310
 defence 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.260
 the village and definitely miss it 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.370
 create yes well choose to order then 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.590
 to go further and socially 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.300
 career in particular towards the street 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.670
 Well have expanded and also spoken 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.680
 yes well i respect a decision despite 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.210
 I think that the Caspian is a long way off 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.280
 besides if you maybe million best 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.900
 played seasons yes think certainly two 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.930
 therefrom season 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.700
 I think for myself I really have yes 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.640
 again so much fun in empty back 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.320
 in soccer and yes this also just comes 13 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.570
 had to add by playing football 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.190
 that we want to play and what the girls 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.230
 for each other and that is gonia 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.180
 is really really very nice 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.040
 then you will miss according to the seasons 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.460
 yes i will definitely miss it but i will 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.980
 come in more often with twente and in 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.360
 Twente so I will be there
