00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.419
 today what makes it what you would like to tell you about the division 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.079
 Iron health 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.379
 so that's a hundred or more big problems from the point 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 it's the division m tomorrow 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.449
 by allowing me to decode a lot 2 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.030
 exercise 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.060
 he was a little 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.440
 so for me is very poorly accepted by teachers 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.640
 for example this simple one that we meet 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 so all the martial arts 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.090
 and very well explained by douglas 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 space 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.140
 m totally open to receive 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.360
 everything that comes his way 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.820
 behind the greens 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 animals 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969
 the mountains the sky the moon 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:07.380
 everything that is manifested 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.340
 but are we really this aspect opening there in us 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.060
 and all that presents itself has been welcomed by some openings 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 so the simple fact of m 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.270
 this teaching head of the harding statue has so perfectly bring 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.750
 When someone 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.530
 the woman m everyday i can be just opening to accommodate 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.780
 specifically to small it expresses julien claude 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.330
 the point of closing others 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.750
 becomes the opening that alas there is never this conflict 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.650
 there is this setback especially to welcome presence 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.910
 s 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.280
 it's not daddy that you have to be aware of this openness to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.300
 culture 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.990
 uses the end of exercise of sardine retrocedes natural 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.059
 that is to say when I'm going to do 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.439
 an exercise that counts three 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:24.349
 this opening this simple gesture he will even at this total opening it's 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.349
 still a good reappear 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:34.609
 I see them as the emergence of this fitness space this exercise 3m 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.769
 dimensions m 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.110
 now very simple gesture to put me in my mentions deep and everything 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 becomes one as I want 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.709
 all the exercises made to speak 2 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:56.849
 all this but in a way that was really very poorly explained and I 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.149
 had never followed and thanks to all place all the exercises nearly 900 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:04.939
 seats 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:05.740
 p 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.159
 to really be good to regain his deep state 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.499
 a single gesture 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.499
 the Swiss 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:19.149
 but everyday life that can not always make his opening gestures 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:22.339
 who does not close his sources 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:26.189
 at 7 11 in the subway for theft of documents about life and how do you do 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.380
 to stay confident in the fact of opening 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.919
 the study that the pole 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.209
 to do 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.120
 6 there is nothing because I can not see myself 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.489
 Russian is so 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.489
 every time I turn 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.739
 then on one side 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.929
 a new p 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:48.759
 the landscape appears 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.839
 if I'm in the subway 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.449
 I am totally open to welcome these villages squatting 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.249
 the Asian child 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:57.240
 5 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.850
 it is the animal that comes before me a little high practice becomes a 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.910
 daily practice no doubt put 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.599
 in any gesture 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.339
 and that's paying attention to what you would not say I'm here 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.830
 it's difficult now 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.260
 but be careful so that we are really really evolving 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.479
 in fact its surface contact and m 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.539
 - monitoring of children maintain what are the obstacles that can cause 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.930
 of concern for this attention 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.950
 the other package was it's mans for them 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.719
 constantly doing 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.289
 we make mistakes the little one in me 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.499
 we always take the place 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:39.069
 and the recipe to become confident of this appearance 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.270
 and to put it back is that I'm really in its right place 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.729
 very easy 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.800
 but there must be a reminder 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.820
 that's why I'm here to redo for the third time this internship 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:55.949
 one week 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.270
 he puts me back into practice 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.569
 and every time it's not 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.049
 a second a third internship is always something that 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.740
 allows 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.819
 with more evidence therefore to access 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.199
 because we are really 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.669
 it is a slaughter that has known since an influx of the farm 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.129
 such a formula 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.719
 what do you look like characters in memory what did you 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.310
 hit the chili while waiting for the man to make more sense to kill 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:26.580
 teachers 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.689
 at the man knows 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.689
 and especially humor 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.779
 the very hushed means of the city 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.819
 it's very simple very concrete 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.050
 to bring us back 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.599
 we are really 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.059
 and since then I met douglas 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:47.969
 all the books I read 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.189
 all the little cons 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:54.580
 and varied the game in first period multiple forms 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.169
 not all powers 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.089
 but thanks to ice 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.089
 there was 1 an understanding 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.129
 hesitant 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.129
 of all the varied exercises 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:12.189
 and so alas he really helped me a simple way with a lot 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.189
 of humor art to clarify 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.490
 and promos entangled in the technique 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.270
 to actually get to the point I mostly remembered his humor 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.969
 and with very practical it is really 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.729
 multiple times a day it's eating 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.629
 sale of francfort fra d'oran 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.520
 tonight 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.729
 while walking 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.830
 while driving his car 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.589
 the practice is possible so much every aspect of our life 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.800
 so we have no more excuses to practice everything depends on us 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.369
