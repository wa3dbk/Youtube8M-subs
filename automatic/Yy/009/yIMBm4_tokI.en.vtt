00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.990
 a few months ago, we had already shown how to partner with help 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.859
 the winner Leitl AK method unlocks 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.489
 in this video we want to show you now the possibilities for that 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.209
 unlock 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.550
 the easy committee and speed bike path was 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.490
 With the help of a leading Kunis, iPhone's processors simply clean up 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.429
 were unlocked quickly 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.300
 so that her grief Kumi later press the contact between the separated 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.329
 can produce 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.129
 They must cover the area around the bridges with a festive medium 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.350
 soldiers 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.560
 in the ab and Experiment Tibet kernel they are in three groups 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.390
 Isolate the contact area around the separated press with a teaser 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 to brush 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.030
 to enable the contact between rubber boat bridge must be one 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.570
 rectangular hole to be cut carefully around the bridges 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.590
 Position the sorrow rubber over the n3 press 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.600
 To fix the wires use extra tape 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.860
 clicked on the combo and the processor they operated under any circumstances 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 the processor cores 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.430
 the contact pressure of the cooler presses the Leitz Grobian on the press and 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 This will allow the Altena Stalking comes kind 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.710
 for owners of a nuclear war Primiz tiebreak core, there are still the ones 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.710
 Trusted method to unlock the CPU 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.369
 First, remove the CPU from the sloot 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.730
 Put the wire in the outer pains and turn it over 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.019
 a loop 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.819
 gently twist the tweezers to some extent to loosen this loop 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.819
 fix 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.659
 The finished loop now bring them over these two penis 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.950
 cut them out with a nail scissors because then stepped on one 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:33.290
 Millimeter way we lie with a pair of tweezers the wire to the middle of the two 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.909
 team 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.120
 The wraps step method is very simple and cheap but really requires one 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.239
 very steady hand to achieve a working result
