00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.090 

okay<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:18.690> go<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> check<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
okay so if you go and check here to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.310 
okay so if you go and check here to
September<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> green<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.180 
all the predictions and I'm a link this
down<00:01:33.630> below<00:01:33.870> if<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.050> remember<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.830> I<00:01:34.920> don't

down below if I remember but if I don't

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.680 
down below if I remember but if I don't
then<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.430> slay<00:01:35.880> me<00:01:36.060> please<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.660> just

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
then don't slay me please I'm just

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.890 
then don't slay me please I'm just
little<00:01:37.080> kid<00:01:37.260> but<00:01:38.030> October<00:01:39.030> it's<00:01:39.300> just<00:01:39.510> not<00:01:39.570> all

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
little kid but October it's just not all

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.380 
little kid but October it's just not all
the<00:01:39.990> stuff<00:01:40.050> they<00:01:40.320> predicted<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.830> well<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
the stuff they predicted as well and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.000 
the stuff they predicted as well and
November<00:01:42.390> except<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.930> December<00:01:43.410> but<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
November except to December but when we

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.820 
November except to December but when we
get<00:01:44.160> closer<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:45.510> actually<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.230> team<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
get closer to when actually the team of

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.110 
get closer to when actually the team of
the<00:01:46.890> season<00:01:47.190> is<00:01:47.280> released<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.730> think<00:01:47.910> see<00:01:48.060> in

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
the season is released I think see in

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.180 
the season is released I think see in
January<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.200> did<00:01:49.410> predicts<00:01:49.770> even<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
January if they did predicts even the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.770 
January if they did predicts even the
announcement<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.180> team<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> years

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
announcement of the team of the years

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.870 
announcement of the team of the years
and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.770> go<00:01:52.890> down<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.160> februari<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and then we go down to februari and

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.969 
and then we go down to februari and
that's<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.119> transfers<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.530> think<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.890> only

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that's a transfers and I think the only

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.660 
that's a transfers and I think the only
thing<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.310> didn't<00:01:56.640> predict<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.510> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
thing they didn't predict it is a the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.190 
thing they didn't predict it is a the
price<00:01:59.670> update<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.240> having<00:02:00.479> anyone<00:02:00.750> predicted

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
price update and having anyone predicted

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.749 
price update and having anyone predicted
them<00:02:01.410> or<00:02:01.800> basically<00:02:02.160> what<00:02:02.400> we're<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.700> do

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
them or basically what we're going to do

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.670 
them or basically what we're going to do
now<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:02.970> checking<00:02:03.300> May<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.630> March<00:02:04.080> is<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.470> st.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
now is checking May so March is the st.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.050 
now is checking May so March is the st.
Patrick's<00:02:05.130> which<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.550> main<00:02:05.580> event<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
Patrick's which was the main event and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
Patrick's which was the main event and
march<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.479> then<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.050> mesa<00:02:07.440> may<00:02:07.800> they

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
march and then we go to mesa may they

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.650 
march and then we go to mesa may they
are<00:02:08.340> red<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:08.910> they<00:02:09.030> haven't<00:02:09.240> come<00:02:09.390> true

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660

that<00:02:32.160> team<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.489> season<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.750> goes<00:02:34.019> on

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
that team of the season and this goes on

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.400 
that team of the season and this goes on
for<00:02:34.440> six<00:02:35.010> weeks<00:02:35.459> at<00:02:35.760> every<00:02:36.269> Wednesday<00:02:36.750> just

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
for six weeks at every Wednesday just

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.780 
for six weeks at every Wednesday just
like<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> team<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.980> week<00:02:38.070> their<00:02:38.370> release<00:02:38.610> in

like a team of the week their release in

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.850 
like a team of the week their release in
New<00:02:39.060> tumulus<00:02:39.360> season<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.739> may

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
New tumulus season so I think they may

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.380 
New tumulus season so I think they may
release<00:02:41.040> both<00:02:41.370> or<00:02:41.640> they<00:02:41.880> may<00:02:42.000> release<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
release both or they may release the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.759 
release both or they may release the
team<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.690> season<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.500> that's<00:02:43.650> gonna

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
team of the season and that's gonna

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.400 
team of the season and that's gonna
consist<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.250> BPL<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.300> Liga<00:02:45.540> BBVA<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:46.230> League

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
consist of BPL the Liga BBVA the League

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.699 
consist of BPL the Liga BBVA the League
