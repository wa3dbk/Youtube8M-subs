the magic seka tears because they

percent or chance of by fifteen percent

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.219 
percent or chance of by fifteen percent
and<00:06:06.979> that<00:06:07.979> they<00:06:08.490> they<00:06:09.270> can<00:06:09.419> also<00:06:09.540> be<00:06:09.690> used<00:06:09.810> to

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
and that they they can also be used to

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.550 
and that they they can also be used to
prune<00:06:10.830> your<00:06:11.010> trees<00:06:11.630> prune<00:06:12.630> your<00:06:12.780> bushes<00:06:13.260> I

mean<00:06:14.490> they're<00:06:14.970> great<00:06:15.240> it's<00:06:15.810> a<00:06:15.870> lifesaver

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
mean they're great it's a lifesaver

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.060 
mean they're great it's a lifesaver
another<00:06:17.550> thing<00:06:17.760> i<00:06:17.880> do<00:06:17.940> recommend<00:06:18.330> is<00:06:18.930> that

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
another thing i do recommend is that

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.710 
another thing i do recommend is that
player<00:06:20.070> owned<00:06:20.310> house<00:06:20.580> getting<00:06:21.030> that<00:06:21.180> teleport

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
player owned house getting that teleport

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.630 
player owned house getting that teleport
because<00:06:21.990> really<00:06:22.229> that<00:06:22.320> will<00:06:22.710> be<00:06:23.460> the

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
because really that will be the

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.350 
because really that will be the
make-or-break<00:06:23.940> point<00:06:24.180> of<00:06:24.860> whether<00:06:25.860> or<00:06:26.190> not

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
make-or-break point of whether or not

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.260 
make-or-break point of whether or not
you<00:06:27.360> can<00:06:27.979> maximize<00:06:28.979> XP<00:06:29.910> or<00:06:30.500> maximize<00:06:31.500> profit

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
you can maximize XP or maximize profit

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.270 
you can maximize XP or maximize profit
and<00:06:33.320> yeah<00:06:34.320> that<00:06:34.470> looks<00:06:34.620> like<00:06:34.740> it's<00:06:34.919> about<00:06:35.010> it

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
and yeah that looks like it's about it

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.029 
and yeah that looks like it's about it
for<00:06:35.460> today<00:06:35.580> i<00:06:35.930> will<00:06:36.930> be<00:06:36.960> doing<00:06:37.320> another<00:06:37.650> guide
