based on Android 5.0 lollipop onto your
Samsung<00:00:22.500> Galaxy<00:00:22.529> Note<00:00:23.039> 3<00:00:23.630> n9<00:00:24.630> double<00:00:25.050> 0<00:00:25.380> 5<00:00:25.680> so

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 n9 double 0 5 so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.380 
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 n9 double 0 5 so
this<00:00:26.849> will<00:00:26.910> only<00:00:27.300> work<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:29.099> n9<00:00:29.490> double<00:00:29.880> 0<00:00:30.090> 5

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
this will only work on the n9 double 0 5

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.310 
this will only work on the n9 double 0 5
and<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.929> will<00:00:31.230> not<00:00:31.619> work<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.700> n900<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:34.170> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and it will not work on the n900 that is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.630 
and it will not work on the n900 that is
the<00:00:34.469> Exynos<00:00:34.890> variant

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the Exynos variant

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.920 
the Exynos variant
so<00:00:36.920> let's<00:00:37.920> first<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> look<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> XDA

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
so let's first have a look at the XDA

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.430 
so let's first have a look at the XDA
thread<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.579> XDA<00:00:42.059> thread<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> in

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
thread so this is the XDA thread and in

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.619 
thread so this is the XDA thread and in
order<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> install<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.640> ROM<00:00:44.700> first<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.390> need

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
order to install this ROM first you need

and now let me show you guys how to
install<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:42.920> first<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.369> need<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.810> turn<00:01:45.810> off

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
install it so first you need to turn off

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.190 
install it so first you need to turn off
your<00:01:46.229> device<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.890> hold<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.579> volume<00:01:48.000> power<00:01:48.840> and

your device and hold up volume power and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
your device and hold up volume power and
home<00:01:49.680> at<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.460> same<00:01:50.670> time<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.720> around<00:01:52.320> 5<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.509> 10

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
home at the same time for around 5 or 10

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.740 
home at the same time for around 5 or 10
seconds<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.740> once<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.450> see

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
seconds so once you do that you will see

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.819 
seconds so once you do that you will see
the<00:01:58.259> message<00:01:58.409> saying<00:01:58.979> recover<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.880> booting

the message saying recover it booting

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.969 
the message saying recover it booting
so<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.640> TWRP<00:02:03.479> recovery<00:02:03.979> installed

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so if you have TWRP recovery installed

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.830 
so if you have TWRP recovery installed
on<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.340> device<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.149> booted<00:02:06.479> into
