machine you're gonna go in here take a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
machine you're gonna go in here take a
left<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.860> I'll<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.159> right<00:01:50.340> there

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.899 
now I would not use your golden key
right<00:01:53.189> off<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> bat<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
right off the bat because it the

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.660 
right off the bat because it the
contents<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.180> chest<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.869> tie<00:01:58.110> to

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
contents in this chest actually tie to

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.859 
contents in this chest actually tie to
what<00:01:59.670> your<00:01:59.939> level<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.479> right<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:00.719> I'm<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
what your level is so right now I'm a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.959 
what your level is so right now I'm a
level<00:02:01.140> 12<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.280> already<00:02:02.369> begun<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.850> now

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
level 12 so if I already begun right now

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.139 
level 12 so if I already begun right now
I<00:02:03.000> probably<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.540> 11<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:04.049> level<00:02:04.439> 12<00:02:04.619> gun<00:02:04.909> but<00:02:05.909> if

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
I probably like 11 a level 12 gun but if

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.520 
I probably like 11 a level 12 gun but if
you<00:02:06.270> wait<00:02:06.450> till<00:02:06.630> you're<00:02:06.719> level<00:02:06.930> 50<00:02:07.229> then

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
you wait till you're level 50 then

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
you wait till you're level 50 then
you're<00:02:07.649> more<00:02:07.770> likely<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.610> level<00:02:09.360> 50<00:02:09.629> gun

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you're more likely to get a level 50 gun

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.510 
you're more likely to get a level 50 gun
and<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> badass<00:02:10.560> gun<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
and get a badass gun because as the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.840 
and get a badass gun because as the
ranks<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.790> are

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
ranks you are

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.580 
ranks you are
determines<00:02:13.450> what<00:02:13.720> levels<00:02:14.110> these<00:02:14.230> guns<00:02:14.500> are

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
determines what levels these guns are

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.560 
determines what levels these guns are
gonna<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.830> in<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.010> chest<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.180> know<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.450> have
