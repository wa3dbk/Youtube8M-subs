00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.670
 the trainer was of two seasons 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.710
 must be this ex club 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.969
 During rush hour 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.209
 Christians 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.209
 terrible 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.389
 there were doubts about it 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.399
 2 0 2 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 I think it's a strong competition 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.350
 the stentor 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.000
 The first is the combination of Antwerp has also seen in the second half 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.330
 a stream from both sides was a distance shot from spencer 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160
 the competition 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 the 86th minute 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.760
 a few minutes' rest, roundabout politicians take the full booty and 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.670
 antwerp back to the last minutes 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.320
 possibly the ball does not get the new team from the penalty area 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.460
 or duty elite 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 via equalizer 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.649
 this is a 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:37.970
 the police have the name on 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.110
 I'll do you here 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.730
 a body foot goal headed and in the turn everyone missed the term 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.850
 yeah i didn't have to go for a bulging jan fatigue can't be any different 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.970
 that certain guys don't come in 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 the man is sin because then there is only one 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.940
 and the northerly inside then I still count a bit less, also a bit 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.060
 as a dutchman may have got me an explosion 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.980
 the computers of the competition 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.180
 tomorrow if you search 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.249
 the end of the match that you aim a quarter 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.719
 then you must have that head start when the tour a polder my corpse mentality 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.769
 to be 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.929
 in 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:17.129
 it is a 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.919
 truncated level 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.029
 it happened time and again just like the man's tartar he must be the bad one 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:27.049
 played the game and with the three points to guess 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.370
 that can kill a brother and now there is clearly no more than ever
