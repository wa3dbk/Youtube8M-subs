00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.779
 right at this moment I am 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.580
 linking up acapulco warrior with me 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.750
 fellow rolando aguilar who is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.700
 found in the area and has 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.830
 details of this very violent eviction 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.850
 of the protesters good night 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.420
 Hello good night 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.890
 approximately 7:30 at night 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.630
 the federal police began to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.830
 replicate the people who were 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.269
 blocking the boulevard of the nations to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.669
 the height of what are the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.890
 facilities of the red cross but a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.140
 shortly before this a group of teachers 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.540
 he got on one of the buses in the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 that were being transported and tried 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 riot police attack 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.239
 convert the bus for you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.879
 they removed the place and also 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.910
 they started throwing stones this 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.620
 caused a first confrontation where 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 finally the teachers were 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.199
 folded back and they stepped aside 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 which is the boulevard so far 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.560
 first report indicates that there are nine 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.250
 people lost because of these events 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:09.670
 and 20 teachers detained the attention 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.650
 continuous is very strong what is 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.080
 happening the teachers are deciding 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.000
 what is he going to do but they 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.160
 were the ones who connected in a moment 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.860
 aggression determined after 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.260
 stay almost three hours in front of 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.360
 riot police where those who 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.430
 they continued to attack verbally 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.920
 to be taken away and let them get there 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.200
 to the airport and they could take the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.410
 situations that finally do not 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.930
 introduced and put the reason for this this 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.630
 is the fact that they are asking 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.180
 demanding that federal authorities 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.479
 were going to talk with them this and 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.950
 had happened on February 10 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.400
 where the secretary of government arrived 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.530
 federal enrique miranda talked to them 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.690
 they installed a dialogue table where 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.940
 people from the secretariat of 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.820
 farm and also the secretariat of 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.390
 public education apparently the great 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 problem is right there 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.610
 two hundred squares that are fighting us 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.490
 teachers and in none of those places 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.290
 is assigned a workplace not 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.319
 is assigned to any school to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.260
 no office and agree to discuss in 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.599
 charging those 1,400 people 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.129
 resounding truly unfortunate what 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.620
 what new teachers have done 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.480
 account and we are seeing images of the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.670
 car leasing and not 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.890
 However, what could have happened 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.049
 the federal police because it was very 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.239
 tolerant I say in other countries and has 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.709
 wars a truck and throws them if the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.470
 situation would have been totally 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.150
 different were tolerant and finally 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.849
 this operation was successful for 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.409
 evict teachers in a state in 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.239
 where the federal police has to go 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.760
 because there is no government the governor 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.459
 ortega I think that there is no is not or 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.900
 he went 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.030
 Unfortunately, the situation is 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.859
 very serious because of all those 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.540
 manifestations that are presented 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.150
 including teachers from very 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.560
 early when they arrived and they knew that 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.530
 I had canceled the table 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.629
 negotiation threatened that they would go 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.849
 to the international tennis tournament that in 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.799
 these moments that he carries out in this 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.440
 area they told me they were going to block 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.310
 totally the accesses in fact a group 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.590
 of teachers came to try 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.900
 but they were repelled by a group of 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.459
 transporters in the area and he had 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.230
 there is a confrontation between her 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.520
 then that also the people 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.230
 talking about acapulco is up to 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.599
 copete of these gentlemen and when there is a 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.520
 opportunity to earn a few pesos what 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.250
 they are doing is boycotting it for their 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.110
 personal interests for its 1,400 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.030
 places due to bad negotiations for a 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.830
 governor who does not have pants and 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.050
 thank goodness that the federal police a day 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.060
 today is a successful operation and there 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.730
 we are seeing no one we are seeing 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.709
 tourists who in one way or another 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.540
 they have to get to take their planes 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.640
 it is unfortunate to see the spectacle of 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.260
 these gentlemen and it's good that the police 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.600
 federal could have a successful operation 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.620
 to send them to the devil to be able 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.720
 Retrieve the order at the airport 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.409
 we hope that satisfaction says 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.409
 controlled 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.930
