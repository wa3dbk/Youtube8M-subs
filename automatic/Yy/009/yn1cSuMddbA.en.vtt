00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.810
 the car world champion the polo r vrc 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.550
 the car with which sebastian ogier won the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.679
 World Rally Championship in 2013 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.599
 externally the machine returns again 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.910
 standard but the interiors have been removed 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.220
 up to the bare sheet the dashboard is 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.750
 an imitation but the pilot to control 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.119
 of all the functions in the least space 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 possible on the right of the steering wheel le 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.070
 less used features like high beam 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930
 the radio connection with the team la 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.699
 left side and the most important one is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 here in fact we find the connections for 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 the mappings can load different 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.050
 settings for various types of funds 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.450
 roads such as muddy wet dry 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.430
 here instead we find the tachometer a 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.420
 say the possibility of setting the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 engine starts between 5,000 and 7,500 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.719
 above we have two more commands 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.910
 important 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 this is the wiper and we use it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.410
 very often to always have a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 windshield cleaned quickly but the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.879
 command more willingly use is this 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.879
 red button is the star command 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.800
 the process depp the volkswagen tester 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.300
 shows us the cockpit leads us to make a 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.580
 around the roar of the engine e 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.710
 acceleration are impressive 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 given that today the road surface is dry 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.930
 we can exploit the full power of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.930
 engine 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.250
 the body is reinforced with one 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.830
 safety cage to protect 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.720
 pilot and co-pilot in the event of an accident a 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.220
 right side of the steering wheel we find one 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.300
 the gear lever a little bigger is the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.400
 handbrake 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.980
 four-cylinder 1.6-liter turbo 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.900
 compressor for the nearly 300 horses 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.190
 pedal board is unchanged but the clutch does not 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.190
 it must be pressed to change gear 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.939
 here we can accelerate again here on the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.070
 display or even a red light my 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.329
 gear shift warning light when it comes on 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.810
 it means that it must engage the gear 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.810
 next one 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.820
 the driver the main data directly 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.590
 on the display 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.750
 so here are two pages one 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.489
 contains more information such as 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.800
 speed gear engaged 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.510
 the number of engine revolutions but also the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.430
 water temperature the pressure 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.500
 oil and battery voltage 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.130
 this is the control panel from mine 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.200
 part and that competes with the rider on the side 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.879
 the driver sits on the co pilot who has the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.980
 his own display reads to you 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.959
 mainly speed and route 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.269
 route giving driving directions 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.250
 in special tests every little one 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.380
 error can cost you precious seconds 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.040
 moreover the co-pilot sees all the values 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.599
 important for car operation 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.640
 the only thing we fight with is 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.560
 obviously the heat in the car 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.360
 the car is not absolutely isolated and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.579
 all the heat coming from the tunnel 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.959
 central is radiated inside 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:59.110
 because here we have a plant of 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.510
 exhaust and therefore extremely hot 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.820
 like in a black box of an airplane the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.860
 on-board computer in the r vrc pole 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.960
 records all the data so that 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.150
 engineers after every test can 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.770
 further develop the car for 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.760
 the rest of the cockpit is reduced 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.500
 essentials 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.600
 the regulation prescribes a maximum weight 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.520
 of 1,200 kg 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.010
 there is not much room left to add 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.660
 other pieces but still the place 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.340
 ideal job for the pilots of the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.340
 world championship of robbery
