00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
closet this right here I guess is your

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.949 
closet this right here I guess is your
generator<00:02:27.920> I'm<00:02:28.820> not<00:02:29.060> sure<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.450> tells<00:02:29.690> you<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
generator I'm not sure it tells you the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.810 
generator I'm not sure it tells you the
time<00:02:30.200> how<00:02:30.470> much<00:02:30.650> power<00:02:30.950> amperage<00:02:31.930> all<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
time how much power amperage all that

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.330 
time how much power amperage all that
but<00:02:34.820> if<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.060> wanted<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.810> pull<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.110> up

I'm trying on that the tires are fair

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.040 
I'm trying on that the tires are fair
the<00:04:21.489> brakes<00:04:21.760> same<00:04:22.330> thing<00:04:22.570> with<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:22.810> brakes

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
the brakes same thing with the brakes

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.670 
the brakes same thing with the brakes
they're<00:04:23.350> fair<00:04:23.620> -<00:04:27.360> I<00:04:28.360> don't<00:04:28.930> have<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.200> keys<00:04:29.440> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
they're fair - I don't have the keys the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.160 
they're fair - I don't have the keys the
openness<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.610> can't<00:04:31.090> open<00:04:31.390> too<00:04:31.540> much<00:04:31.780> but

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.140 
and for the lights and right up there
also<00:06:03.970> it<00:06:04.300> could<00:06:04.420> use<00:06:04.630> one<00:06:04.840> as<00:06:04.990> well<00:06:05.970> I'm<00:06:06.970> not

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
also it could use one as well I'm not

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.970 
also it could use one as well I'm not
gonna<00:06:07.330> go<00:06:07.510> up<00:06:07.540> on<00:06:07.840> the<00:06:07.990> top<00:06:08.170> right<00:06:08.410> now<00:06:08.620> because

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
gonna go up on the top right now because

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.030 
gonna go up on the top right now because
it's<00:06:09.310> starting<00:06:09.670> to<00:06:09.880> rain<00:06:09.970> bad<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:11.620> just

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
it's starting to rain bad and I just

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.790 
it's starting to rain bad and I just
don't<00:06:12.280> really<00:06:12.550> want<00:06:12.670> to<00:06:12.850> go<00:06:12.910> on<00:06:12.970> top<00:06:13.800> there's

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
don't really want to go on top there's

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.590 
don't really want to go on top there's
uh<00:06:14.980> I<00:06:17.040> guess<00:06:18.040> that's<00:06:18.280> basically<00:06:18.640> about<00:06:18.790> it<00:06:19.120> for

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
uh I guess that's basically about it for

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.740 
uh I guess that's basically about it for
