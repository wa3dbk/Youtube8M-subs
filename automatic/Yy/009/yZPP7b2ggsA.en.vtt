variation on the fall camo like there's
all<00:01:24.649> these<00:01:24.770> sort<00:01:25.039> of<00:01:25.069> red<00:01:25.310> white<00:01:25.579> black<00:01:25.880> yellow

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:26.209 
all these sort of red white black yellow

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.510 
all these sort of red white black yellow
orange<00:01:26.689> splotches<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:27.799> kind<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> like<00:01:28.279> fall

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
orange splotches it's kind of like fall

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.609

but<00:01:28.759> way<00:01:28.909> more<00:01:29.119> vibrant<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.719> a<00:01:29.840> lot<00:01:29.990> cooler<00:01:30.259> I

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
but way more vibrant and a lot cooler I

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.289 
but way more vibrant and a lot cooler I
think<00:01:31.310> that'd<00:01:31.399> be<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.549> really<00:01:31.789> cool<00:01:31.909> camera<00:01:32.149> to

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
think that'd be a really cool camera to

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.699 
think that'd be a really cool camera to
put<00:01:32.450> in<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.600> game<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:32.899> know<00:01:33.020> like<00:01:33.229> it's

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
there's a lot of problems with the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.999 
there's a lot of problems with the
default<00:01:35.959> camos<00:01:36.319> is<00:01:36.469> that<00:01:36.619> they're<00:01:36.770> sort<00:01:36.950> of

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
default camos is that they're sort of

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.980 
default camos is that they're sort of
just<00:01:37.069> bland<00:01:37.459> and<00:01:37.670> not<00:01:37.729> too<00:01:37.999> not<00:01:38.389> too<00:01:38.569> nice<00:01:38.719> but

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
just bland and not too not too nice but

believe<00:02:42.980> that's<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> Maverick<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.940> is

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
believe that's the Maverick that is

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.820 
believe that's the Maverick that is
showing<00:02:44.239> from<00:02:44.510> ghost<00:02:45.049> is<00:02:45.470> probably<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
showing from ghost is probably the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.460

of racing flag camo this is actually one
of<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.549> know<00:04:10.579> it's<00:04:10.879> a<00:04:10.970> calling<00:04:11.269> card<00:04:11.299> from

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569

of the I know it's a calling card from
black<00:04:11.720> ops<00:04:11.750> 2<00:04:12.079> I<00:04:12.290> believe<00:04:12.620> it's<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.099> octane

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
black ops 2 I believe it's the octane

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.129 
black ops 2 I believe it's the octane
calling<00:04:14.150> card<00:04:14.359> you<00:04:14.510> know<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.720> camo<00:04:14.989> is

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
calling card you know the camo is

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.240 
calling card you know the camo is
actually<00:04:15.410> different<00:04:15.530> but<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.799> calling<00:04:16.070> card

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
actually different but the calling card

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.890 
actually different but the calling card
is<00:04:16.489> looks<00:04:17.120> like<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.389> where<00:04:17.599> it's<00:04:17.720> kind<00:04:17.870> of

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
is looks like this where it's kind of

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.779 
is looks like this where it's kind of
sort<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.229> waving<00:04:18.530> flag<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.609> actually

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
sort of the waving flag so it's actually

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:20.860 
sort of the waving flag so it's actually
that's<00:04:20.150> actually<00:04:20.359> really<00:04:20.510> cool<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.840> know
