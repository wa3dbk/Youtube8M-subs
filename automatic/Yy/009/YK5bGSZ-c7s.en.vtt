00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.349
 swim in the fish first which is the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.540
 swim bladder swim bladder is 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.269
 a flotation organ that many possess 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.220
 bone fish it is a bag of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.350
 flexible walls filled with gas and it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.990
 find in the heat ma just under the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.939
 spine the bone fish have 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.029
 a specific weight slightly by 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.680
 above the water the swim bladder 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.570
 controls the neutral buoyancy of the fish 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.079
 in the water without the need for a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.149
 muscular effort symptoms the fish does not 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.610
 he has control of his body problems of 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.070
 floating nothing on the side or back

 Etc. Swelling in the belly not

 can defecate stool with no bubbles 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.469
 want to eat causes bad nutrition 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.270
 when we feed the fish only with 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.940
 dry food like pellets and 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 flakes this dry food when falling to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.350
 water will begin to absorb water and will be 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.239
 full of air then the fish 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.090
 they begin to eat them and they inflate in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.850
 fish belly kidney problem when 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.950
 have problems removing liquids 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.780
 fluids and secretions 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.369
 infections by viruses and bacteria this 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.890
 can cause kidney failure and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.750
 end in dropsy solution will place 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.520
 the fish in another aquarium with a bit of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 water that only covers the fish so that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.869
 can swim well and thus avoid the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.000
 stress there will be left to the fish without eating 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.979
 for three days and the fourth day 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.469
 will be fed with cooked peas and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.689
 without a shell this is done so that the fish 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.609
 evacuate all fecal matter trapped in 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.100
 your intestines and the trapped gases 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.159
 as a preventive you medicate with 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.409
 fragile dynasol meter a tablet of 250 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.390
 milligrams per 20 liters of water at 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.979
 fourth day we made a change 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.719
 partial water of the aquarium and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.759
 we raise the water level so that the 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.489
 fish gets used to maneuvering with more 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.469
 ease if the fish is very swollen and 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.450
 do not want to eat it will be necessary to apply 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.030
 a dose of olive oil or oil 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.280
 vegetable with a syringe without needles 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.319
 Apply 2 to 3 drops with a lot 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.689
 Be careful that it does not fall on your eyes or 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.239
 in the gills to avoid relapses 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.129
 soak the food for 2 to 3 minutes with 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.360
 aquarium water before giving it to 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.560
 fishes 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.560
