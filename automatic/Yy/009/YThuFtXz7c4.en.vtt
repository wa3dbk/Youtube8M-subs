a<00:02:34.690> bit<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.930> an<00:02:35.020> issue<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.470> noisy<00:02:35.890> engine

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
a bit of an issue of this noisy engine

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.570 
a bit of an issue of this noisy engine
which<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.140> mean<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.530> always<00:02:38.650> been<00:02:38.739> noisy<00:02:39.340> but

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
which I mean it's always been noisy but

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.610 
which I mean it's always been noisy but
it<00:02:39.670> got<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.850> little<00:02:40.030> bit<00:02:40.239> noisier<00:02:40.720> when<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.350> was

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
it got a little bit noisier when I was

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.470 
it got a little bit noisier when I was
abroad<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.760> took<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> freely

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
abroad on it and so I took it to freely

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.800 
abroad on it and so I took it to freely
a<00:02:46.600> place<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:48.660> North<00:02:49.660> London

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
a place in North London

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.510 
a place in North London
and<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:51.440> said<00:02:51.620> yeah<00:02:51.770> yeah<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.069> clam<00:02:52.280> chain

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
and I said yeah yeah it's clam chain

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.460 
and I said yeah yeah it's clam chain
tensioners<00:02:53.120> fine<00:02:53.480> all<00:02:53.720> right<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.840> they<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.319> I

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
tensioners fine all right so they that I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.840 
tensioners fine all right so they that I
think<00:02:57.830> they've<00:02:57.950> replaced<00:02:58.220> them<00:02:58.580> or<00:02:58.730> they

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
think they've replaced them or they

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.309 
think they've replaced them or they
tightened<00:02:59.330> them<00:02:59.420> up<00:02:59.540> they're<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.780> didn't

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
tightened them up they're just didn't

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:40.289 
tightened them up they're just didn't
they<00:03:00.380> did<00:03:00.530> something<00:03:00.709> anyway<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.340> didn't<00:03:01.520> work

have<00:04:43.479> on<00:04:43.780> the<00:04:44.050> drifter<00:04:45.330> but<00:04:46.330> I'm<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.509> little

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
have on the drifter but I'm a little

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.700 
have on the drifter but I'm a little
confused<00:04:47.110> about<00:04:47.349> this<00:04:47.560> whole<00:04:47.800> head<00:04:48.039> nodding

then<00:04:50.710> there's<00:04:51.039> obviously<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.520> distance<00:04:52.120> out<00:04:52.330> of

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
then there's obviously a distance out of

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.080 
then there's obviously a distance out of
London<00:04:52.870> where<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.110> kicks<00:04:53.349> in<00:04:53.759> and<00:04:54.759> I<00:04:54.880> wonder

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
London where it kicks in and I wonder

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.999 
London where it kicks in and I wonder
what<00:04:55.180> it<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:55.330> like<00:04:55.599> for<00:04:55.660> you<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.990> draw<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.470> circle

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
what it is like for you to draw a circle

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.670 
what it is like for you to draw a circle
around<00:04:57.039> London<00:04:57.789> it's<00:04:58.240> at<00:04:58.389> the<00:04:58.479> end<00:04:58.509> 25<00:04:59.050> it's
