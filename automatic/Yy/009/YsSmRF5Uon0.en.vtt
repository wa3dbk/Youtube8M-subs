00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
comes down out of the mountains and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
comes down out of the mountains and
flows<00:01:15.900> right<00:01:16.140> through<00:01:16.200> here<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.710> creates<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
flows right through here and creates the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
it's actively an industrial center and

the people who live here a lot of them
are<00:03:30.630> relatives<00:03:31.630> of<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.169> original<00:03:32.590> five

founding<00:03:33.220> families<00:03:33.669> so<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.120> did<00:03:34.480> two<00:03:34.660> things<00:03:34.690> in

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
founding families so I did two things in

founding families so I did two things in
the<00:03:35.139> text<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:35.739> I<00:03:35.769> wrote<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.160> story<00:03:36.519> of

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
the text one I wrote a story of

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.050

of the Hispanic names that one might

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.550 
of the Hispanic names that one might

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
over the world which tells us of course

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.700 
over the world which tells us of course
that<00:04:01.630> were<00:04:01.720> in<00:04:01.810> America<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.410> were<00:04:02.590> in

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
that were in America that were in

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.830 
that were in America that were in
California<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.580> there<00:04:03.760> was<00:04:03.880> the<00:04:03.970> gold<00:04:04.180> rush

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.300 

the<00:04:07.840> most<00:04:08.110> with<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.440> mosaics<00:04:08.830> are<00:04:08.920> at<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.100> far

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
the most with the mosaics are at the far

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.060 
the most with the mosaics are at the far
end<00:04:09.520> of<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.700> platform<00:04:09.910> not<00:04:10.600> where<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.590> public

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
end of the platform not where the public

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.370 
end of the platform not where the public
enters<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:12.610> exits<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:13.630> encourage

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
enters and exits to encourage

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
exploration of the whole platform so the

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.410 
exploration of the whole platform so the
idea<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.769> it's<00:04:18.130> sort<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.459> like<00:04:18.610> a<00:04:18.670> Hansel

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
idea is that it's sort of like a Hansel

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.880 
idea is that it's sort of like a Hansel
and<00:04:19.540> Gretel<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:20.019> know<00:04:20.110> trail<00:04:20.350> of<00:04:20.500> breadcrumbs

where<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.280> starts<00:04:21.580> off<00:04:21.730> with<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:21.940> few<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.450> then

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
where it starts off with a few and then

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.600 
where it starts off with a few and then
it<00:04:23.080> gets<00:04:23.140> more<00:04:23.380> and<00:04:23.500> more<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:24.130> get<00:04:24.310> all<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.520> way

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
it gets more and more to get all the way

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.850 
it gets more and more to get all the way
down<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.940> end<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.720> has<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:25.960> lot<00:04:26.230> of<00:04:26.290> benefits

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
down the end that has a lot of benefits

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.670 
down the end that has a lot of benefits

are<00:04:31.360> in<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.570> platform<00:04:32.140> it's<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:32.440> just<00:04:32.650> like

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
are in the platform it's not just like

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.250 
are in the platform it's not just like
one<00:04:33.040> thing<00:04:33.370> in<00:04:33.640> this<00:04:34.090> particular<00:04:34.330> platform

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
one thing in this particular platform

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.230 
one thing in this particular platform
the<00:04:35.770> view<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.250> fantastic<00:04:36.820> from<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.060> far

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
the view is so fantastic from the far

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.820 
the view is so fantastic from the far
end<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:37.840> really<00:04:38.080> wanted<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.380> emphasize

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
end to that I really wanted to emphasize

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.100 
end to that I really wanted to emphasize
that<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.430> do<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.730> lot<00:04:39.940> of<00:04:39.970> transit<00:04:40.450> projects<00:04:40.930> and

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
that I do a lot of transit projects and

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.420 
that I do a lot of transit projects and
one<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:41.950> things<00:04:42.100> that<00:04:42.130> I<00:04:42.220> like<00:04:42.370> about

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
one of the things that I like about

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.670 
one of the things that I like about
transit<00:04:43.030> besides<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.630> social<00:04:44.110> environmental

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
transit besides the social environmental

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.380 
transit besides the social environmental
aspects<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:45.790> like<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.090> idea<00:04:46.210> that

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
aspects of it is I like the idea that

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.390 
aspects of it is I like the idea that
the<00:04:46.600> audience<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.350> move<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:48.100> I<00:04:48.130> like

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
the audience is on the move so I like

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.680 
the audience is on the move so I like
entertaining<00:04:48.910> them<00:04:49.120> while<00:04:49.270> they're<00:04:49.420> actually

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
entertaining them while they're actually

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.780 
entertaining them while they're actually
on<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.930> train<00:04:50.200> so<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.830> diagonal<00:04:51.310> lines<00:04:51.520> on

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
on the train so the diagonal lines on

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.120 
on the train so the diagonal lines on
the<00:04:51.910> platform<00:04:52.540> as<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.260> train<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.650> coming<00:04:53.830> into

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
the platform as the train is coming into

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.640 
the platform as the train is coming into
the<00:04:54.250> into<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:54.790> station<00:04:55.330> on<00:04:55.660> this<00:04:55.810> side<00:04:56.050> the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
the into the station on this side the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.440 
the into the station on this side the
dark<00:04:56.890> color<00:04:57.160> will<00:04:57.430> be<00:04:57.580> wide<00:04:57.790> at<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.060> end<00:04:58.270> and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
dark color will be wide at the end and

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.580 
dark color will be wide at the end and
we'll<00:04:58.570> get<00:04:58.690> narrower<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.230> narrower<00:04:59.320> and

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
we'll get narrower and narrower and
