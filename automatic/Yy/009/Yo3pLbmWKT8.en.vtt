00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.110
 girls like this I do not bring you this look 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.330
 that is something colorful is some tones that 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.180
 I have not used it together for a long time 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.970
 a mauve violet color and I'm going to 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.349
 using this maurice brand that is a 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.090
 brand that is super super right now 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.270
 fashion and is very tempted to try 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.220
 that applying your pre-base is a basis 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.840
 super creamy unlike any 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.690
 another one that has proven 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.580
 It covers a lot the natural tone of 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.610
 the eyelids and I will use their 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.880
 compact shadows this these men 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.970
 they have an equal size for the pallets 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.420
 of mac and I'm applying this tone that 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.340
 it's like beige between beige and pink in the 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.100
 bone of the eyebrows and on the inside 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.730
 a little blurring very well and now I'm going 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.800
 to apply this tone between mallows is 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.440
 very interesting is between mauve and has 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.530
 some brightness like salmon color is very 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.540
 interesting and with a single application the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.580
 true applies very well 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.980
 the texture is quite silky is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.320
 pigmented nothing else I'm applying a 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.850
 last and it's enough 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.000
 I'm going to apply it to two thirds 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.010
 internal what is the mobile eyelid and 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.100
 right after this same quartet I will 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.830
 use that violet shade with very base 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.850
 blue and I'm applying it in the part 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.100
 external of the mobile eyelid having 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.979
 Care to blur with mauve 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.160
 and it is a color that also adheres very 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.040
 well you do not need to apply much 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.790
 quite pigmented and the softness is very 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.250
 high does not have much fall this shadow does not 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.670
 I do not feel like it's falling on top of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.340
 makeup under the eye that silky 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.979
 same as the mauve color in up to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.950
 moment I have not had to do with these 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.710
 tones that I'm using and since 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.630
 I carry that figure that I am creating 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.450
 where I want to go I will blur a 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.850
 little with this shadow that is very bright 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.300
 it's a coffee and I'm going to apply it 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.540
 in the line that I made with that blue between 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.870
 the blue line and the red savills line 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.180
 to apply on the brow bone and what 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.590
 I'm blurring with a pretty brush 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.960
 loose 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.320
 I'm applying this bit by bit to 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.060
 blur is a tone that has enough 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.270
 but obviously brightness of difuminarlo 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.470
 skype but this when I did it when 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.880
 this type of tones apply very very 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.250
 abundantly on the eyelid above 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.170
 a base without even showing all its 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.900
 shine in this case an eye that was 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.920
 blurring but it 's one is a product 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.260
 rich of very very good and very very easy to 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.160
 work now apply a little 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.500
 more to the fold now I'm going to delineate with 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.550
 this type down eyeliner the same 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.900
 brand is a black tone what I 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.640
 I find that you have the kindness that 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.070
 is trapped with the shadow because times 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.860
 we buy markers to delineate and in 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.680
 some occasions 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.810
 that will spoil the tip thanks to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.760
 the shadow but like these I do not know if 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.460
 is that these shadows do not have 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.680
 a lot of waste is not dust as it is not 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.340
 accumulate in the tip of the brush what 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.950
 which is excellent I have a video 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.650
 specific delineation of techniques 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.890
 delineated those that also included this 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.930
 down type I do the end tail and 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.030
 then he came back and then stuffed as is the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.950
 little triangle that I made and now I'm going to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.310
 apply this product of the now that is 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.750
 a a limited edition product has 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.989
 very bright and I 'm applying 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.820
 over the mauve tone then it comes back and 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.100
 retouch the eyeliner because it was filled with 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.489
 glitter but now I'm going to apply these 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.590
 eyelashes that came to my university 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.690
 since I applied I will apply myself to the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.660
 same base for shadows on the part of 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.540
 down the line of the in the line of 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.880
 the lower lashes to make it stand out 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.840
 quite this color that is applying 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.250
 again it's the blue violet tone of this 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.320
 palette of dying 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.820
 and then I'm going to apply it from this I know that 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.790
 apply the blue I will apply in the 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.540
 external part this tone itself the 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.180

 with some very nice and matte peach 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.640
 as we see, we love the best mate and 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.460
 I'm applying it quite generously in 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.710
 my cheeks blending very well now 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.630

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.250
 before the labials to last 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.120
 to match the tone of the lips 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.390
 before they look like they saw 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.520
