had to hold it up and other than that

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.570 
had to hold it up and other than that
you<00:02:40.690> know<00:02:40.720> quite<00:02:41.470> good<00:02:41.710> all-round<00:02:42.100> stats<00:02:42.400> to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
one less than 80 and that was his

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.530 
one less than 80 and that was his
strength<00:02:47.890> which<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.910> thought<00:02:49.180> was<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.390> lot

out of players brilliantly I think is a
