00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.990
 hello once number one personal of the imperial 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.240
 for you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.050
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make the detour. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.250
 break on the new s7 this home screen 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.180
 you can click the links on the buttons and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.840
 they go straight to where they are 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.840
 personal touch conditioning 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.860
 first let's know the cassava he 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.410
 will automatically recognize the iphone 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.109
 We'll stick around and click on 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.940
 restore the font 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.820
 you first need to disable the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.320
 look for iphone is not equal said not it 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.320
 Do not let you do the restoration. 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.820
 done that we will continue conical 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.670
 iphone restoration getting 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.590
 again he will make some requests 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.590
 I will not make a backup 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:34.530
 you can do is perfect he will do 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.570
 some process but like I already did 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.670
 previously on this computer 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.890
 I'm going to teach that I was going to get it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.539
 to download again or do 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.850
 other checks 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.740
 We're going to get him on the computer. 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.039
 I'll put it on the desktop for 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.289
 we can install directly from the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.179
 UN that now gives it also serves to 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.110
 You will see sins for others. 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.110
 computers are good 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.709
 nothing with shift just click on restore 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.819
 it will make a process do some 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.239
 checks and make the process direct 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.180
 on your iphone that was already connected 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.299
 I'll come here quickly for you. 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.459
 process because this is not the focus of 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.459
 Our video lesson today is good. 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.760
 the iphone already configured we will go 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.910
 open the internet and look for the 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.570
 and look like you're in the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.420
 screen 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.210
 I'm going to download it for windows that 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.220
 I'm using windows but also 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.950
 Is there a version for me? 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.160
 for who already owns a macbook by 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.650
 example apple is doing on macbook 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.080
 the process is identical to the only difference 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.080
 it's the download that's right 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.970
 downloaded just open the file and 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.430
 extracts to the file and xz the executable 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.850
 anywhere I'll put here 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.240
 on the desktop and ask to run 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.410
 he already recognized the iphone just clicking 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.990
 in the way 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.860
 if you do not connect the iphone and it will 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.620
 without knowing how to connect 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.020
 it automatically recognizes the process 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.240
 it starts and it's very simple 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.180
 that's how he's going to vote for the first time 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.060
 unlock the iphone and click the icon and 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.490
 See what's on your desktop 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.450
 so he continues with the process he 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.600
 will start a couple more times and 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.590
 ends the jailbreak process in the 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.500
 iphone 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:10.030
 it will end the configuration of what it is 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:13.960
 not who to start and is finalized 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:17.080
 You can already close the window I see. 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.150
 computer no longer exists 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.550
 need to leave open 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.510
 and found it say it's in the area 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.820
 job 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.980
 he will do a preparation and 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.790
 finalized as soon as you had been 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.920
 again just be here the screen to 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.230
 try to see better 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.750
 there are three options for you to select 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.840
 who uses rock and envelope 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.410
 I'm going to select europe and it appears more 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.960
 options for you to customize and the 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.050
 the right site screen 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:53.010
 you can already do add 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.010
 custom 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:03.779
 and entering the environment here you are 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.959
 everything that has already been installed by 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:10.439
 jailbreak is on the serce you can 

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:13.139
 add new repositories which is where 

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:16.020
 you install the applications from where 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.209

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.969
