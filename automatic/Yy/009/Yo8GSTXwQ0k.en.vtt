okay so this is the video for installing

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.000 
okay so this is the video for installing
your<00:00:04.410> face<00:00:05.370> bar<00:00:05.730> onto<00:00:06.060> your<00:00:06.450> keyboard<00:00:07.010> start

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
your face bar onto your keyboard start

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.100 
your face bar onto your keyboard start
out<00:00:08.160> by<00:00:08.370> looking<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> metal<00:00:09.510> pieces<00:00:09.780> that

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
out by looking at the metal pieces that

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.620 
out by looking at the metal pieces that
are<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.679> keyboard<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.460> can<00:00:11.910> see<00:00:12.300> at<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
are on the keyboard you can see at the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.829 
are on the keyboard you can see at the
very<00:00:12.900> right<00:00:13.320> there's<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.059> metal<00:00:15.059> piece<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
very right there's a metal piece with a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.160 
very right there's a metal piece with a
hole<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> middle<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.180> as<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:18.690> left

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
hole in the middle and as a very left

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.160 
hole in the middle and as a very left
there's<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.980> same<00:00:20.220> piece<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:21.359> those<00:00:21.869> two

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
there's the same piece so those two

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.370 
there's the same piece so those two
pieces<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:23.090> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> grab<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.930> metal

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
pieces are going to grab on to a metal

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.660 
pieces are going to grab on to a metal
wire<00:00:25.650> that's<00:00:26.369> attached<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.660> key<00:00:27.990> itself

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
wire that's attached to the key itself

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.900 
wire that's attached to the key itself
so<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.119> we're<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> use<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.380> next

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
so right now we're going to use the next

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.840 
so right now we're going to use the next
metal<00:00:32.910> plate<00:00:33.210> next<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
metal plate next to this one which is

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.600 
metal plate next to this one which is
this<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.489> there's<00:00:38.809> two<00:00:40.610> metal

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this this and that there's two metal

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.360 
this this and that there's two metal
pieces<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.719> top<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.739> holes<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
pieces at the top here with holes in the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.750 
pieces at the top here with holes in the
middle<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.879> one<00:00:45.629> large<00:00:45.870> hook<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.350> bottom

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
middle and one large hook at the bottom

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
middle and one large hook at the bottom
so<00:00:48.620> we're<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.750> look<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> different

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so we're going to look at the different

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
so we're going to look at the different
key<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.059> change<00:00:54.239> position

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
key because they can change position

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
key because they can change position
sometimes<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:57.350> hook<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> top<00:00:59.309> or

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
sometimes the hook can be at the top or

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
sometimes the hook can be at the top or
to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.039> determines<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
to the side and that determines the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
to the side and that determines the
position<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.940> pieces<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> right<00:01:04.559> now

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
position for these pieces so right now

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
position for these pieces so right now
we're<00:01:04.979> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.159> determine<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.640> position

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we're going to determine the position

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
we're going to determine the position
for<00:01:06.330> these<00:01:06.479> pieces<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.740> click<00:01:08.070> them<00:01:08.250> together

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
for these pieces and click them together

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
for these pieces and click them together
to<00:01:09.150> make<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.510> piece<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.320> after<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> we're

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to make one piece and after that we're

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.570 
to make one piece and after that we're
going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> install<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.630> keyboard

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
going to install it on to the keyboard

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.920 
going to install it on to the keyboard
we're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> start<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> large

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
we're going to start with the large

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.080 
we're going to start with the large

for<00:02:35.570> both<00:02:35.750> pieces<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:38.630> insert<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.200> pin

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
for both pieces you just insert the pin

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.680 
for both pieces you just insert the pin
of<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.980> small<00:02:40.220> piece<00:02:40.490> into<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.880> hole<00:02:41.270> of<00:02:41.570> the

you<00:02:44.750> hold<00:02:45.050> on<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.650> side<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.250> doesn't

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
you hold on to that side so it doesn't

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.000 
you hold on to that side so it doesn't
come<00:02:46.640> out<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:48.200> separate<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.800> large

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
come out and you separate the large

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.460 
come out and you separate the large
piece<00:02:49.310> from<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.670> small<00:02:49.910> piece<00:02:50.150> in<00:02:50.420> order<00:02:51.200> for

this<00:03:47.860> video<00:03:48.190> I've<00:03:48.460> already<00:03:48.820> installed<00:03:49.240> that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
this video I've already installed that

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.700 
this video I've already installed that
side<00:03:49.810> now<00:03:50.710> we<00:03:51.190> get<00:03:51.400> your<00:03:51.580> key<00:03:52.200> which<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.440> this

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
side now we get your key which is this

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.500 
side now we get your key which is this
and<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:56.470> determine<00:03:57.100> whether<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.610> put<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.940> like

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
and you determine whether to put it like

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.220 
and you determine whether to put it like
this<00:03:58.720> or<00:03:58.990> like<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.280> by<00:04:00.280> feeling<00:04:01.230> underneath

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
this or like this by feeling underneath

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.360 
this or like this by feeling underneath
I<00:04:02.680> mean<00:04:02.980> looking<00:04:03.370> underneath<00:04:04.890> all<00:04:05.890> these

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
I mean looking underneath all these

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.040 
I mean looking underneath all these
fittings<00:04:06.790> have<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.360> purpose<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.820> this<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.420> the

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
fittings have a purpose so this in the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.160 
fittings have a purpose so this in the
middle<00:04:11.440> there's<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:12.160> fitting<00:04:13.060> at<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.510> top<00:04:13.780> and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
middle there's a fitting at the top and

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.979 
middle there's a fitting at the top and
there's<00:04:14.590> none<00:04:14.860> at<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.370> bottom<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:16.600> now<00:04:16.630> you

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
there's none at the bottom so now you

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.330 
there's none at the bottom so now you
know<00:04:17.380> if<00:04:17.710> you<00:04:17.770> flip<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.640> key<00:04:19.230> this<00:04:20.230> way<00:04:20.680> this

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
know if you flip the key this way this

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.450 
know if you flip the key this way this
is<00:04:21.489> gonna<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:22.990> how<00:04:23.110> it's<00:04:23.290> going<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.470> go<00:04:23.680> so

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
is gonna this is how it's going to go so

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.100 
is gonna this is how it's going to go so
for<00:04:24.790> now<00:04:24.940> we're<00:04:25.150> going<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.330> be<00:04:25.450> flipping<00:04:25.660> this

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
for now we're going to be flipping this

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.880 
for now we're going to be flipping this
keyboard<00:04:26.410> like<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.570> put<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:29.500> at<00:04:29.830> the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
keyboard like that and put this at the

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.940 
keyboard like that and put this at the
top<00:04:30.100> don't<00:04:30.610> put<00:04:30.970> that<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:32.320> fitting<00:04:32.710> at<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
top don't put that the fitting at the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.350 
top don't put that the fitting at the
bottom<00:04:33.220> like<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.930> okay<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:36.060> once<00:04:37.060> we<00:04:37.210> have

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
bottom like that okay so once we have

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.580 
bottom like that okay so once we have
that<00:04:37.680> we're<00:04:38.680> going<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.600> put<00:04:40.600> this<00:04:40.810> metal<00:04:41.410> wire

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
that we're going to put this metal wire
