we<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.730> algae<00:00:24.210> here

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.020 

this<00:00:26.990> is<00:00:27.170> fairly<00:00:27.590> flexible

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.810 

and<00:00:33.120> we're<00:00:33.330> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.630> run<00:00:33.810> it<00:00:33.960> in

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
and we're going to run it in

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.010 
and we're going to run it in
for<00:00:35.030> critters

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
one has a home you can see the motor

one has a home you can see the motor
coupling

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
coupling

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.039 
coupling
and<00:01:37.090> inside

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
and inside

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.969 
and inside
we<00:01:39.590> have<00:01:39.770> as

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
we have as

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.080 
we have as
see<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:43.060> stationary<00:01:43.990> call<00:01:44.350> and/or<00:01:45.280> order<00:01:45.610> and

see a stationary call and/or order and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.100

so<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.229> rotor<00:01:47.530> goes<00:01:47.829> around<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:49.420> will<00:01:49.570> slice

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
so this rotor goes around it will slice

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.340 
so this rotor goes around it will slice
material<00:01:50.950> as<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.119> goes<00:01:52.299> through<00:01:52.329> that<00:01:52.630> column

material as it goes through that column

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.490 
material as it goes through that column
you<00:01:54.950> get<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.130> big<00:01:55.400> opening<00:01:56.080> critter<00:01:57.080> happen

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
you get a big opening critter happen

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.070 
you get a big opening critter happen

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
right - how square opening so it will

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.160 
right - how square opening so it will
flow<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.530> much<00:02:00.740> stuff<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:02.090> out<00:02:02.600> as<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.140> goes

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
flow as much stuff and out as it goes

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.070 
flow as much stuff and out as it goes

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.180 

for<00:02:32.680> us

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.420 

these<00:02:35.760> are<00:02:35.910> all<00:02:36.060> precious<00:02:36.420> immigrants

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.160 

anyway<00:02:42.909> it<00:02:42.970> doesn't<00:02:43.299> look<00:02:43.540> very<00:02:43.569> good<00:02:43.840> because

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
anyway it doesn't look very good because

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.400 
anyway it doesn't look very good because
these<00:02:44.500> machines<00:02:44.980> come<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.489> go

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.550 

I'm<00:02:49.890> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.310> put<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.870> less<00:02:51.870> than<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.230> put<00:02:52.470> in

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
I'm going to put a less than that put in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.600 
I'm going to put a less than that put in
about<00:02:52.680> half<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.040> much<00:02:54.500> yeah<00:02:55.500> there's<00:02:56.370> one

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
about half that much yeah there's one

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.510 
about half that much yeah there's one
scoopful<00:02:59.090> it<00:03:00.090> flows<00:03:00.360> through<00:03:00.390> real<00:03:00.870> nicely

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
scoopful it flows through real nicely

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.140 
scoopful it flows through real nicely
this<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:02.940> we're<00:03:03.120> getting<00:03:03.240> out

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
this is what we're getting out

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.030 
this is what we're getting out
I<00:03:04.239> see<00:03:04.870> pieces

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
I see pieces

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.980 
I see pieces
towards

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
towards

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.830 
towards
drive<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.710> smallest<00:03:09.280> screen<00:03:09.840> installed

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
drive with a smallest screen installed

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:43.430 
drive with a smallest screen installed
in<00:03:11.050> this

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.710 

okay

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:04:09.720 

creation

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.089 

you<00:04:10.269> can<00:04:10.450> see<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:10.780> capacity<00:04:11.440> is<00:04:11.590> down<00:04:11.860> it

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
you can see the capacity is down it

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.890 
you can see the capacity is down it
takes<00:04:12.250> longer<00:04:12.760> for<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:13.000> soup<00:04:13.269> bowl<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.750> go

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
takes longer for a soup bowl to go

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.950 
takes longer for a soup bowl to go
through

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
through

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.040 
through
and<00:04:16.760> we'll<00:04:17.760> hear<00:04:17.910> one<00:04:18.150> more<00:04:18.330> scoop<00:04:18.630> ball<00:04:18.870> and

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
and we'll hear one more scoop ball and

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:28.409 
and we'll hear one more scoop ball and
see<00:04:19.230> what<00:04:19.410> we<00:04:19.530> get

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.860 

this<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:29.600> what<00:04:29.810> we<00:04:29.990> got<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:30.680> can<00:04:30.800> see<00:04:31.870> much

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
this is what we got you can see much

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.100 
this is what we got you can see much
more<00:04:32.930> size<00:04:33.530> reduction

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
more size reduction

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.379 
more size reduction
some<00:04:35.409> powder<00:04:35.710> over<00:04:36.159> there<00:04:36.370> some<00:04:36.639> ghosts<00:04:36.939> but

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
some powder over there some ghosts but

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.379 
some powder over there some ghosts but
not<00:04:37.539> a<00:04:37.569> lot

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
not a lot

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.370 
not a lot
anyway<00:04:40.020> we'll<00:04:40.229> quite<00:04:40.440> samples<00:04:40.979> of<00:04:41.129> this

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.500 

we<00:04:43.710> just<00:04:43.920> noticed<00:04:44.370> we've<00:04:44.550> got<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.970> wet<00:04:45.210> spot
