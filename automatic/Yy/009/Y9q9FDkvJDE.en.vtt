playing<00:01:04.739> with<00:01:04.830> those<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.309> things<00:01:05.580> you'll<00:01:06.240> get

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
playing with those two things you'll get

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.700 
playing with those two things you'll get
it<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.110> pretty<00:01:07.320> quick<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:09.290> then<00:01:10.290> once

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it I think pretty quick and then once

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.520 
it I think pretty quick and then once
you<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.180> those<00:01:12.180> two<00:01:12.240> pieces<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.960> place<00:01:13.170> there

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
you have those two pieces in place there

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440 
you have those two pieces in place there
are<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> few<00:01:14.430> other<00:01:14.700> ways<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.270> kind

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
are just like a few other ways to kind

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.020 
are just like a few other ways to kind
of<00:01:15.570> play<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:17.189> some<00:01:17.430> variation

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
of play with it and get some variation

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.820 
of play with it and get some variation
on<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> things<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.680> can

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
on it so one of the things that you can

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
on it so one of the things that you can
play<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.780> shape<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
play with is just like the the shape of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.100 
play with is just like the the shape of
your<00:01:22.259> mouth<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.880> make<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> call<00:01:24.479> with

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
