 I start by cutting but in Lebanon 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.670
 neighborhood using the blade of a 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.280
 paring knife I realize 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.820
 incisions on nettle just sting 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.620
 meat in different places 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.570
 I have to do the dolive pieces in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.309
 my roast inside the incisions in 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.289

 fillet of olive oil 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.750
 I grab the roast season with fine salt 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.059
 on all sides 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.550
 we add to canes and aromatic towers 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.360
 the bay leaf branches of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.869
 thyme a clove of garlic just crushed under 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.760
 the hand and I finish with the butter I 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.710
 let melt the butter and I cover to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.740
 coconut and jean provide everything in a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
 oven preheated to 200 degrees during a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 fifty minutes the roaster 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.830
 dufour it is golden that at the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.450
 perfection 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.829
 I chose to realize it with a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.240
 piece of poles but we would have very 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.460
 well did it with a piece of 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.110
 leg because they are pieces that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 requires some cooking time 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.439
 once cooked their tools I say 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.810
 break on a piece of paper 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.040
 aluminum 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.360
 I'm going to season it with pears and I 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.180
 will do again but the aluminum foil 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 to keep the heat and let the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.070
 meat to rest about half of the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 cooking time, ie 25 minutes 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.869
 in a big night or in a big 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.329
 hot stove 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:02.159
 I put my butter to melt and I'm going 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.479
 let him scream until they are 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.250
 nutty ie it is a 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.850
 beautiful pink color when the butter and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.280
 of course we remove the stems 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.030
 and we had them beforehand and we go 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.620
 knock them down 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.829
 that is to say that I am agitated by 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.319
 small amounts while mixing and 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.140
 with the heat the leaves are going 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.670
 retract once spinach are 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.579

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.430
