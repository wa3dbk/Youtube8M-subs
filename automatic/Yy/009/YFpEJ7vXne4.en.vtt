of<00:01:11.850> ugly<00:01:11.970> looking<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> camo

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
of ugly looking and I think the camo

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.740 
of ugly looking and I think the camo
really<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.130> kind<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.430> ugly<00:01:14.600> regardless<00:01:15.600> it's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750

like green and orange I don't know my
opinion<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> worst<00:01:19.350> ones<00:01:19.740> but

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
one thing I do kind of like about it is

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.960 
one thing I do kind of like about it is
the<00:01:27.380> reflex<00:01:28.380> sight<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> comes<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.579> or

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the reflex sight that it comes with or

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.550 
the reflex sight that it comes with or
at<00:01:30.360> least<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.659> are<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> reticle<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
at least there are the reticle for the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.170 
at least there are the reticle for the
reflex<00:01:32.280> sight<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> comes<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.030> think

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
reflex sight that comes with it I think

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.210 
reflex sight that comes with it I think
that<00:01:33.390> one's<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:33.689> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:33.990> cool-looking

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
that one's actually kind of cool-looking

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.630 
that one's actually kind of cool-looking
it's<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.509> circle<00:01:36.829> it's<00:01:37.829> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.220> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it's like a circle it's kind of like a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640 
it's like a circle it's kind of like a
broken<00:01:39.299> circle<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> target<00:01:40.470> sign

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
broken circle it's like a target sign

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.870 
broken circle it's like a target sign
but<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.189> circle<00:01:41.490> isn't<00:01:41.610> all<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.820> way

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
but the circle isn't all the way

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
but the circle isn't all the way
connected<00:01:42.270> around<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.840> broken<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
connected around it's like broken out a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200 
connected around it's like broken out a
lot<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.649> explain<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> look<00:01:45.060> at

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
lot and explain it you have to look at

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.139 
lot and explain it you have to look at
it<00:01:45.329> yourself<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.470> one

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
it yourself but I kind of like that one

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.600 
it yourself but I kind of like that one
so<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.810> my<00:01:48.930> opinion<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.470> makes<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> cool<00:01:50.220> but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so in my opinion that makes it cool but

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
so in my opinion that makes it cool but
that's<00:01:50.820> pretty<00:01:51.000> much<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.299> i<00:01:51.390> gotta<00:01:51.540> say<00:01:51.600> love

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
that's pretty much all i gotta say love

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
that's pretty much all i gotta say love
this<00:01:52.020> camo<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.490> cool<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.060> my

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
this camo not really that cool in my

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.870 
this camo not really that cool in my
opinion<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.829> had<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> reason<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:56.640> using

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
opinion but I had the reason I was using

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.910 
opinion but I had the reason I was using
the<00:01:57.000> pw<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> i've<00:01:57.960> been<00:01:58.079> using<00:01:58.170> MSC<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.829> all

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the pw and i've been using MSC for all

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.469 
the pw and i've been using MSC for all
these<00:01:59.009> new<00:01:59.159> candles<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.610> stuff<00:01:59.670> is<00:02:00.000> because

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
these new candles and stuff is because

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.940 
these new candles and stuff is because
that<00:02:01.469> recent<00:02:01.860> patch<00:02:02.040> was<00:02:02.340> supposed<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.939> have

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
that recent patch was supposed to have

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.520 
that recent patch was supposed to have
nerf<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.280> MSMC<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> pw<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:07.170> i<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.439> just

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
nerf the MSMC and the pw so i was just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.900 
nerf the MSMC and the pw so i was just
trying<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.950> mount<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.729> i

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
trying to mount you know a little bit i

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.219 
trying to mount you know a little bit i
use<00:02:09.360> them<00:02:09.509> anyway<00:02:09.750> I'm<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:09.959> gonna<00:02:10.050> try<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
use them anyway I'm not gonna try to

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.960 
use them anyway I'm not gonna try to
hide<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.679> from<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.979> or<00:02:11.099> whatever<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.580> could

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
hide that from you or whatever I could

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
hide that from you or whatever I could
really<00:02:12.090> care<00:02:12.360> less<00:02:12.390> about

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
really care less about

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.289 
really care less about
what<00:02:14.010> people<00:02:14.280> say<00:02:14.459> about<00:02:14.489> what<00:02:14.670> guns<00:02:15.000> i<00:02:15.090> use<00:02:15.209> it

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
what people say about what guns i use it

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.280 
what people say about what guns i use it
doesn't<00:02:15.480> really<00:02:15.569> matter<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.900> me<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.170> not<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
doesn't really matter to me it's not a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.500 
doesn't really matter to me it's not a
big<00:02:16.439> with<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.640> gun<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.060> video<00:02:18.329> game

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
big with you it's a gun on a video game

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.479 
big with you it's a gun on a video game
so<00:02:18.689> yeah<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.409> i<00:02:19.590> did<00:02:19.739> want<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:20.010> try<00:02:20.189> them<00:02:20.370> out

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
so yeah but i did want to try them out

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.860 
so yeah but i did want to try them out
because<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.150> right<00:02:21.299> after<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.629> patch

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
because this was right after the patch

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.240 
because this was right after the patch
so<00:02:22.200> i<00:02:22.260> wanted<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:22.769> how<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.129> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so i wanted to see how much of a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.350 
so i wanted to see how much of a
difference<00:02:23.579> there<00:02:23.640> was<00:02:23.879> i<00:02:24.060> don't<00:02:24.239> really

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
difference there was i don't really

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.149 
difference there was i don't really
notice<00:02:24.540> too<00:02:24.780> much<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.769> be<00:02:25.860> honest<00:02:26.069> with

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
notice too much and to be honest with

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.369 
notice too much and to be honest with
you<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.849> they<00:02:27.420> never<00:02:27.629> told<00:02:27.870> us<00:02:28.019> there<00:02:28.230> was<00:02:28.290> a

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
you if they never told us there was a

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.470 
you if they never told us there was a
patch<00:02:28.560> i<00:02:28.739> wouldn't<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.129> thought<00:02:29.459> there<00:02:30.299> was

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
patch i wouldn't have thought there was

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.179 
patch i wouldn't have thought there was
so<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:31.140> if<00:02:31.409> it<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.680> difference<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.129> very

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
so as if it is a difference is very

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.460 
so as if it is a difference is very
small<00:02:32.370> maybe<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.329> little<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.689> more<00:02:33.840> recoil<00:02:34.200> in

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
small maybe a little bit more recoil in

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.309 
small maybe a little bit more recoil in
long<00:02:34.709> long<00:02:35.040> range<00:02:35.720> gunfights<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.140> that's

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
long long range gunfights but that's

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.819 
long long range gunfights but that's
about<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.560> i<00:02:37.829> guess<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:39.030> yeah<00:02:39.569> msmc<00:02:40.319> still<00:02:40.739> my

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
about it i guess so yeah msmc still my

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.099 
about it i guess so yeah msmc still my
favorite<00:02:41.099> going<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:42.150> game<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.450> vector<00:02:42.900> is

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
favorite going in the game the vector is

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.050 
favorite going in the game the vector is
starting<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.950> grow<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.189> me<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.400> little<00:02:44.519> bit<00:02:44.700> they

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
starting to grow on me a little bit they

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.190 
starting to grow on me a little bit they
haven't<00:02:45.299> patched<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.690> i'll<00:02:45.870> probably<00:02:46.049> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
haven't patched that i'll probably the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.539 
haven't patched that i'll probably the
next<00:02:46.290> can<00:02:46.500> they<00:02:46.620> patch<00:02:46.799> it's<00:02:47.129> really<00:02:47.340> strong

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
next can they patch it's really strong

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.420 
next can they patch it's really strong
noriko<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:49.650> good<00:02:49.859> going<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.220> don't<00:02:50.280> know

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
noriko it's good going so I don't know

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.160 
noriko it's good going so I don't know
maybe<00:02:51.030> use<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.329> vector<00:02:51.569> from<00:02:51.690> now<00:02:51.840> but<00:02:52.049> up

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
maybe use the vector from now but up

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.390 
maybe use the vector from now but up
there's<00:02:52.409> the<00:02:52.470> brutal<00:02:52.799> metal<00:02:52.920> right<00:02:53.099> there<00:02:53.159> i

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
there's the brutal metal right there i

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.009 
there's the brutal metal right there i
means<00:02:53.579> i'm<00:02:53.700> pretty<00:02:54.030> close<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.540> nuclear

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
means i'm pretty close to the nuclear

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.539 
means i'm pretty close to the nuclear
it's<00:02:55.560> about<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> three<00:02:55.920> minute<00:02:56.069> nuclear<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.489> i

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
it's about a three minute nuclear so i

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.059 
it's about a three minute nuclear so i
guess<00:02:56.700> that's<00:02:56.879> pretty<00:02:57.239> good<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.709> yes<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.010> if

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
guess that's pretty good and I yes so if

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.440 
guess that's pretty good and I yes so if
