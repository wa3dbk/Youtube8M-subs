00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.520
 Personal speech is starting another tone. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.560
 well in the kitchen today we will 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.860
 teach a chicken to the sauce of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.610
 lemon and capers and it is easy to 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.760
 make it look delicious and you'll learn 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.010
 Now we're going to start tempering the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.310
 our chicken steaks here we are 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.990
 using the boneless chicken breast and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.119
 cut into fillets 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.519
 If you want you can ask for the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.619
 lord, I'm gay, he can cut yes, but 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.989
 also you can find and ready already 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.380
 so you'll temper a little bit 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.110
 of salt and freshly ground pepper and also 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.329
 here seasoned with cayenne pepper 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.649
 you have your pepper she stays very 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.579
 It's delicious, it's just good to taste both of them. 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.460
 sides 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 and now we 're going to cover this fillet of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.800
 chicken with a little wheat 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.590
 You do not have to pass an egg. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.379
 you need to spend nothing, just pass one 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.660
 this will leave the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.330
 a little crispy chicken 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.280
 when you go pass him in the pot and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.280
 will give a very special touch to him 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.610
 now you will shine your chicken in a 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.250
 large frying pan with a 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.720
 Oil, you'll get through it more or less. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.770
 2 to 3 minutes on each side on fire 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.690
 high medium high heat're you saw I 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.110
 I put the chicken there and it's already bubbling 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.120
 this is really the idea if you put 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.190
 the chicken and do not bubble because your 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.110
 pan is not hot is 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.810
 important that it starts to fry 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.550
 so you put it in the pot and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.050
 after about three minutes 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.390
 Are you going to turn around? He looks just like you did. 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.970
 crunchy and looked lovely our chicken 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.570
 exactly the color that we want to 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.369
 he 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.710
 Now we'll go the other way. 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.710
 more or less 2 to 3 minutes too 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.590
 now that your chicken is ready you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.110
 will take it out of the pot will book and the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.709
 People are still going to use a pot for 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.019
 make our sauce 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.510
 there I had a little oil in the 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.660
 panela and I already start playing the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.690
 capers and a cool tip for you 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.019
 You can knead some of the capers. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.700
 to give a more special flavor 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.530
 I was with my pan was a 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.090
 little hot why you're leaving 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.790
 this smoke 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.340
 then after 30 seconds or so 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.260
 You will throw your white wine in this 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.540
 hot pot if you do not want 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.120
 use the white wine is just for this 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.209
 part and straight to the lemon juice the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.880
 wine will reduce a little bit and then 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.049
 of reduced you will put the juice of 1 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.890
 Lemon Sicilian in your panela and there 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.230
 being the base of your sauce 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.140
 then after about 30 seconds you 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.230
 play your chicken broth 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.980
 and you will leave your eye and then 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.440
 reducing for a little or less there a minute 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.780
 now to finalize your eye when 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.160
 he already has reducing you will put 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.709
 the butter cut into pieces and there 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.380
 although it looks like a lot of butter this sauce 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:35.360
 yields enough it will yield for more 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.610
 or less than 5 to 6 bi chicken feeds are 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.950
 people are making three chickens but that one 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:46.010
 sauce yields a lot so do not 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.900
 it scares the amount of butter and 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.570
 Now to end an eye, you go. 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:04:00.739
 play a little parsley parsley 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:02.750
 chopped in the hour and during that time you 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.610
 You can try a little to know. 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.920
 if you need to fix it a little bit 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.200
 Your sauce here I put a little bit 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.900
 salt that I thought was missing is 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.329
 only you try it and see how it is 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.540
 my eye is fine, and now I 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.570
 I return the steaks I had booked from 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.940
 Come back and I'll pass him over or 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.550
 less than 30 seconds 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.380
 there it is on each side is just a 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.100
 bit to modify a little bit 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.250
 moist and absorb a little bit of this sauce 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.100
 and your chicken is almost ready 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.900
 now 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.090
 now just mount your plate is just 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.640
 put the chicken or play a little 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.310
 of your sauce on top and serve with that 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.500
 You want it to be a polenta one. 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.350
 potatoes or even with rice 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.780
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.900
 liked the video short and until the next 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.900
