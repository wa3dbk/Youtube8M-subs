00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
here in the office got some lovin we

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.650 
here in the office got some lovin we
stuck<00:00:16.830> our<00:00:16.980> hands<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:18.210> flex<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.550 
glove and I think with there was a
collective<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:21.119> know<00:00:21.210> ah<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:22.109> through<00:00:22.260> us

collective you know ah going through us

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.950 
collective you know ah going through us

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
because it's it feels so natural the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.330 
because it's it feels so natural the
closure<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.650> natural<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
closure is so natural and it's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.400 
closure is so natural and it's
incredibly<00:00:26.820> lightweight<00:00:27.199> you<00:00:28.199> haven't

here<00:02:42.040> okay<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.700> does<00:02:42.940> make<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.390> little<00:02:43.420> bit

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
here okay it does make it a little bit

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.110 
here okay it does make it a little bit
more<00:02:44.019> flexible<00:02:44.590> when<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> t<00:02:45.519> is<00:02:45.640> off<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
more flexible when the t is off to the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.550 
more flexible when the t is off to the
side<00:02:46.299> because<00:02:46.480> there's<00:02:46.720> less<00:02:46.930> restriction

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
side because there's less restriction

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.259 
side because there's less restriction
right<00:02:47.739> through<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.040> break<00:02:48.250> area<00:02:48.459> yeah<00:02:48.760> but

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
right through the break area yeah but

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.270 
right through the break area yeah but
some<00:02:49.480> goalies<00:02:49.840> prefer<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.650> T<00:02:50.860> through<00:02:51.160> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
some goalies prefer the T through the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.250 
some goalies prefer the T through the
center<00:02:51.579> because<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.060> does<00:02:52.390> absorb<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:53.110> impact

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
center because it does absorb the impact

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.380 
center because it does absorb the impact
with<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.010> right<00:02:54.250> foam<00:02:54.519> be<00:02:54.730> nice<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.180> that's

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
with the right foam be nice so that's

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.850 
with the right foam be nice so that's
always<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.690> point<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.110> confusion<00:02:56.260> with<00:02:56.680> some

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
always a point of confusion with some

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.770 
always a point of confusion with some
goalies<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.310> think<00:02:57.579> so<00:02:57.730> you'll<00:02:57.879> get<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.090> so

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
goalies I think so you'll get the so

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.300 
goalies I think so you'll get the so
what<00:02:58.959> you're<00:02:59.079> talking<00:02:59.200> about<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.769> 580

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
what you're talking about is the 580

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.130 
what you're talking about is the 580
break<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.910> guess<00:03:01.060> which<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.360> more<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.750> 90

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
break I guess which is more of the 90

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.380 
break I guess which is more of the 90
degree<00:03:02.260> yeah<00:03:02.829> your<00:03:03.069> time<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.430> 590<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.150> more<00:03:04.329> of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
degree yeah your time the 590 is more of

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.059 
degree yeah your time the 590 is more of
a<00:03:04.450> traditional<00:03:04.599> 60<00:03:05.170> degree<00:03:05.500> correct<00:03:05.860> so

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
a traditional 60 degree correct so

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.970 
a traditional 60 degree correct so
sometimes<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:07.959> layman's<00:03:08.379> term<00:03:08.560> are<00:03:08.739> in

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
sometimes in in layman's term are in

the leather strap versus the webbing

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.629 
the leather strap versus the webbing
strap<00:05:16.449> right<00:05:16.719> uh<00:05:16.779> we<00:05:17.650> weighed<00:05:17.889> this<00:05:18.129> again<00:05:18.490> in

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
strap right uh we weighed this again in

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.170 
strap right uh we weighed this again in
our<00:05:18.729> warehouse<00:05:19.169> 2.12<00:05:20.169> pounds<00:05:20.620> super<00:05:21.460> light<00:05:21.669> um

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
our warehouse 2.12 pounds super light um

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.730 
our warehouse 2.12 pounds super light um
it's<00:05:22.659> the<00:05:22.779> injection<00:05:23.319> molded<00:05:23.650> yeah<00:05:23.889> I<00:05:24.490> mean<00:05:24.759> we

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
it's the injection molded yeah I mean we

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.309 
it's the injection molded yeah I mean we
tested<00:05:26.740> this<00:05:26.949> glove<00:05:27.339> for<00:05:28.089> years<00:05:28.539> getting<00:05:29.110> the

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
tested this glove for years getting the

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.079 
tested this glove for years getting the
right<00:05:29.560> resin<00:05:30.310> consistency<00:05:31.120> so<00:05:31.629> that<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:32.650> know

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:33.089 
right resin consistency so that you know

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.119 
right resin consistency so that you know
years<00:05:34.089> ago<00:05:34.210> we<00:05:34.960> used<00:05:34.990> compression<00:05:35.770> molding

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
years ago we used compression molding

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.070 
years ago we used compression molding
and<00:05:36.310> with<00:05:36.789> compression<00:05:37.330> molding<00:05:37.659> you<00:05:37.779> start

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
and with compression molding you start

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.139 
and with compression molding you start
with<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.229> sheet<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.589> plastic<00:05:38.949> and<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:39.849> heat<00:05:40.120> it

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.149 
with a sheet of plastic and you heat it

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.480 
with a sheet of plastic and you heat it
up<00:05:40.389> and<00:05:40.659> you<00:05:41.289> put<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:41.560> in<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.860> mold<00:05:42.069> and<00:05:42.370> it

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
up and you put it in the mold and it

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.969 
up and you put it in the mold and it
takes<00:05:42.729> the<00:05:42.879> shape<00:05:43.120> but<00:05:43.930> over<00:05:44.379> time<00:05:44.680> and

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
takes the shape but over time and

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.570 
takes the shape but over time and
repeated<00:05:45.550> impact<00:05:46.060> plastic<00:05:47.250> generally<00:05:48.250> wants

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
repeated impact plastic generally wants

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.490 
repeated impact plastic generally wants
to<00:05:48.699> go<00:05:48.819> back<00:05:48.969> to<00:05:49.210> its<00:05:49.330> natural<00:05:49.479> shape<00:05:49.750> which

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
to go back to its natural shape which

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.860 
to go back to its natural shape which
was<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.889> sheet<00:05:51.099> of<00:05:51.129> plastic<00:05:51.729> yeah<00:05:52.210> with

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
was the sheet of plastic yeah with

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.260 
was the sheet of plastic yeah with
injection<00:05:53.560> you're<00:05:53.740> injecting<00:05:54.099> a<00:05:54.430> resin<00:05:54.969> into

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
injection you're injecting a resin into

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.300 
injection you're injecting a resin into
the<00:05:55.629> shape<00:05:55.870> so<00:05:56.319> that<00:05:56.349> is<00:05:56.649> the<00:05:56.770> original<00:05:57.069> shape

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
the shape so that is the original shape

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.629 
the shape so that is the original shape
sure<00:05:57.550> goalies<00:05:58.229> also<00:05:59.229> uh<00:05:59.469> you<00:06:00.250> know<00:06:00.339> some<00:06:00.610> of

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
sure goalies also uh you know some of

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:01.740 
sure goalies also uh you know some of
the<00:06:00.789> goalies<00:06:01.060> that<00:06:01.180> have<00:06:01.270> switched<00:06:01.539> to<00:06:01.719> a

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
the goalies that have switched to a

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.559 
the goalies that have switched to a
Reebok<00:06:02.169> glove<00:06:02.469> said<00:06:02.800> my<00:06:03.789> glove<00:06:04.060> doesn't<00:06:04.240> break

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
Reebok glove said my glove doesn't break

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:05.670 
Reebok glove said my glove doesn't break
down<00:06:04.599> here<00:06:05.110> because<00:06:05.199> this<00:06:05.409> is<00:06:05.529> the<00:06:05.649> first

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
down here because this is the first

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.619 
down here because this is the first
thing<00:06:06.039> it'll<00:06:06.189> happen<00:06:06.370> with<00:06:06.699> the<00:06:06.789> glove<00:06:07.029> is<00:06:07.270> all

area this thumb in a compression molded

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.800 
area this thumb in a compression molded
glove<00:06:12.370> will<00:06:12.669> compress<00:06:13.089> we<00:06:13.300> used<00:06:13.479> to<00:06:13.539> have<00:06:13.659> that

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
glove will compress we used to have that

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.260 
glove will compress we used to have that
problem<00:06:14.110> all<00:06:14.289> the<00:06:14.379> time<00:06:14.560> this<00:06:15.099> is<00:06:15.310> why<00:06:15.580> we

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
problem all the time this is why we

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.969 
problem all the time this is why we
invested<00:06:16.810> the<00:06:16.930> dollars<00:06:17.259> we<00:06:17.289> did<00:06:17.680> in<00:06:17.919> the

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
invested the dollars we did in the

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.829 
invested the dollars we did in the
injection<00:06:18.699> molding<00:06:19.029> technology<00:06:19.599> of<00:06:19.689> this

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:19.839 
injection molding technology of this

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.260 
injection molding technology of this
because<00:06:20.050> now<00:06:20.529> you've<00:06:21.189> got<00:06:21.399> a<00:06:21.430> glove<00:06:21.759> where

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
because now you've got a glove where

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.700 
because now you've got a glove where
it's<00:06:22.389> not<00:06:22.629> going<00:06:22.870> to<00:06:22.930> compress<00:06:23.289> and<00:06:23.560> it's

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
it's not going to compress and it's
