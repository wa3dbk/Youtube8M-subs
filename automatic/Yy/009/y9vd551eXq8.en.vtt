00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
with the x10 knows how good the camera

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.890 
with the x10 knows how good the camera
is<00:00:25.100> how<00:00:25.310> good<00:00:25.550> it<00:00:25.670> how<00:00:26.090> good<00:00:26.600> the<00:00:26.690> build

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
is how good it how good the build

is how good it how good the build
quality<00:00:27.050> is<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.650> of<00:00:27.830> course<00:00:28.030> you<00:00:29.030> know<00:00:29.150> we

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
quality is and of course you know we

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.060 
quality is and of course you know we
really<00:00:29.690> improved<00:00:30.140> on<00:00:30.410> some<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.890> key

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
really improved on some of the key

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.499 
really improved on some of the key
things<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:31.430> were<00:00:31.610> maybe<00:00:31.820> lacking<00:00:32.180> from

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
things that were maybe lacking from

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.560 
things that were maybe lacking from
lashes<00:00:33.050> model<00:00:33.469> ok<00:00:33.859> so<00:00:34.370> let's<00:00:34.969> start<00:00:35.179> with<00:00:35.329> one

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
lashes model ok so let's start with one

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.569 
lashes model ok so let's start with one
of<00:00:35.659> those<00:00:35.749> first<00:00:36.019> key<00:00:36.260> things<00:00:36.499> I<00:00:36.739> know<00:00:37.190> we<00:00:37.429> have

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
of those first key things I know we have

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.520 
of those first key things I know we have
a<00:00:37.609> new<00:00:37.789> sensor<00:00:38.149> in<00:00:38.269> this<00:00:38.390> camera<00:00:38.690> absolutely

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
a new sensor in this camera absolutely

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.950 
a new sensor in this camera absolutely
it's<00:00:40.039> still<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.219> two-thirds<00:00:40.609> inch<00:00:40.909> CMOS<00:00:41.600> sensor

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
it's still a two-thirds inch CMOS sensor

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.660 
it's still a two-thirds inch CMOS sensor
where's<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.499> you<00:00:42.890> know<00:00:43.010> generally<00:00:43.399> two

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
where's that you know generally two

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.219 
where's that you know generally two
times<00:00:43.850> larger<00:00:44.089> than<00:00:44.269> the<00:00:44.480> average<00:00:44.719> pony<00:00:44.960> shoot

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
times larger than the average pony shoot

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.840 
times larger than the average pony shoot
sensor<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.679> course<00:00:46.010> I<00:00:46.399> didn't<00:00:46.670> cooperate

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
sensor of course I didn't cooperate

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.239 
sensor of course I didn't cooperate
still<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.329> f2<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.780> 2.8<00:00:48.170> lens<00:00:48.409> it's<00:00:48.979> a<00:00:49.039> very

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
still the f2 the 2.8 lens it's a very

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.059 
still the f2 the 2.8 lens it's a very
fast<00:00:49.519> lens<00:00:49.850> but<00:00:50.449> instead<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.749> using<00:00:50.839> exs<00:00:51.620> CMOS

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
fast lens but instead of using exs CMOS

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:54.009 
fast lens but instead of using exs CMOS
mm-hmm<00:00:52.609> we've<00:00:52.969> actually<00:00:53.179> gone<00:00:53.479> with<00:00:53.749> the<00:00:53.870> ex

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
mm-hmm we've actually gone with the ex

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.469 
mm-hmm we've actually gone with the ex
Trent<00:00:54.280> filter<00:00:55.280> array<00:00:55.399> now<00:00:55.729> on<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.120> CMOS

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
Trent filter array now on the CMOS

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.029 
Trent filter array now on the CMOS
sensor<00:00:56.929> first<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.409> it's<00:00:57.589> going<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.800> give<00:00:57.920> us

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
sensor first and it's going to give us

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.250 
sensor first and it's going to give us
you<00:00:58.280> know<00:00:58.399> that<00:00:58.609> seem<00:00:58.999> you<00:00:59.539> know<00:00:59.569> a<00:00:59.719> sharp

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
you know that seem you know a sharp

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.410 
you know that seem you know a sharp
resolving<00:01:00.859> pal<00:01:01.100> that<00:01:01.370> we<00:01:01.489> found<00:01:01.699> on<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.059> XE

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
resolving pal that we found on the XE

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.780 
resolving pal that we found on the XE
one<00:01:02.629> exposure<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.679> same<00:01:03.920> technology<00:01:04.159> that's

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
one exposure that same technology that's

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.330 
one exposure that same technology that's
on<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.360> high<00:01:05.540> end<00:01:05.570> cameras<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.500> now<00:01:06.620> then<00:01:07.130> put

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
on the high end cameras and now then put

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.570 
on the high end cameras and now then put
down<00:01:07.550> to<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.690> x10<00:01:09.560> replaces<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:10.220> essentially

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
down to the x10 replaces so essentially

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.380 
down to the x10 replaces so essentially
like<00:01:10.670> pro<00:01:11.060> quality<00:01:11.860> images<00:01:12.860> are<00:01:13.100> in<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.910> more

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
like pro quality images are in a more

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.330 
like pro quality images are in a more
affordable<00:01:14.600> smaller<00:01:15.050> camera<00:01:15.410> absolutely<00:01:16.250> and

the optical viewfinder the x10 was

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.410 
the optical viewfinder the x10 was
unique<00:02:11.400> i<00:02:11.520> mean<00:02:11.670> they're<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:11.970> glass

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
construction and had a good field of

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.400 
construction and had a good field of
view<00:02:14.880> especially<00:02:15.270> larger<00:02:15.930> than<00:02:16.080> some<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410

competition out there yeah but what it
did<00:02:18.450> lack<00:02:18.750> was<00:02:19.050> shooting<00:02:19.380> information<00:02:20.010> yes<00:02:20.250> as

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
did lack was shooting information yes as

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.730 
did lack was shooting information yes as
well<00:02:20.670> as<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.120> know<00:02:21.180> AF<00:02:21.600> confirmation<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
well as you know AF confirmation and so

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.860 
well as you know AF confirmation and so
someone<00:02:23.280> who's<00:02:23.430> really<00:02:23.640> wanted<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> optical

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
someone who's really wanted the optical

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.870 
someone who's really wanted the optical
viewfinder<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.950> know<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.160> wasn't<00:02:26.610> as

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
viewfinder you know it wasn't as

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.309 
viewfinder you know it wasn't as
practical<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.750> could<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:27.959> been<00:02:28.140> because

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
practical as it could have been because

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.290

you're not you weren't sure if you got
things<00:02:30.600> in<00:02:30.750> focus<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.319> not<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.920> even<00:02:32.400> then

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
things in focus or not and and even then

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.100 
things in focus or not and and even then
even<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.000> settings<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.630> know<00:02:33.750> you're<00:02:34.020> not

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
even the settings you know you're not

even the settings you know you're not
you<00:02:34.350> weren't<00:02:34.590> sure<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:34.860> what<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.430> apogee<00:02:35.730> of

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
you weren't sure if what the apogee of

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.070 
you weren't sure if what the apogee of
the<00:02:35.970> shutter<00:02:36.180> speed<00:02:36.390> through<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.900> have<00:02:36.989> to

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the shutter speed through you have to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.870 
the shutter speed through you have to
pull<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.380> camera<00:02:37.620> away<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.190> with<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.700> new

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
pull the camera away and with this new

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.030 
pull the camera away and with this new
digital<00:02:39.090> trans<00:02:39.630> panel<00:02:40.140> that's<00:02:40.260> very<00:02:40.800> unique

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
digital trans panel that's very unique

digital trans panel that's very unique
to<00:02:41.280> fuji<00:02:41.640> again<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.150> developed<00:02:42.630> that's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
to fuji again that we developed that's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.350 
to fuji again that we developed that's
now<00:02:43.590> incorporated<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.340> be<00:02:44.430> over<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.209> got

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
now incorporated to be over here you got

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.690 
now incorporated to be over here you got
shooting<00:02:45.720> information<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.010> apertures

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
shooting information is so apertures

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300 
shooting information is so apertures
even<00:02:48.360> AF<00:02:48.690> confirmation<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.769> it's<00:02:49.980> squares

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
even AF confirmation so it's squares

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.479 
even AF confirmation so it's squares
that<00:02:50.400> kept<00:02:50.820> moving<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.530> really<00:02:52.530> show<00:02:52.800> up<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
that kept moving and really show up to

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.370 
that kept moving and really show up to
tell<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.790> where<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> focusing<00:02:54.569> absolute<00:02:55.260> on

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
tell you where the focusing absolute on

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.229 
tell you where the focusing absolute on
the<00:02:55.470> camera<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.950> an<00:02:56.100> even<00:02:56.310> confirmation<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.090> it

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
the camera is an even confirmation if it

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.400 
the camera is an even confirmation if it
shows<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.930> didn't<00:02:58.200> receive

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
shows that it didn't receive

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.280 
shows that it didn't receive
confirmation<00:02:58.760> it'll<00:02:59.760> come<00:02:59.940> up<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.330> red<00:03:00.989> LED

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
confirmation it'll come up in a red LED

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.520 
confirmation it'll come up in a red LED
instead<00:03:01.890> yeah<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.430> if<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.730> got<00:03:02.819> confirmation

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
instead yeah and if you got confirmation

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.900 
instead yeah and if you got confirmation
focusing<00:03:04.530> correct<00:03:04.860> that's<00:03:05.069> gonna<00:03:05.580> be<00:03:05.730> green

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
focusing correct that's gonna be green

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.090 
focusing correct that's gonna be green
sort<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.600> unique<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.290> kind<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.920> can't

see that on the video but I can kind of
see<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.739> by<00:03:10.829> covering<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.220> lens<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.790> you

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
see it just by covering the lens so you

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.479 
see it just by covering the lens so you
know<00:03:12.030> now<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.360> green<00:03:12.630> now<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:13.200> black<00:03:13.500> goes

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
know now it's green now it's black goes
