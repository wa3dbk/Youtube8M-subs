00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.760
 Hi guys 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.890
 I want to present this business to you 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.509
 strong in my opinion is a hybrid between 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:15.509
 liga bbva and photos that I can assure you 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.690
 that we decide then we start from 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.250
 continuously explains that a usual concierge 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 with statistic that has distributed as 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 you can see the only flaw or the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.349
 speed but I can assure you that it does 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.140
 abstruse calculations then there is a coffin of 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.600
 defender of the real madrid and enduring 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.559
 fast defender with wants with good 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.410
 defense and physique will lose many to jump 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.020
 then there is fabio coentrao difficult of the site 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.230
 discrete boulders do their job well 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.210
 exceptional though being breakers 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 really believe in this game costs 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.660
 very little and fortissimo is one 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.510
 incredible speed the physical 55 of the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.120
 yours surely more than the shooting 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.550
 passage we wo n't talk about it will be a lot 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.040

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.700
 look and there is something spectacular 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.460
 physical god who recites everything always puts 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.440
 the ball just seen goes on 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.140
 part of it stops him more than the sun of the goal 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.330
 of xavi that this year is cheap though 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.550
 May 10 puts the ball above all 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.040
 to light matches on horses that you called le 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.000
 exceptional things salt in a while 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.930

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.950
 clc is played the double role if who does 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.900
 that we'll find it defended like 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.740
 added defender to raise many 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.540
 balls and even in attack makes when 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.760
