and<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:45.170> quick<00:02:45.620> start<00:02:45.860> guide<00:02:46.100> which<00:02:46.340> real<00:02:46.610> men

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
and a quick start guide which real men

00:02:46.819 --> 00:03:00.270 
and a quick start guide which real men
don't<00:02:46.970> use<00:02:47.239> either<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.819> some<00:02:55.480> stickers

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.350 

anyways<00:03:01.280> none<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.670> stuff<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.090> really<00:03:02.269> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
anyways none of that stuff is really a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.210 
anyways none of that stuff is really a
lot<00:03:02.540> important<00:03:03.079> because<00:03:05.829> this<00:03:06.829> is<00:03:06.980> what<00:03:07.130> you

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
lot important because this is what you

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.160 
lot important because this is what you
really<00:03:07.370> want<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.640> see<00:03:08.049> now<00:03:09.049> it's<00:03:09.350> actually

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.330 

alright<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.350> here<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.799> mobile<00:03:16.130> what<00:03:16.220> I'm

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
alright so here is the mobile what I'm

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.710 
alright so here is the mobile what I'm
just<00:03:16.519> going<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.760> set<00:03:16.880> protective<00:03:17.390> stickers

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
just going to set protective stickers

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.940 
just going to set protective stickers
off<00:03:17.959> because<00:03:18.350> we're<00:03:18.470> going<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> remove<00:03:18.890> that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
off because we're going to remove that

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.420 
off because we're going to remove that
heat<00:03:19.340> sink<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:19.970> heat<00:03:20.150> sink<00:03:20.390> as<00:03:20.480> well

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
heat sink and that heat sink as well

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.870 
heat sink and that heat sink as well
basically<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.579> entire<00:03:22.640> bloody<00:03:23.510> work<00:03:23.690> tool

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
basically the entire bloody work tool

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.680 
basically the entire bloody work tool
we've<00:03:25.880> got<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.720> EK<00:03:27.590> full<00:03:28.160> block<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:28.730> the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
we've got the EK full block and the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.400 
we've got the EK full block and the
Southbridge<00:03:30.200> coming<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.970> i<00:03:31.970> also<00:03:32.239> got<00:03:32.600> having

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
Southbridge coming and i also got having

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.330 
Southbridge coming and i also got having
decided<00:03:34.090> completely<00:03:35.090> but<00:03:35.450> I'm<00:03:36.340> earmarking

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
decided completely but I'm earmarking

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.660 
decided completely but I'm earmarking
this<00:03:37.519> for<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.850> 6990<00:03:38.720> water-cooled<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.829> that's

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
this for a 6990 water-cooled so that's

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.840 
this for a 6990 water-cooled so that's
pretty<00:03:40.970> cool<00:03:41.030> got<00:03:41.480> dominate<00:03:41.810> around<00:03:42.549> so<00:03:43.549> three

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
pretty cool got dominate around so three

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.140 
pretty cool got dominate around so three
off<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.329> 6-speed<00:03:45.260> were<00:03:45.769> cool<00:03:45.980> as<00:03:46.160> well<00:03:46.340> so<00:03:47.090> you

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
off a 6-speed were cool as well so you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.569 
off a 6-speed were cool as well so you
can<00:03:47.209> really<00:03:47.420> see<00:03:48.130> there<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.459> be<00:03:49.519> a

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
can really see there is going to be a

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.009 
can really see there is going to be a
longer<00:03:49.880> one<00:03:50.000> point<00:03:50.269> here<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:50.900> you

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
longer one point here so what you

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.640 
longer one point here so what you
essentially<00:03:51.410> see<00:03:51.739> here<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:54.200> going<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.440> change

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
essentially see here is going to change

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.650 
essentially see here is going to change
a<00:03:55.040> lot<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.900> will<00:03:57.049> probably<00:03:57.290> notice<00:03:57.680> that

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
a lot you will probably notice that

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
a lot you will probably notice that
they've<00:03:59.660> done<00:03:59.810> away<00:04:00.019> with<00:04:00.049> really<00:04:00.410> really

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
they've done away with really really

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.410 
they've done away with really really
cool<00:04:00.859> we're<00:04:01.130> writing<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.609> there<00:04:01.730> he<00:04:01.880> studies

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
cool we're writing that there he studies

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.980 
cool we're writing that there he studies
have<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:02.930> pieces<00:04:03.319> stuck<00:04:04.040> cool

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
have like pieces stuck cool

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
have like pieces stuck cool
write<00:04:05.990> a<00:04:06.020> whole<00:04:06.200> bunch<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.500> stuff<00:04:06.680> in<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:06.860> back

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
write a whole bunch of stuff in the back

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.460 
write a whole bunch of stuff in the back
but<00:04:07.940> they<00:04:08.000> don't<00:04:08.180> have<00:04:08.240> that<00:04:08.330> anymore<00:04:08.480> some<00:04:09.380> of

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
but they don't have that anymore some of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.720 
but they don't have that anymore some of
the<00:04:09.530> more<00:04:09.650> important<00:04:10.070> points<00:04:10.310> is<00:04:10.490> that<00:04:10.640> you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
the more important points is that you

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.670 
the more important points is that you
have<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.150> PCI<00:04:12.400> bay<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:14.780> got<00:04:14.930> your<00:04:15.020> PCI<00:04:15.350> you've

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
have a PCI bay you got your PCI you've

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.970 
have a PCI bay you got your PCI you've
got<00:04:15.830> two<00:04:16.130> x<00:04:16.820> 16<00:04:17.330> ports<00:04:17.750> for<00:04:18.140> your<00:04:18.230> crossfire<00:04:18.650> or

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
got two x 16 ports for your crossfire or

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.690 
got two x 16 ports for your crossfire or
sli<00:04:20.860> and<00:04:21.860> then<00:04:22.460> you've<00:04:22.580> got<00:04:22.760> reset<00:04:23.420> and<00:04:23.690> start

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
sli and then you've got reset and start

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.610 
sli and then you've got reset and start
which<00:04:25.700> is<00:04:25.820> really<00:04:26.030> cool<00:04:26.210> because<00:04:26.620> anyone

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
which is really cool because anyone

a start button on their mother boy and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.870 
a start button on their mother boy and
pace<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:33.770> tend<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.100> do<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.400> lot<00:04:34.610> with<00:04:34.850> a

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
pace just tend to do that a lot with a

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
pace just tend to do that a lot with a
lot<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.210> stuff<00:04:36.400> you've<00:04:37.400> got<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.900> battery

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
lot of that stuff you've got a battery

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.980 
lot of that stuff you've got a battery
the<00:04:39.800> CMOS<00:04:40.180> but<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.390> actually<00:04:41.480> take<00:04:41.780> out

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
the CMOS but you can actually take out

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.780 
the CMOS but you can actually take out
from<00:04:42.170> the<00:04:42.230> side<00:04:42.440> which<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.650> really<00:04:42.950> cool<00:04:43.160> but

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
from the side which is really cool but

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.490 
from the side which is really cool but
you<00:04:43.910> won't<00:04:44.060> need<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:44.360> because<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:45.110> CMOS

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
you won't need that because the CMOS

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.270 
you won't need that because the CMOS
