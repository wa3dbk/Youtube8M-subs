00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.030
 and that since the cost that 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.050
 and the angel may 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.609
 but undoubtedly for many the kiko does not dance in the cinema 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.320
 in fact it is Tony I work 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.640
 the character he made to do from the left 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.510
 she had made movies like cheek or like the woman's boy 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.830
 but his success for what happened 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.840
 another 80 as a lot of commercial failure 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.720
 then kuehne tarantino resurrected him in the 90s 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.430
 he was successful in the other and now he is an icon again and now with all the

 retirement boom if you do not put on jeffrÃ©n after done but travolta

 keep making the peaks bolado in high and I do not mean only the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.500
 planes that shooting 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.470
 by the way in all this 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.370
 10 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.710
 debrahlee Saturday night was the movie quite popular although something 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.430
 crushed by criticism 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.480
 it was based on a supposed chronicle about working class youth 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.440
 they danced said every Saturday 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.230
 clear that this chronicle turned out to be invented 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.290
 but still it became an icon for his generation 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.920
 the soundtrack of the bikinis in collaboration with another sing later 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 total success 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.230
 and also provoked a series of 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.190
 of response c movies comedies of situations 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.860

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.630
 Mexican contest program called Monday's closing where all the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.630

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.430
