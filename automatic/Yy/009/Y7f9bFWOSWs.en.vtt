00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 in today's video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.629
 how to put on this device have been 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.530
 wall here is for him to stay on top of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.530
 head of my bed will need 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.710
 fabric and if you choose here you 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 important that you buy fabric for 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.279
 sofa cover because it has not been a 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.769
 but little juninho than conventional 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.740
 and this makes it much easier to apply 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.050
 And I'm not going to put it on. 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.460
 put snail glue debut in the very 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.040
 It takes a lot of work to take 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.530
 Later when I nailed senai 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.739
 I want to change then I'll use this tape 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.620
 here 's where that tape sets strong 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.500
 which is super tough then do everything 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.930
 the process with it and I will also need 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.950
 a pair of scissors to cut the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 fabric 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.399
 so go and start the finishing 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.670
 I made this cut pretty here in the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.049
 because it's the following we go 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.960
 give it like it's a bar 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.090
 With that hand you 'll put it like that. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.220
 and will putting china will rolling in the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.460
 wall is to stay like this and this 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.320
 part here will also enter the 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.840
 finish can be perfect not 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.580
 that part of the fabric was then 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.619
 when you're pasting the wall 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.930
 You go with the same hand you go. 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.790
 placing it down and fixing it in the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.090
 Cola taking care always to stay 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.409
 light quiet and just doing it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.979
 people are very easy 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.020
 I'll show you how I did it. 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.079
 Good people I've been sticking here some 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.630
 small pieces of tape fastens and you 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.540
 leaves a space of June more or less 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.880
 thus for each other here already we have to 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.920
 I put it in already I took the protection chain 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.930
 and there you go putting in all the space 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.560
 giving a distance course from a pro 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.560
 another is 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.560
 We can see how easy it is here. 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.780
 O 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.439
 Here is the tape and here I am alone. 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.960
 remembering with my hand and I'm talking 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.060
 There you come and set up very well and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.360
 here's another little piece of tape I'm going 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.950
 from white ac until you reach the other 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.140
 little piece of cloth 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.129
 singing and it's okay to know our part 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:25.349
 here I have already done the reporter then already 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:28.230
 I also fixed it does not go so well 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.920
 here in the middle I leave putting some 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.050
 pieces of tape to be able to and stick 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.180
 It's better not to be loose here then. 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.580
 it was in the middle of the street scattered you go 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.150
 placing some small pieces of tape 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:03:47.989
 fix it better and that's it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:03:50.989
 [Music]

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.130
 Good people, this is the end result here. 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.490
 from my wall and how can you see 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.250
 stayed like this look much like 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.830
 any failure but the advantage of a 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.410
 tissue, you spend much less drugs 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.220
 the device you can take and place the 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.480
