00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.910
 hi girls and boys 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.410
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.119
 new video so this time it's 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.230
 not a tag but a tutorial then I see 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.279
 you ask if there is something that has 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.449
 changed if there has been a change 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.710
 because in fact I went to the 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.980
 barber move a new haircut 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.539
 hair 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.340
 which made me think that I have to 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.470
 do my hairstyle routine so this 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.610
 will I think within a week of you 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.080
 open watch a little bit and tricks 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.910
 a little tip to style you all 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.410
 mornings like me first tutorial it's 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.059
 a nail art tutorial because I tell myself that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.860
 it would be fun to show you my 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.820
 little trick the little technique for 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.260
 to do funny things on his nails 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.579
 for this tutorial I imposed myself a 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.809
 constraint the one to show you three 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.980
 different patterns that each time 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.870
 reflects some of the personalities 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.199
 like that you learn to do both 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.159
 nail art is both knowing me 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.359
 so the first motive that I got 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.949
 done is a pattern that expresses a little 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.460
 how to say my tolerant and open side 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.659
 spirit 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.550
 actually says to try to draw me a 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.899
 rainbow on the nail because actually 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.629
 ball rainbow is a bit like 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:01.299
 flag sent the flag the report 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.530
 advise what the one who presents the 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.420
 so I chose varnishes from the range 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.770
 iceland girl for me this range has 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.570
 really pretty colors what is 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.159
 perfect for my rainbow I'm going 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.939
 so come applied band after band 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.649
 each color 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.939
 I know it's not really respecting 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.020
 the right colors of the arc flag in 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.369
 heaven but finally good I was not good 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.259
 polish on me finally you understood 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.909
 the idea that my advice is good 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.649
 let dry between each band and 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.119
 this is a first round of fact the 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.500
 second reason is a little star 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.060
 because in fact that represents my side 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.859
 a little dreamy a little head elsewhere 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.240
 but not committed all the time game you 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.710
 often have to head to the moon finally 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.969
 in the end blow his own stars 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.340
 but it can be a first 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.359
 step in the street of the star 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.890
 so I apply my base before coming 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.299
 put a white polish I chose the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.070
 nail from topshop because it's my 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.420
 favorite simply I come so in 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.399
 apply once and it's important 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.719
 that my base to dry then with my 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.880
 fluo julien pen draw contours 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.200
 of the star for the little anecdote I 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.369
 never really knew how to draw the stars 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.840
 so since kindergarten I do 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.729
 always the same my little tip that I 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.649
 you book here is to draw two 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.579
 triangles finally I fill her the canvases 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.280
 with my favorite color 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.780
 yellow is 2 and third and finally 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.890
 last reason these two little lightning 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.090
 because in fact we say it's a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.740
 real little electric ball 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.319
 so here are these two little ones is clear that 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.759
 present this side a little energetic that 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.170
 gekko so I already apply a 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.500
 layer of emerald green on which I 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.120
 came 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.230
 drawn to change in order to break a 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.520
 little too full of colors that we have 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.680
 from the beginning I will do both 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.610
 flashes in black the very simple I do 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.230
 small forms of s 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.880
 a little broken like the lightning that falls 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.960
 on a tree it may be the reason 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.070
 which requires the most technique of 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.810
 drawing do not hesitate to train yourself 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.950
 on a sheet before once you 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.270
 did that you have your two little ones 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.380
 lightning and that's the third and last 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.670
 finished tab so here I hope that 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.120
 this tutorial has more than you learned 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.770
 lots of things 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.300
 do not hesitate to say in 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.500
 comment what are the small logos 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.570
 the little symbols that characterize you 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.660
 the most or also to give small 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.500
 Advice from Born Barth Councils 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.940
