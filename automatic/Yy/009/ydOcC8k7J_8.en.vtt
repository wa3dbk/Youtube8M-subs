hating video the second part 2 uploaded
yesterday<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.690> believe<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.439> we're<00:00:19.619> rich<00:00:20.490> says

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410

bitcoins<00:00:22.410> are<00:00:22.529> horrible<00:00:22.980> don't<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.550> them

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
bitcoins are horrible don't use them

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.179 
bitcoins are horrible don't use them
this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> rebuttal<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.859> explains

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
this is a rebuttal to that and explains

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.250 
this is a rebuttal to that and explains
why<00:00:26.369> some<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.640> his<00:00:26.760> arguments<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.449> incorrect

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
why some of his arguments are incorrect

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.350 
why some of his arguments are incorrect
so<00:00:30.349> essentially<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.650> guy's<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> good<00:00:32.579> guy<00:00:32.880> he

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
so essentially the guy's a good guy he

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.200 
so essentially the guy's a good guy he
just<00:00:33.690> misses<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.380> few<00:00:34.710> points<00:00:35.130> unlike<00:00:35.969> some<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
just misses a few points unlike some of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.200 
just misses a few points unlike some of
the<00:00:36.239> commentators<00:00:37.250> my<00:00:38.250> video<00:00:38.579> who<00:00:38.910> can't

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the commentators my video who can't

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.930 
the commentators my video who can't
string<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.570> logical<00:00:39.870> sentence<00:00:40.260> go<00:00:40.760> also<00:00:41.760> know

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
string a logical sentence go also know

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.160

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so um one of the counters and said that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.560

bartering now borrowing works using

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.020 
bartering now borrowing works using
apples<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.100> oranges<00:01:30.929> great<00:01:31.929> school<00:01:32.320> thing

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
apples and oranges great school thing

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
apples and oranges great school thing
and<00:01:34.030> then<00:01:34.179> you<00:01:34.270> were<00:01:34.390> still<00:01:34.659> have<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.869> go

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
and then you were still have to go

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.230 
and then you were still have to go
where's<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.220> gold<00:01:36.490> has<00:01:36.700> unique<00:01:36.939> physical

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
where's this gold has unique physical

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.330 
where's this gold has unique physical
characteristics<00:01:38.170> properties<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.069> make<00:01:39.220> it

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
characteristics properties that make it

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.460 
characteristics properties that make it
valuable<00:01:39.840> such<00:01:40.840> as<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.259> know<00:01:41.350> it's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
valuable such as it you know it's

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.809 
valuable such as it you know it's
malleable<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.659> looks<00:01:43.659> nice<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.049> guess<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.520> can

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
malleable it looks nice I guess it can

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.410 
malleable it looks nice I guess it can
be<00:01:45.939> made<00:01:46.119> into<00:01:46.210> coins<00:01:46.479> etc<00:01:47.789> so<00:01:48.789> gold<00:01:49.240> is

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
be made into coins etc so gold is

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.730 
be made into coins etc so gold is
commodity<00:01:49.899> like<00:01:49.960> apples<00:01:50.469> or<00:01:50.560> oranges<00:01:50.590> etc

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
commodity like apples or oranges etc

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.529 
commodity like apples or oranges etc
which<00:01:53.740> is<00:01:53.950> saying<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.369> everyone<00:01:54.939> will<00:01:55.240> want

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
which is saying that everyone will want

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.380 
which is saying that everyone will want
to<00:01:55.599> use<00:01:55.720> gold<00:01:56.610> simple<00:01:57.610> enough<00:01:57.670> stuff<00:01:58.000> that's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
to use gold simple enough stuff that's

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.749 
to use gold simple enough stuff that's
that's<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.079> basic<00:01:59.439> start<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.860> it<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.579> they

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
that's the basic start of it and they

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.149 
that's the basic start of it and they
says<00:02:01.140> dollars<00:02:02.140> are<00:02:02.439> essentially<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:02.890> beats

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
says dollars are essentially just beats

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.789 
says dollars are essentially just beats
paper<00:02:03.459> what<00:02:04.299> are<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.479> end<00:02:04.630> users<00:02:05.140> which<00:02:05.679> I

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
paper what are the end users which I

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.710 
paper what are the end users which I
guess<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.399> I<00:02:07.679> don't<00:02:08.679> like<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.860> term<00:02:09.039> it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
guess is a I don't like the term it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.490 
guess is a I don't like the term it
essentially<00:02:10.720> means<00:02:10.780> who<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.319> to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
essentially means who is going to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.880 
essentially means who is going to
physically<00:02:12.040> consume<00:02:13.000> or<00:02:13.329> use<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.260> product

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
physically consume or use that product

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.230 
physically consume or use that product
in<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.549> way<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.849> is<00:02:15.970> beneficial<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.720> them

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.530 

and<00:02:19.810> he<00:02:20.080> says<00:02:20.290> well<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:21.280> not<00:02:21.490> great<00:02:21.820> but<00:02:21.850> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
and he says well it's not great but the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.530 
and he says well it's not great but the
tax<00:02:22.920> payers<00:02:23.920> are<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.610> end<00:02:24.760> users<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.390> this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
tax payers are the end users of this

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.240 
tax payers are the end users of this
because<00:02:25.870> they<00:02:26.140> have<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.380> pay<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> taxes<00:02:27.070> and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
because they have to pay the taxes and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.030 
because they have to pay the taxes and
dollars<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.140> says<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.500> dollars<00:02:29.860> are

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
dollars so it says the dollars are

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.260 
dollars so it says the dollars are
backed<00:02:30.280> by<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.490> government<00:02:31.030> which

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
backed by the government which

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.760 
backed by the government which
essentially<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:31.990> backed<00:02:32.260> by<00:02:32.320> old<00:02:32.620> people

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
essentially is backed by old people

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.030 
essentially is backed by old people
saying<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.670> know<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:35.260> want<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.950> be

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
saying you know we we want this to be

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.430 
saying you know we we want this to be
our<00:02:36.130> currency<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.940> says<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:37.930> not<00:02:38.110> great<00:02:38.410> but

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
our currency I says it's not great but

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.840 
our currency I says it's not great but
it's<00:02:38.830> better<00:02:39.070> than<00:02:39.160> bitcoins<00:02:39.610> which<00:02:39.730> is

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it's better than bitcoins which is

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.340 
it's better than bitcoins which is
backed<00:02:40.060> by<00:02:40.090> nothing<00:02:40.180> which<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:41.050> will<00:02:41.170> cover

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
backed by nothing which we will cover

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.730 
backed by nothing which we will cover
later<00:02:41.470> but<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.190> not<00:02:42.610> true<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:43.600> when<00:02:44.530> he<00:02:44.590> says

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
later but is not true so when he says

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.340 
later but is not true so when he says
dollars<00:02:45.160> are<00:02:45.310> backed<00:02:45.790> by<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.480> government<00:02:47.050> he

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
dollars are backed by the government he

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.930 
dollars are backed by the government he
doesn't<00:02:47.650> really<00:02:47.740> explain<00:02:48.010> what<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.340> means<00:02:48.370> but

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
doesn't really explain what it means but

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.720 
doesn't really explain what it means but
I<00:02:49.210> think<00:02:50.200> I'm<00:02:50.320> logically<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.220> constructed

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
I think I'm logically be constructed

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.030 
I think I'm logically be constructed
what<00:02:51.880> he<00:02:51.970> means<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.570> we'll<00:02:53.380> cover<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.770> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
what he means so we'll cover that and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.550 
what he means so we'll cover that and
it's<00:02:54.520> essentially<00:02:55.030> two<00:02:55.300> points<00:02:55.690> when<00:02:56.440> you're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
it's essentially two points when you're

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.380 
it's essentially two points when you're
saying<00:02:56.800> dollars<00:02:57.670> are<00:02:57.820> backed<00:02:58.120> by<00:02:58.270> the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
saying dollars are backed by the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.630 
saying dollars are backed by the
government<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.840> mean<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.440> citizens<00:02:59.980> trust

the government for two things two main
things<00:03:03.670> that<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:04.000> thought<00:03:04.240> if<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.600> miss<00:03:04.780> them

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
things that I thought if I miss them

whatever reason and the Euro failed well
your<00:03:22.930> trust<00:03:23.230> was<00:03:23.380> misplaced<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.220> arrow

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
your trust was misplaced in the arrow

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
then because the government will not

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.530 
then because the government will not
hunter<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.130> money<00:03:27.400> no<00:03:27.880> one<00:03:28.030> lot<00:03:28.210> of<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.480> year

hunter that money no one lot of the year
look<00:03:29.689> just<00:03:30.200> an<00:03:30.530> example<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.680> also<00:03:33.829> trust

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:34.219 
look just an example and you also trust

technically can be out of your control

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:44.709 
technically can be out of your control
that's<00:03:41.420> definite<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.849> obviously<00:03:43.849> let's<00:03:44.540> say

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:44.719 
that's definite you obviously let's say

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.330 
that's definite you obviously let's say
Greece<00:03:45.019> failed<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.530> let's<00:03:45.680> say<00:03:45.799> they<00:03:46.069> dragged

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
Greece failed and let's say they dragged

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.789 
Greece failed and let's say they dragged
the<00:03:46.519> year<00:03:46.670> or<00:03:46.790> down<00:03:46.970> with<00:03:47.150> them<00:03:47.269> well<00:03:47.799> the

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
the year or down with them well the

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.619 
the year or down with them well the
European<00:03:49.189> Union<00:03:49.519> can<00:03:49.700> do<00:03:49.849> much<00:03:50.000> except<00:03:50.359> bail

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
European Union can do much except bail

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.130 
European Union can do much except bail
Greece<00:03:50.900> out<00:03:51.079> again<00:03:51.489> to<00:03:52.489> save<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.849> euro<00:03:53.140> that

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
mostly is beyond their control but then

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.089 
mostly is beyond their control but then
you<00:03:59.120> say<00:03:59.299> that<00:03:59.480> thick<00:03:59.689> coins<00:03:59.989> are<00:04:00.230> backed<00:04:00.680> by

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
you say that thick coins are backed by

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:08.010 
you say that thick coins are backed by
nothing<00:04:01.959> which<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:02.989> definitely<00:04:03.709> not<00:04:04.159> true

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.730 

let's<00:04:09.020> use<00:04:09.230> this<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:10.040> same<00:04:10.340> two<00:04:11.300> examples<00:04:12.020> to

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
let's use this the same two examples to

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.020 
let's use this the same two examples to
improve<00:04:13.100> upon<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:14.680> need<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.800> trust<00:04:16.130> Bitcoin<00:04:16.730> to

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
improve upon I need to trust Bitcoin to

improve upon I need to trust Bitcoin to
a<00:04:17.860> will<00:04:18.860> still<00:04:19.400> be<00:04:19.549> around<00:04:19.670> and<00:04:20.150> honor<00:04:20.360> my

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
a will still be around and honor my

a will still be around and honor my
money<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.890> answer<00:04:22.160> is<00:04:22.190> pretty<00:04:22.730> simple<00:04:22.850> as

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
money the answer is pretty simple as

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.960 
money the answer is pretty simple as
long<00:04:23.360> as<00:04:23.780> two<00:04:24.200> people<00:04:24.560> are<00:04:25.130> using<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:25.610> Bitcoin

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
long as two people are using the Bitcoin

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.960 
long as two people are using the Bitcoin
software<00:04:26.890> technically<00:04:27.890> they<00:04:28.280> can<00:04:28.490> still<00:04:28.790> use

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
software technically they can still use

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.860 
software technically they can still use
bitcoins<00:04:29.650> it's<00:04:30.650> it's<00:04:31.610> not<00:04:31.790> an<00:04:31.910> issue<00:04:32.000> since

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
bitcoins it's it's not an issue since

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.570 
bitcoins it's it's not an issue since

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 
else provides so essentially what's

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.839 
else provides so essentially what's
happening<00:07:24.620> when<00:07:24.770> you<00:07:24.830> boil<00:07:25.069> it<00:07:25.279> down<00:07:25.339> is<00:07:25.819> that

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:25.849 
happening when you boil it down is that

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:27.790 
happening when you boil it down is that
you<00:07:26.150> are<00:07:26.270> exchanging<00:07:26.810> your<00:07:26.839> goods<00:07:27.499> and

else's goods or services essentially

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.159 
else's goods or services essentially
bartering<00:07:33.819> but<00:07:34.819> the<00:07:34.939> dollar<00:07:35.270> is<00:07:35.689> a<00:07:35.719> store

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169 
bartering but the dollar is a store

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:39.820 
bartering but the dollar is a store
value<00:07:37.029> stores<00:07:38.029> value<00:07:38.449> and<00:07:38.689> everyone<00:07:39.169> accepts

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
value stores value and everyone accepts

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.139 
value stores value and everyone accepts
it<00:07:40.449> so<00:07:41.449> so<00:07:42.409> essentially<00:07:43.039> instead<00:07:43.849> of<00:07:43.939> just

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:44.149 
it so so essentially instead of just

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:46.420 
it so so essentially instead of just
saying<00:07:44.360> going<00:07:44.749> up<00:07:44.870> so<00:07:45.080> saying<00:07:45.409> I<00:07:45.589> can<00:07:46.279> do

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430 
saying going up so saying I can do

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.980 
saying going up so saying I can do
computer<00:07:46.909> work

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:47.990 
computer work

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.260 
computer work
I<00:07:48.080> want<00:07:48.860> some<00:07:49.220> apples<00:07:49.610> do<00:07:49.970> you<00:07:50.060> need<00:07:50.240> a

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:50.270 
I want some apples do you need a

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.970 
I want some apples do you need a
computer<00:07:50.690> that<00:07:50.840> needs<00:07:51.140> to<00:07:51.290> be<00:07:51.380> worked<00:07:51.410> on<00:07:51.710> and

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:51.980 
computer that needs to be worked on and

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.820 
computer that needs to be worked on and
doing<00:07:52.280> it<00:07:52.460> bartering<00:07:53.030> that<00:07:53.450> way<00:07:53.690> you<00:07:54.290> just<00:07:54.530> use

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:54.830 
doing it bartering that way you just use

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.710 
doing it bartering that way you just use
the<00:07:55.100> dollar<00:07:55.340> to<00:07:55.790> exchange<00:07:56.300> it<00:07:56.480> all<00:07:57.010> so

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 
the dollar to exchange it all so

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.510 
the dollar to exchange it all so
essentially<00:07:59.950> you're<00:08:00.950> saying<00:08:01.010> that<00:08:01.340> the

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 
essentially you're saying that the

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.210 
essentially you're saying that the
dollar<00:08:01.850> is<00:08:02.210> money<00:08:03.080> laundering

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:05.220 
dollar is money laundering

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.920 
dollar is money laundering
because<00:08:05.910> it's<00:08:06.060> just<00:08:06.840> an<00:08:07.410> exchange<00:08:08.750> for<00:08:09.750> goods

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:09.930 
because it's just an exchange for goods

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.999 
because it's just an exchange for goods
and<00:08:10.080> services

00:08:11.999 --> 00:08:12.009 
and services

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:14.069 
and services
