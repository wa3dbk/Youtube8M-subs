00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.359
 5 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.610
 highlighted I do not understand what is a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.610
 kind of square 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.750
 quadrilateral 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.180
 framed in which we have to run 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.529
 with cadiz those who said the cars I'm 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.160
 third if I had had but that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.110
 he says then I do not understand god I do not understand 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.370
 equal now let's make the rematch is 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.200
 proposed very contrary we have given 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.450
 back because he has put a spin and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 the race that lasts about 500 meters 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:53.129
 in the box half but that 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.659
 well actually start a little late 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.510
 therefore I think it has been the mistake 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.460
 but it does not matter the fact is that I joined 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.670
 uncle model I actually believe and a vision 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.559
 night and that could be qualified as 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.750
 some glasses to see under the water 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.600
 because they are like binoculars in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.970
 reality under the eyes that equal 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.200
 ok let's try to win this race 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.520
 as possible 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.380
 I go is active and I know what this is 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.759
 pathetic this typical to just the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.560
 I had the impulse to try 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.960
 throw me but in the end it has been repeated like this 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.220
 that we could say that he is a subscriber 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.780
 good people is good is bad people but 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.990
 it's really good people because it has 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990
 rectified 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.470
 the curve are well and sticking to all 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.750
 to see if with a little bit of luck 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.940
 I get it and see that as a mica that portu 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.259
 compost they go is total you were the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.299
 Look how I have the car in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.490
 white in front of me I'm going to paste is the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.990
 talent a lot from wolf to girl and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.000
 last I think you 're telling me uncle 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 but if these things vision 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.180
 ging local reality and I despair 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.150
 too uncle the cadets wait 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.040
 we raise up my god my god the car 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.850
 red you left me you left local slipstream 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.850
 and you can catch slipstream 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.940
 what can you do with that, then cars and 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.350
 rebujos because I do not understand it I'll go 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.090
 it was activated and there is a ticket already finished 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.290
 but please because people are 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.900
 but with the cali but what is happening 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.980
 the week shipping for men and not 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.459
 gait are put back 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.500
 unfortunate innovating is that it is 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.870
 unfortunate uncle exists that berni dif and 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 more than 24 seconds line for mf 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.220
 mother 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.959
 this is all this is very pathetic not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.030
 I want another rematch if the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.070

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.230
 good point and ball yes yes yes yes is the 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.180
 won if we go more modern than if I win 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.440
 or what looks for the moment I go first is 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.030
 indicated a kind of problem like that are left and 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.280
 please do not complicate your life now 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.050
 so what happens partner and you are 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.880
 quiet good good there's a guy 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.290
 that has not passed the laps nothing more 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.730
 start the race and I do not have to catch 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.530
 the jump that where we say 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.180
 trampita cacho but when it's worth it already 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.189
 we go third 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.189
 quite together I trusted that I am 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.879
 this kid while he wins put a 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.049
 vocal command shot I swear it or a mouthful 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.049
 the subscriber that the cavatina also 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.130
 Now what do I do , what do I do a lot? 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.410
 that this throws me to the other side 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.560
 I have a slam that came to Jupiter and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.410
 Wait, man, let's try 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.680
 go up we will give fact in the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.680
 lifetime 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:43.120
 this race is already because of this wave won or 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.050
 side later I changed the color because 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.550
 I think the green color is giving me 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.840
 bad vibrations or to compete to 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.620
 someone to compete someone is 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.380
 bringing trampitas to the eye because first 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.650
 without any kind of buts because they are 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.650
 bad 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:05.010
 actually rather together if someone 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.080
 that hits yes or yes 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.730
 ok a little bit little by little there 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.680
 we are without falling not making it perfect 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.300
 if you calm and enjoying the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.350
 career and what changes the color of 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.950
 car because I think the green is 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.470
 giving bad vibrations to my god and the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.330
 blue then I shit in your room is 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.290
 possible to finish this career tivo is 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.930
 impossible to be impossible said my mother 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.860
 I go fifth I said that macho is that macho 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.910
 but really because people like that 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.990
 we go 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.670
 I'm leaving the world today is the last time 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.790
 he tried it and it's like this so I'm going to 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.280
 win I have something inside of me will not be a 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:53.680
 cold 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:05:00.710
 it's normal 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:04.450
 the world of the mind is that my luck 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:18.830
 incredible for this the key is in 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:22.040
 this fourth quarter world the first that 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.920
 he was getting into the car inside the 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.420
 wall but but guess my mother 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.980
 Companion, I already know that you fall 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.590
 is not even a hair of anyone is worth and 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.450
 third I'm third the first one is the one 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.110
 he goes there yellowish and he is not going to get caught 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.110
 in the life god 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.470
 is the second one that is going to stick 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.530
 we have here is the first nothing I do not 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.940
 Uncle said I married a digestive to 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.840
 electrical and pass something 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.840

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.470
 around here colleagues and well I see it 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.970
 At least we have been second and 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.979
 it's something 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:08.150
 in all the fields we are staying 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:11.020
 last you can take six you approximate us 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.020

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.400
 yes
