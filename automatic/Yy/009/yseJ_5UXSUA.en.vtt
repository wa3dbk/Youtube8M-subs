00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone, bee and this is the second 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.759
 a series of mechanism using mods in 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
 second series we will tell you how 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.790
 build such a wonderful myth when 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.440
 help mod red power 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.430
 Now Nikitos will tell you how 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.449
 build it yes mean elevators and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.279
 pretty simple design 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.279
 the only difficulty in it is 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 logical system 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.740
 which will accordingly raise 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.960
 this elevator up and down here means elevator 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.780
 made by ussr and pavlovsk frames and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.219
 Now we will show you the principle 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.700
 his work is not the right principle 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.870
 showed you his works here 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.870
 penny pretty laguchy 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:57.360
 mighty lift on the ascent only downhill 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:03.930
 it works more or less well 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:08.580
 mean pretty smooth elevator in terms of 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 the plan quickly you are not and not as noisy as 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.880
 a sheet on tarlan pistons is very easy too 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.790
 very easy to raise this mix 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.900
 raise the height of this summer here and now 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.720
 we will show you how you build a step 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.000
 number one we dig out the pit here 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.460
 here are the forms 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 6 blocks deep why in 6 because 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.439
 at shift the height of our sheet is six 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 blocks 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 that is, two or three times four 5 5 we will not give them yet 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 6 step number two build small 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:59.030
 build an elevator platform and finish 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.030
 her auras like i am showing now 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:14.520
 step number three d 3 heat set two 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.190
 frame tarot wires and bat box to 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.620
 power free motors 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.770
 how to put from the motors here this set 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.650
 so here is this sam here and so cool 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.209
 screwdriver twice right click 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.330
 so that this one looked up that is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:39.330
 this hour is watching the world and this one is looking down 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.830
 step number four build a diagram 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.610
 elevator controls you can crawl 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.019
 video and completely copy this diagram 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.019
 now more about the scheme itself 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:02.330
 recipients rather that the receiver should 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:04.950
 stand purity other than 0 as well 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:10.200
 there must be purity that is not yet 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.090
 they later occupied here further timer 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.690
 it should be a timer interval 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.560
 about 0.8 seconds but no less 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.010
 I mean that more can be but 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.190
 less can the elevator just break down 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.140
 and if you play on some open 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.090
 server, it is desirable to put somewhere 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.430
 for a minute because because of the lags 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.310
 server elevator you can just 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:42.900
 break further in the counter maximum 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:49.650
 Count put such a number 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:53.910
 to which the number means elevator height -1 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.100
 that is, five maximum decrement set 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.230
 same as the maximum call increment 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:04.590
 leave the unit here just do not forget 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.600
 close the plus side of us fore 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.440
 here 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:14.400
 further 2 gate absolute and not 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.660
 identical here is one nuance of a screwdriver 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.420
 sandwiched shifty 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:26.790
 you need to twist them so that it was only 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:29.360
 two inputs as shown here is the last hour 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.170
 step close the whole thing carpeted 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.810
 put the ladder for beauty and 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.660
 directly put the second floor 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.310
 also need to put a call button 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.930
 it is done using a block of a button and 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.620
 transmitter is boiled transmitter out 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.380
 fashion airless redstone by the way forgot 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.490
 add that here besides the city power we 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.360
 still used 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.640
 Wiles redstone bone7 bus can be 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.810
 principle can be without it 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:07.520
 enter the redstone wiring right there 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:15.870
 Now for the place of this here receivers 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:19.490
 get the same effect so here 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.490
 all found ready to experience 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:37.800
 that's enough to modify the elevator 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:45.060
 just dig up the elevator shaft here in 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:48.229
 this place we go down and here 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.759
 down here 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.520
 digging mine down so blocks 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.229
 how much you want to increase if then 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.610
 add frames and be sure 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:02.419
 closing their feces on this in principle all 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.530
 You had advice Meng bang

 bye everyone
