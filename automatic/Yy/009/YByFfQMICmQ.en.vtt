could see the script after seeing the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
could see the script after seeing the
film<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.720> you'd<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.500> was<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
film because you'd see it was in the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.120 
film because you'd see it was in the
concept<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> execution<00:01:37.049> obviously<00:01:37.920> had

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
concept and the execution obviously had

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.520 
concept and the execution obviously had
to<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.479> pretty<00:01:39.479> terrific<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.079> make<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.350> work

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to be pretty terrific to make it work

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.889 
to be pretty terrific to make it work
but<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> was<00:01:41.340> conceived<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
but but it was conceived this way the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.510 
but but it was conceived this way the
intercutting<00:01:43.290> between<00:01:43.680> different<00:01:44.070> realities

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
intercutting between different realities

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.359 
intercutting between different realities
was<00:01:44.909> basically<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> wasn't<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.220> was

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
was basically as as if it wasn't it was

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
was basically as as if it wasn't it was
in<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> screenplay<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.750> that's<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.200> hooked

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
in the screenplay so that's what hooked

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.749 
in the screenplay so that's what hooked
me<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.759> at<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.970> point<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.360> met<00:01:51.869> Rob<00:01:52.759> who

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
me and and at that point I met Rob who

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.350 
me and and at that point I met Rob who
had<00:01:53.939> only<00:01:54.119> done<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
had only done and

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.890 
had only done and
on<00:01:55.600> television<00:01:56.170> which<00:01:57.070> we<00:01:57.280> did<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.490> very

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
on television which we did a very

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.290 
on television which we did a very
terrific<00:01:58.900> job<00:01:59.440> with<00:01:59.470> but<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.010> was<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:01.060> a<00:02:01.120> big

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
terrific job with but it was it's a big

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.130 
terrific job with but it was it's a big
leap<00:02:01.510> from<00:02:01.720> Matt<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.410> do<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:04.570> think<00:02:04.780> we

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
leap from Matt to do this and I think we

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.250
