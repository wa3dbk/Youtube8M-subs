reason<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.829> sure<00:01:49.979> why<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.310> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
reason I'm not sure why that is

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.420 
reason I'm not sure why that is
this<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.409> followed<00:01:52.710> me<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.250> killed

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
you turn that corner because there's

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.569 
you turn that corner because there's
those<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:00.390> brutes<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.840> jackal<00:02:01.340> go<00:02:02.340> through

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
here go I like to go to the left because

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.050 
here go I like to go to the left because
a<00:02:04.350> lot<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.590> times<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.009> jackal<00:02:05.670> will<00:02:05.790> follow

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
a lot of times that jackal will follow

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.460 
a lot of times that jackal will follow
you<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.710> start<00:02:08.280> shooting<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.020> I'm<00:02:10.020> not

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
reason so that was kind of weird got

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.720 
reason so that was kind of weird got
kind<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.940> little<00:02:20.060> bit<00:02:20.210> lucky<00:02:20.390> there<00:02:20.660> but

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
kind of a little bit lucky there but

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.640 
kind of a little bit lucky there but
even<00:02:22.730> if<00:02:22.820> even<00:02:23.600> if<00:02:23.780> there<00:02:23.930> are<00:02:24.050> four<00:02:24.290> brutes<00:02:24.530> I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
over here by this tree what we're gonna

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.190 
over here by this tree what we're gonna

there on top of the rock and we get on
top<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.690> level<00:04:13.300> I'm<00:04:14.300> just<00:04:14.600> trying<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.840> spot

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
further back where we started there's a

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.839 
further back where we started there's a
little<00:04:27.900> ramp<00:04:28.319> going<00:04:28.949> down<00:04:29.220> here<00:04:29.460> down<00:04:29.699> this

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
little ramp going down here down this

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.930 
little ramp going down here down this
cliff<00:04:30.169> but<00:04:31.169> don't<00:04:31.800> back<00:04:32.280> up<00:04:32.310> too<00:04:32.610> much<00:04:32.789> because

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
cliff but don't back up too much because

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.510 
cliff but don't back up too much because
it's<00:04:33.270> not<00:04:33.449> uh<00:04:33.479> not<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.080> very<00:04:34.319> long<00:04:34.560> ramp<00:04:34.889> so

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
it's not uh not a very long ramp so

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.279 
it's not uh not a very long ramp so
you'll<00:04:35.970> fall<00:04:36.240> off<00:04:36.270> if<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.810> do<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.259> i

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
you'll fall off if you do it so i

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.040 
you'll fall off if you do it so i
cloaked<00:04:37.530> here<00:04:37.849> jumped<00:04:38.849> kind<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.870> wedged

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
cloaked here jumped kind of wedged

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.710 
cloaked here jumped kind of wedged
myself<00:04:40.169> in<00:04:40.620> between<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:41.099> tree<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.539> rock

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
myself in between the tree and the rock

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.379 
myself in between the tree and the rock
face<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.319> then<00:04:44.310> jumped<00:04:44.669> up<00:04:44.759> again<00:04:45.000> from<00:04:45.150> there

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
face and then jumped up again from there

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.930 
face and then jumped up again from there
and<00:04:45.770> now<00:04:46.770> I'm<00:04:46.889> just<00:04:47.069> kind<00:04:47.460> of<00:04:47.490> hugging<00:04:47.729> the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and now I'm just kind of hugging the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.960 
and now I'm just kind of hugging the
left<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.479> little<00:04:48.720> bit<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:49.849> avoid<00:04:50.849> getting

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
left a little bit to avoid getting

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.350 
left a little bit to avoid getting
sniped<00:04:53.599> but<00:04:54.599> this<00:04:54.840> is<00:04:54.990> pretty<00:04:55.169> much<00:04:55.349> it<00:04:55.560> I<00:04:56.360> used

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
sniped but this is pretty much it I used

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.390 
sniped but this is pretty much it I used
to<00:04:57.419> end<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.630> level<00:04:57.870> by<00:04:58.069> dropping<00:04:59.069> down<00:04:59.190> with<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
to end the level by dropping down with a

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.670 
to end the level by dropping down with a
fuel<00:04:59.669> rod<00:04:59.819> and<00:05:00.150> fuel<00:05:00.840> routing<00:05:01.110> myself<00:05:01.440> once

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
fuel rod and fuel routing myself once

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.290 
fuel rod and fuel routing myself once
you<00:05:01.949> slow<00:05:02.190> my<00:05:02.340> descent<00:05:02.699> down<00:05:02.909> to<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.180> right

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
you slow my descent down to the right

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.870 
you slow my descent down to the right
and<00:05:03.479> then<00:05:04.409> I<00:05:04.470> found<00:05:04.650> out<00:05:04.830> that's<00:05:05.460> completely

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
and then I found out that's completely

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.899 
and then I found out that's completely
unnecessary<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:09.240> could<00:05:09.389> actually<00:05:09.569> just<00:05:10.909> walk

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
unnecessary you could actually just walk

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.930 
unnecessary you could actually just walk
right<00:05:12.180> here<00:05:13.039> right<00:05:14.039> about<00:05:14.340> here<00:05:14.729> and<00:05:14.880> that

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
right here right about here and that

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.350 
right here right about here and that
ends<00:05:15.599> the<00:05:15.720> level<00:05:15.990> which<00:05:16.199> is<00:05:16.349> freaking<00:05:17.190> awesome

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
ends the level which is freaking awesome

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.430 
ends the level which is freaking awesome
