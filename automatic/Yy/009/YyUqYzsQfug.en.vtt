00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
the strap is can be removable so that I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:25.910 
the strap is can be removable so that I
have<00:02:18.570> um<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:21.680> thing<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.470> doesn't

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.320 
want to use it you just take it off
which<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.680> don't<00:02:28.920> really<00:02:29.190> use<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.520> much<00:02:29.730> I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
which is I don't really use it much I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.300 
which is I don't really use it much I
like<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.810> handle<00:02:31.050> like<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:33.420> handles<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.410> I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
like to handle like the handles and I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.840 
like to handle like the handles and I
just<00:02:35.490> carry<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.030> without<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.480> handles<00:02:36.810> and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
just carry that without the handles and

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.250 
just carry that without the handles and
sometimes<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.180> handles<00:02:39.630> really<00:02:39.870> annoying

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
sometimes the handles really annoying

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.500 
sometimes the handles really annoying
this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.680> flapping<00:02:41.040> over<00:02:41.640> all<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.970> time<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
this is flapping over all the time and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.110 
this is flapping over all the time and
yeah<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:47.120> let<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:49.080> what<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.620> inside<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.880> just

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
yeah and let see what is inside I just

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.040 
yeah and let see what is inside I just
bring<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.690> today<00:02:51.959> this<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:54.420> not<00:02:54.720> really

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
bring it today this and it's not really

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.860 
bring it today this and it's not really
much<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:56.100> put<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:56.940> really<00:02:57.350> slim<00:02:58.760> inside

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
much to put in it's really slim inside

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.390 
much to put in it's really slim inside
so<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.800> is<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.220> insight<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.330> today

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
so this is the insight that I have today

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.030 
so this is the insight that I have today
and<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.080> go<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.290> work<00:03:07.650> all<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.010> time

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and I have to go to work all the time
