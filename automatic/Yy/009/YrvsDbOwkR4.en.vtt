main points that I love about it and the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.060 
main points that I love about it and the
first<00:00:59.039> one<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> concave<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:01.230> perfect

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.210 
first one is the concave it is perfect
um<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:03.300> decks<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.989> can't<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.830> feel<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
um some decks you can't really feel the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.770 
um some decks you can't really feel the
board<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.549> well<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.030> feet<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
board that well with your feet if you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.910 
board that well with your feet if you
don't<00:01:06.930> skateboard<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.439> probably<00:01:07.740> doesn't

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
don't skateboard that probably doesn't

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250

make<00:01:08.010> sense<00:01:08.250> um<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.990> probably

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
make sense um but if you do you probably

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.320 
make sense um but if you do you probably
skated<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> deck<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.700> doesn't<00:01:11.970> feel

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
