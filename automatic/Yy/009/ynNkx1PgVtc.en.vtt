walk<00:03:09.040> through<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.610> finesse<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.030> weak<00:03:10.209> foot

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
walk through and finesse it weak foot

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.650

Wellington<00:03:11.620> goes<00:03:11.769> through<00:03:11.950> here<00:03:12.269> nice<00:03:13.269> chop

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
Wellington goes through here nice chop

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.810 
Wellington goes through here nice chop
to<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> weak<00:03:14.200> foot<00:03:14.440> finesse<00:03:14.769> into<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.250> far<00:03:15.489> net

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
to a weak foot finesse into the far net

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.289 
to a weak foot finesse into the far net
and<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.079> 37th<00:03:17.890> minute<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.250> think<00:03:18.459> was

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
and then in this 37th minute I think was

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.819 
and then in this 37th minute I think was
like<00:03:19.329> no<00:03:19.780> man<00:03:19.959> goes<00:03:20.170> through<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.560> obviously

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
like no man goes through and obviously

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.840 
like no man goes through and obviously
he's<00:03:20.920> never<00:03:21.040> gonna<00:03:21.220> miss<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> finesse<00:03:21.820> shot

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
he's never gonna miss a finesse shot

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:22.410 
he's never gonna miss a finesse shot
from<00:03:22.120> there

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
from there

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.270 
from there
he's<00:03:22.690> never<00:03:22.900> gonna<00:03:23.079> miss<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.350> finesse<00:03:23.680> shot<00:03:23.709> .

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
he's never gonna miss a finesse shot .

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.759 
he's never gonna miss a finesse shot .
then<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.450> we<00:03:25.540> had<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.690> 2-1<00:03:25.989> lead<00:03:26.230> there<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.620> then

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
then so we had a 2-1 lead there and then

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.039 
then so we had a 2-1 lead there and then
kack<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.489> went<00:03:27.670> through<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.910> 19th<00:03:28.299> minute<00:03:28.570> love

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
very solid defenders as well but I

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.320 
very solid defenders as well but I
managed<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.490> break<00:06:00.640> through<00:06:00.700> them<00:06:01.060> in<00:06:01.180> the

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
managed to break through them in the

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.969 
managed to break through them in the
35th<00:06:01.750> minute<00:06:01.930> just<00:06:02.320> about<00:06:02.650> look<00:06:02.800> at<00:06:02.860> his

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
35th minute just about look at his

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.010 
35th minute just about look at his
attacker<00:06:03.070> off<00:06:03.520> the<00:06:03.910> post<00:06:04.150> off<00:06:04.419> the<00:06:04.540> keeper<00:06:04.930> and

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
attacker off the post off the keeper and

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.140 
attacker off the post off the keeper and
in<00:06:05.140> so<00:06:05.380> a<00:06:05.560> very<00:06:06.010> lucky<00:06:06.250> gold<00:06:06.490> but<00:06:06.640> I<00:06:06.669> had<00:06:06.940> kind

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
in so a very lucky gold but I had kind

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.640 
in so a very lucky gold but I had kind
of<00:06:07.240> dominate<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.750> match<00:06:07.900> up<00:06:08.140> to<00:06:08.260> that<00:06:08.290> stage

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
of dominate the match up to that stage

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.100 
of dominate the match up to that stage
so<00:06:08.919> I<00:06:09.130> guess<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:09.669> deserved<00:06:09.970> it<00:06:10.150> then<00:06:10.600> just<00:06:10.810> for<00:06:11.050> I

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
so I guess I deserved it then just for I

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.110

find<00:06:11.380> well<00:06:11.680> if<00:06:11.800> it<00:06:11.950> goes<00:06:12.100> through<00:06:12.340> he's<00:06:12.970> going

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
find well if it goes through he's going
