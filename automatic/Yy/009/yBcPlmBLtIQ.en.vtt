league learn the rules learn the schemes

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.620 
league learn the rules learn the schemes
defensively<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.280> learn<00:02:26.730> offensive<00:02:27.360> sets

defensively and learn offensive sets

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.670 
defensively and learn offensive sets
that<00:02:27.960> that<00:02:28.680> teams<00:02:28.950> run<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.990> know<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.560> it

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
that that teams run you know because it

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680 
that that teams run you know because it
is<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> different<00:02:32.490> game<00:02:32.640> there's<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.940> 24-second

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
is a different game there's a 24-second

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.870 
is a different game there's a 24-second
shot<00:02:33.720> clock<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:35.460> know<00:02:35.550> there's<00:02:35.730> certain

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
shot clock you know there's certain

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.940 
shot clock you know there's certain
rules<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.570> legal<00:02:36.780> defenses<00:02:37.350> things<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.770> that

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
rules of legal defenses things like that

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.950 
rules of legal defenses things like that
so<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.700> different<00:02:38.970> than<00:02:39.270> coaching<00:02:39.540> in<00:02:39.810> high

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
so it's different than coaching in high

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.910 
so it's different than coaching in high
school<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.530> college<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:42.540> being<00:02:42.780> said<00:02:43.020> you

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
