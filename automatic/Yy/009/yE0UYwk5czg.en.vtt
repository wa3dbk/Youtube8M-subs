Finn machine gives you great visibility
all<00:00:47.360> around<00:00:47.750> actually<00:00:48.020> you've<00:00:48.500> got<00:00:48.530> open

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
all around actually you've got open

sides right foot in the shed because

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.920 
sides right foot in the shed because
it's<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.790> pivot<00:00:53.059> seer<00:00:53.239> obviously<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:53.870> very

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
it's a pivot seer obviously it's very

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.680 
it's a pivot seer obviously it's very
good<00:00:54.290> for<00:00:54.350> maneuverability<00:00:55.540> all<00:00:56.540> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
good for maneuverability all the

the<00:01:00.110> right-hand<00:01:00.379> joystick<00:01:00.710> as<00:01:01.610> usual<00:01:02.379> your

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
the right-hand joystick as usual your

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.880 
the right-hand joystick as usual your
hydraulics<00:01:03.830> are<00:01:04.040> on<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.900> auxilary<00:01:05.900> lever

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
hydraulics are on this auxilary lever

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.570 
hydraulics are on this auxilary lever
here<00:01:07.280> which<00:01:07.660> is<00:01:08.660> okay<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:09.560> could<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.100> be<00:01:10.250> doing

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
here which is okay but could it be doing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.330 
here which is okay but could it be doing
with<00:01:10.850> being<00:01:11.240> on<00:01:11.390> the<00:01:11.420> joystick<00:01:12.190> it's<00:01:13.190> got<00:01:13.310> a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
with being on the joystick it's got a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.310 
with being on the joystick it's got a
hydro<00:01:13.759> gearbox<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.570> obviously<00:01:15.170> the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
hydro gearbox and obviously the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.889 
hydro gearbox and obviously the
two-speed<00:01:16.009> rocker<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.940> on<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.240> side<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.660> the

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
two-speed rocker is on the side of the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.969 
two-speed rocker is on the side of the
joystick<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.560> it's<00:01:20.080> got<00:01:21.080> a<00:01:21.110> quite<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.560> light

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
joystick and it's got a quite a light

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.639 
joystick and it's got a quite a light
throttle<00:01:22.940> which<00:01:23.420> is<00:01:23.690> great<00:01:24.020> when<00:01:24.530> you're

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
throttle which is great when you're

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.080 
throttle which is great when you're
trying<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:24.950> get<00:01:25.100> somewhere<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:25.580> on<00:01:25.759> rough

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
trying to get somewhere but on rough

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.800 
trying to get somewhere but on rough
ground<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.570> can<00:01:26.690> be<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:26.930> little<00:01:27.140> bit<00:01:27.470> jumpy

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
ground it can be a little bit jumpy

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.469 
ground it can be a little bit jumpy
definitely<00:01:29.810> not<00:01:29.990> lacking<00:01:30.229> in<00:01:30.470> power<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.479> no

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
definitely not lacking in power and no
