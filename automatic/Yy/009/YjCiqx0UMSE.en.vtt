00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
insoles they use for running so they're

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
insoles they use for running so they're
very<00:00:23.850> light<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.779> shoe<00:00:25.250> very<00:00:26.250> light

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
very light and they be shoe very light

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
very light and they be shoe very light
and<00:00:27.109> I<00:00:28.130> mean<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.519> they're<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.480> good<00:00:30.660> I'm

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and I mean like they're really good I'm

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.479 
and I mean like they're really good I'm
not<00:00:31.349> gonna<00:00:31.560> lie<00:00:31.650> they're<00:00:31.949> really<00:00:32.189> good<00:00:32.340> I've

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
not gonna lie they're really good I've

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.780 
not gonna lie they're really good I've
used<00:00:32.669> them<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:32.820> skating<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.300> couple<00:00:33.630> times<00:00:34.790> but

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
used them for skating a couple times but

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
used them for skating a couple times but
I<00:00:37.250> think<00:00:38.540> these<00:00:39.540> footprints<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> couple

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I think these footprints was a couple

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.840 
I think these footprints was a couple
weeks<00:00:41.160> ago<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.260> they're<00:00:43.590> amazing<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
weeks ago and they're amazing what you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
weeks ago and they're amazing what you
do<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.450> water<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.620> there's<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
do is you just get water and there's a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
do is you just get water and there's a
little<00:00:47.010> hole<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> just

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
little hole right here and you just

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.950 
little hole right here and you just
inject<00:00:48.950> whole<00:00:49.950> thing<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> syringe<00:00:50.960> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
inject whole thing with the syringe and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.290 
inject whole thing with the syringe and
this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.710> super<00:00:52.920> good<00:00:53.250> padding<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
this is just like super good padding it

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.939 
this is just like super good padding it
feels<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> cost<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.500> actually

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
feels just like the cost and actually

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
feels just like the cost and actually
feels<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.250> better<00:00:56.550> than<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> costume

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
feels a little better than the costume

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.979 
feels a little better than the costume
but<00:00:58.640> what<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.730> do<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.600> inject<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
but what you do is you do you inject the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
but what you do is you do you inject the
water<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.699> supposed<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
water there and then you're supposed to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
water there and then you're supposed to
like<00:01:03.149> mix<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> around<00:01:03.600> putting<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.170> shoe<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
like mix it around putting a shoe and it

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.590 
like mix it around putting a shoe and it
forms<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> arch<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.330> heel<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.619> see

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
forms the arch in your heel you can see

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.570 
forms the arch in your heel you can see
and<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.200> people<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.369> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and a lot of people like think that it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.670 
and a lot of people like think that it's
gonna<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.850> soft<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.990> comes<00:01:13.229> off<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.560> really

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
gonna be soft but it comes off as really

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.600 
gonna be soft but it comes off as really
hard<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.600> notice<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.350> just

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
hard but you don't notice it's just

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.010 
hard but you don't notice it's just
cupping<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.640> healing<00:01:18.119> literally<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.780> heel

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
cupping your healing literally your heel

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.620 
cupping your healing literally your heel
and<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.229> arch<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.310> just

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630

verses<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> lunar<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.530> they're<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.040> bad<00:01:47.340> but

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
verses the lunar one they're not bad but

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.429 
verses the lunar one they're not bad but
I<00:01:49.820> recommend<00:01:50.820> getting<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.780> footprint<00:01:52.350> in

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
I recommend getting that footprint in

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.280 
I recommend getting that footprint in
solos<00:01:52.799> cuz<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:53.939> these<00:01:54.360> aren't<00:01:54.570> bad<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
solos cuz these these aren't bad so

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810 
solos cuz these these aren't bad so
they're<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.979> walking<00:01:56.219> around<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> gas

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
they're good for walking around a gas

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.179 
they're good for walking around a gas
but<00:01:57.229> ever<00:01:58.229> since<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> foot<00:01:58.920> prints

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but ever since I got the foot prints

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.050 
but ever since I got the foot prints
holes<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.649> just<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.040> can't<00:02:02.280> use<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.729> can't<00:02:02.909> walk

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
holes I I just I can't use I can't walk

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.020 
holes I I just I can't use I can't walk
without<00:02:03.360> or<00:02:03.570> anything<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:05.219> let<00:02:05.759> me<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.909> what

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030
