00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.520
 not less according to statistics from 30 cars 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.140

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.070
 equipped with car seats 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.920
 why is this happening let's see 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.939
 the first is the high cost of children 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.630
 car seats 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:37.040

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.200
 every automaker fights for 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.710
 literally for every cubic centimeter 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.030
 spaces 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:53.489

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.699
 to the space of his car 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.680
 stole car seats and these are just two points 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.269
 from a large list of reasons which is not 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.250
 car owners justify the absence 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.180
 child seat on install it all 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.310
 equals 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.409
 a fine of 3,000 rubles for this 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.149
 contributed benefit manufacturers 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.700
