00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
is call nine-one-one or the equivalent

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.630 
is call nine-one-one or the equivalent
it's<00:01:06.240> pushing<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.720> triangle<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.400> help<00:01:08.400> will

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's pushing this triangle and help will

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.870 
it's pushing this triangle and help will
come

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
come

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
come
but<00:01:09.659> anyway<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> does<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.799> sends

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
but anyway what that does is it sends

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.190 
but anyway what that does is it sends
out<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> signal<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.570> compound<00:01:16.049> is

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
out a signal and the compound is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
out a signal and the compound is
notified<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.280> that's<00:01:17.460> our<00:01:17.689> 911<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:20.490> sends

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
notified and that's our 911 and it sends

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.940 
notified and that's our 911 and it sends
out<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> stone<00:01:21.420> over<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> whole<00:01:22.470> net<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
out a stone over the whole net that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.070 
out a stone over the whole net that
everybody<00:01:23.340> hears<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> can

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
everybody hears and then you can

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.899 
everybody hears and then you can
communicate<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.100> them<00:01:26.250> without<00:01:26.430> even<00:01:26.790> using

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
communicate with them without even using

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
communicate with them without even using
the<00:01:27.090> microphone<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.900> speak<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.409> kind

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the microphone you just speak it's kind

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.700 
the microphone you just speak it's kind
of<00:01:28.619> like<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.420> home<00:01:30.420> alert<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.049> house<00:01:31.350> alert

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
of like that home alert or house alert

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
of like that home alert or house alert
thing<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.159> old<00:01:32.280> people<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.850> come<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> think

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
thing and old people have come to think

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.609 
thing and old people have come to think
of<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.970> anyway<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.750> occasionally<00:01:37.350> gets

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
of it and anyway it occasionally gets

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.130 
of it and anyway it occasionally gets
used<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.220> most<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> times<00:01:39.030> somebody<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
used and most of the times somebody you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
used and most of the times somebody you
have<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> push<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> button<00:01:41.070> hold<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
have to push the button hold it down and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
have to push the button hold it down and
people<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.570> managed<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.649> few

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
people have managed to do that a few

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.889 
people have managed to do that a few
times<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.540> has<00:01:45.659> been<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:46.470> issue<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
times and it has been a not an issue so

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
times and it has been a not an issue so
that's<00:01:48.899> pretty<00:01:49.140> cool<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.790> tied

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that's pretty cool and I think it's tied

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
that's pretty cool and I think it's tied
into<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.659> GPS<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.649> way<00:01:52.799> too<00:01:52.860> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
into the GPS in some way too it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.630 
into the GPS in some way too it
transmits<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.530> GPS<00:01:55.530> data<00:01:55.799> back<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
transmits a GPS data back to a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.780 
transmits a GPS data back to a
mothership<00:01:57.210> or<00:01:57.990> something<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.790> I'm

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
mothership or something like that I'm

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.280 
mothership or something like that I'm
not<00:01:59.969> really<00:02:00.119> sure<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.079> pretty

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
not really sure but it's a pretty

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.900 
not really sure but it's a pretty
trained<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:04.009> know<00:02:06.170> syriza<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.439> there's<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
trained you know syriza but there's a
