00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
various LG apps but overall I definitely

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.650 
various LG apps but overall I definitely
would<00:03:11.290> recommend<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:12.130> version<00:03:12.400> because<00:03:13.360> it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
would recommend this version because it

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.280 
would recommend this version because it
seems<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.290> flowing<00:03:14.650> way<00:03:15.549> nicer<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:17.110> also

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
seems to be flowing way nicer but also

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.930 
seems to be flowing way nicer but also
that<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:18.040> looks<00:03:18.280> way<00:03:18.580> better<00:03:18.930> than<00:03:19.930> previous

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
that it looks way better than previous

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.490 
that it looks way better than previous
