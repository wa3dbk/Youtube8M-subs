whatever<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> we're<00:01:44.939> gonna<00:01:45.060> no<00:01:45.270> view<00:01:45.570> of

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
whatever so we're gonna no view of

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.910 
whatever so we're gonna no view of
course<00:01:46.820> it's<00:01:47.820> some<00:01:48.030> editor<00:01:48.630> changed

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.510 

documents<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.039> on<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.310> April

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.440

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.999 
I added that left and I to blue LED I
think<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.020> gives<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.320> nice<00:02:01.469> touch

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

them<00:02:43.580> hooked<00:02:43.820> them<00:02:43.970> up<00:02:44.060> parallel<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:45.020> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
them hooked them up parallel to the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.050 
them hooked them up parallel to the
light<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:47.210> cannon<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.900> there<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.320> have<00:02:48.530> a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
light of the cannon and there you have a

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.030 
light of the cannon and there you have a
guiding<00:02:50.060> mechanism<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.870> men<00:02:51.080> using<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
guiding mechanism of men using the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.270 
guiding mechanism of men using the
cannons<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:53.240> course<00:02:53.510> also<00:02:53.810> installed<00:02:54.280> very

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
cannons of course also installed very

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.000 
cannons of course also installed very
easy<00:02:55.580> mod<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.870> they're<00:02:57.050> not<00:02:57.200> flat<00:02:57.709> but<00:02:57.740> a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
easy mod just they're not flat but a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.650 
easy mod just they're not flat but a
dome<00:02:58.220> shape<00:02:58.550> think<00:02:59.300> it's<00:02:59.450> much<00:02:59.720> nicer<00:02:59.930> looking

bird-of-prey<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:10.610> very<00:03:10.850> easy<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.450> do<00:03:11.660> your

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
bird-of-prey it's very easy to do your

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.290 
bird-of-prey it's very easy to do your
slot<00:03:12.050> upgrade<00:03:12.470> but<00:03:13.130> also<00:03:13.250> know<00:03:13.489> Hamlin<00:03:13.850> much

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
slot upgrade but also know Hamlin much
