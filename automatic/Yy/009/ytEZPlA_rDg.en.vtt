00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
with it or you know it just makes a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.600 
with it or you know it just makes a
design<00:00:51.629> smaller<00:00:51.989> how<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.370> have<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> right

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
design smaller how we have it right

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.630 
design smaller how we have it right
there<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.059> we're<00:00:54.780> apart<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.280> show

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
there but we're apart now and then show

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.500 
there but we're apart now and then show
you<00:00:56.670> how<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> build<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.539> thing<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:58.079> here

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
you how to build this thing right here

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
you how to build this thing right here
for<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> tutorial<00:01:01.079> now<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.469> would<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
for the tutorial now we would do it in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
for the tutorial now we would do it in
two<00:01:02.370> parts<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:03.300> we're<00:01:03.840> two<00:01:03.960> people<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.590 
right there and when we place our torch
right<00:01:59.939> over<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:02.070> will<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.610> also<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
right over here that will be also in the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.089 
right over here that will be also in the
default<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.200> position<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:06.979> nothing<00:02:07.979> will

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
default on position and nothing will

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.770 
default on position and nothing will
happen<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.060> already<00:02:09.209> powered<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
happen because it's already powered and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.830 
happen because it's already powered and
I<00:02:10.709> believe<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.340> my<00:02:11.370> part<00:02:11.700> down<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.150> again

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
I believe that is my part down so again

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.869 
I believe that is my part down so again
Rosie<00:02:13.470> purring<00:02:13.620> yep<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:16.140> torch<00:02:16.470> is

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
Rosie purring yep so this torch is

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.660 
Rosie purring yep so this torch is
turning<00:02:17.879> on<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.379> power<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> family<00:02:20.310> or<00:02:20.640> in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
turning on the power in the family or in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.160 
turning on the power in the family or in
the<00:02:20.879> block<00:02:21.180> which<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.540> turn<00:02:21.720> into<00:02:21.840> farmland

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
the block which we turn into farmland

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.850 
the block which we turn into farmland
and<00:02:22.790> if<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:24.000> come<00:02:24.180> from<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.540> bottom<00:02:25.019> we<00:02:25.200> won't

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
and if we come from the bottom we won't

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.890 
and if we come from the bottom we won't
cut<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> power<00:02:26.610> off<00:02:26.730> up<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.599> we<00:02:27.720> need

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
cut the power off up there but we need

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.680 
cut the power off up there but we need
to<00:02:28.019> just<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.379> put<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.890> ton<00:02:29.099> of<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.430> torch<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.030> we

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to just to put a ton of the torch so we

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.420 
to just to put a ton of the torch so we
can<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.110> build<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.379> torch<00:02:31.650> over<00:02:31.890> here<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
can just build a torch over here on the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.550 
can just build a torch over here on the
side<00:02:32.730> that's<00:02:33.540> not<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> torch<00:02:34.170> always

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
side that's not really a torch always

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.650 
side that's not really a torch always
just<00:02:34.830> one<00:02:35.010> redstone<00:02:35.250> torch<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.120> but

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
just one redstone torch like this but

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.449 
just one redstone torch like this but
now<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.810> saw<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.110> trigger<00:02:37.950> because<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
now you saw that trigger because the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.309 
now you saw that trigger because the
torch<00:02:38.730> turned<00:02:39.120> off<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:40.760> we<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:42.060> go<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.840> from

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
torch turned off so we can go in from

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.569 
torch turned off so we can go in from
the<00:02:43.590> side<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:44.370> with<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.599> repeater<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.829> I

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
the side here with just a repeater on I

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.220 
the side here with just a repeater on I
guess<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.299> ticks<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.400> then<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:51.060> block<00:02:51.540> next<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
guess for ticks and then a block next to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.630 
guess for ticks and then a block next to
the<00:02:52.349> repeater<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:52.980> can<00:02:53.130> place<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> redstone

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
the repeater so we can place a redstone

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.210 
the repeater so we can place a redstone
torch<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.360> side<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:55.079> this<00:02:55.650> turns<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
torch on the side and this turns the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.240 
torch on the side and this turns the
torch<00:02:56.489> up<00:02:56.700> there<00:02:56.940> on<00:02:57.180> again<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.890> then<00:02:58.890> we<00:02:59.040> can

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
torch up there on again and then we can

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.100 
torch up there on again and then we can
just<00:02:59.519> add<00:02:59.790> two<00:03:00.660> redstone<00:03:00.900> dust<00:03:01.440> here<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.110> up

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
just add two redstone dust here and up

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.319 
just add two redstone dust here and up
here<00:03:04.410> we<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.739> place<00:03:05.129> our<00:03:05.340> pressure<00:03:05.910> plate

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
here we can place our pressure plate

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.039 
here we can place our pressure plate
whoops<00:03:06.780> here<00:03:07.410> and<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.310> button<00:03:09.239> there<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.510> if<00:03:09.930> I

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
whoops here and the button there so if I

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.080 
whoops here and the button there so if I
step<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.379> here<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.220> will<00:03:11.400> already<00:03:11.549> trigger

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
step on here this will already trigger

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.940 
step on here this will already trigger
the<00:03:12.900> thing<00:03:13.079> up<00:03:13.200> there<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:13.500> now<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.620> just<00:03:13.829> need

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the thing up there and now we just need

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.949 
the thing up there and now we just need
the<00:03:14.250> sticky<00:03:14.519> piston<00:03:14.910> just<00:03:15.269> quite<00:03:15.540> easy<00:03:15.780> just

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
the sticky piston just quite easy just

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.140 
the sticky piston just quite easy just
place<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.319> piston<00:03:19.769> here<00:03:20.280> with<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.790> slime

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
place the piston here with the slime

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.390 
place the piston here with the slime
block<00:03:21.389> on<00:03:21.690> top<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.350> then<00:03:22.829> make<00:03:22.859> sure<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.160> you

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
block on top and then make sure that you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.199 
block on top and then make sure that you
use<00:03:23.639> non<00:03:24.359> moveable<00:03:24.810> blocks<00:03:25.079> like<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
use non moveable blocks like the

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.129 
use non moveable blocks like the
obsidian<00:03:27.750> or<00:03:27.959> furnaces<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:29.480> case<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.870> in

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
obsidian or furnaces to case this in

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.300 
obsidian or furnaces to case this in
like<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.889> and<00:03:33.230> all<00:03:34.230> we<00:03:34.440> need<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.709> do<00:03:34.859> then<00:03:35.040> is

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
like this and all we need to do then is

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.400 
like this and all we need to do then is
hook<00:03:35.760> up<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.060> redstone<00:03:36.450> from<00:03:36.780> right<00:03:37.019> here

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
hook up the redstone from right here

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.390 
hook up the redstone from right here
with<00:03:37.950> two<00:03:38.459> repeaters<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.180> four<00:03:39.599> delay<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:41.160> just

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
with two repeaters on four delay so just

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.289 
with two repeaters on four delay so just
like<00:03:41.549> this<00:03:41.760> facing<00:03:42.540> into<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.930> block<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:44.299> place

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
like this facing into a block and place

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.229 
like this facing into a block and place
a<00:03:45.329> block<00:03:45.510> with<00:03:45.780> redstone<00:03:45.959> dust<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.819> then<00:03:47.819> this

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
a block with redstone dust and then this

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.930 
a block with redstone dust and then this
should<00:03:48.419> be<00:03:48.480> done<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:49.380> let's<00:03:49.620> try<00:03:49.859> it<00:03:49.950> out<00:03:50.040> yeah

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
should be done so let's try it out yeah

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.659 
should be done so let's try it out yeah
it<00:03:51.690> works<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.230> don't<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:52.739> should<00:03:53.040> work<00:03:53.190> out<00:03:53.370> for

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
it works I don't it should work out for

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.180 
it works I don't it should work out for
me<00:03:53.760> as<00:03:53.880> well<00:03:54.440> make<00:03:55.440> sure<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.709> may<00:03:55.829> have<00:03:55.859> tried

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
me as well make sure you may have tried

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.199 
me as well make sure you may have tried
the<00:03:56.310> button<00:03:57.410> alright<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:59.340> time<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.549> feel<00:03:59.849> like

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the button alright this time I feel like

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.539 
the button alright this time I feel like
it's<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.930> bit<00:04:01.079> depending<00:04:01.769> on<00:04:02.010> server<00:04:02.370> lag

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
it's a bit depending on server lag

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.940 
it's a bit depending on server lag
because<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.450> server's<00:04:03.780> now<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.230> Europe<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
because the server's now in Europe and

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.120 
because the server's now in Europe and
the<00:04:05.280> beach<00:04:05.400> masses<00:04:05.819> from<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.090> yes<00:04:07.010> might<00:04:08.010> not

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
the beach masses from the yes might not

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.159 
the beach masses from the yes might not
work<00:04:08.310> always<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:08.940> with<00:04:09.419> our<00:04:09.540> testing<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:10.019> was
