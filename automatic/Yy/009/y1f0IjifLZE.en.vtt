00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 door locks vaz 2110 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:15.109
 compared with Vologda silent it 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:20.160
 The usual decimal tens But this 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:22.320
 volgovskih silent from 105 volga 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.060
 notice all the difference just 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:33.420
 here is a smooth edge that there is such 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:35.840
 antennae clearly visible that is if you are here 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.840
 cut down 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.210
 something like this would be fine 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:52.760
 work and work it will all be 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:01:01.699
 listen to the regular lock opened and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:01.699
 volgovskiy opened snaps 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 regular 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 Volga 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.270
 really silent put the locks and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.600
 little secret build any 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.420
 Domestic cars are required 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.450
 lubricate all rubbing and moving 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.950
 things appropriate grease showing 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:52.789
 door handle lock work as it is removed 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:02:02.390
 put gorgeous sounds and it's worth it 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:06.280
 grease is already such that not 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.780
 creaks do not squeak the only thing that will say 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.660
 the work of the lock mechanism itself 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:20.450
 You can also overcome it if you wish. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:22.519
 it was absolutely silent to use 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.530
 the lock is much more pleasant and generally in 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.470
 In general, if you make the whole car like this 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.480
 lubricate everywhere all moving rubbing 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.799
 the details are few they will be practically 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.400
 forever and so also will become 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.400
 much nicer 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.650
 put the door lock between the body and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.520
 the castle has laid a small piece 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.230
 vibration isolation in the first place will be a little bit 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.610
 better to fit in a second lock a little 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:57.150
 a little more became introduced because the staff 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.890
 gaskets under 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 otvetka not enough so I file more 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:09.730
 barely catchy such work Volga 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:22.900
 lock dozens of doors will not describe 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:28.980
 clay, therefore, stumbles a little all 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.980
 blurred first click second click 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.409
 compare 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.299
 standard for call and one more one 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:49.439
 one little secret of quality 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.930
 assembly Lada here back door dozens 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:56.969
 especially for those who crawl when 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.969
 closing the opening of the central lock 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.799
 metal by metal 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.790
 because in this mechanism here's a stopper 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.919
 Metal's been here since youtube 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.030
 also metal when closing 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:19.479
 clanging happens or happens when 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.810
 opening if one of 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:26.470
 two that option either 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.789
 anything or just just 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.330
 when assembling this whole thing a little bit 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.330
 adjust to middle position 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.090
 now a little bit more 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:07.180
 same morning code 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.389
 does not apply to closing 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.590
 when opened literally a little bit 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:18.650
 can still touch a little bit lower 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:22.220
 Bulgarian 10 and then already close 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.410
 open locks will be clearly expressed 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.319
 metallic alias to the back 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.319
 Salon such little secrets
