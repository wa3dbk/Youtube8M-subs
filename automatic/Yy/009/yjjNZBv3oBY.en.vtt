hi<00:00:01.380> my<00:00:01.560> name<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.829> Henry<00:00:02.010> sagermann<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.610> is

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hi my name is Henry sagermann this is

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.079 
hi my name is Henry sagermann this is
regular<00:00:03.270> triangulation<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.170> age<00:00:04.410> three<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.819> H

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
regular triangulation of age three so H

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.780 
regular triangulation of age three so H
three<00:00:06.450> is<00:00:07.040> three-dimensional<00:00:08.040> hyperbolic

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
three is three-dimensional hyperbolic

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.089 
three is three-dimensional hyperbolic
space<00:00:09.980> so<00:00:10.980> what's<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.420> so

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
space so what's that so so

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.860 
space so what's that so so
two-dimensional<00:00:14.099> hyperbolic<00:00:14.880> space<00:00:15.000> many

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870

people will have seen in the works of
Asher<00:00:18.960> Asher<00:00:19.560> did<00:00:19.890> some<00:00:20.130> tilings

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
Asher Asher did some tilings

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.279 
Asher Asher did some tilings
tessellations<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.560> hyperbolic<00:00:23.460> space<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:25.050> he

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
tessellations of hyperbolic space and he

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.359 
tessellations of hyperbolic space and he
used<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.730> poincaré<00:00:26.730> disk<00:00:26.820> model<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.980> h2<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
used the poincaré disk model of h2 of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.600 
used the poincaré disk model of h2 of
hyper<00:00:29.640> book<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> hyperbolic<00:00:30.420> plane<00:00:31.610> which

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
hyper book the hyperbolic plane which

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.729 
hyper book the hyperbolic plane which
you<00:00:33.420> see<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> picture<00:00:34.829> inside<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.460> circle<00:00:36.450> and

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
you see a picture inside of a circle and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
you see a picture inside of a circle and
the<00:00:37.969> figures<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> tessellation<00:00:39.780> gets

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the figures in the tessellation gets

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.569 
the figures in the tessellation gets
smaller<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.410> smaller<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.070> near<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
smaller and smaller as you get near to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.240 
smaller and smaller as you get near to
the<00:00:41.670> boundary<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.149> circle<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.190> is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the boundary of the circle and this is

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
the boundary of the circle and this is
the<00:00:44.460> same<00:00:44.640> sort<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> idea<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.539> three

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the same sort of idea in three

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.819 
the same sort of idea in three
dimensions<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.660> rather<00:00:48.660> than<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.079> circle<00:00:49.710> we

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
dimensions so rather than a circle we

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.950 
dimensions so rather than a circle we
get<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> sphere<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:51.300> there's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> tiling

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
get a sphere and then there's a tiling

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.470 
get a sphere and then there's a tiling
of<00:00:52.079> objects<00:00:52.710> inside<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> sphere<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
of objects inside of the sphere that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.910 
of objects inside of the sphere that
gets<00:00:54.690> smaller<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.110> smaller<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.710> me<00:00:55.829> over

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
gets smaller and smaller to get me over

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.090 
gets smaller and smaller to get me over
to<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> boundary<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:58.230> said<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
to the boundary so I said it was a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.830 
to the boundary so I said it was a
triangulation<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.420> means<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
triangulation so what that means is that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.410 
triangulation so what that means is that
it's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> tiling<00:01:01.559> by<00:01:01.800> well<00:01:02.520> not<00:01:02.670> triangles<00:01:03.239> but

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it's a tiling by well not triangles but

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100 
it's a tiling by well not triangles but
tetrahedra<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:06.990> these

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
tetrahedra so if I see so there's these

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.859 
tetrahedra so if I see so there's these
sort<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:08.060> sort<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> big<00:01:09.680> vertices<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.869> so

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sort of sort of big vertices here and so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
sort of sort of big vertices here and so
I<00:01:12.930> put<00:01:13.229> my<00:01:13.350> fingers<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.520> these

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
I put my fingers on on these so these

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.899 
I put my fingers on on these so these
these<00:01:15.240> form<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:16.259> tetrahedron<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.820> are

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
these form a tetrahedron so there are

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.450 
these form a tetrahedron so there are
edges<00:01:18.330> between<00:01:18.509> these<00:01:18.900> four<00:01:19.170> points<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:20.340> can

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
edges between these four points you can

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.160 
edges between these four points you can
see<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> edge<00:01:20.880> between<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.659> point<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
see the edge between this point and this

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.929 
see the edge between this point and this
point<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.710> through<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> middle<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
point going through the middle there and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
point going through the middle there and
so<00:01:24.509> those<00:01:24.659> four<00:01:24.930> points<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.439> those<00:01:25.619> edges

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so those four points all those edges

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.179 
so those four points all those edges
linked<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:27.439> all<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.680> vertices<00:01:28.979> are

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
linked up all of these vertices are

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.450 
linked up all of these vertices are
linked<00:01:29.400> up<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.850> form<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.780> tetrahedron<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
linked up to form a tetrahedron and this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
linked up to form a tetrahedron and this
is<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.930> bit<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> strange-looking

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is a bit of a strange-looking

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
is a bit of a strange-looking
tetrahedron<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> sir<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.030> something<00:01:36.329> called

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
tetrahedron it sir and something called

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.469 
tetrahedron it sir and something called
an<00:01:36.570> ideal<00:01:36.780> tetrahedron<00:01:38.030> which<00:01:39.030> means<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
an ideal tetrahedron which means that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.410 
an ideal tetrahedron which means that
its<00:01:39.630> vertices<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> boundary<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.420> age

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
its vertices are on the boundary of age

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.719 
its vertices are on the boundary of age
three<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> sphere<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.549> they're<00:01:44.670> not

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
three of the sphere and so they're not

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.160 
three of the sphere and so they're not
actually<00:01:44.909> part<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> tetrahedron<00:01:45.990> but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
actually part of the tetrahedron but

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
actually part of the tetrahedron but
anyway<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.460> an<00:01:47.549> ideal<00:01:47.880> tetrahedron

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
anyway so so it's an ideal tetrahedron

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.230 
anyway so so it's an ideal tetrahedron
it's<00:01:48.689> its<00:01:48.930> vertices<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.939> out<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
it's its vertices are out at the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.469 
it's its vertices are out at the
boundary<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.229> age<00:01:52.409> three<00:01:53.270> but<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
boundary of of age three but it's a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
boundary of of age three but it's a
regular<00:01:54.899> tetrahedron<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> means

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
regular tetrahedron and what that means

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.480 
regular tetrahedron and what that means
is<00:01:57.030> well<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.079> can't<00:01:58.229> really<00:01:58.290> say<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
is well you can't really say all the the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
is well you can't really say all the the
site<00:02:00.119> lengths<00:02:00.420> are<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.570> same<00:02:00.630> because

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
site lengths are the same because

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.380 
site lengths are the same because
they're<00:02:02.009> all<00:02:02.100> infinitely<00:02:02.610> long<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.090> all<00:02:03.180> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
they're all infinitely long but all the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.020 
they're all infinitely long but all the
dihedral<00:02:03.719> angles<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> angles<00:02:04.530> between<00:02:05.030> faces

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
dihedral angles the angles between faces

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209

I<00:02:30.930> only<00:02:31.019> went<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.530> think<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.920> was<00:02:32.099> four<00:02:32.340> four

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
I only went I think it was four four

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.640 
I only went I think it was four four
steps<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.329> was<00:02:33.690> from<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.079> central

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
steps that was from the central

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.069 
steps that was from the central
tetrahedron<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.879> is<00:02:36.030> what<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.239> get<00:02:36.390> and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
tetrahedron and this is what you get and

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.910 
tetrahedron and this is what you get and
it<00:02:37.200> has<00:02:37.379> some<00:02:37.709> these<00:02:38.340> nice<00:02:38.970> symmetries<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
it has some these nice symmetries of the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.910 
it has some these nice symmetries of the
of<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.610> tetrahedron<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.329> turns<00:02:42.569> out<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
of the tetrahedron it turns out that the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.500 
of the tetrahedron it turns out that the

extend outwards to the rest of it so

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.400
