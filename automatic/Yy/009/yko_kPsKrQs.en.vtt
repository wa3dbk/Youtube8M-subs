look<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.750> top<00:01:52.020> one<00:01:52.290> knows<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
look at the top one knows they have a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460 
look at the top one knows they have a
little<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> great<00:01:53.729> end<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.290> my

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
little more of a great end so I like my

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.539 
little more of a great end so I like my
stuff<00:01:55.770> being<00:01:56.070> gray<00:01:57.409> but<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.680> demo<00:01:59.219> here

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
stuff being gray but for this demo here

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.889 
stuff being gray but for this demo here
that<00:01:59.729> I'm<00:01:59.790> not<00:01:59.880> sure<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.210> i'm<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.600> going

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that I'm not sure you i'm actually going

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.649 
that I'm not sure you i'm actually going
to<00:02:01.049> set<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.680> black<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:03.390> i'll<00:02:03.540> do

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
to set it all to black and i'll do

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
to set it all to black and i'll do
they're<00:02:03.780> just<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> bit<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.380> there's<00:02:05.189> all

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
they're just a bit but there's all

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.800 
they're just a bit but there's all
different<00:02:05.340> settings<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.360> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
different settings you can see it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
different settings you can see it's
pretty<00:02:07.020> neat<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.429> any<00:02:08.640> color

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
pretty neat you can really get any color

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940 
pretty neat you can really get any color
so<00:02:09.270> there's<00:02:09.420> no<00:02:09.899> there's<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> nice<00:02:10.259> black<00:02:10.560> color

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so there's no there's a nice black color

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.530 
so there's no there's a nice black color
not<00:02:11.730> blue<00:02:12.000> always<00:02:12.569> different

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
not blue always different

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.600 
not blue always different
and<00:02:14.079> I<00:02:14.709> just<00:02:14.890> have<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.069> lot<00:02:15.189> of<00:02:15.219> fun<00:02:15.400> messing

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and I just have a lot of fun messing

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.130 
and I just have a lot of fun messing
around<00:02:15.849> with<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:19.629> was<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.930> little<00:02:19.989> bit

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
around with this that was a little bit

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.140 
around with this that was a little bit
hard<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.379> read<00:02:20.590> there's<00:02:21.189> a<00:02:21.280> live<00:02:21.489> test<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.000> can

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
hard to read there's a live test you can

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.880 
hard to read there's a live test you can
see<00:02:22.299> how<00:02:22.359> it's<00:02:22.480> see-through<00:02:22.719> it's<00:02:23.560> neat<00:02:23.859> but

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
see how it's see-through it's neat but

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.709 
see how it's see-through it's neat but
not<00:02:24.310> really<00:02:24.459> practical<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:26.129> like<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.250> keep<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
not really practical I like to keep the

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.990 
not really practical I like to keep the
opacity<00:02:28.719> set<00:02:29.500> some<00:02:29.829> more<00:02:29.980> up<00:02:30.220> there<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.970> know

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
opacity set some more up there you know

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.190 
opacity set some more up there you know
so<00:02:31.329> that<00:02:31.359> it<00:02:31.599> doesn't<00:02:31.840> just<00:02:33.659> look<00:02:34.659> back<00:02:35.019> you

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
so that it doesn't just look back you

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.929 
so that it doesn't just look back you
know<00:02:35.260> really<00:02:35.470> well<00:02:36.099> but<00:02:36.280> it's<00:02:36.430> very<00:02:36.640> neat

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
know really well but it's very neat

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.599 
know really well but it's very neat
application<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.930> when<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.530> saw<00:02:38.829> this<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.519> know

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
application and when I saw this you know

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.330 
application and when I saw this you know
why<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.930> reason<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.290> saw<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.739> because<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.189> was

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
why the reason I saw it is because I was

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.500 
why the reason I saw it is because I was
looking<00:02:42.639> for<00:02:43.709> iOS<00:02:44.709> that<00:02:45.280> notification<00:02:45.909> tweaks

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
looking for iOS that notification tweaks

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.599 
looking for iOS that notification tweaks
because<00:02:46.840> people<00:02:47.109> say<00:02:47.400> notifications<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.519> I

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
because people say notifications and I

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.360 
because people say notifications and I
always<00:02:48.760> are<00:02:48.970> awful<00:02:49.470> are<00:02:50.470> they<00:02:50.769> now<00:02:51.069> I'm<00:02:51.189> not

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
always are awful are they now I'm not

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.729 
always are awful are they now I'm not
really<00:02:51.609> in<00:02:52.540> my<00:02:52.750> opinion<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.650> know

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
really in my opinion but you know

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.069 
really in my opinion but you know
there's<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> nice<00:02:54.159> black<00:02:54.400> one<00:02:54.639> so<00:02:54.970> live<00:02:55.780> test

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
there's a nice black one so live test

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.270 
there's a nice black one so live test
elves<00:02:56.439> nice<00:02:57.389> cool<00:02:58.389> so<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.680> turn<00:02:59.919> the<00:03:00.040> opacity

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
elves nice cool so you turn the opacity

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.879 
elves nice cool so you turn the opacity
up<00:03:00.669> a<00:03:00.760> little<00:03:00.939> bit<00:03:01.030> that's<00:03:02.019> much<00:03:02.230> better<00:03:02.409> now<00:03:02.650> I

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
up a little bit that's much better now I

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.250 
up a little bit that's much better now I
can<00:03:03.189> modify<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.609> border<00:03:04.000> color<00:03:04.239> so<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.109> can

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
can modify the border color so you can

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.920 
can modify the border color so you can
see<00:03:05.439> that<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.590> can<00:03:05.680> give<00:03:05.919> a<00:03:05.950> little<00:03:06.189> bit<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.459> a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
see that I can give a little bit of a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.640 
see that I can give a little bit of a
tent<00:03:07.930> hint<00:03:09.030> whatever<00:03:10.030> no<00:03:12.659> just<00:03:13.659> set<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:13.930> up<00:03:14.169> you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
tent hint whatever no just set it up you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.470 
tent hint whatever no just set it up you
know<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:15.189> can<00:03:15.340> get<00:03:15.430> these<00:03:15.549> like<00:03:15.760> me<00:03:16.000> on<00:03:16.150> looks

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
know you can get these like me on looks

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.869 
know you can get these like me on looks
but<00:03:17.290> i<00:03:17.500> don't<00:03:17.739> really<00:03:17.949> like<00:03:18.069> those<00:03:18.340> looks<00:03:18.609> so

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
set the opacity down a little bit ler

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.659 
set the opacity down a little bit ler
looks<00:03:21.400> kind<00:03:21.669> of<00:03:21.699> nice<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.290> live<00:03:23.889> test<00:03:24.220> there

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
looks kind of nice and live test there

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.879 
looks kind of nice and live test there
you<00:03:24.760> go<00:03:24.849> you<00:03:25.569> can<00:03:25.750> change<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.260> shadow<00:03:26.560> color

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
you go you can change the shadow color

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:30.030 
you go you can change the shadow color
of<00:03:27.099> course<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.819> they<00:03:28.239> all<00:03:28.359> work<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.569> same<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
of course and they all work the same the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.539 
of course and they all work the same the
text<00:03:30.430> color<00:03:31.560> see<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.919> know<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.280> have<00:03:33.400> all

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
text color see you know you have all

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.550 
text color see you know you have all
these<00:03:33.760> different<00:03:34.000> options<00:03:34.479> and<00:03:34.720> then<00:03:35.379> you<00:03:35.440> can

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
these different options and then you can

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.409 
these different options and then you can
even<00:03:35.650> change<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.400> text<00:03:36.699> shadow<00:03:36.819> color<00:03:37.180> which

even change the text shadow color which

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:39.539 
even change the text shadow color which
I<00:03:37.599> don't<00:03:37.659> see<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:37.989> reason<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.680> change<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:39.400> can

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
I don't see a reason to change you can

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.969 
I don't see a reason to change you can
change<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.909> fonts<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.389> are<00:03:40.569> on<00:03:40.810> deep<00:03:41.530> dialog

change the fonts that are on deep dialog

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.250 
change the fonts that are on deep dialog
boxes<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.909> you<00:03:43.479> have<00:03:43.629> quite<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.870> few<00:03:43.959> options

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
boxes and you have quite a few options

boxes and you have quite a few options
for<00:03:44.560> those<00:03:44.799> once<00:03:45.250> they<00:03:45.459> load<00:03:45.639> in<00:03:45.819> here<00:03:46.000> device
