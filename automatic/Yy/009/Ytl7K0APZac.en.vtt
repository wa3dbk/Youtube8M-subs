00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
go to our phone we have lens tap blank

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.590 
go to our phone we have lens tap blank

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030 
and even rs-422 control as well as
Ethernet<00:01:21.899> so<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.469> a<00:01:22.530> lot<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> ways<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
Ethernet so we have a lot of ways to
control<00:01:23.399> this<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> key<00:01:24.600> trick<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
control this but the key trick is you

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.359 
control this but the key trick is you
can<00:01:25.860> shoot<00:01:26.040> multicam<00:01:26.640> event<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:28.369> for

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
can shoot multicam event and then for

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.510 
can shoot multicam event and then for
6-8<00:01:30.360> hours<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.899> video<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.219> hard

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
6-8 hours of video right here on a hard
