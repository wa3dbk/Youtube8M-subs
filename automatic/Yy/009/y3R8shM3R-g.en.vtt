00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
I was feeling better I'm feeling

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.800 
I was feeling better I'm feeling
stronger<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.700> wanted<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.479> what

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
stronger and I wanted to just see what

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.149

goes<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.760> don't<00:01:15.509> believe<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> scale

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
goes I don't believe that the scale

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.870 
goes I don't believe that the scale
should<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> end-all<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.400> be-all<00:01:17.670> but

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
should be the end-all of the be-all but

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.700 
should be the end-all of the be-all but
it<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> measure<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.350> something<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
it is a measure it's not something that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
it is a measure it's not something that
I<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:19.920> every<00:01:20.040> week<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:20.700> even<00:01:21.090> necessarily

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I do every week I don't even necessarily

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.570 
I do every week I don't even necessarily
do<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> every<00:01:22.080> month<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.009> something<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
do it every month but it is something I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
do it every month but it is something I
