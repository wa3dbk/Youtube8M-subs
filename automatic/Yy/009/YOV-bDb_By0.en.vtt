what the Bible promise it stands for now
we<00:00:56.340> may<00:00:56.610> discuss<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:58.440> intellectual<00:00:59.010> level

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309

we may discuss on an intellectual level
and<00:01:00.379> we<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.649> even<00:01:02.010> become<00:01:02.210> like<00:01:03.210> enemies

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and we can even become like enemies

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.590 
and we can even become like enemies
because<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.580> misunderstand<00:01:06.299> each<00:01:06.479> other<00:01:06.720> and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
because we misunderstand each other and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
because we misunderstand each other and
reality<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.840> difficult<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
reality is difficult if there is a
