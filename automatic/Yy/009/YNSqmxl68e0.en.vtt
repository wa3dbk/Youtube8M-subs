that's<00:04:24.610> right<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:25.270> sometimes<00:04:25.750> think<00:04:26.080> that

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
that's right I sometimes think that

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.010 
that's right I sometimes think that
changing<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> fly<00:04:27.300> is<00:04:28.300> one<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.780> things

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
changing the fly is one of the things

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.720 
changing the fly is one of the things
that<00:04:29.110> makes<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.530> easy<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.250> catch<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.640> fish

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
that makes it easy to catch the fish

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.640 
that makes it easy to catch the fish
because<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.540> give<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.840> fish<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> break<00:04:32.320> you

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
because you give the fish a break you

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.480 
because you give the fish a break you
know<00:04:32.800> they're<00:04:33.160> just<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.550> Texan<00:04:34.170> literally

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.640 

I<00:05:52.860> then<00:05:53.520> spied<00:05:53.909> a<00:05:53.940> young<00:05:54.240> girl<00:05:54.599> watching<00:05:55.530> me

about<00:06:02.569> my<00:06:03.569> mind<00:06:03.840> drifted<00:06:04.199> back<00:06:04.409> a<00:06:04.440> few

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
about my mind drifted back a few

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.860 
about my mind drifted back a few
centuries<00:06:05.039> and<00:06:05.729> I<00:06:05.849> thought<00:06:06.030> of<00:06:06.090> asking<00:06:06.330> her<00:06:06.720> to

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
centuries and I thought of asking her to

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.029 
centuries and I thought of asking her to
sing<00:06:07.080> my<00:06:07.199> song<00:06:07.879> but<00:06:08.879> that<00:06:09.060> was<00:06:09.210> ridiculous

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
sing my song but that was ridiculous

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.159 
sing my song but that was ridiculous
after<00:06:11.039> all<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:11.879> was<00:06:12.090> just<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.479> young<00:06:12.629> girl<00:06:12.930> out

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
after all this was just a young girl out

after all this was just a young girl out
for<00:06:13.199> a<00:06:13.470> walk

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.860 

then<00:06:18.920> the<00:06:19.040> trout<00:06:19.310> struck<00:06:19.670> my<00:06:19.850> line<00:06:20.060> and<00:06:20.660> I<00:06:20.720> was

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
then the trout struck my line and I was

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.280 
then the trout struck my line and I was
taken<00:06:21.230> back<00:06:21.380> to<00:06:21.440> the<00:06:21.680> task<00:06:21.980> at<00:06:22.220> hand<00:06:23.290> perfect

taken back to the task at hand perfect
timing<00:06:24.470> i<00:06:24.800> thought<00:06:25.010> i'll<00:06:25.850> get<00:06:26.060> a<00:06:26.090> chance<00:06:26.390> to

show off my angling skills which will

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.320 
show off my angling skills which will
provide<00:06:28.790> me<00:06:29.000> an<00:06:29.090> opportunity<00:06:29.330> to<00:06:29.750> say<00:06:30.080> hello

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
when I turned around she disappeared up

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.140 
when I turned around she disappeared up
the<00:06:35.900> trail<00:06:36.199> into<00:06:37.099> the<00:06:37.129> hazelwood<00:06:40.030> and<00:06:41.030> I

the trail into the hazelwood and I

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.430 
the trail into the hazelwood and I
wondered<00:06:41.509> if<00:06:41.659> I'd<00:06:41.870> even<00:06:42.169> seen<00:06:42.500> her<00:06:42.740> at<00:06:43.009> all
