00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.169 
and actually look at the table of
contents<00:01:57.990> okay<00:01:58.990> so<00:01:59.259> if<00:01:59.860> that's<00:02:00.610> one<00:02:00.939> way<00:02:01.119> you

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
contents okay so if that's one way you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.059 
contents okay so if that's one way you
could<00:02:01.420> look<00:02:01.569> at<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:02.049> could<00:02:02.229> go<00:02:02.409> online<00:02:02.530> see

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
could look at it you could go online see

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.059 
could look at it you could go online see
if<00:02:03.100> you're<00:02:03.520> familiarized<00:02:04.149> with<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:05.069> concepts

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
if you're familiarized with the concepts

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.309 
if you're familiarized with the concepts
but<00:02:06.880> without<00:02:07.509> looking<00:02:07.899> at<00:02:07.959> the<00:02:08.049> table

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
but without looking at the table

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.589 
but without looking at the table
contents<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:08.830> would<00:02:08.979> say<00:02:09.220> it's<00:02:09.549> whether<00:02:10.299> or<00:02:10.479> not

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
contents I would say it's whether or not

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.780 
contents I would say it's whether or not
you'd<00:02:10.989> be<00:02:11.170> comfortable<00:02:11.410> comfortable<00:02:12.340> enough

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you'd be comfortable comfortable enough

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.050 
you'd be comfortable comfortable enough
to<00:02:12.849> go<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.530> into<00:02:15.040> roblox<00:02:15.400> duty<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.790> start

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
to go just into roblox duty and start

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.690 
to go just into roblox duty and start
writing<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.450> game<00:02:16.690> from<00:02:17.379> scratch<00:02:17.560> because<00:02:18.340> you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
writing a game from scratch because you

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.640 
writing a game from scratch because you
know<00:02:18.970> when<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.330> don't<00:02:19.540> know<00:02:19.690> anything<00:02:19.989> but

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
know when you don't know anything but

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.970 
know when you don't know anything but
like<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:20.950> said<00:02:21.220> it's<00:02:21.459> harder<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.940> know<00:02:22.709> if<00:02:23.709> you

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
like you said it's harder to know if you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.339 
like you said it's harder to know if you
know<00:02:24.130> something<00:02:24.489> right<00:02:25.180> or<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:25.540> how<00:02:25.690> in-depth
