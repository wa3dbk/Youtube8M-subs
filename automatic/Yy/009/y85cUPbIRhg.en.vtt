breaking at 20 25 feet so it looks like

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
breaking at 20 25 feet so it looks like
this<00:01:46.619> quite<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> few<00:01:47.100> cars<00:01:47.340> parked<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.399 

okay<00:02:00.240> we're<00:02:00.450> getting<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.900> bit<00:02:01.110> closer

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
okay we're getting a little bit closer

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.280 
okay we're getting a little bit closer
to<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.920> shoreline<00:02:02.190> here<00:02:02.820> waves<00:02:03.690> are<00:02:04.140> just

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
to the shoreline here waves are just

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.449 
to the shoreline here waves are just
really<00:02:04.800> large<00:02:06.380> it's<00:02:07.380> actually<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.860> too<00:02:08.069> cold

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
really large it's actually not too cold

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.260 
really large it's actually not too cold
though<00:02:08.759> surprisingly<00:02:11.209> temperature<00:02:12.209> is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
though surprisingly temperature is

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.010 
though surprisingly temperature is
probably<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> upper<00:02:13.530> 50s<00:02:13.980> low<00:02:14.250> 60s<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
probably in the upper 50s low 60s but I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.949 
probably in the upper 50s low 60s but I
