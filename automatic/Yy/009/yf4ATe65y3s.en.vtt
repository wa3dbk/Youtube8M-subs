00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.019
 today I bring you this tutorial of 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.510
 a very simple makeup first 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.420
 I apply my first on the entire eyelid 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.060
 from the mobile eyelid to below the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.920
 eyebrow arch and to give a little bit of 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.220
 intensity to the shadows I will apply 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.090
 a white base but this one concentrated 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.180
 only on the mobile eyelid 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.180
 to 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.830
 and then with the help of a brush 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.650
 flat I'm going to take a beige tone and I'm going 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.980
 to apply the same way first with 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.380
 light blows on top of the white base 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.970
 and I'm going to blur it to below 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:53.980
 wax arch 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:57.190
 then I'm going to take a copper shadow and 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.910
 I'm going to draw a diagonal line if you 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.570
 fixed I put the tape to help me 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.740
 have as a guide and I'm going to apply for 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.850
 my pupil out towards is a 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.280
 line inclined towards the fold I want 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.200
 go blurring it little by little until 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.200
 be well attached to the eyelashes 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.610
 remember to place little by little the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.580
 Shade in both eyes until they remain 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.730
 similar and the tape is very helpful 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.090
 to be your guide and mark very 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.660
 well that delineated or that look a bit 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.720
 more torn after I'm going to take the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.990
 brush with which apply the beige shadow and 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.160
 I'm going to blur a little bit any line 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.890
 marked now following the guide of my 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.320
 tape I will apply liquid eyeliner 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 but I'm going to do it well 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.280
 eyelashes and I'm going to mark up where 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 I want it to be that angular line is 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.700
 like that the tail or the hairstyle 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.670
 paul I do not know how to leave immediately I'm going to 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.710
 take the black shadow and I will go 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.770
 filling in 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.050
 I'm going to keep doing the sloping line and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.960
 I'm going to blur it little by little 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.710
 length of my eyelashes if you lose a 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.140
 little the coppery I can not follow 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.810
 applying copper I can diffuse it 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.830
 with beige or can I finally blur it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.560
 sorry with the black you are going to go 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.360
 riding your makeup little by little 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.280
 remember that it is necessary to go 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.180
 applying little by little until it 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.620
 reach the intensity that we still like 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.560
 then I'll have a light coffee and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.930
 it only diffused it from outside the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.170
 external angle inwards to give a 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.540
 little color transition applied 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.940
 several layers of mascara to prepare my 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.230
 eyelashes and use lashes 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.739
 false 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.530
 since I did this remove the ribbons remove 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.260
 any excess makeup that has 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 fallen on my face and immediately and he 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.099
 all my makeup routine the base the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.400
 correctors the dust to seal and 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.129
 Eyeliner on the eyebrows or delineate more 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.700
 ok my eyebrows with a little shadow 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.700
 coffee 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.420
 I can not even mark your eyebrows too much 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.750
 You can clean the excess with a 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.180
 brush of some mascara or mask that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.640
 you have finished cleaning the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.960
 brush and with that same you can remove 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.980
 the excess of the eyebrows I put these tricks 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.550
 of abel are the whiskeys of art he is the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.520
 mark arden and I'll apply them first 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.060
 I put them on top and I'm going to cut the 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.900
 excess the excess is always cut from the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.300
 end edge I put the glue 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.800
 I hit the middle part and then not 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.800
 I go with the ends 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.860
 and since the glue has dried 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.519
 tape with the same liquid eyeliner 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.630
 this part my camera almost failed to take 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.210
 what I was doing but I'm 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.780
 applying the same copper shade to the 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.060
 length of the lower lashes and as 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.430
 they notice it like that, they keep their eyes and 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.400
 then I put black shadow but 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.730
 only at the end in the external angle 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.350
 of the lower lashes blurs it 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:44.220
 a little and in the lacrimal I'm going to put 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.889
 a beige shade but only iridescent 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.849
 to give light in that part of the eye 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:56.810
 and now yes as the upper lashes 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:58.490
 they are very flashy let's say I need it 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.039
 obviously also call more the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.889
 attention on the lower lashes and 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.830
 I pass several layers of mascara 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.870
 down as above then I'm going to take the 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.779
 light coffee that I used in my crease 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.810
 but now I'm going to use it in outline 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:16.789
 first placed a little on both sides and 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.920
 then he blurred it in movements 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.520
 circular 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:26.000
 then I continue with a robot in tone 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.180
 old rose and on the lips is being 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.260
 the same shade of flush first those of 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.810
 line and then I put the lipstick I hope 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.760
 that you have liked this look very 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.480
 simple very natural and at the same time it is 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.540
 and notorious if it's that way
