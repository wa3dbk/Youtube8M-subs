five millimeters and at the very tips of
those<00:01:56.789> needles<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:58.319> releases<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.979> small<00:01:59.460> energy

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
those needles it releases a small energy

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.949 
those needles it releases a small energy
charge<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.709> are<00:02:02.130> guaranteed<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.719> that

the<00:02:13.200> other<00:02:13.410> reason<00:02:14.040> why<00:02:14.220> Infini<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.820> superior

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
the other reason why Infini is superior

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.320 
the other reason why Infini is superior
is<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.710> can<00:02:16.830> go<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.010> different<00:02:17.520> levels<00:02:17.700> so

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
is that it can go to different levels so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.570 
is that it can go to different levels so
you<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:19.170> can<00:02:19.200> actually<00:02:19.770> treat<00:02:20.040> someone's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you can you can actually treat someone's

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.060 
you can you can actually treat someone's
face<00:02:20.880> at<00:02:21.180> three<00:02:21.780> different<00:02:22.050> levels<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.770> this

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
face at three different levels so this

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.770 
face at three different levels so this
device<00:02:23.690> has<00:02:24.690> no<00:02:25.050> downtime<00:02:26.300> except<00:02:27.300> for<00:02:27.540> some

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
device has no downtime except for some

that the skin is thicker and each little
each<00:03:10.950> little<00:03:11.400> pulse<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.690> needles<00:03:13.050> are<00:03:13.290> coming

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
each little pulse the needles are coming

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.300 
each little pulse the needles are coming
out<00:03:14.040> there's<00:03:14.880> 40<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.390> them<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.980> right<00:03:17.160> now

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310

great for these fine lines above the lip
that<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.450> somewhat<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.440> area<00:03:49.829> is<00:03:50.040> somewhat

tender<00:03:53.160> because<00:03:53.970> there's<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.450> lot<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.750> nerve

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
