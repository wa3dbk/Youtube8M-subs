00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.040 

so<00:00:44.190> pretty<00:00:44.399> much<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.789> suit<00:00:45.059> came<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.899> because

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
so pretty much the suit came out because

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.590 
so pretty much the suit came out because
Deathstroke<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.190> turn<00:00:47.399> young<00:00:47.640> he<00:00:48.030> lost<00:00:48.300> his

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
Deathstroke got turn young he lost his

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
Deathstroke got turn young he lost his
memory<00:00:48.809> kind<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.320> pulled<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> Wolverine<00:00:50.300> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
memory kind of pulled a Wolverine and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.130 
memory kind of pulled a Wolverine and
his<00:00:51.899> healing<00:00:52.320> factor<00:00:53.360> came<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.539> play<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> lot

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
his healing factor came into play a lot

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.560 
his healing factor came into play a lot
more<00:00:55.410> when<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.489> happened<00:00:57.800> because<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:59.570> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
more when this happened because of the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.380 
more when this happened because of the
fact<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.870> he<00:01:00.989> was<00:01:01.199> younger<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.180> guess<00:01:03.180> that's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
fact that he was younger I guess that's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
fact that he was younger I guess that's
what<00:01:03.570> accelerate<00:01:04.019> his<00:01:04.140> healing<00:01:04.439> factor<00:01:04.470> more

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
what accelerate his healing factor more

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.060 
what accelerate his healing factor more
because<00:01:05.970> he<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.049> surviving<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:07.740> more<00:01:07.920> than

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
because he was surviving a lot more than

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
because he was surviving a lot more than
he<00:01:08.130> was<00:01:08.250> before<00:01:08.369> before<00:01:08.610> sealing<00:01:08.970> factor<00:01:09.330> was

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
he was before before sealing factor was

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
he was before before sealing factor was
good<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:09.840> not<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.530> like<00:01:10.770> he<00:01:10.920> gets<00:01:11.040> shot

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
good but not this good like he gets shot

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
good but not this good like he gets shot
head<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> couple<00:01:12.570> hours<00:01:12.810> later<00:01:12.990> he'd<00:01:13.229> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
head and like couple hours later he'd be

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.660 
head and like couple hours later he'd be
fine<00:01:13.560> there's<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> lot<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.430> reckless

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
fine there's a lot more reckless

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
fine there's a lot more reckless
Deathstroke<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:15.450> well<00:01:15.570> he<00:01:15.689> wasn't<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.049> as

Deathstroke as well he wasn't here as

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.600 
Deathstroke as well he wasn't here as
good<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.820> um<00:01:18.290> like<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.409> said<00:01:19.439> he<00:01:19.650> did<00:01:19.830> lose<00:01:20.400> his

good like um like I said he did lose his
memory<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.030> he<00:01:21.090> didn't<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.570> anything

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
memory so he didn't really know anything

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.630 
memory so he didn't really know anything
he<00:01:22.020> acted<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.530> instinct<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.490> pretty

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.149 
done this before and all this stuff is
really<00:01:39.570> weird<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.560> when<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> art

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
really weird this was also when the art

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.499 
really weird this was also when the art
started<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.610> drop<00:01:41.820> off<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> got<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
started to drop off because it got a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.410 
started to drop off because it got a
different<00:01:42.840> artist<00:01:43.259> was<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.270> art

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
different artist was like it the art

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.520 
different artist was like it the art
didn't<00:01:45.720> look<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.110> great

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.260 

thus<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.009> was<00:01:50.130> guy<00:01:50.280> cool<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:51.030> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
thus it was it was guy cool like it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.670 
thus it was it was guy cool like it
wasn't<00:01:51.509> my<00:01:51.570> favorite<00:01:51.720> suit<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.229> much<00:01:52.409> prefer

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
wasn't my favorite suit I much prefer

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.440 
wasn't my favorite suit I much prefer
the<00:01:52.860> original<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> nice<00:01:54.390> new<00:01:54.750> tank

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
the original but it was a nice new tank

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.870 
the original but it was a nice new tank
I<00:01:55.930> was<00:01:56.770> hoping<00:01:57.039> they<00:01:57.189> would<00:01:57.310> include<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.759> in

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
I was hoping they would include it in

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.429 
I was hoping they would include it in
Arkham<00:01:58.149> origins<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.659> was<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.899> other<00:01:59.020> suit<00:01:59.320> I

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
Arkham origins that was the other suit I

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.109 
Arkham origins that was the other suit I
was<00:01:59.649> I<00:01:59.890> was<00:02:00.460> guessing<00:02:00.579> they<00:02:00.850> were<00:02:00.880> gonna
