00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
the volvo car corporation is already at

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.090 
the volvo car corporation is already at
the<00:00:07.450> forefront<00:00:07.690> of<00:00:08.080> developments<00:00:08.800> when<00:00:08.980> it

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
the forefront of developments when it

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.740 
the forefront of developments when it
comes<00:00:09.340> to<00:00:09.520> preventive<00:00:10.090> safety<00:00:11.850> and<00:00:12.850> now<00:00:13.330> the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
comes to preventive safety and now the

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.199 
comes to preventive safety and now the
intelligent<00:00:14.170> car<00:00:14.709> is<00:00:14.950> set<00:00:15.219> to<00:00:15.340> become<00:00:15.459> even

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
intelligent car is set to become even

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.660 
intelligent car is set to become even
more<00:00:16.240> intelligent<00:00:17.230> with<00:00:18.070> completely

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
more intelligent with completely

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.279 
more intelligent with completely
automatic<00:00:19.390> braking<00:00:19.689> power<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:26.050> situation

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
automatic braking power the situation

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.200 
automatic braking power the situation
that<00:00:26.679> we're<00:00:26.800> seeing<00:00:27.039> here<00:00:27.250> is<00:00:27.310> that<00:00:27.609> the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
that we're seeing here is that the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.849 
that we're seeing here is that the
driver<00:00:28.449> cannot<00:00:28.900> steer<00:00:29.169> around<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.650> vehicle

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
driver cannot steer around the vehicle

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.249 
driver cannot steer around the vehicle
in<00:00:30.160> front<00:00:30.189> of<00:00:30.519> him<00:00:30.669> or<00:00:30.789> her<00:00:30.939> and<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:31.869> means<00:00:32.050> that

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
in front of him or her and it means that

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.420 
in front of him or her and it means that
the<00:00:32.349> point<00:00:32.529> where<00:00:32.800> acylation<00:00:33.070> becomes

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
the point where acylation becomes

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.000 
the point where acylation becomes
unavoidable<00:00:33.880> is<00:00:34.270> much<00:00:34.720> earlier<00:00:35.200> and<00:00:35.410> it<00:00:35.800> also

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
unavoidable is much earlier and it also

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.770 
unavoidable is much earlier and it also
means<00:00:36.340> that<00:00:36.550> we<00:00:36.670> can<00:00:36.850> provide<00:00:37.330> automatic

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
means that we can provide automatic

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.680 
means that we can provide automatic
braking<00:00:38.170> already<00:00:38.980> earlier<00:00:39.400> and<00:00:39.610> even<00:00:40.420> so

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
braking already earlier and even so

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.200 
braking already earlier and even so
early<00:00:41.050> that<00:00:41.200> we<00:00:41.650> can<00:00:41.860> avoid<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.760> excellence

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
early that we can avoid the excellence

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.650 
early that we can avoid the excellence
completely<00:00:44.310> for<00:00:45.310> some<00:00:45.490> time<00:00:45.820> now<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.120> volvo

the driver if he or she doesn't react
quickly<00:00:54.130> enough<00:00:55.470> this<00:00:56.470> principle<00:00:56.950> has<00:00:57.160> now

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
quickly enough this principle has now

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.930 
quickly enough this principle has now
been<00:00:57.700> taken<00:00:57.880> a<00:00:58.150> stage<00:00:58.420> further<00:00:59.430> here<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.700> car

brakes automatically if an obstacle
crops<00:01:03.160> up<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.610> if<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.479> driver<00:01:04.720> does<00:01:04.960> not

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
crops up and if the driver does not

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.870 
crops up and if the driver does not
break<00:01:05.350> hard<00:01:05.590> enough<00:01:05.860> then<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.520> system

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
break hard enough then the system

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.620 
break hard enough then the system
increases<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.630> braking<00:01:08.020> power<00:01:09.480> at<00:01:10.480> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
increases the braking power at the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.420 
increases the braking power at the
present<00:01:11.020> time<00:01:11.050> the<00:01:11.470> system<00:01:11.650> is<00:01:11.920> still<00:01:12.160> being

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
present time the system is still being

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.580 
present time the system is still being
fully<00:01:12.820> developed<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.510> though<00:01:13.960> not<00:01:14.200> yet<00:01:14.410> in

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
fully developed and though not yet in

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.150 
fully developed and though not yet in
production<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.280> very<00:01:15.940> much<00:01:16.180> on<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.480> way<00:01:16.720> there

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
production is very much on the way there

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.160 
production is very much on the way there
what<00:01:18.160> you<00:01:18.280> see<00:01:18.460> here<00:01:18.730> is<00:01:18.880> really<00:01:19.780> advanced

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
what you see here is really advanced

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.110 
what you see here is really advanced
this<00:01:20.409> is<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.560> unique<00:01:20.800> system<00:01:21.190> but<00:01:21.820> it's<00:01:21.970> still

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
this is a unique system but it's still

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.820 
this is a unique system but it's still
in<00:01:22.330> a<00:01:22.420> concept<00:01:22.840> it's<00:01:23.110> still<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.530> research

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
in a concept it's still in a research

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.640 
in a concept it's still in a research
face<00:01:24.220> so<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.420> are<00:01:25.570> still<00:01:26.020> developing<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
face so we are still developing the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.560 
face so we are still developing the
system<00:01:26.770> but<00:01:27.159> as<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.400> can<00:01:27.520> see<00:01:27.730> here<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.150> on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
system but as you can see here and on

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.330 
system but as you can see here and on
the<00:01:28.690> test<00:01:28.900> track<00:01:28.960> it's<00:01:29.470> already<00:01:29.770> working<00:01:30.070> and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
the test track it's already working and

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.840 
the test track it's already working and
we<00:01:30.430> can<00:01:30.580> show<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:30.970> concept<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.460> question

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
we can show the concept it's a question

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.730 
we can show the concept it's a question
of<00:01:34.050> anticipating<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.200> threat<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.530> a

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
of anticipating the threat of a

of anticipating the threat of a
collision<00:01:36.159> in<00:01:36.280> time<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:37.150> be<00:01:37.270> able<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.630> prevent

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
collision in time to be able to prevent

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.430 
collision in time to be able to prevent
an<00:01:38.290> accident<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.360> isn't<00:01:40.720> there<00:01:40.900> a<00:01:40.960> risk<00:01:41.290> that

an accident but isn't there a risk that

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.969 
an accident but isn't there a risk that
