this comparison before but comparing the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.750 
this comparison before but comparing the
backs<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.540> helmets<00:04:08.960> to<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.460> area

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
backs of the helmets to to the area

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.330 
backs of the helmets to to the area
light<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:12.320> was<00:04:12.440> really<00:04:12.470> close

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
light one it was really close

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.530 
light one it was really close
so<00:04:13.790> yeah<00:04:15.310> just<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:19.700> then<00:04:19.940> he<00:04:20.030> has<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.300> same

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
so yeah just and then he has the same

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.040 
so yeah just and then he has the same
back<00:04:21.320> printing<00:04:21.860> there<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:24.080> yeah<00:04:25.570> he's<00:04:26.570> kind

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
back printing there and yeah he's kind

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.580 
back printing there and yeah he's kind
of<00:04:27.290> like<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:28.670> shadow<00:04:29.320> stormtrooper<00:04:30.320> here<00:04:30.500> at

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
of like the shadow stormtrooper here at

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.890 
of like the shadow stormtrooper here at
shadow<00:04:30.800> trooper<00:04:32.200> same<00:04:33.200> idea<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:34.040> as<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:34.970> clone

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
shadow trooper same idea just as a clone

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.860 
shadow trooper same idea just as a clone
or<00:04:35.930> his<00:04:36.200> version<00:04:36.410> or<00:04:37.130> triple<00:04:38.090> kilometres<00:04:38.660> and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
or his version or triple kilometres and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.560 
or his version or triple kilometres and
but<00:04:39.590> yeah<00:04:39.770> he's<00:04:40.070> definitely<00:04:40.450> better<00:04:41.450> than

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
but yeah he's definitely better than

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.550 
but yeah he's definitely better than
that<00:04:41.900> one

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
that one

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.590 
that one
