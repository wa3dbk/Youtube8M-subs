the edge of the room you take damage if

ads<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.080> instantly<00:01:22.530> die<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> run

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
ads you instantly die so you have to run

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.780 
ads you instantly die so you have to run
around<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:25.320> hitting<00:01:25.560> walls<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.520> running

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
around not hitting walls and not running

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
around not hitting walls and not running
into<00:01:27.090> anything<00:01:27.350> until<00:01:28.350> your<00:01:28.470> raid<00:01:28.650> breaks<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
into anything until your raid breaks you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
into anything until your raid breaks you
out<00:01:29.329> this<00:01:30.329> usually<00:01:30.840> takes<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.439> five<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.860> six

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
out this usually takes just five or six

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.819 
out this usually takes just five or six
seconds<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.549> most<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> fun<00:01:34.079> part<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.619> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
seconds at most the fun part is that you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.429 
seconds at most the fun part is that you
can<00:01:35.100> run<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.700> golden<00:01:36.210> orbs<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> if

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
can run into these golden orbs and if

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
can run into these golden orbs and if
you<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.799> you'll<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.340> healed<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> full<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.299> well

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you do you'll be healed to full as well

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.390 
you do you'll be healed to full as well
as<00:01:39.900> buffing<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.350> raid<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.979> break<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> out

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
as buffing your raid to break you out

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.450 
as buffing your raid to break you out
faster<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.680> wish<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> maze<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.250> more

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
faster I wish the maze was more

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.060 
faster I wish the maze was more
complicated<00:01:44.869> but<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.049> basic<00:01:46.380> strategy<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
complicated but the basic strategy is to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
complicated but the basic strategy is to
take<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.549> first<00:01:47.759> left<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:49.049> turn<00:01:49.290> left

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
take your first left and then turn left

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.639 
take your first left and then turn left
again<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.909> reach<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.360> orb<00:01:51.689> turn<00:01:52.350> around

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
again if you reach this orb turn around

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.340 
again if you reach this orb turn around
and<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.070> back<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> way<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.549> came<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:54.350> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and go back the way you came if you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
and go back the way you came if you
aren't<00:01:55.560> back<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.250> normal<00:01:56.399> realm<00:01:56.759> by<00:01:56.909> the

seconds<00:02:56.820> that's<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.020> get<00:02:58.140> out<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.380> hand

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
seconds that's going to get out of hand

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.670 
seconds that's going to get out of hand
quickly<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.360> if<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.630> nothing<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.440> is

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
quickly and if you do nothing that is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.370 
quickly and if you do nothing that is
indeed<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.100> case<00:03:02.420> but<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.570> are<00:03:03.690> able<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.110> run

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
indeed the case but you are able to run

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.220 
indeed the case but you are able to run
over<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.920> riff<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.370> close<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.690> take<00:03:06.930> some

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
over the riff to close it you take some

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.170 
over the riff to close it you take some
damage<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:07.890> more<00:03:08.280> importantly<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.970> get<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
damage but more importantly you get a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.570 
damage but more importantly you get a
debuff<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:09.989> one<00:03:10.170> minute<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:11.040> doesn't<00:03:11.489> allow

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
debuff for one minute that doesn't allow

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.780 
debuff for one minute that doesn't allow
you<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.030> close<00:03:12.239> any<00:03:12.450> more<00:03:12.840> ribs<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.459> basic

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
you to close any more ribs so the basic

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.760 
you to close any more ribs so the basic
strategy<00:03:15.239> here<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.870> have<00:03:16.170> your<00:03:16.320> rate<00:03:16.560> be

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
strategy here is to have your rate be

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.250 
strategy here is to have your rate be
aware<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.100> nearby<00:03:17.489> riffs<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.269> close<00:03:19.019> them

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
aware of nearby riffs and close them

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.920 
aware of nearby riffs and close them
when<00:03:19.410> they<00:03:19.530> can<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.510> get<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> hundred

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
when they can you can get a hundred

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.990 
when they can you can get a hundred
percent<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> ribs<00:03:22.739> but<00:03:23.459> it's<00:03:23.670> probably

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
percent of the ribs but it's probably

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.910 
percent of the ribs but it's probably
not<00:03:24.209> worth<00:03:24.239> having<00:03:24.690> almost<00:03:25.019> your<00:03:25.320> entire<00:03:25.350> rate

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
not worth having almost your entire rate

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.479 
not worth having almost your entire rate
doing<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.430> as<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.269> riffs<00:03:27.480> get<00:03:27.720> spread<00:03:28.049> out

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
doing this as the riffs get spread out

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.729 
doing this as the riffs get spread out
at<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.940> very<00:03:30.239> least<00:03:30.510> your<00:03:30.989> tanks<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.530> grab

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
at the very least your tanks can grab

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.190 
at the very least your tanks can grab
one<00:03:31.950> when<00:03:32.220> they<00:03:32.370> aren't<00:03:32.549> tanking<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.180> all<00:03:34.080> of

one when they aren't tanking and all of

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
your dps can rotate through grabbing the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.780 
your dps can rotate through grabbing the
riffs<00:03:36.330> be<00:03:37.200> very<00:03:37.500> careful<00:03:37.980> though<00:03:38.160> if<00:03:38.400> you're

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
riffs be very careful though if you're

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
nasty dot in there you might die from

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.870 
nasty dot in there you might die from
closing<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.769> rift<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.400> aren't<00:03:44.610> topped

after<00:03:53.850> your<00:03:53.970> debuff<00:03:54.299> expires<00:03:54.860> use<00:03:55.860> some<00:03:56.100> kind

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
after your debuff expires use some kind

after your debuff expires use some kind
of<00:03:56.459> weak<00:03:56.670> warriors<00:03:57.090> or<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.810> remember<00:03:58.170> about

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
of weak warriors or just remember about

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.080 
of weak warriors or just remember about
the<00:03:58.530> same<00:03:58.769> part<00:03:59.070> of<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.190> boss<00:03:59.430> cycle<00:03:59.850> that<00:03:59.940> you

the same part of the boss cycle that you

close riffs the rate as a whole would

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.360 
close riffs the rate as a whole would

the<00:06:02.430> most<00:06:02.639> part<00:06:02.880> the<00:06:03.779> melee<00:06:04.139> tanks<00:06:04.650> and<00:06:04.830> myself

the most part the melee tanks and myself

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.450 
the most part the melee tanks and myself
would<00:06:05.789> occasionally<00:06:06.300> hit<00:06:06.569> a<00:06:06.599> rift<00:06:06.870> up<00:06:07.080> front

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
would occasionally hit a rift up front

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.920 
would occasionally hit a rift up front
but<00:06:08.460> we<00:06:08.669> seem<00:06:08.849> to<00:06:09.029> keep<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.270> number<00:06:09.569> of<00:06:09.690> riffs

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
but we seem to keep the number of riffs

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.209 
but we seem to keep the number of riffs
pretty<00:06:10.289> low<00:06:10.819> using<00:06:11.819> this<00:06:11.909> approach<00:06:12.979> the<00:06:13.979> last

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
pretty low using this approach the last

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.159 
pretty low using this approach the last
major<00:06:14.430> thing<00:06:14.610> to<00:06:14.940> mention<00:06:15.120> is<00:06:15.330> the<00:06:15.509> damage<00:06:15.990> of

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
major thing to mention is the damage of

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.339 
major thing to mention is the damage of
swelling<00:06:16.560> pride<00:06:17.029> with<00:06:18.029> a<00:06:18.060> raid<00:06:18.389> dps<00:06:18.569> which

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
will show at the end we had for swelling

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.839 
will show at the end we had for swelling
prides<00:06:22.229> before<00:06:22.800> we<00:06:22.889> pushed<00:06:23.159> into<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.520> last
