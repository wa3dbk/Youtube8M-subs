these heists missions that they create

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.230

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
are not like any other jobs it takes

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.600 
are not like any other jobs it takes
some<00:02:49.420> time<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.720> create<00:02:50.170> these<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.800> takes<00:02:51.340> time

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
some time to create these and takes time

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.510

it<00:02:51.880> takes<00:02:51.910> effort<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.660> takes<00:02:52.810> planning<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.590> it

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520
