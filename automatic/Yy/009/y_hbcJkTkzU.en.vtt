we have what's known as tablature tab

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.190 
we have what's known as tablature tab
for<00:00:11.080> short<00:00:11.350> and<00:00:11.530> the<00:00:12.400> chord<00:00:12.670> diagrams<00:00:13.240> start

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
for short and the chord diagrams start

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.900 
for short and the chord diagrams start
with<00:00:14.620> the<00:00:14.980> tablature<00:00:15.370> here

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
with the tablature here

see<00:00:16.299> there's<00:00:16.480> 1<00:00:16.720> 2<00:00:17.020> 3<00:00:17.050> 4<00:00:17.619> 5<00:00:18.310> 6<00:00:18.790> lines<00:00:19.180> just<00:00:20.109> like

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
see there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 lines just like

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.340 
see there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 lines just like
there<00:00:20.560> are<00:00:20.590> 6<00:00:20.980> strings<00:00:21.310> on<00:00:21.490> a<00:00:21.520> guitar<00:00:22.350> each

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
there are 6 strings on a guitar each

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.580 
there are 6 strings on a guitar each
line<00:00:23.830> represents<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:24.580> string<00:00:25.060> and<00:00:25.359> the<00:00:26.260> number

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
line represents a string and the number

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.160 
line represents a string and the number
on<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.010> line<00:00:27.189> tells<00:00:27.880> you<00:00:27.970> which<00:00:28.210> fret<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.960> play

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
on the line tells you which fret to play

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.599 
on the line tells you which fret to play
on<00:00:29.320> that<00:00:29.350> particular<00:00:30.039> string

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
on that particular string

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.070 
on that particular string
so<00:00:30.789> for<00:00:31.300> example<00:00:31.439> with<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.619> C<00:00:32.890> right<00:00:33.699> here

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
so for example with the C right here

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.319 
so for example with the C right here
this<00:00:35.080> third<00:00:35.440> fret<00:00:35.830> is<00:00:36.040> on<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.550> second<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.210> the

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
this third fret is on the second to the

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.110 
this third fret is on the second to the
bottom<00:00:37.480> line<00:00:38.290> second<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.520> bottom<00:00:39.820> string

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
bottom line second to the bottom string

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.470 
bottom line second to the bottom string
on<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.899> one<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.440> third<00:00:42.040> fret<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.440> moves<00:00:44.980> over

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
on the one to third fret so moves over

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.360 
on the one to third fret so moves over
one<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.750> then<00:00:47.079> that'd<00:00:47.379> be<00:00:47.559> the<00:00:47.710> second<00:00:48.100> fret

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
one and then that'd be the second fret

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.000 
one and then that'd be the second fret
when<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.180> see<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.420> zero<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:50.140> means<00:00:50.289> open<00:00:50.590> so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
when you see a zero that means open so

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.529 
when you see a zero that means open so
that's<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:52.480> string<00:00:52.840> by<00:00:52.989> itself<00:00:54.030> below<00:00:55.030> we

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
that's that string by itself below we

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.470 
that's that string by itself below we
have<00:00:55.690> what<00:00:55.930> are<00:00:55.960> called<00:00:56.110> chord<00:00:56.890> blocks<00:00:57.480> once

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
have what are called chord blocks once

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.810 
have what are called chord blocks once
again<00:00:58.750> there<00:00:58.930> are<00:00:59.020> six<00:00:59.260> lines<00:00:59.590> each<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.640> them

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
again there are six lines each of them

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.779 
again there are six lines each of them
is<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> guitar<00:01:01.480> string<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.430> each<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.699> these

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
is a guitar string and each of these

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.770 
is a guitar string and each of these
spaces<00:01:04.149> going<00:01:04.690> across<00:01:04.960> is<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.379> fret<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.780> above

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
spaces going across is a fret and above

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.899 
spaces going across is a fret and above
here<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.470> X<00:01:08.680> means<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.310> don't<00:01:09.460> play<00:01:09.729> the

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
here the X means you don't play the

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.960 
here the X means you don't play the
string<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.869> circle<00:01:11.320> means<00:01:11.530> it's<00:01:12.159> open

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
string and a circle means it's open

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.030 
string and a circle means it's open
meaning<00:01:13.450> no<00:01:13.659> fret<00:01:13.990> so<00:01:14.290> for<00:01:14.530> example<00:01:14.950> this

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
meaning no fret so for example this

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.609 
meaning no fret so for example this
first<00:01:15.280> chord<00:01:15.840> says<00:01:16.840> if<00:01:17.049> you're<00:01:17.229> looking<00:01:17.470> at

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
first chord says if you're looking at

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.429 
first chord says if you're looking at
the<00:01:17.799> guitar<00:01:18.130> like<00:01:18.369> so<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:19.570> see<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.960> third

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
the guitar like so you see the third

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.240 
the guitar like so you see the third
fret<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.040> second<00:01:21.670> closest<00:01:22.119> string<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.100> we

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
fret on the second closest string and we

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.219 
fret on the second closest string and we
have<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> second<00:01:24.820> fret<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.450> then<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.869> first

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
have the second fret and then the first

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.230 
have the second fret and then the first
fret<00:01:26.530> on<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.799> second<00:01:27.400> string<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.850> chord

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
fret on the second string so that chord

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.539 
fret on the second string so that chord
would<00:01:28.450> look<00:01:28.630> like<00:01:28.869> that

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
would look like that

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.530 
would look like that
also<00:01:31.360> sometimes<00:01:32.200> you'll<00:01:32.680> see<00:01:33.360> something<00:01:34.360> like

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
also sometimes you'll see something like

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.410 
also sometimes you'll see something like
this<00:01:34.930> that's<00:01:35.590> known<00:01:35.829> as<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:36.009> barre<00:01:36.340> chord<00:01:36.420> where

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
this that's known as a barre chord where

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.179 
this that's known as a barre chord where
you<00:01:37.630> use<00:01:37.840> one<00:01:38.079> finger<00:01:38.320> all<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.799> way<00:01:38.890> across

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
you use one finger all the way across

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.789 
you use one finger all the way across
the<00:01:39.729> first<00:01:40.030> fret<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.600> then<00:01:41.409> your<00:01:41.470> other

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
the first fret and then your other

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.039 
the first fret and then your other
fingers<00:01:42.250> fall<00:01:42.520> into<00:01:42.850> place<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.350> here

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
fingers fall into place for this here

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.770 
fingers fall into place for this here
that's<00:01:47.049> what<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:47.500> looks<00:01:47.799> like<00:01:47.920> right<00:01:48.310> here

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that's what this looks like right here

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.270 
that's what this looks like right here
ok<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:49.810> we're<00:01:50.110> going<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.290> work<00:01:50.439> out<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.890> chords

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
ok so we're going to work out the chords

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.639 
ok so we're going to work out the chords
and<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.880> rhythm<00:01:52.210> for<00:01:52.450> La<00:01:52.570> Bamba<00:01:52.930> starting

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
and the rhythm for La Bamba starting

and the rhythm for La Bamba starting
with<00:01:53.770> C<00:01:54.070> which<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:54.939> play<00:01:55.210> for<00:01:55.450> two<00:01:55.600> beats<00:01:55.840> using

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
with C which we play for two beats using

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.330 
with C which we play for two beats using
your<00:01:56.590> first<00:01:57.570> second<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:58.689> third<00:01:59.470> fingers

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340

then<00:02:03.340> f<00:02:03.729> for<00:02:04.420> two<00:02:04.630> beats<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:05.470> get<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.799> this

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
then f for two beats to get to this

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.699 
then f for two beats to get to this
court<00:02:06.340> what<00:02:06.850> what<00:02:07.299> I'm<00:02:07.420> doing<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.259> flatten
