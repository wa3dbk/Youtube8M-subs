 this video was brought to you by hize

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.380
 Hello everyone if you watch videos on the channel 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.790
 youtube cut there on the day of 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.220
 today we have a first look at the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.230
 assembled computer lets that attacked her 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.689
 and why he kills her with good because it's the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.369
 blanket consoles and well let's see what 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.900
 is what we find inside of 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.180
 this computer 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.720
 inside you will not find a gpu 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.570
 nvidia geforce gtx 250 and a processor 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.379
 intel core i3 40 and 150 which they 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.460
 will soon update to 41 60 a card 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:46.030
 mother gh 97 million 3h 8 gigabytes of 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.790
 memory ranking are 'breaks' fiber of 8 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.250
 gigabytes to 1600 megahertz either in 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.379
 red blue or black color a source of 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.190
 power that this source of power is of my 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.250
 favorite is an ace x 430 that's from 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.680
 corsair certification 80plus bronze usa 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.690
 a very reliable source of power 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.090
 we will also find good 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.280
 different cabinet options in the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.530
 video let's see the aero culex predator 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.430
 x one in black configuration with red 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.130
 we're also going to watch a dvd drive and 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.310
 a hard disk of a terabyte sata 3 to 7 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.970
 one thousand two hundred revolutions per minute 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.800
 now take the monkeys a few seconds to 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.650
 think about the tail kill 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.500
 and I'm going to tell you this when I did 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.730
 lamata ads that I was a person 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.510
 what 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.640
 did not trust japan skeptical a bit of 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.510
 the greed kills good if the island 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.250
 attacked why you do not put a price a bit 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.000
 more competitive the price today 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 is 9 thousand 950 pesos here in Mexico and 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.980
 good compared to the 8500 of an xbox 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.370
 one with kinect or the 7000 of a play 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:01.240
 station 4 and wish good if there is a jump 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.570
 quite high price but after 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.310
 speak with skull the manager of the area of 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.149
 physical and very good he made me understand 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.940
 why false and ordered to do is good 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.950
 did this computer with those pieces and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.780
 it was at that price 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.820
 and what he explained to me I'm going to 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.830
 convey to you is that since it does not 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.320
 I was looking to make the computer cheaper 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.210
 because yes yes if we put a little bit of 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.160
 cheaper components maybe a 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.530
 md processor we can even 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.840
 increase the graphics card leaving it 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.120
 at the same price or we can still lower 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.310
 much more the price of this equipment 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.590
 then the intention of them was not 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.470
 that was not to make a super cheap team 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.840
 increase the cheapest parts 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.230
 you will find and there is here the co 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.000
 not only find pieces that were 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.650
 updatable the good mother card in 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.560
 a future can support if you 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.780
 they want an intel core i7 processor without 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.190
 problems and the second unlocked 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.190
 locked clear they will not be able to do 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.200
 overclock but he admits them and also 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.250
 a video card up to an nvidia 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.530
 geforce gtx 980 so because the those 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.420
 components are components of a tdp or 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.340
 is not going to consume more than 300 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.700
 watts a team well the team as well as 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.550
 it's easy to consume less than 150 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.100
 watts very energy efficient and good and 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.069
 it gives us the opportunity to expand 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.980
 even more 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.900
 as our components expand and 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.340
 well he explained to me this we did not look for 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.319
 only throw away economic pieces 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.989
 We were really looking for that 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.980
 performance that satisfaction with the 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.959
 client that quality that is the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.689
 quality that hai is handling myself 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.900
 I tried the game for a while 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:50.209
 sorry computer and in particular I 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.099
 It was very pleasing how it worked in any 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.959
 We regret any type of game 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.569
 including uach stocks that is a game 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.730
 which is a bit poorly optimized and is very 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.099
 plaintiff and all the games the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.760
 occurred at 60 frames per second in 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.439
 1080p in medium quality this team is 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.530
 designed for that to play the game 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.469
 that you want in 1080p quality 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.480
 mean now if you buy the kills 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:16.669
 which the best are going to say good I'm going to 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.920
 reuse my old monitor hp my 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.360
 old monitor 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.820
 of 18.5 inches which is the traditional 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.980
 good on a monitor of lower resolution 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.470
 is still going to give you a little more 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.550
 better they can even increase it to 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.250
 space high and I would run between 40 and 60 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.700
 frames per second different games in 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.210
 a lower resolution good that was careful 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.130
 much the wiring the equipment assembly 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.730
 it's very good you can see the professionalism 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.960
 leave that is very nice to see toy still 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.760
 people who twisted the wires 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.150
 sata in the back good to 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.480
 wiring is also very very good 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.470
 cap closes perfectly good equipment 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.290
 very clean very aesthetic and good is a 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.080
 team that I liked very much 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.080
 like to have more time to play 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.540
 with him and well this was all and if you 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.180
 I would like Jason 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.620
 and I made a performance video 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.330
 of the kill as saying here in the 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.640
 comments so we can convince 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.800
 he made it to be done I leave the link 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.660
 of the mata co version 1 which is the one 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.190
 we are seeing in the video and good 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.320
 remember to follow me on facebook twitter 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.970
 in all my social networks in general and 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.970
 well that was all and until next time
