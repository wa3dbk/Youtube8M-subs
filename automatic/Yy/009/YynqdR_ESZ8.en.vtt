00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
so let's take a look at ball position

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.350 
so let's take a look at ball position
picture<00:00:15.230> on<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.469> right<00:00:15.740> here<00:00:16.280> I've<00:00:16.640> got<00:00:17.030> a

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
picture on the right here I've got a

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.890 
picture on the right here I've got a
8-iron<00:00:18.290> picture<00:00:19.220> on<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.460> left<00:00:19.490> here<00:00:20.269> I've<00:00:20.539> got

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
8-iron picture on the left here I've got

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.359 
8-iron picture on the left here I've got
a<00:00:21.050> three<00:00:21.439> hour<00:00:21.560> nice<00:00:21.769> look<00:00:21.920> at<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:22.099> subtle

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
a three hour nice look at the subtle

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.679 
a three hour nice look at the subtle
differences<00:00:22.760> in<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:23.000> board<00:00:23.210> position<00:00:23.539> and

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
differences in the board position and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.179 
differences in the board position and
what<00:00:23.779> that<00:00:23.960> does<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.349> the<00:00:24.590> impact<00:00:24.949> position

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
what that does to the impact position

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.029 
what that does to the impact position
and<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:26.570> angle<00:00:27.050> of<00:00:27.109> attack<00:00:27.230> King<00:00:27.740> threw<00:00:27.980> the

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
and the angle of attack King threw the

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.200 
and the angle of attack King threw the
ball<00:00:28.160> so<00:00:28.340> we've<00:00:28.460> got<00:00:28.580> bear<00:00:28.759> in<00:00:28.849> mind<00:00:28.970> with<00:00:29.119> an

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
ball so we've got bear in mind with an

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.870 
ball so we've got bear in mind with an
eight<00:00:29.300> on<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:29.779> club's<00:00:29.990> got<00:00:30.170> lost<00:00:30.730> so<00:00:31.730> what

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
eight on the club's got lost so what

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.010 
eight on the club's got lost so what
happens<00:00:32.180> is<00:00:32.270> i<00:00:32.330> put<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:32.570> ball<00:00:32.720> more<00:00:32.840> in<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
happens is i put the ball more in the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.770 
happens is i put the ball more in the
middle<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.320> my<00:00:33.380> stance<00:00:34.300> compared<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.420> three<00:00:35.660> on

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
middle of my stance compared to three on

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.479 
middle of my stance compared to three on
that<00:00:35.960> has<00:00:36.079> less<00:00:36.379> loft<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.100> ball<00:00:37.309> goes

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
that has less loft and the ball goes

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.639 
that has less loft and the ball goes
closer<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:38.000> my<00:00:38.120> front<00:00:38.510> foot<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.320> it's<00:00:39.440> close<00:00:39.620> to

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
closer to my front foot so it's close to

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.410 
closer to my front foot so it's close to
my<00:00:39.890> left<00:00:40.070> foot<00:00:40.309> as<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.460> right-handed<00:00:41.000> golfer

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
my left foot as a right-handed golfer

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.510 
my left foot as a right-handed golfer
now<00:00:42.050> what<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:42.410> does<00:00:42.469> this<00:00:42.920> bull<00:00:43.160> vision

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
now what this does this bull vision

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.819 
now what this does this bull vision
creates<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.149> different<00:00:44.840> angle<00:00:45.260> of<00:00:45.320> attack<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
creates a different angle of attack the

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.560 
creates a different angle of attack the
a<00:00:45.860> time<00:00:46.219> I<00:00:46.250> get<00:00:46.700> more<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:46.969> descending<00:00:47.449> blow

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
a time I get more of a descending blow

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.600 
a time I get more of a descending blow
into<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.079> ball<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:48.829> what<00:00:48.980> you'll<00:00:49.129> notice<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.520> I

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
into the ball so what you'll notice as I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.580 
into the ball so what you'll notice as I
strike<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.059> ball<00:00:50.210> my<00:00:50.420> head<00:00:50.840> my<00:00:51.110> left<00:00:51.320> ear<00:00:51.469> is

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
touching the line which is ball was

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.479 
touching the line which is ball was
touching<00:00:54.440> that<00:00:54.559> line<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.039> I'm<00:00:55.129> pretty<00:00:55.370> much

going to notice my weight still going
forwards<00:01:07.760> my<00:01:08.000> lower<00:01:08.150> half<00:01:08.240> smoothing<00:01:08.750> through

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
forwards my lower half smoothing through

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.550 
forwards my lower half smoothing through
but<00:01:09.590> my<00:01:09.740> head<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:09.920> further<00:01:10.430> back<00:01:11.230> them<00:01:12.230> where

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
but my head is further back them where

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.500 
but my head is further back them where
the<00:01:12.800> ball<00:01:12.980> begun<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.910> cause<00:01:14.270> obviously

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
the ball begun this is cause obviously

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.960 
the ball begun this is cause obviously
with<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.870> ball<00:01:15.050> being<00:01:15.230> further<00:01:15.470> forward<00:01:16.040> also

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
with the ball being further forward also

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.850 
with the ball being further forward also
I<00:01:17.000> was<00:01:17.360> slightly<00:01:17.690> leaning<00:01:18.020> back<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:18.350> my<00:01:18.620> upper

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
I was slightly leaning back in my upper

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.890 
I was slightly leaning back in my upper
body<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.220> try<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:19.550> create<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.790> shallower<00:01:20.540> angle

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
body to try and create a shallower angle

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.870 
body to try and create a shallower angle
of<00:01:21.140> attack<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.710> try<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.340> generate<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.700> bit<00:01:22.850> of

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
of attack to try and generate a bit of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.220 
of attack to try and generate a bit of
launch<00:01:23.180> with<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.720> three<00:01:23.900> iron<00:01:24.050> which

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
launch with the three iron which

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.380 
launch with the three iron which
obviously<00:01:24.500> has<00:01:24.650> a<00:01:24.890> little<00:01:25.280> less<00:01:25.580> loft<00:01:26.000> so

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
obviously has a little less loft so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.940 
obviously has a little less loft so
you've<00:01:26.930> got<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.200> understand<00:01:27.620> your<00:01:27.800> ball

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
you've got to understand your ball

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.550 
you've got to understand your ball
position<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:29.420> relationship<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.230> loft<00:01:30.440> of

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
position in relationship to the loft of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.230 
position in relationship to the loft of
the<00:01:30.620> club<00:01:30.680> for<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.280> get<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.520> most<00:01:31.580> out<00:01:32.180> of

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
the club for you to get the most out of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
your golf shots the lower the loft so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.940 
your golf shots the lower the loft so
the<00:01:35.210> more<00:01:35.360> straight<00:01:35.690> face<00:01:35.990> clubs<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.650> further

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
the more straight face clubs the further

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.920 
the more straight face clubs the further
towards<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> front<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.180> they<00:01:38.360> go<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.600> help

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
towards the front that they go to help
