 Yes Hi Chitose Is this time 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.710
 While looking at the catalog 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.470

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.860
 x625 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.840
 About the difference in appearance 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.100
 I want to introduce 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.050
 Yes 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.050

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.680

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.160
 The relationship and why 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.520
 Thin person 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:57.170
 This is an inverted fork with a silver part underneath 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 The lower Rex's book is the slower one, so I 'm wondering if this is covered too 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.219
 But it is an erect fork with the thinner one on top 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219
 Yes 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.000
 It is from the mouth 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.409
 Next is a tire 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.409

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.230

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.230

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.010

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.720
 Some of the sound system Rex 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.360

 It's getting higher, but it's about going to the upper reaches of the people Gonnietpa Yamanaka, but it is high 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600
 We now have 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.730
 It is such a place , I think that the difference in appearance is about that or that design after 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.550
 is not it 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.640
 For example, this is red 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:25.540
