an Indian expression which actually may
have<00:00:10.170> severe<00:00:10.469> repercussions<00:00:11.630> for<00:00:12.630> example<00:00:14.179> we

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
have severe repercussions for example we

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.540 
have severe repercussions for example we
usually<00:00:15.599> say<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.139> passed<00:00:16.800> out

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
usually say I passed out

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
in the year so and soon passed out

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.089 
in the year so and soon passed out
actually<00:00:21.660> means<00:00:23.930> unconscious<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.740> means

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
actually means unconscious it means

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.810 
actually means unconscious it means

so passed out may be substituted with

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.410 
so passed out may be substituted with

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
understand out of the station so it's

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.520 
understand out of the station so it's
easier<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.850> say<00:02:01.150> he<00:02:01.510> is<00:02:01.660> not<00:02:01.840> here<00:02:02.170> at<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
easier to say he is not here at the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.950

moment or he is not is out of town I

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.630 
moment or he is not is out of town I
think<00:02:07.960> it's<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.679> very<00:02:08.890> good<00:02:09.130> substitute<00:02:09.310> for

think it's a very good substitute for

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.500 
think it's a very good substitute for

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
first minute to the last minute will

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.400 
first minute to the last minute will
actually<00:04:16.790> remain<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.329> same<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.109> check

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
actually remain the same so you check

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.390 
actually remain the same so you check
will<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.620> say<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:19.220> have<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.699> headache<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.419> I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
will you say I have a headache and I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.279 
will you say I have a headache and I
have<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.760> class<00:04:23.199> so<00:04:24.199> I<00:04:24.500> think<00:04:24.710> if<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:26.270> can<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:27.260> a

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
have a class so I think if we can to a

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.950 
have a class so I think if we can to a
large<00:04:27.620> extent<00:04:28.130> do<00:04:28.699> I<00:04:28.729> live<00:04:29.150> with<00:04:29.360> these

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
large extent do I live with these

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.810 
large extent do I live with these
expressions<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.010> substitute<00:04:31.520> them<00:04:31.760> with

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
expressions and substitute them with

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.230 
expressions and substitute them with
simpler<00:04:32.600> ones<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:34.130> would<00:04:34.370> be<00:04:34.520> communication

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
simpler ones it would be communication

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.650 
simpler ones it would be communication
more<00:04:35.389> effective<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:37.250> think<00:04:37.449> clarity<00:04:38.449> which

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
more effective and I think clarity which

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.570 
more effective and I think clarity which
is<00:04:38.810> what<00:04:38.960> in<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.169> seas<00:04:39.440> of<00:04:39.710> communication

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
is what in the seas of communication

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.719 
is what in the seas of communication
would<00:04:41.150> term<00:04:41.919> actually<00:04:42.919> limit<00:04:43.250> we<00:04:43.430> will<00:04:43.610> be

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
would term actually limit we will be

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.230 
would term actually limit we will be
more<00:04:43.970> clear<00:04:44.360> in<00:04:44.960> our<00:04:45.080> speech<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:45.940> people<00:04:46.940> will

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
more clear in our speech and people will

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.760 
more clear in our speech and people will
understand<00:04:47.720> us<00:04:47.900> in<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.199> much<00:04:48.350> better<00:04:48.560> way

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
understand us in a much better way

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.390 
understand us in a much better way
without<00:04:49.610> being<00:04:50.539> judgmental<00:04:51.020> about<00:04:51.350> how<00:04:52.130> they

without being judgmental about how they

without being judgmental about how they
