more<00:00:58.050> choppy<00:00:58.350> environment<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.640> Steve<00:01:00.180> swims

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
more choppy environment as Steve swims

more choppy environment as Steve swims
he<00:01:00.840> takes<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.170> stroke<00:01:01.500> he<00:01:02.040> lifts<00:01:02.370> his<00:01:02.489> head<00:01:02.670> up

and<00:01:04.920> carries<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.309> swimming<00:01:05.720> what<00:01:06.720> I'd<00:01:06.840> suggest

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and carries on swimming what I'd suggest

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.370 
and carries on swimming what I'd suggest
you<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.550> ocean<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.690> a<00:01:09.780> lake<00:01:10.050> or

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
you do in the ocean or in a lake or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
you do in the ocean or in a lake or
wherever<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.009> are<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> open<00:01:11.520> water<00:01:11.910> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
wherever you are in the open water is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.300 
wherever you are in the open water is
you<00:01:12.780> lift<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.170> head<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.320> maybe<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.800> little<00:01:14.160> bit

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you lift your head up maybe a little bit

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.639 
you lift your head up maybe a little bit
higher<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.660> actually<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.440> boy

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
higher so you can actually see the boy

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:24.370 
higher so you can actually see the boy
or<00:01:17.009> see<00:01:17.399> where<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.700> need<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.940> be<00:01:18.060> going

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.440 

here<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.530> practicing<00:01:26.220> turns<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.760> Lois's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
here we are practicing turns as Lois's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
here we are practicing turns as Lois's
approaches<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> boy<00:01:28.320> she<00:01:28.590> has<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> quick<00:01:29.010> look

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
approaches the boy she has a quick look

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.220 
approaches the boy she has a quick look
at<00:01:29.340> where<00:01:29.490> she's<00:01:29.730> going

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
at where she's going

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.260 
at where she's going
she<00:01:31.230> takes<00:01:31.440> mainly<00:01:32.070> strokes<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> left<00:01:32.970> arm

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
she takes mainly strokes the left arm

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
she takes mainly strokes the left arm
while<00:01:33.630> keeping<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.200> arm<00:01:34.500> still<00:01:34.800> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
while keeping the right arm still the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.950 
while keeping the right arm still the
reason<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.090> doing<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.660> that<00:01:36.780> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
reason for doing that is so that it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.540 
reason for doing that is so that it
doesn't<00:01:37.260> get<00:01:37.320> tangled<00:01:37.830> up<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.190> boy<00:01:38.370> and

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
doesn't get tangled up in the boy and

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.070 
doesn't get tangled up in the boy and
she's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.820> hitting<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.420> way<00:01:39.540> around

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.510 

another<00:01:47.080> technique<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.650> Louis<00:01:48.100> can<00:01:48.310> use

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
another technique that Louis can use

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.550 
another technique that Louis can use
when<00:01:48.700> she's<00:01:48.880> turning<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.300> boy<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.840> she<00:01:49.900> turns<00:01:50.320> on

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
when she's turning a boy is she turns on

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.430 
when she's turning a boy is she turns on
her<00:01:50.680> back<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.190> she<00:01:51.280> uses<00:01:52.240> one<00:01:52.480> arm<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:53.230> pull

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
her back and she uses one arm to pull

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.230 
her back and she uses one arm to pull
around<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.740> boy<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.220> then<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.520> other<00:01:54.640> arm<00:01:54.940> to

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
around the boy and then the other arm to

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.750 
around the boy and then the other arm to
pull<00:01:56.110> around<00:01:56.200> again<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.190> you<00:01:57.250> get<00:01:57.430> more

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
pull around again so you get more

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.420 
pull around again so you get more
momentum<00:01:58.080> turning<00:01:59.080> by<00:01:59.290> using<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.830> rolling

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
momentum turning by using a rolling

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:14.160 
momentum turning by using a rolling
technique

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.720 

although<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> main<00:02:15.410> topic<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.980> these<00:02:16.280> videos

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
although the main topic of these videos

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.940 
although the main topic of these videos
is<00:02:17.000> open<00:02:17.390> water<00:02:17.600> swimming<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.140> then<00:02:18.560> brewery

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
is open water swimming and then brewery

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.250 
is open water swimming and then brewery
season<00:02:19.340> races<00:02:19.670> actually<00:02:20.000> use<00:02:20.150> pools<00:02:20.510> for<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
season races actually use pools for the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.920 
season races actually use pools for the
swim<00:02:21.650> because<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.100> open<00:02:22.340> water<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.700> too<00:02:22.850> cold

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
swim because the open water is too cold

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.420 
swim because the open water is too cold
so<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.170> are<00:02:24.350> going<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.800> do<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> pool<00:02:25.250> based

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
so if you are going to do a pool based

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.860 
so if you are going to do a pool based
triathlon<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.180> might<00:02:26.360> be<00:02:26.510> handy<00:02:26.840> to

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
triathlon then it might be handy to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.950 
triathlon then it might be handy to
learn<00:02:27.170> how<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.550> templeton<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.570> basic

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
learn how to do a templeton the basic

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.690 
learn how to do a templeton the basic
principle<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.560> temple<00:02:30.920> turn<00:02:31.070> is<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.370> half

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
principle of a temple turn is a half

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.730 
principle of a temple turn is a half
somersault<00:02:32.300> against<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> wall<00:02:33.380> in<00:02:33.470> which<00:02:33.560> you

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
somersault against the wall in which you

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.890 
somersault against the wall in which you
go<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.040> with<00:02:34.190> your<00:02:34.430> hands<00:02:35.180> first<00:02:35.510> and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
go in with your hands first and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.660 
go in with your hands first and
obviously<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.770> end<00:02:36.950> up<00:02:37.130> with<00:02:37.310> your<00:02:37.430> feet

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
obviously you end up with your feet

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.670 
obviously you end up with your feet
against<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.180> wall<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:39.110> good<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.470> practice

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
against the wall it's good to practice

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.470 
against the wall it's good to practice
this<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.280> middle<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.730> pool<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.450> you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
this in the middle of the pool so you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.449 
this in the middle of the pool so you
obviously<00:02:41.930> don't<00:02:42.020> hit<00:02:42.350> your<00:02:42.560> heels<00:02:43.040> against

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
the wall while practicing them so if you

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.580 
the wall while practicing them so if you
practice<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.160> half<00:02:46.370> flip<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:47.230> pretend<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.320> push

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
practice a half flip and pretend to push

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.990

off<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.920> wall<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:49.459> when<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.700> get<00:02:49.850> more

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000

off the wall and then when you get more
confident<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:50.540> doing<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.900> then<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.530> can

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
confident of doing this then you can

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280 
confident of doing this then you can
practice<00:02:51.860> at<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.430> wall<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.930> same<00:02:54.140> as

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
practice at the wall and the same as

practice at the wall and the same as
everything<00:02:54.500> else

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
everything else
