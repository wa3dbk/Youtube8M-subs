00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.379
 bigger I am together 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.840
 Concept and theme do not couple you today 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.480
 introduce tips like the first steps 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.050
 better online first of all succeed 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.240
 is the question most frequently asked is 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.950
 swing and should i should i have barefoot 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.600
 of course a better feeling today is 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.840
 a bit cold it does not speak 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.970
 we have to build up against shoes 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.070
 profile that of course it's ideal 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.870
 ton ballet slippers or even barefoot 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.679
 that is very well taken care of that 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.260
 The length of the leyen will last eight 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.999
 ten meters exactly the right distance 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.059
 for the beginners is not yet swinging 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:48.039
 strong in the middle but at the same time 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.679
 you've had a good feeling especially 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.030
 strong Latvians in the middle because it is even 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.819
 but not very much on the tree 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.920
 because it is rather static so here 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.229
 about a third of the tree 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.120
 I always say a good place 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.350
 Switzerland neutral, it is optimal 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.659
 So I'll just take yours 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.310
 left leg is flat on it you can 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.860
 you want to rest on my shoulder 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
 just there you can already see that in paints 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.640
 Clerk the foot to the back to one 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.079
 I was a little bit more on this leg 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.710
 quite characteristic is at all 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.539
 nothing bad is typical of slacklinen 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.729
 Overdriven muscles are natural 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.960
 if you have the second football that 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.770
 highest less but that leaves 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.250
 Bonds named after 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.100
 why exactly these defects had here 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.229
 Knee already followed the hip is straight 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.899
 have torso upright the second 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.649
 still in the hands high position no 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.390
 nice balance 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.219
 you are raised on the shoulder 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.630
 level below can be compensated so 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.100
 just has to be flexible while snooping 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.729
 so my reschen structure makes exactly 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.079
 Masako puts his foot to the word 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.959
 look still has to go down 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.780
 typical beginners try the end 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.459
 Alone to fix exactly and when to find 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.970
 again very good automatically 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:12.940
 that's just the way it is detached and there 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.940
 goes alone 23 step but was okay good 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.569
 Let's start again 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.630
 for example , at the same time 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.950
 ascend if you have the second leg 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.510
 not so far out should have 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.040
 and if it is very to the then the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.480
 corpse in the back then it can get to it 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.030
 to swing in the chamber 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.109
 ascend the arm lift up and have 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.280
 I once actually already in the 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.489
 starting position 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.200
 and then came on start saying empathize 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:44.299
 and here comes the first step and 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.299
 It goes on for us practice for 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.040
 It's exactly the same and normal 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.760
 hold hands 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.760
 that's when it works out by itself
