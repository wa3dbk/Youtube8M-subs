searching for lower control arms for a
Honda<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.829> an<00:00:38.430> easy<00:00:38.760> thing<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.329> because

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
Honda is an easy thing to do because

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.990 
Honda is an easy thing to do because
there's<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.960> lot<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.350> there<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.730> only

there's a lot out there on the only

there's a lot out there on the only
problem<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.899> there's<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.170> lot<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.920> crappy

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
problem is is there's a lot of crappy

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.260 
problem is is there's a lot of crappy
ones<00:00:44.879> um<00:00:45.739> primarily<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.219> reason<00:00:47.550> being<00:00:47.760> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
know why they'd be considered crappy is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.819 
know why they'd be considered crappy is
because<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.020> bushings<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> you've

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
because of the the bushings that you've

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.189 
because of the the bushings that you've
got<00:00:53.149> you<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.300> whether<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
got you know whether it be the one that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.689 
got you know whether it be the one that

that sort what happens is with some of

completely you know kind of come out on

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.190 
completely you know kind of come out on
and<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.299> shake<00:01:18.509> around<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and it will just shake around in the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.370 
and it will just shake around in the
control<00:01:19.740> arm<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.180> say<00:01:21.540> imagine<00:01:22.259> you've

your not here the control arm instead of

your not here the control arm instead of
staying<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.210> fashion<00:01:27.540> well<00:01:28.400> there's<00:01:29.400> no

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
staying in this fashion well there's no

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.999 
staying in this fashion well there's no
aw<00:01:29.610> collar<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.930> actual<00:01:31.259> bushing<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.770> some

slide back and forth even though the

slide back and forth even though the
bolt<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.360> stationary<00:01:36.990> um<00:01:38.570> one<00:01:39.570> thing<00:01:39.600> that's

good about these come to ones is that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
good about these come to ones is that
they've<00:01:42.150> kind<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.659> eliminated<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.530> factory

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
use a replicated design of the Honda

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.490 
use a replicated design of the Honda
ones<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.540> doesn't<00:02:03.780> hold<00:02:04.079> up<00:02:04.290> they're

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
ones but it just doesn't hold up they're

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.859 
ones but it just doesn't hold up they're
just<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.860> poor<00:02:05.189> quality<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.090> blowout<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
just really poor quality and blowout and

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.450 
just really poor quality and blowout and
almost<00:02:07.290> instantly<00:02:07.770> um<00:02:09.200> with<00:02:10.200> this

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
almost instantly um with this

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.210 
almost instantly um with this
to<00:02:10.760> design<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> more-or-less<00:02:11.840> ah<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:13.070> know

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
to design a more-or-less ah you know

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.960 
to design a more-or-less ah you know
solve<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.270> problem<00:02:15.190> you've<00:02:16.190> got<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.640> big

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
solve that problem you've got a big

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.760 
solve that problem you've got a big
sleeve<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.510> center<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.170> there<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.590> no

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
sleeve in the center and there is no

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.640 
sleeve in the center and there is no
outer<00:02:19.160> metal<00:02:19.700> sleeve<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.780> basically<00:02:21.260> just

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
outer metal sleeve on you basically just

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.220 
outer metal sleeve on you basically just
got<00:02:21.890> two<00:02:22.190> halves<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.120> bushing<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:24.080> you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
got two halves of the bushing so if you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.350 
got two halves of the bushing so if you
were<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.530> press<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.040> out<00:02:25.310> which<00:02:26.060> is<00:02:26.210> actually

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
were to press this out which is actually

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.840 
were to press this out which is actually
a<00:02:26.600> lot<00:02:26.810> easier<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.380> do<00:02:27.530> yourself<00:02:28.040> than<00:02:28.340> trying

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
a lot easier to do yourself than trying

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.400 
a lot easier to do yourself than trying
to<00:02:28.970> press<00:02:29.210> out<00:02:29.420> some<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.780> metal<00:02:30.080> sleeved

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
to press out some of the metal sleeved

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.130 
to press out some of the metal sleeved
ones<00:02:30.710> um<00:02:31.150> once<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.300> press<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.750> pin<00:02:32.990> out

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
ones um once you press this pin out

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.500 
ones um once you press this pin out
you've<00:02:33.680> got<00:02:33.920> these<00:02:34.250> two<00:02:34.310> bushings<00:02:35.060> which<00:02:35.210> are

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
you've got these two bushings which are

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.180 
you've got these two bushings which are
actually<00:02:35.900> split<00:02:36.290> right<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.740> middle<00:02:36.920> more

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
actually split right in the middle more

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.340 
actually split right in the middle more
or<00:02:37.340> less<00:02:37.520> once<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.000> take<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.270> apart<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:39.200> can

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
or less once you take this apart you can

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.570 
or less once you take this apart you can
almost<00:02:39.500> work<00:02:39.830> them<00:02:40.040> out<00:02:40.160> with<00:02:40.370> your<00:02:40.400> fingers

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
almost work them out with your fingers

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.580 
almost work them out with your fingers
um<00:02:42.730> they<00:02:43.730> are<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.970> bit<00:02:44.360> rigid<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.110> can<00:02:45.290> feel

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
um they are a bit rigid as you can feel

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.710 
um they are a bit rigid as you can feel
and<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.190> feels<00:02:46.460> almost<00:02:46.670> more<00:02:47.090> like<00:02:47.300> a<00:02:47.390> plastic

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
and it feels almost more like a plastic

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.100 
and it feels almost more like a plastic
than<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> rubber<00:02:48.890> but<00:02:49.790> ah<00:02:49.820> it's<00:02:50.210> probably<00:02:50.840> some

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
than a rubber but ah it's probably some

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.870 
than a rubber but ah it's probably some
form<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.620> our<00:02:51.920> rubber<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.430> polyurethane

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
form of our rubber and polyurethane

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.960 
form of our rubber and polyurethane
mixture<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:53.870> they<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.400> it's<00:02:55.550> also<00:02:55.670> not

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
mixture that they have and it's also not

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.880 
mixture that they have and it's also not
something<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.540> really<00:02:56.810> want<00:02:57.020> spongy<00:02:57.650> at<00:02:57.740> all

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
something you really want spongy at all

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.670 
something you really want spongy at all
either<00:02:58.130> um<00:02:58.510> another<00:02:59.510> good<00:02:59.900> part<00:03:00.200> about<00:03:00.290> these

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
either um another good part about these

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.040 
either um another good part about these
is<00:03:00.950> you've<00:03:01.730> got<00:03:02.000> our<00:03:02.180> three<00:03:02.450> adjustability

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
is you've got our three adjustability

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.940 
is you've got our three adjustability

points for your sway bar arm it looks

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.360 
points for your sway bar arm it looks

as<00:03:49.880> far<00:03:50.270> as<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.630> rigidity<00:03:51.320> wise<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.920> looks

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
as far as like rigidity wise it looks

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.170 
as far as like rigidity wise it looks
like<00:03:52.520> they<00:03:52.730> are<00:03:52.940> pretty<00:03:53.450> well<00:03:53.750> built<00:03:54.470> um<00:03:55.180> they

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
like they are pretty well built um they

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.360 
like they are pretty well built um they

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
you know steel lower control arm but uh

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.920 
you know steel lower control arm but uh
it<00:04:04.040> definitely<00:04:04.250> does<00:04:04.730> look<00:04:04.760> like<00:04:05.240> this<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:05.720> one
