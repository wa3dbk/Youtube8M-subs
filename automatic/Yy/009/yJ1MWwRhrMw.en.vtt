00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
if you agree with this as I have mainly

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
if you agree with this as I have mainly
based<00:01:13.229> off<00:01:13.530> his<00:01:13.680> stats<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.640> haven't<00:01:14.939> watched

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
based off his stats as I haven't watched

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210 
based off his stats as I haven't watched
them<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> ton<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> real<00:01:15.750> life<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:17.130> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
them a ton of real life but I think this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.950 
them a ton of real life but I think this
color<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.549> about<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.090> based<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.570> his<00:01:18.689> stats

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
color is about right based on his stats

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
color is about right based on his stats
so<00:01:19.619> yeah<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.189> into<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> next<00:01:20.700> player

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
so yeah it's got into the next player

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.030 
so yeah it's got into the next player
