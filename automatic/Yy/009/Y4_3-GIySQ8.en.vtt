00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.860
 Raabs house transmitters are so enjoyable 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:10.729
 August 2008 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.839
 Warsaw and on the offensive stand to learn to change ourselves 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:15.629
 red cards 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.240
 the offender was looking at the place 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.400
 Katharina Fiegl and Jessica learn what you can do as a farmer 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.850
 In the second year of training, the post becomes a farmer and Katerina makes one 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.349
 internship 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.069
 I will now point out that the promoter 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:33.520
 there was 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.350
 Theory in vocational school practice on the field of Bauer Ort 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.480
 which goes on 190 hectares of rye barley wheat and rapeseed on the 3rd 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.080
 they should check once 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.040
 no coincidence is therefore would have been postponed 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.190
 one meter 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.580
 Ludwig dance that is optimal then Rome Rheine 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.700
 to offer the attraction 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.820
 according to protocol 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.820
 you have to be out and about a lot Roman 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.630
 an insight where the whole 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.350
 What you are like, everything comes from it and who produces smoke that gives the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.270
 Walk away 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 more versatile you can do many things 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.210
 "Werder had nothing to do but me, all my people 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
 become 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.750
 the hit would not have counted 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.170
 and something I was one 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.580
 with poultry 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.830
 the eleven percent 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.650
 and there on the farm of the family there are but then decided 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.570
 a rarely the niche in Germany 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.090
 this can be important for this the green area usage and the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 meat production 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.860
 just cares about the drainage 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.900
 Here, the water is accumulated by rainfall in the fields 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.500
 Ingrid has been guided by an underground pipe system 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.750
 extends over almost five hectares 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.479
 You have to make sure that this is from what is also often 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.759
 I hope that I Hertha 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:02.810
 and 9 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.720
 a woman in front 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.229
 and so was allowed 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.049
 percent 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.429
 also left the control of yesterday left calm 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.319
 that's the last year's harvest for sale in the next 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.359
 Intermediate session 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.359
 the pop-up still frozen 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.469
 so important that you control the temperature 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.969
 over 15 degrees warm if storable the fire was of Wight 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:48.409
 Gertrud also runs a pig farm together with two other farmers 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.669
 the place for up to 1000 800 animals Vienna 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.220
 more about an investment in Germany 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.220
 what are on the Christmas markets 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.059
 the Londoners the health half-year influence who the meat 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.429
 renounce 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:09.339
 the product sounds like that you have to check that of course 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:12.339
 the picture 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.269
 that he enters the facility 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.209
 For the product, he is only half the time, of course, as well 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.199
 After all, I would not want to be able to walk so easily 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.829
 100 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.200
 The artists are often people saying where are we and we need to help them 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.409
 need to be on his tours torn up production means 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.500
 who analyze the sales proceeds around Millerntor 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.619
 And if you also have some fun with the bring then the training 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.779
 to the farmer remained quite exciting matter 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.189
 the technology is making more and more economists admonish 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:48.689
 always works a computer-animated and what technical equipment 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.989
 Of course, not all prerequisites can make men, too 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.989
 Client Razer has Federal Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.039
 underneath that is definitely something OK 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.719
 Not only did they ask for brains
