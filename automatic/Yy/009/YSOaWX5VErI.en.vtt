00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 what if i tell you what mercedes 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.970
 appeared without a tire constructor appeared 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.099
 by themselves as the car needed 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.840
 come into motion 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.310
 4 identical round pieces were formed 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.470
 rubber suspension formed and there 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.779
 we established these four circles 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.269
 call it tires and no car 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.300
 without them before we it 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.579
 we will start it suddenly flies back to 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:36.050
 future no no high up in the sky 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:40.190
 man understands it's stupid but you 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.500
 continue to deny think think 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.890
 think why are you still tired our 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.809
 beautiful creator is not wrong 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 closing your eyes you will not change the surrounding 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.550
 you think about your things 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.489
 your purpose you will not change the truth 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.680
 even if you bring it under the carpet you are not 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 change the truth even if its sales are 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 market and when you turn off the lights and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.949
 close the curtains in your room 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.130
 it's getting dark and your heart 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.659
 becomes denser 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.090
 the need to move quickly is not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 we grow wings and arctic 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 cold does not form wool on our skin 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.270
 but the sweater keeps you warm and it 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.770
 not by chance by chance when you 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.530
 slipped and fell 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.080
 when you admire the architecture of the house and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.450
 his design someone says it is not 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 the work of the architect and it was built 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.610
 human eyes 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.530
 you say that this planet and the universe 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.290
 created themselves 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 they appeared on their own and so you 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.390
 want to say that the universe 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.549
 existed before she appeared 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 it looks like a chinese whisper game when 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.220
 the right thought comes to you but she 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.680
 already turning into the distorted you wanted 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.409
 would see your creator and understand what 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.750
 he is real you only believe that 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.810
 you can touch and feel and you 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.729
 saw his whole pedigree it is illogical 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.380
 do not accept what is obvious and by the way 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.380
 mersedes has a constructor
