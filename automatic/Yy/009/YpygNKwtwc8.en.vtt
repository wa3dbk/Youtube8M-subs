00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
point guard so don't I gotta switch a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.310 
point guard so don't I gotta switch a
lot<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.119> stuff<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:54.990> all

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
lot of stuff because I don't have all

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.380 
lot of stuff because I don't have all
the<00:01:55.380> things<00:01:55.590> set<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.369> use<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.180> point

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the things set that I use what my point

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.179 
the things set that I use what my point
guard<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.409> use<00:01:58.560> any<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
of stuff because it always wins with

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.779 
of stuff because it always wins with
getting<00:02:04.829> blocked

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
analog stick away from the baseline so

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.580 
analog stick away from the baseline so
you<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:45.000> your<00:02:45.120> baseline<00:02:47.750> dunk<00:02:48.750> package<00:02:49.440> that
