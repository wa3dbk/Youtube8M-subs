00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
today we're going to show you how to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.890 
today we're going to show you how to
make<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.980> loop-de-loop<00:00:11.429> connection<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.690> is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.509 
make a loop-de-loop connection this is
the<00:00:13.019> kind<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.259> connection<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.799> might<00:00:13.950> use<00:00:14.190> if

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the kind of connection you might use if

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.180 
the kind of connection you might use if
you<00:00:14.700> were<00:00:14.910> repairing<00:00:15.329> a<00:00:15.480> bridle<00:00:15.869> or<00:00:16.190> attaching

that there's minimal drag on the lines

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.630 
that there's minimal drag on the lines
if<00:00:25.650> there<00:00:25.830> happened<00:00:26.100> to<00:00:26.130> be<00:00:26.220> traveling

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
if there happened to be traveling

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.440 
if there happened to be traveling
through<00:00:26.850> something<00:00:28.160> it's<00:00:29.160> very<00:00:29.280> simple<00:00:29.610> but

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
through something it's very simple but

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.119 
through something it's very simple but
sometimes<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.110> can<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.380> easy<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> get<00:00:31.830> hung<00:00:32.009> up

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 
sometimes it can be easy to get hung up

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.919 
sometimes it can be easy to get hung up

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
to loop connection all you do is widen

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.239 
to loop connection all you do is widen
out<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.059> loops<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.769> you<00:00:46.859> want<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.069> do

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
out your loops and what you want to do

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.029 
out your loops and what you want to do
is<00:00:47.429> put<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.940> loop<00:00:48.530> through<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> other<00:00:49.920> loop

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
is put one loop through the other loop

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.469 
is put one loop through the other loop
in<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.519> case<00:00:50.699> I'm<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.089> put<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> blue

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
in this case I'm going to put the blue

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.270 
in this case I'm going to put the blue
loop<00:00:51.769> through<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:53.010> yellow<00:00:53.219> loop<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:55.280> I'm

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
loop through the yellow loop now I'm

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.309 
loop through the yellow loop now I'm
going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> feed<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.300> entire<00:00:57.449> yellow<00:00:58.019> line

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
going to feed the entire yellow line

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:06.380 
going to feed the entire yellow line
back<00:00:58.979> through<00:00:59.429> the<00:00:59.850> blue<00:01:00.059> loop

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.219 

and<00:01:07.390> what<00:01:07.540> that<00:01:07.720> forms<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:08.800> nice<00:01:09.190> simple

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and what that forms is a nice simple

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.430 
and what that forms is a nice simple
loop<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.409> loop<00:01:11.560> connection<00:01:13.740> super<00:01:14.740> tight

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.630 

very<00:01:18.100> easy<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.490> also<00:01:18.760> take<00:01:18.910> apart<00:01:20.460> loop<00:01:21.460> to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
very easy to also take apart loop to

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.160 
very easy to also take apart loop to
loop<00:01:21.760> connection<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:25.000> some<00:01:25.330> kites<00:01:25.570> like

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
loop connection now on some kites like

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.160 
loop connection now on some kites like
the<00:01:26.320> North<00:01:26.620> for<00:01:27.610> line<00:01:27.820> bar<00:01:28.030> you're<00:01:28.780> required

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
the North for line bar you're required

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.550 
the North for line bar you're required
to<00:01:29.260> attach<00:01:29.680> two<00:01:30.040> lines<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.970> two<00:01:31.180> lines<00:01:31.560> it's

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
to attach two lines to two lines it's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.910 
to attach two lines to two lines it's
done<00:01:32.770> exactly<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.340> safe<00:01:33.550> fashion<00:01:34.860> going<00:01:35.860> to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
done exactly a safe fashion going to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.000 
done exactly a safe fashion going to
take<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:37.980> two<00:01:38.980> yellow<00:01:39.550> lines<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:41.770> going<00:01:41.950> to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
take the two yellow lines I'm going to

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.130 
take the two yellow lines I'm going to
line<00:01:42.190> up<00:01:42.370> the<00:01:42.520> two<00:01:42.700> loops<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.990> they're

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
line up the two loops so that they're

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.510 
line up the two loops so that they're
together

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.580 

then<00:01:48.520> I'm<00:01:48.640> going<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:48.850> take<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.300> loops<00:01:49.590> from

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
then I'm going to take the loops from

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.430 
then I'm going to take the loops from
the<00:01:50.800> blue<00:01:51.010> lines<00:01:51.390> which<00:01:52.390> in<00:01:52.570> this<00:01:52.690> case<00:01:52.750> would

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
the blue lines which in this case would

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.490 
the blue lines which in this case would
be<00:01:53.500> our<00:01:53.770> flying<00:01:54.070> lines<00:01:55.680> or<00:01:56.680> bridle<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:59.350> going

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
be our flying lines or bridle I'm going

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.160 
be our flying lines or bridle I'm going
to<00:01:59.590> put<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.890> yellow<00:02:00.280> loops<00:02:00.550> through<00:02:01.270> both

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
to put the yellow loops through both

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.240 
to put the yellow loops through both
blue<00:02:02.500> blue<00:02:03.040> loops<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.229> then<00:02:05.619> just<00:02:05.770> as<00:02:05.950> we<00:02:06.070> did

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
blue blue loops and then just as we did

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.800 
blue blue loops and then just as we did

going<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> take<00:02:10.240> both<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.500> fly<00:02:12.190> lines<00:02:15.330> put

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
going to take both of the fly lines put

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.110 
going to take both of the fly lines put
them<00:02:16.510> through<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.110> loop<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.590> yellow<00:02:18.120> pull

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
them through the loop of the yellow pull

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.809 
them through the loop of the yellow pull
them<00:02:19.270> all<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:19.780> through

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.010 

and<00:02:25.939> then<00:02:26.599> pull<00:02:27.590> tight

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.720 

it's<00:02:31.620> pretty<00:02:31.800> straightforward<00:02:32.040> pretty<00:02:32.550> easy

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it's pretty straightforward pretty easy

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.600 
it's pretty straightforward pretty easy
I<00:02:33.690> hope<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.260> video<00:02:34.560> has<00:02:34.680> made<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.310> little

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
I hope this video has made that a little

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.050 
I hope this video has made that a little
bit<00:02:35.700> easier<00:02:35.850> for<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.270> thank<00:02:36.900> you
