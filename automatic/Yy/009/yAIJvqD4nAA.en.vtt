was fairly minimalistic and kind of an

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.200 
was fairly minimalistic and kind of an
experiment<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> experiment<00:01:20.610> worked<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
experiment but the experiment worked so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
experiment but the experiment worked so
now<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.870> retail<00:01:22.110> release<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.800> has
