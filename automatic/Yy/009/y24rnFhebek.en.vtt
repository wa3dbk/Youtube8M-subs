00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.500
 vivat to all fellow combatants in browser 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.870
 game tanks online 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.250
 Today is another issue of the sensational 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.550
 Weekday Nouveau 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.350
 last tenth issue I was away from 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.320
 sequences of his narration 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.230
 and revised look at the bounce 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.930
 Well, today as promised I will continue 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.410
 study the corps and take turns from us 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.960
 titan and dictator by the way as already noted 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.750
 higher I actively help the team under 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.800
 name deer giving advice how already 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.110
 experienced players 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.330
 from what our everyday life will be smoothly 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.690
 go to the present guides 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.280
 but this then for now for now first on 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.280
 today titanium case 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.280
 titanium is essentially the last cheap 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.400
 body games that can be obtained in 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.980
 M0 modifications for just 100 crystals 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.500
 heavy-duty titanium alloy armor 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.780
 together with well-designed 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.750
 geometry allows this case 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 perfectly resist even 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.870
 large-caliber guns tank 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.990
 equipped with this enclosure can without 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.520
 thinking to go to the very thick 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.060
 It should be noted that due to the low 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 speeds 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.590
 this case is not suitable for quick attacks 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.050
 to the rear of the enemy so how then 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.560
 to go to the promised answer hell 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.800
 is simple 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.540
 on the sly if the case turns out of course 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.030
 still more good for 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.820
 positional struggle while special 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.240
 driving skills will not be required because 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.700
 the tower is shifted forward to the pluses reasonably 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.940
 let's assign good armor and this figure 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.100
 and never superfluous and large mass of that 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.620
 gives us tremendous protection against 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.480
 wishing to send in a cliff on 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.430
 compared to the moment has a higher 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.709
 speed and turning and up to which 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.160
 we still get well as a fact 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.739
 m3 is available as field marshal but 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.310
 here are the minuses of the hull where how 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.650
 more 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.620
 titanium though available for two ranks 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.480
 ahead of time but more expensive low 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.610
 speed coupled with the same no 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.860
 maneuverability force 10 times 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.350
 think before vylazit in the open 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.200
 the field here and armor can no longer save 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.660
 if you cover the rear there will be nothing price 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 category also pumped it up 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.300
 expensive armor when pumping with me to m3 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.030
 well, and the curtain of negative moments 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.900
 Noting the large gap the title itself is one of 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.870
 m2 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.780
 Now a couple of the same in the protection of titanium certainly 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.570
 good with almost any stem except isis 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.239
 when attacking, you can put anything 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:26.280
 but usually in narco hull battles 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.280
 rarely used now turn to 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.440
 armor with a promising title 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.870
 dictator thanks to the improved 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.190
 active protection system and application 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.140
 newest composite materials up to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.470
 on the case effectively absorbs energy 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.420
 explosion of a projectile of any caliber 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.940
 such a body can safely lead 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.750
 comrades to attack taking the brunt 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.210
 to myself 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.790
 being one of the fastest and 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.130
 protected this enclosure has large 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.560
 dimensions making it an easy target 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.810
 for the enemy here it is better not to rush into 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.300
 lyrical reasoning and immediately send 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.810
 look at the pros and cons of both 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.090
 they will tell everyone the advantages lie in 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.820
 quite high for an average body 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.830
 mobility and good armor that is 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.470
 obvious advantage of the dictator 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.320
 allowing to plan more widely 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.630
 fighting style than with titanium 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.330
 shifted to the rear edge that if available 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.520
 Anyone playing skills in reverse will be 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.340
 good help when playing because 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.320
 obstacles due to the height of the dictator is very 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.020
 convenient to shoot through various 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.350
 high ground out of thunder rails or smokie 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.360
 the cons can be cumbersome 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.150
 dictator and again the height 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.550
 after all, when playing with flamethrower and frieze, you can 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.800
 just don't fall pauper owl noise in 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.410
 tank body when firing in the side 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.380
 dictator his can easily be flipped 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.890
 also quite strong gap between m2 and 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.650
 m3 high cost what's up to the guns then 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.169
 there is no choice without balloon artillery 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.570
 This is due to the long nose of the body 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.450
 which eats half the range of all 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.300
 balloon guns dictator cost-effective as 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.250
 vdm and team games well, but in general 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.030
 pretty clever body to different 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.700
 occasions 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.330
 unless of course you are a flamethrower fan or 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.260
 cutter 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.780
 and what next you ask further 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.850
 hornet and viking will come to our garage 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.550
 I take this opportunity to congratulate 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.860
 game with fourth birthday honor 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.320
 whose whole month every day will be 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.540
 huge discounts than and I will not fail 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.850
 use the example of the shooting day 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.430
 This video modification shop the hunter 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.710
 and isis cost 20 percent less 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.080
 but this is the way and do not consider it 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.260
 advertising although the players are all about it and so 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.249
 know but today it was all with you 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.829
 kinat and 11th part of the cycle 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:51.829
 in the game tanks online to new meetings
