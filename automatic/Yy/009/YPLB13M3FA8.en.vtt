 this is a plane boeing 7 3 7 200 i for 100 so far what was already 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.919
 is about to retire the plane are not issues that had to be between forward 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.609
 by 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.959
 in the nose balance of the plane to be able then pulls alien detractors 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.849
 I can fix it 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.540
 towing her off-track position does that pencil actually build that 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.340
 does not have any damage on the track and will grant retired open the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.129
 operations again and this adds up that will be exalted from 5 15 hours 15 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.569
 minutes later operating the airport 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.179
 They are affecting about 27 operations 11 arrivals and six departures 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:21.639
 they told me that they hold the same fox and I did not hesitate to come 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.520
 that affect us like because we do not handle the number of passengers say 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.919
 these operations between the stretches well the use of the capacity bands for 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.339
 this one until the moment that passengers are being checked in and 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:38.209
 understand a rollover but formally fortunately here are two things 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.229
 that are important and we've seen it last week from technology and 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.409
 preparation of our bodies almost six thousand 100 is fully prepared 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.569
 for this he already put us in the simulacrum 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.689
 that was also previously 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.129
 this finally put the proof that the coasts being come that are very 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.489
 efficient to combined with the expertise of the bankia pilot he finally had to 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.719
 see also a lot in 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.809
 and that this incident does not lead to greater deaths briceño s'arenal confused 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.789
 despite the green zone of sight of the simple view of course it has 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:09.559
 some small damages but surely the 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:14.859
 the one of the mechanics city of the hotel expertises of day exactly if it suffers 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.819
 some other structural damage to doing nothing is not a good time and 20 what 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:22.710
 we reached to see did not have any significant damages I complied napier normalization 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.949
 the normal satires and banks this with that the benefit of it actually not 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:27.250
 I had 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.200
 2 injured are
