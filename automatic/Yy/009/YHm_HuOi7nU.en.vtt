turned my griddle on before I started so
I<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.340> feel<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.790> nice<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.420> hot<00:02:19.630> there

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
I can feel it's nice and hot there

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.890 
I can feel it's nice and hot there

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
already so we'll have that ready to pop

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.460 
already so we'll have that ready to pop
these<00:02:23.110> pancakes<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:25.019> see<00:02:26.019> how<00:02:26.050> I'm<00:02:26.200> kind<00:02:26.230> of

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
these pancakes on see how I'm kind of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.620 
these pancakes on see how I'm kind of
kind<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.769> fold<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.280> batter<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:28.300> don't<00:02:28.480> want

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
kind of fold that batter you don't want

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.080 
kind of fold that batter you don't want
to<00:02:28.720> over<00:02:29.019> beat<00:02:29.200> pancake<00:02:29.860> batter<00:02:30.069> because<00:02:30.970> it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
to over beat pancake batter because it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.330 
to over beat pancake batter because it
makes<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.420> pancakes<00:02:31.930> not<00:02:32.410> quite<00:02:32.739> as<00:02:32.920> fluffy

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
makes the pancakes not quite as fluffy

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.150 
makes the pancakes not quite as fluffy
as<00:02:33.670> they<00:02:33.849> can<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.709> you'll<00:02:35.709> notice<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.100> I

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
as they can be and you'll notice that I

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.100 
as they can be and you'll notice that I
didn't<00:02:36.459> put<00:02:36.670> oil<00:02:36.819> in<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.269> pancakes<00:02:37.810> either

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
didn't put oil in the pancakes either

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.630 
didn't put oil in the pancakes either
most<00:02:38.860> recipes<00:02:39.190> call<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.209> oil<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:41.620> years<00:02:42.549> ago

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
most recipes call for oil but years ago

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300 
most recipes call for oil but years ago
I<00:02:42.880> just<00:02:43.180> stopped<00:02:44.170> putting<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.980> see<00:02:45.160> how

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
I just stopped putting it in to see how

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.770 
I just stopped putting it in to see how
it<00:02:45.370> would<00:02:45.519> taste<00:02:45.760> because<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.299> thought<00:02:46.480> why<00:02:46.720> do

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
it would taste because I thought why do

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.199 
it would taste because I thought why do
we<00:02:46.959> need<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.260> extra<00:02:47.590> calories<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.459> it<00:02:48.910> tastes

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
we need the extra calories and it tastes

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.500 
we need the extra calories and it tastes
just<00:02:49.269> fine<00:02:49.540> without<00:02:49.959> oil<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.269> try

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
just fine without oil so you can try

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.300 
just fine without oil so you can try
either<00:02:52.780> way<00:02:53.019> if<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.410> want<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.620> put<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:53.799> little

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
either way if you want to put a little

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.789 
either way if you want to put a little
oil<00:02:54.489> in<00:02:54.730> there<00:02:55.049> go<00:02:56.049> right<00:02:56.290> ahead

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
oil in there go right ahead

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.130 
oil in there go right ahead
now<00:02:57.670> I'm<00:02:57.730> trying<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.090> get<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.330> batter<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.959> be

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
now I'm trying to get this batter to be

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.140 
now I'm trying to get this batter to be
where<00:02:59.440> it's<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> nice<00:03:00.010> consistency<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.940> come

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
where it's a nice consistency to come

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.509 
where it's a nice consistency to come
out<00:03:01.299> of<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.510> spoon<00:03:01.810> that's<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.650> little<00:03:03.040> bit<00:03:03.280> too

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
out of the spoon that's a little bit too

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.059 
out of the spoon that's a little bit too
thick<00:03:04.049> I'm<00:03:05.049> going<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> put<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.620> little<00:03:05.650> bit

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
thick I'm going to put just a little bit

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.160 
thick I'm going to put just a little bit
