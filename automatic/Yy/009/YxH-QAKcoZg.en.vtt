weights I always say all the things that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.349 
weights I always say all the things that
you're<00:03:33.299> building<00:03:33.629> a<00:03:33.689> safety<00:03:34.109> board<00:03:35.359> nice

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
you're building a safety board nice

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.150 
you're building a safety board nice
inside<00:03:37.040> ok<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:40.049> you<00:03:40.260> see<00:03:40.410> now<00:03:40.889> how<00:03:41.099> the

inside ok so there you see now how the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.939 
inside ok so there you see now how the
animals<00:03:41.730> are<00:03:41.879> moving<00:03:42.090> with<00:03:42.900> slightly<00:03:43.590> yes

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
animals are moving with slightly yes

the same time you know the good thing
about<00:05:08.890> this<00:05:09.190> is<00:05:09.310> that<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.550> can<00:05:09.700> actually<00:05:09.880> see

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
about this is that you can actually see

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.370 
about this is that you can actually see
what<00:05:10.660> you're<00:05:10.810> doing

what you're doing

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.020 
what you're doing
yeah<00:05:11.530> where<00:05:11.890> you're<00:05:12.130> out<00:05:12.160> in<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:12.669> kind<00:05:12.940> of

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
yeah where you're out in this kind of

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.400 
yeah where you're out in this kind of
odd<00:05:13.180> there's<00:05:13.419> so<00:05:13.570> many<00:05:13.660> things<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.140> could

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
odd there's so many things that could

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.710 
odd there's so many things that could
constructive<00:05:15.250> exactly<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.419> get<00:05:16.600> the

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
constructive exactly you get the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.260 
constructive exactly you get the
feedback<00:05:17.020> instantly<00:05:17.740> from<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.729> computer

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
feedback instantly from the computer

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.250 
feedback instantly from the computer
from<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.600> screen<00:05:19.900> and<00:05:20.200> then<00:05:20.950> also<00:05:21.220> I<00:05:21.460> have<00:05:21.910> the

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
from the screen and then also I have the

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.950 
from the screen and then also I have the
possibility<00:05:23.260> here<00:05:24.040> to<00:05:24.490> actually<00:05:24.760> physically

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
possibility here to actually physically

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.499 
possibility here to actually physically
so<00:05:27.379> you<00:05:27.530> can<00:05:27.770> get<00:05:27.979> that<00:05:28.159> I<00:05:28.280> can<00:05:28.430> Evo<00:05:28.729> power<00:05:28.970> when

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
so you can get that I can Evo power when

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.649 
so you can get that I can Evo power when
it<00:05:29.599> feels<00:05:29.810> right<00:05:30.020> all<00:05:30.349> sound<00:05:31.030> and<00:05:32.030> that<00:05:32.240> is<00:05:32.300> of

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
it feels right all sound and that is of

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.570 
it feels right all sound and that is of
course<00:05:32.900> impossible<00:05:33.259> on<00:05:33.710> an<00:05:33.830> eye<00:05:33.979> for<00:05:34.039> students
