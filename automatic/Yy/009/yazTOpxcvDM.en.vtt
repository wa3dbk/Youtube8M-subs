00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 the volumes when we are here again for 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.349
 a new and exciting debts from a 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.889
 couple is a video this a dna that yours 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.230
 video to warn you that unfortunately today 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.010
 afternoon and I don't even know if Sunday 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.330
 there may be the afternoon live 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.099
 this is because I just became an uncle 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.930
 and i 'm sorry this is also the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.330
 why there are no videos today 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 part this we say informative 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.410
 because yesterday we were practically 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.690
 all day at the hospital because mine 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 sister gave birth and so now I have a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.829
 grandson from dl obviously has taken over the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 beauty from the uncle 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.460
 ok ok apart and tonnage is shit 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 staff that I had to say wanted 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.610
 just tell you that this is the reason 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.980
 so this afternoon there will be no 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.780
 live since we are anyway 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.969
 at the hospital etc. so I won't be able to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.440
 do a live 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.470
 I don't even know if Sunday then 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.720
 let's say be prepared because if Sunday 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.479
 you won't see a live the reason is this 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.500
 for me it is simply this there is to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.619
 new green screen 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.970
 that's because I'm trying things out 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.340
 I want to see if it is possible to do the green 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.630
 screen in this way so now 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.200
 we see 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:33.479
 I have no idea so he will see you crying and 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.110
 those and those that are what they hold 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.600
 this very quick video also put 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.810
 I don't know if you've seen the room so far 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.180
 Also auction also see an auction 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.390
 second screen there is a second one 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:55.189
 screen so that you can put the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.409
 the thing as the microphone is called 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.790
 as far as I can I could also 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.310
 I don't know if I can get closer to it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.310
 this increases or decreases the factor 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.260
 but I would not say I believe in the crisis 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.500
 seems to feel good about sitting themes 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.720
 you feel better than before 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.050
 and we see the next video rap 91 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.050
