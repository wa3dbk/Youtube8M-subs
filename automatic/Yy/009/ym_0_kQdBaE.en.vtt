Apple<00:02:29.060> TV<00:02:29.090> playlist<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.710> found<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.100> be

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
Apple TV playlist so I found this to be

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.620 
Apple TV playlist so I found this to be
quite<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.400> good<00:02:31.580> solution<00:02:31.790> overall<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.570> I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
quite a good solution overall and I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.680 
quite a good solution overall and I
actually<00:02:32.810> find<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.740> now<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.980> Apple<00:02:34.310> TV

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
actually find that now the Apple TV

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.940 
actually find that now the Apple TV
YouTube<00:02:35.690> application<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.260> quite<00:02:36.470> useful<00:02:36.620> now

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
YouTube application is quite useful now

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.380 
YouTube application is quite useful now
whereas<00:02:37.460> before<00:02:37.490> it's<00:02:37.970> probably<00:02:38.090> something

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
whereas before it's probably something

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.240 
whereas before it's probably something
only<00:02:38.570> never<00:02:38.780> used<00:02:39.170> whereas<00:02:39.800> now<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.220> view

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
only never used whereas now I can view

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.250 
only never used whereas now I can view
in<00:02:40.460> my<00:02:40.520> latest<00:02:40.670> videos<00:02:41.120> on<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.510> Apple<00:02:41.750> TV<00:02:41.870> I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
in my latest videos on the Apple TV I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.440 
in my latest videos on the Apple TV I
find<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.100> be<00:02:43.160> quite<00:02:43.370> good<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.030> hopefully

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
find it to be quite good so hopefully

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.820 
find it to be quite good so hopefully
