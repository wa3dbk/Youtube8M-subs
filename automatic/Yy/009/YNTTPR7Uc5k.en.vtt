00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.439
 a fan is simple and simple 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.599
 defined as an enthusiastic one 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.849
 admirer 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.430
 I have to admit I was in mine 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.670
 Not much Christian life so far 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.110
 more than a fan of Jesus I am in 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.640
 a christian family grew up 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.739
 was at a christian school 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.890
 My father was a preacher from the beginning 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.629
 I was expected to be Jesus 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.039
 love that i would believe in jesus 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.260
 simply provided 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.789
 and later I think I was 13 at the time 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 I was expected to do that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.289
 typical haircut of the baptists 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.969
 tokyo with a scrutinizing look was expected 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.550
 that I enter school as a child 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 Christian t shirt was really worn like that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.150
 something like gold or his blood for you me 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.060
 I had something really and I was 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.680
 from the beginning a real fan a fan of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.119
 Jesus in my room 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.880
 that is really true in my room 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.409
 next to the poster of michael jordan 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.000
 I had a picture of Jesus Christ 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.430
 that hits the nail on the dot me 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.300
 was a fan of michael and a fan of 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.250
 jesus I wanted to be like jesus 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.980
 I wanted to be like Mike and I 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.510
 thought that was enough for now and over 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.230
 the years I have then determined 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.490
 that there are many Christians 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.950
 enthusiastic admirers of Jesus 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.510
 are you fans but if you are the 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.250
 you will read texts in the Bible 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.320
 Jesus never realized that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.690
 was interested to have fans what he 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.730
 This was a real successor 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.130
 that did not interest him for 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.640
 Example how big the crowd around 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.160
 it was all about him 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.940
 willingness of people to be with him 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.910
 to go to him 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.350
 there is a passage in the bible which 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.679
 is not quoted on the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.860
 lukasevangelium chapter 9 vers 23 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.710
 there it is 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.240
 Jesus said if one go with me 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.980
 the denied wants to take himself 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.610
 daily be cross on and follow 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.250
 follow me 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.710
 for many people this is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.900
 Invite them to follow themselves too 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.360
 deny and bear his cross 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 simply too much that will happen 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 not if someone is the gospel 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.680
 preaching was cited man john 3 vers 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.790
 16 but Lukas 9 vers 23 becomes mostly 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.410
 just forget 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.090
 but right here I have for myself and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.959
 others on this trip following 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.470
 discovered it is not enough just a fan 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.600
 his 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.570
 who is not ready his complete 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.790
 to devote life to Jesus Christ 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.480
 that also means everything to him 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.190
 leave 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.110
 he will never experience it 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.260
 the true life of jesus for us 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.420
 But that's what Jesus wants 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.920
 for us and it is always exciting the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.020
 different stories of people 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.800
 to be heard also as a fan of Jesus 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.440
 had begun 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.930
 as enthusiastic admirers and the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.680
 today jesus on his way follow the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.900
 say today 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.610
 I'm ready to die every day 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.460
 I am willing to withhold nothing from myself 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.000
 and all i have jesus christ too 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.460
 dedicate 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.880
 I do not know if you are a fan of Jesus 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.540
 Maybe you are as much as you are 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.850
 I once wat you're ready jesus close 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.680
 to be in order to exploit all advantages 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.560
 but can not be so close that is not 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.840
 sacrifice costs you would like to jesus 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.400
 to ascend to the sky but that is 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.010
 yours is not your daily favorite 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.710
 to wear cross yourself but the only one 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.470
 invitation the jesus pronounced is the 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.300
 invitation to die for yourself and 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.520
 to find true life in him 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.230
 if you can do it from a fan one 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.600
 enthusiastic admirers to 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.000
 to become follower of Jesus Christ then 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.700
 Do you really find the life we ​​do 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.550
 wants to give you 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.550
