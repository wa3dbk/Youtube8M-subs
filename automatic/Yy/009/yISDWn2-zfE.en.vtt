one of the farms the massive potential
there<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.329> increase<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.809> grass<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
there to increase the grass the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
half years right near there when we

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.660 
half years right near there when we

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
started off here in all nine I suppose
there<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.910> number<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.209> things<00:03:33.360> we<00:03:33.510> had<00:03:33.630> to

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
there was a number of things we had to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.000 
there was a number of things we had to
look<00:03:33.810> up<00:03:33.959> before<00:03:34.290> we<00:03:34.380> started<00:03:34.680> off<00:03:34.830> on<00:03:34.980> the

her nine months of the year which

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.490 
her nine months of the year which
probably<00:03:38.760> wasn't<00:03:39.000> ideal<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:39.989> had<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.200> condense

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
probably wasn't ideal we had to condense

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.350 
probably wasn't ideal we had to condense
that<00:03:40.620> back<00:03:40.950> into<00:03:41.160> three<00:03:41.430> months<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.209> that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
in terms of Calvin interval will run 375

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.699 
in terms of Calvin interval will run 375
days<00:04:03.660> there<00:04:03.900> at<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.080> moment<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.560> is<00:04:04.590> a

little bit of our target our target set

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.090 
little bit of our target our target set
for<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.720> last<00:04:06.870> year<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.170> problem<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.500> 365

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
for the last year the problem is 365

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.130 
for the last year the problem is 365
days<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.030> means<00:04:09.269> every<00:04:09.570> Co<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.959> herd

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
days so that means every Co in the herd

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.970 
days so that means every Co in the herd
has<00:04:11.040> carved<00:04:11.340> in<00:04:11.790> 12<00:04:12.150> months<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.079> 365<00:04:13.590> deer

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
has carved in 12 months so it's 365 deer

week so example a field the soil sample
can<00:06:13.320> be<00:06:13.350> either<00:06:13.500> at<00:06:13.710> index<00:06:13.979> 1<00:06:14.250> 2<00:06:14.640> 3<00:06:14.910> or<00:06:15.150> 4<00:06:15.390> in

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
can be either at index 1 2 3 or 4 in

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.680 
can be either at index 1 2 3 or 4 in
terms<00:06:16.140> of<00:06:16.320> soil<00:06:16.500> P<00:06:16.770> index<00:06:17.130> I<00:06:17.400> think<00:06:17.940> at<00:06:18.120> index<00:06:18.419> 1

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
terms of soil P index I think at index 1

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.930 
terms of soil P index I think at index 1
the<00:06:19.050> feed<00:06:19.650> won't<00:06:19.890> grow<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.130> as<00:06:20.340> potential<00:06:20.850> at

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
the feed won't grow to as potential at

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.790 
the feed won't grow to as potential at
all<00:06:21.090> so<00:06:21.630> we<00:06:21.750> need<00:06:21.870> to<00:06:21.990> build<00:06:22.169> that<00:06:22.290> level<00:06:22.680> up<00:06:22.770> to

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
all so we need to build that level up to

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.070 
all so we need to build that level up to
index<00:06:23.250> 3<00:06:23.430> which<00:06:23.880> is<00:06:23.910> a<00:06:24.060> nice<00:06:24.270> level<00:06:24.780> to<00:06:24.960> be

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
index 3 which is a nice level to be

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.430 
index 3 which is a nice level to be
asked

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
asked

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.750 
asked
I<00:06:25.470> didn't<00:06:25.890> explore<00:06:26.190> this<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:26.400> little<00:06:26.430> bit<00:06:26.669> of

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
I didn't explore this a little bit of

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.520 
I didn't explore this a little bit of
wastage<00:06:27.120> going<00:06:27.330> on<00:06:27.419> there<00:06:27.690> if<00:06:27.840> you<00:06:28.020> if<00:06:28.410> you

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
wastage going on there if you if you

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.230 
wastage going on there if you if you
spread<00:06:28.770> beyond<00:06:29.130> an<00:06:29.250> index<00:06:29.580> for<00:06:29.790> so<00:06:30.030> and<00:06:30.210> so

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
spread beyond an index for so and so

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.840 
spread beyond an index for so and so
index<00:06:31.110> 3<00:06:31.380> is<00:06:31.740> a<00:06:31.770> nice<00:06:31.979> place<00:06:32.310> to<00:06:32.340> be<00:06:32.520> out<00:06:32.729> in

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
index 3 is a nice place to be out in

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.430 
index 3 is a nice place to be out in
terms<00:06:32.970> of<00:06:33.120> maximum<00:06:33.599> potential<00:06:33.930> in<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.200> field

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
terms of maximum potential in the field

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.239 
terms of maximum potential in the field
for<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:34.800> firmer

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 
for a firmer

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.509 
for a firmer

as index one soil a lot of benefits to

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:40.549 
as index one soil a lot of benefits to
bring<00:06:38.699> him<00:06:38.789> up<00:06:38.909> to<00:06:39.059> date<00:06:39.239> three<00:06:39.509> in<00:06:40.079> terms<00:06:40.379> of

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:40.559 
bring him up to date three in terms of

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.099 
bring him up to date three in terms of
density<00:06:41.219> as<00:06:41.609> wards<00:06:42.029> and<00:06:42.119> in<00:06:42.209> terms<00:06:42.419> of<00:06:42.599> maximum

density as wards and in terms of maximum

00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:45.049 
density as wards and in terms of maximum
growth<00:06:43.319> that's<00:06:43.799> what<00:06:44.069> we're<00:06:44.609> finding<00:06:44.819> on

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:45.059 
growth that's what we're finding on

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:46.489 
growth that's what we're finding on
paddocks<00:06:45.389> at<00:06:45.539> index<00:06:45.749> one<00:06:45.959> or<00:06:46.079> two<00:06:46.199> they're<00:06:46.379> not

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499 
paddocks at index one or two they're not

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:48.319 
paddocks at index one or two they're not
growing<00:06:46.739> enough<00:06:47.039> grass<00:06:47.279> and<00:06:47.609> when<00:06:47.909> we<00:06:47.999> compare

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:48.329 
growing enough grass and when we compare

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:49.879 
growing enough grass and when we compare
them<00:06:48.449> with<00:06:48.509> index<00:06:48.809> three<00:06:49.019> and<00:06:49.169> four<00:06:49.349> paddocks

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
them with index three and four paddocks

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:51.529 
them with index three and four paddocks
so<00:06:50.099> it's<00:06:50.219> very<00:06:50.339> important<00:06:50.819> to<00:06:50.909> get<00:06:50.999> that<00:06:51.179> index

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
so it's very important to get that index

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.419 
so it's very important to get that index
right<00:06:51.719> today<00:06:52.229> we've<00:06:52.409> seen<00:06:52.499> what<00:06:52.859> Carla's<00:06:53.219> done

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:53.429 
right today we've seen what Carla's done
