of players on machine in MOOC and he

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
of players on machine in MOOC and he

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
pulled them out of the bag every well

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.490 
pulled them out of the bag every well
it's<00:01:58.799> every<00:01:58.979> time<00:01:59.189> it's<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.840> I've<00:02:01.229> got<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it's every time it's like I've got a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's every time it's like I've got a
little<00:02:01.740> bit<00:02:01.950> practicing<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.270> was

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
little bit practicing it but I was

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.310 
little bit practicing it but I was
nearly<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.409> much<00:02:06.020> ends<00:02:07.020> up<00:02:07.140> being

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
nearly there in this much ends up being

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.809 
nearly there in this much ends up being
a<00:02:07.910> 13-2<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:10.050> all<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.979> my

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
a 13-2 but I get all the way up to my

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.470 
a 13-2 but I get all the way up to my
chopper<00:02:12.599> gunner<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.080> dogs

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
chopper gunner and dogs

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.559 
chopper gunner and dogs
without<00:02:15.480> any<00:02:15.720> deaths<00:02:15.989> at<00:02:16.140> all<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.730> good<00:02:18.120> good

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
without any deaths at all so a good good

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.750 
without any deaths at all so a good good
step<00:02:18.840> towards<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.319> full<00:02:19.500> flawless<00:02:19.890> game<00:02:20.099> I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
step towards a full flawless game I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.020 
step towards a full flawless game I
thought<00:02:21.330> it'd<00:02:21.860> make<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.920> good<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.549> good<00:02:23.790> game

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
thought it'd make a good a good game

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.710 
thought it'd make a good a good game
play<00:02:24.239> anyway

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
luckily managed to finish me off with

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.250 
luckily managed to finish me off with
the<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.730> pm-63<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.540> get<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.750> dogs<00:03:00.959> they

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
called in straight away and find a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.599 
called in straight away and find a
little<00:03:03.900> hiding<00:03:04.230> place<00:03:04.500> in<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.890> bush<00:03:05.099> for<00:03:05.430> my

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
little hiding place in the bush for my

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.800 
little hiding place in the bush for my
to<00:03:06.420> call<00:03:06.599> on<00:03:06.989> calling<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> chopper<00:03:08.220> gunner<00:03:08.810> so

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
to call on calling the chopper gunner so

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.240 
to call on calling the chopper gunner so
I'll<00:03:10.200> probably<00:03:10.290> fast<00:03:10.620> forward<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:10.980> because

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
I'll probably fast forward this because

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.800 
I'll probably fast forward this because
I've<00:03:11.579> only<00:03:11.730> can<00:03:11.940> be<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> bit<00:03:12.239> boring<00:03:12.450> but

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
I've only can be a bit boring but

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.009 
I've only can be a bit boring but
basically<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.340> think<00:03:15.180> there's<00:03:15.359> maybe<00:03:15.870> one

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
basically and I think there's maybe one

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.680 
basically and I think there's maybe one
maybe<00:03:16.799> two<00:03:17.099> opportunities<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.419> missed

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
maybe two opportunities that I missed

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.330 
maybe two opportunities that I missed
you<00:03:18.900> know<00:03:19.079> I'm<00:03:19.410> too<00:03:19.650> busy<00:03:19.829> trying<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.130> shoot

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
you know I'm too busy trying to shoot

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.190 
you know I'm too busy trying to shoot
someone<00:03:20.819> who<00:03:21.329> was<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:22.019> looks<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.470> they're

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
someone who was it looks like they're

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.979 
someone who was it looks like they're
accessible<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.880> guy<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.359> got<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> one

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
accessible but like that guy I got a one

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:28.849 
accessible but like that guy I got a one
hit<00:03:28.169> mark<00:03:28.380> on<00:03:28.530> him

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
hit mark on him

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.349 
hit mark on him
spend<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> bit<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.340> time<00:03:29.430> trying<00:03:29.760> trying<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.299> get

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
spend a bit of time trying trying to get

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.449 
spend a bit of time trying trying to get
the<00:03:30.480> second<00:03:30.840> one<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.139> it<00:03:31.859> wasn't<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.430> I

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
the second one and it wasn't to be and I

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.490 
the second one and it wasn't to be and I
think<00:03:32.669> I<00:03:32.760> missed<00:03:33.079> first<00:03:34.079> thing<00:03:34.319> in<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
think I missed first thing in the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.009 
think I missed first thing in the
meantime<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.980> was<00:03:35.190> outside<00:03:35.669> and<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.690> see<00:03:36.870> that

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
meantime it was outside and I see that

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.509 
meantime it was outside and I see that
one<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.440> one<00:03:37.590> there<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:37.919> wasn't<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.340> was

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
one that one there that wasn't that was

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.080 
one that one there that wasn't that was
another<00:03:38.819> one<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.799> think<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.549> was<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
another one so I think that was the the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.550 
another one so I think that was the the
main<00:03:42.239> mistake<00:03:42.599> in<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:42.810> game<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.169> paying<00:03:43.410> too

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
main mistake in this game is paying too

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.530 
main mistake in this game is paying too
much<00:03:43.590> attention<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.180> people<00:03:45.450> who

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
much attention to the so that people who

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.940 
much attention to the so that people who
are<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.720> buildings<00:03:46.169> rather<00:03:46.380> than<00:03:46.560> keeping<00:03:46.859> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
are in buildings rather than keeping the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.500 
are in buildings rather than keeping the
now<00:03:47.099> for<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.400> ones<00:03:47.549> who<00:03:47.669> like<00:03:47.910> who<00:03:48.359> were

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
now for the ones who like who were

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.900 
now for the ones who like who were
outside<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.340> as<00:03:50.340> you'll<00:03:50.549> see<00:03:50.579> when<00:03:50.849> I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
outside and as you'll see when I

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.940 
outside and as you'll see when I
finished<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.389> this<00:03:52.319> chopper<00:03:52.680> gunner

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
finished this this chopper gunner

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.360 
finished this this chopper gunner
there's<00:03:53.250> only<00:03:53.430> only<00:03:54.440> about<00:03:55.440> two<00:03:55.650> kills<00:03:55.950> needed

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
there's only only about two kills needed

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.129 
there's only only about two kills needed
so<00:03:57.329> there<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.510> go<00:03:57.629> of<00:03:57.720> Chapel<00:03:57.930> goodness

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
so there we go of Chapel goodness

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.770 
so there we go of Chapel goodness
finished<00:03:58.410> now<00:03:58.560> I'm<00:03:58.799> not<00:03:59.400> really<00:03:59.669> happy<00:04:00.510> with

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
finished now I'm not really happy with

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.259 
finished now I'm not really happy with
the<00:04:00.900> gun<00:04:01.049> I've<00:04:01.169> chosen<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.609> m6<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.030> do<00:04:03.150> he's

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
the gun I've chosen the m6 to do he's

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.629 
the gun I've chosen the m6 to do he's
not<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.480> best<00:04:03.629> weapon<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.169> I<00:04:04.650> could<00:04:04.919> have<00:04:05.040> got

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
not the best weapon and I could have got

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.509 
not the best weapon and I could have got
thinking<00:04:06.480> about<00:04:06.690> there<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:07.400> there<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.430> a

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
thinking about there is there is a

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.890 
thinking about there is there is a
another<00:04:09.000> weapon<00:04:09.120> on<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.389> floor<00:04:09.599> some<00:04:09.780> way

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
another weapon on the floor some way

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.300 
another weapon on the floor some way
around<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.230> this<00:04:10.620> area<00:04:10.919> that<00:04:11.040> could<00:04:11.190> have

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
around this this area that could have

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.490 
around this this area that could have
picked<00:04:11.459> up<00:04:11.669> I<00:04:11.790> never<00:04:11.970> thought<00:04:12.209> at<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.449> time<00:04:12.629> so

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
picked up I never thought at the time so

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.860 
picked up I never thought at the time so
as<00:04:13.949> you<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.099> see<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.310> only<00:04:14.879> need<00:04:15.090> two<00:04:15.269> kills<00:04:15.599> to

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
as you can see I only need two kills to

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.620 
as you can see I only need two kills to
get<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.139> default<00:04:16.560> flawless<00:04:17.269> like<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.329> said<00:04:18.510> was

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
get the default flawless like I said was

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.020 
get the default flawless like I said was
probably<00:04:19.380> two<00:04:19.560> options<00:04:20.250> opportunities<00:04:20.910> in

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
probably two options opportunities in

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.620 
probably two options opportunities in
that<00:04:21.180> Chapel<00:04:21.479> gun<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:21.720> I've<00:04:21.930> missed<00:04:22.109> that

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
that Chapel gun and I've missed that

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.339 
that Chapel gun and I've missed that
looking<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.690> little<00:04:24.810> bit<00:04:24.990> more<00:04:25.050> adventurous

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
looking a little bit more adventurous

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.910 
looking a little bit more adventurous
and<00:04:25.680> moving<00:04:26.039> away<00:04:26.130> from<00:04:26.250> that<00:04:26.610> general<00:04:27.450> area

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
and moving away from that general area

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.250 
and moving away from that general area
and<00:04:28.010> I<00:04:28.970> think<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.330> spot<00:04:29.570> a<00:04:29.600> guy<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.870> just<00:04:30.140> a

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
and I think of spot a guy in just a

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.390 
and I think of spot a guy in just a
second<00:04:30.770> we've<00:04:31.670> just<00:04:31.880> sworn<00:04:32.240> down<00:04:32.570> there<00:04:33.400> so

here comes society yeah I thought so

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.410

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
hit mark winning sprint towards him but

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.100 
hit mark winning sprint towards him but
is<00:04:40.670> it<00:04:41.210> got<00:04:41.360> make<00:04:41.570> if<00:04:41.750> you<00:04:41.810> look<00:04:41.930> at<00:04:42.020> the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
is it got make if you look at the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.480 
is it got make if you look at the
killcam<00:04:42.470> not<00:04:42.680> flush<00:04:42.890> didn't<00:04:43.160> even<00:04:43.340> do

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
killcam not flush didn't even do

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.650 
killcam not flush didn't even do
anything<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.970> him<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.360> was<00:04:44.480> pretty

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
anything to him so that was pretty

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.050 
anything to him so that was pretty
annoying<00:04:44.930> so<00:04:45.620> that's<00:04:45.740> basically<00:04:46.460> brewing<00:04:46.820> by

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
annoying so that's basically brewing by

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.520 
annoying so that's basically brewing by
my<00:04:47.570> flawless<00:04:47.840> game<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:49.760> think<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:51.350> nerves

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
my flawless game and I think the nerves

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.720 
my flawless game and I think the nerves
are<00:04:51.680> probably<00:04:51.710> getting<00:04:52.040> to<00:04:52.220> me<00:04:52.310> that's<00:04:52.460> have

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
are probably getting to me that's have

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.770 
are probably getting to me that's have
basically<00:04:53.480> waste<00:04:53.810> almost<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:54.890> full<00:04:55.100> clip

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
basically waste almost a full clip

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.520 
basically waste almost a full clip
trying<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.870> get<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.080> guy<00:04:57.260> I<00:04:57.290> don't<00:04:57.440> know

trying to get that guy I don't know
whether<00:04:57.740> he<00:04:57.920> was<00:04:57.980> the<00:04:58.160> host<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.640> walk<00:04:58.820> that

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
whether he was the host I walk that

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.470

fired<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.870> Kevin<00:05:03.170> picked<00:05:03.410> me<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.890> that's

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
fired and Kevin picked me so that's

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.820 
fired and Kevin picked me so that's
death<00:05:04.580> number<00:05:04.760> two<00:05:05.030> so<00:05:05.720> we're<00:05:06.020> totally<00:05:06.290> ruined

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
death number two so we're totally ruined

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.190 
death number two so we're totally ruined
is<00:05:06.920> in<00:05:07.400> terms<00:05:07.760> of<00:05:07.910> a<00:05:07.970> flawless<00:05:08.360> game<00:05:08.570> but<00:05:08.870> it

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
is in terms of a flawless game but it

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.200 
is in terms of a flawless game but it
didn't<00:05:09.470> have<00:05:09.590> been<00:05:09.740> quite<00:05:10.070> a<00:05:10.100> good<00:05:10.310> good<00:05:10.880> score

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
didn't have been quite a good good score

didn't have been quite a good good score
and<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:13.010> thought<00:05:13.610> this<00:05:13.760> was<00:05:13.910> this<00:05:14.120> one<00:05:14.300> was
