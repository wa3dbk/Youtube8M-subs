00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
opens up and we got like the main

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.280 
opens up and we got like the main
control<00:04:08.709> panel<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:09.389> when<00:04:10.389> we<00:04:10.750> press<00:04:11.109> this

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
control panel and when we press this

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.430 
control panel and when we press this
lever<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:12.609> will<00:04:12.760> see<00:04:12.909> all<00:04:13.090> these<00:04:13.329> doors<00:04:13.959> are

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
lever you will see all these doors are

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.069 
lever you will see all these doors are
going<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:14.829> open<00:04:14.889> at<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.310> same<00:04:15.489> time<00:04:15.729> so<00:04:16.389> what<00:04:17.049> I

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
going to open at the same time so what I

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.560 
going to open at the same time so what I
was<00:04:17.260> thinking<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:18.609> will<00:04:18.820> be<00:04:18.940> pretty<00:04:19.120> amazing

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
was thinking it will be pretty amazing

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.959 
was thinking it will be pretty amazing
if<00:04:19.690> we<00:04:19.840> got<00:04:20.019> like<00:04:20.229> missions<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:21.039> like<00:04:21.340> five

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
if we got like missions to like five

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.969 
if we got like missions to like five
missions<00:04:22.419> one<00:04:23.139> with<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.440> phone<00:04:23.590> number<00:04:23.770> one

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
missions one with the phone number one

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:24.620 
missions one with the phone number one
phone<00:04:24.010> number

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
phone number

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.450 
phone number
of<00:04:24.720> course<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.260> then<00:04:25.380> probably<00:04:25.830> one<00:04:26.010> in<00:04:26.040> space

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
of course and then probably one in space

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.200 
of course and then probably one in space
and<00:04:27.380> then<00:04:28.380> with<00:04:29.310> four<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.850> then<00:04:30.000> probably

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
and then with four and then probably

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.350 
and then with four and then probably
something<00:04:30.990> with<00:04:31.200> Thunderbird<00:04:32.040> 5<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.580> don't

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
2 and what I did over here this is

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.780 
2 and what I did over here this is
pretty<00:05:41.310> amazing

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
pretty amazing

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.320 
pretty amazing
I<00:05:41.910> made<00:05:42.870> this<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:43.020> place<00:05:43.860> took<00:05:44.790> a<00:05:44.880> little<00:05:45.090> bit<00:05:45.210> of

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
I made this a place took a little bit of

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.290 
I made this a place took a little bit of
more<00:05:45.510> shape<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.760> made<00:05:47.760> something<00:05:47.970> on<00:05:48.210> the

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
more shape and I made something on the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.200 
more shape and I made something on the
inside<00:05:48.390> I<00:05:48.870> changed<00:05:49.590> this<00:05:49.710> doorway<00:05:49.980> it<00:05:50.430> look

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
inside I changed this doorway it look

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.860 
inside I changed this doorway it look
really<00:05:51.570> weird

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
really weird

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.450 
really weird
and<00:05:52.080> this<00:05:52.230> looks<00:05:52.470> way<00:05:52.680> better<00:05:52.830> than<00:05:53.130> what<00:05:53.310> we

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
and this looks way better than what we

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.840 
and this looks way better than what we
had<00:05:53.610> first<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:55.040> think<00:05:56.040> tone<00:05:56.220> number<00:05:56.430> 2<00:05:56.610> will

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
had first and I think tone number 2 will

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.560 
had first and I think tone number 2 will
fit<00:05:57.480> in<00:05:57.630> here<00:05:57.660> this<00:05:58.530> is<00:05:58.740> 40<00:05:59.430> blocks<00:05:59.640> white<00:06:00.240> and

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
fit in here this is 40 blocks white and

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:08.030 
fit in here this is 40 blocks white and
I<00:06:01.350> thought<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.890> was<00:06:02.090> 1<00:06:03.090> 2<00:06:03.420> 3<00:06:03.900> 4<00:06:04.650> 5<00:06:05.100> 6<00:06:05.730> 7<00:06:06.150> 8<00:06:06.480> 9<00:06:07.260> 10<00:06:07.770> 11

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
I thought it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.970 
I thought it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
12<00:06:08.640> 13<00:06:09.060> 14<00:06:09.770> 15<00:06:10.770> 16<00:06:11.280> 17<00:06:11.550> 18<00:06:12.120> this<00:06:13.020> is<00:06:13.140> 18<00:06:13.500> blocks

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 this is 18 blocks

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.320 
12 13 14 15 16 17 18 this is 18 blocks
tall<00:06:15.170> yeah<00:06:16.170> and<00:06:16.470> these<00:06:17.400> are<00:06:17.580> all<00:06:17.730> 15<00:06:18.180> in

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
tall yeah and these are all 15 in

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.730 
tall yeah and these are all 15 in
between<00:06:18.660> so<00:06:18.930> that's<00:06:19.230> 30<00:06:20.660> 45<00:06:21.660> and<00:06:22.140> then<00:06:22.470> with

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
between so that's 30 45 and then with

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.550 
between so that's 30 45 and then with
these<00:06:23.310> four<00:06:23.610> so<00:06:23.880> that's<00:06:24.090> probably<00:06:24.480> about<00:06:24.780> 60

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
these four so that's probably about 60

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.660 
these four so that's probably about 60
and<00:06:27.050> then<00:06:28.050> we<00:06:28.200> got<00:06:28.350> this<00:06:28.500> place<00:06:28.710> over<00:06:29.010> here<00:06:29.160> as

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:29.670 
and then we got this place over here as

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.840 
and then we got this place over here as
well<00:06:29.970> but<00:06:30.840> that<00:06:31.020> doesn't<00:06:31.320> really<00:06:31.350> matter<00:06:31.850> this

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
well but that doesn't really matter this

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.940 
well but that doesn't really matter this
thing<00:06:33.150> is<00:06:33.360> pretty<00:06:33.600> amazing<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.140> not<00:06:34.440> only<00:06:34.590> for

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
thing is pretty amazing and not only for

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.210 
thing is pretty amazing and not only for
fun<00:06:35.070> numbered<00:06:35.370> to<00:06:35.940> here<00:06:36.750> will<00:06:36.930> be<00:06:37.080> like<00:06:37.290> the

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
fun numbered to here will be like the

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.330 
fun numbered to here will be like the
main<00:06:38.640> thing<00:06:38.850> were<00:06:39.000> brings<00:06:39.300> is<00:06:39.630> having<00:06:40.620> his<00:06:40.710> lap

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
main thing were brings is having his lap

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.730 
main thing were brings is having his lap
and<00:06:41.580> stuff<00:06:41.790> like<00:06:41.970> that<00:06:42.230> it<00:06:43.230> will<00:06:43.410> be<00:06:43.530> pretty

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
and stuff like that it will be pretty

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.840 
and stuff like that it will be pretty
amazing<00:06:43.980> there<00:06:44.220> will<00:06:44.340> be<00:06:44.370> a<00:06:44.490> lot<00:06:44.730> more

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
amazing there will be a lot more

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.140 
amazing there will be a lot more
underground<00:06:45.210> so<00:06:45.930> it<00:06:46.560> will<00:06:46.800> there<00:06:47.430> won't<00:06:47.640> be<00:06:47.760> as

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
underground so it will there won't be as

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.230 
underground so it will there won't be as
big<00:06:48.360> as<00:06:48.510> this<00:06:49.130> I'll<00:06:50.130> think<00:06:50.820> I'll<00:06:51.000> probably

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
big as this I'll think I'll probably

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.890 
big as this I'll think I'll probably
make<00:06:51.600> it<00:06:51.780> like<00:06:51.990> deeper<00:06:52.590> first<00:06:52.830> and<00:06:53.870> yeah<00:06:54.870> I

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
make it like deeper first and yeah I

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.800 
make it like deeper first and yeah I
