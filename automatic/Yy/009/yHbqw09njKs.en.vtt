but<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.780> have<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.350> much<00:00:36.830> much<00:00:37.640> easier

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
but I have a much much easier

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.840 
but I have a much much easier
alternative<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:40.040> get<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:41.059> can<00:00:41.269> use<00:00:41.510> a<00:00:42.850> pretty

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
alternative to get you can use a pretty

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.270 
alternative to get you can use a pretty
much<00:00:44.030> any<00:00:44.449> etek<00:00:44.870> launcher<00:00:45.409> would<00:00:45.680> be<00:00:45.799> the<00:00:45.920> area

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
much any etek launcher would be the area

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.969 
much any etek launcher would be the area
of<00:00:46.460> effect<00:00:46.960> launcher<00:00:47.960> much<00:00:48.379> like<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.799> north

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
of effect launcher much like the north

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.020 
of effect launcher much like the north
way<00:00:49.159> or<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:49.370> can<00:00:49.460> just<00:00:49.610> shoot<00:00:49.760> it<00:00:49.879> at<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
way or you can just shoot it at the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.630 
way or you can just shoot it at the
floor<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:50.629> do<00:00:50.780> some<00:00:51.019> damage<00:00:51.190> but<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.339> blade

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
floor and do some damage but the blade

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.780 
floor and do some damage but the blade
off<00:00:52.879> ones<00:00:53.239> are<00:00:53.540> sick<00:00:54.110> they<00:00:54.470> they<00:00:54.920> camp<00:00:55.369> out<00:00:55.580> at

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
off ones are sick they they camp out at

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.399 
off ones are sick they they camp out at
about<00:00:57.220> 300,000<00:00:58.220> damage<00:00:59.210> which<00:00:59.479> isn't<00:01:00.019> that

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
about 300,000 damage which isn't that

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.070 
about 300,000 damage which isn't that
good<00:01:00.920> compared<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.670> north<00:01:02.030> lead<00:01:02.299> but<00:01:02.869> for

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
good compared to a north lead but for

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.469 
good compared to a north lead but for
average<00:01:03.500> enemies<00:01:03.979> in<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.430> game<00:01:04.729> if<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:05.269> get

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
average enemies in the game if you get

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.719 
average enemies in the game if you get
the<00:01:05.600> right<00:01:05.840> element<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.560> will<00:01:06.770> melt<00:01:07.189> them<00:01:07.490> they

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
the right element it will melt them they

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.910 
the right element it will melt them they
have<00:01:07.850> such<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.090> fast<00:01:08.540> fire<00:01:08.930> rate<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.530> pretty

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
have such a fast fire rate a pretty

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.030 
have such a fast fire rate a pretty
decent<00:01:10.400> reload<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.120> they<00:01:11.450> consume<00:01:11.990> less<00:01:12.350> ammo

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
decent reload and they consume less ammo

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.750 
decent reload and they consume less ammo
so<00:01:13.580> for<00:01:14.530> one<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.680> has<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.830> capacity<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.460> 5

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
so for one that has a capacity of 5

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.520 
so for one that has a capacity of 5
that's<00:01:17.060> pretty<00:01:17.300> common<00:01:17.480> you'll<00:01:17.840> get<00:01:17.990> 8<00:01:18.200> shots

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
that's pretty common you'll get 8 shots

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.000 
that's pretty common you'll get 8 shots
out<00:01:18.830> of<00:01:18.860> that<00:01:19.100> 5<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.210> then<00:01:20.390> 8<00:01:20.870> times<00:01:21.230> 3<00:01:21.890> or

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
out of that 5 so then 8 times 3 or

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.330 
out of that 5 so then 8 times 3 or
thought<00:01:22.250> that's<00:01:23.140> 2.4<00:01:24.140> million<00:01:24.500> damage<00:01:25.010> you

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
thought that's 2.4 million damage you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.230 
thought that's 2.4 million damage you
can<00:01:25.490> get<00:01:25.610> from<00:01:25.790> one<00:01:26.120> clip<00:01:26.510> of<00:01:27.520> blade<00:01:28.520> off<00:01:28.730> VTEC

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
can get from one clip of blade off VTEC

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.260 
can get from one clip of blade off VTEC
so<00:01:29.480> it's<00:01:29.860> plenty<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.220> take<00:01:31.580> care<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.030> any

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
so it's plenty to take care of any

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.610 
so it's plenty to take care of any
regular<00:01:32.900> bosses<00:01:33.650> in<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> game<00:01:33.950> or<00:01:34.520> any<00:01:35.620> just

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
regular bosses in the game or any just

regular bosses in the game or any just
regular<00:01:36.980> enemies<00:01:37.370> in<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.610> game<00:01:37.790> it<00:01:38.000> will<00:01:38.090> melt

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
regular enemies in the game it will melt

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.270 
regular enemies in the game it will melt
