00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
competition year to this point I think

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.560

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
outstanding year you do kind of take a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.609 
outstanding year you do kind of take a
breath<00:00:26.760> after<00:00:27.029> basketball<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.470> still

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
breath after basketball but we still

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.380 
breath after basketball but we still
have<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:28.949> many<00:00:29.099> teams<00:00:29.340> continuing<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.060> compete

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
have so many teams continuing to compete

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.910 
have so many teams continuing to compete
down<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> spring<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:31.830> obviously

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
down the spring so you know obviously

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
down the spring so you know obviously
baseball<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.640> softball<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> ones<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
baseball and softball is the ones that

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.209 
baseball and softball is the ones that
have<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> most<00:00:33.840> games<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
have the most games and that's the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.560 
have the most games and that's the
busiest<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.790> overall<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.120> thought<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
busiest but overall I thought it was a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.110 
busiest but overall I thought it was a
very<00:00:36.750> good<00:00:36.899> year<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.380> gymnastics<00:00:38.120> defensing

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079

following that closely what if you

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.800 
following that closely what if you
thought<00:03:31.799> well<00:03:32.760> one<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.000> was<00:03:33.209> surprised<00:03:33.540> it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
thought well one I was surprised it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.180 
thought well one I was surprised it
happened<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:34.200> Northwestern<00:03:34.739> but<00:03:35.040> when<00:03:35.160> the

happened at Northwestern but when the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.800 
happened at Northwestern but when the
more<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.459> read<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.060> it's<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.510> know<00:03:36.600> it's<00:03:36.630> a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
more I read that it's you know it's a

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.360 
more I read that it's you know it's a
private<00:03:37.170> school<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.440> right<00:03:37.860> now<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.220> only

applies to to private schools and
they've<00:03:40.950> been<00:03:41.070> granted<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.640> right<00:03:42.000> by<00:03:42.630> the

consider a union if they so choose and I

consider a union if they so choose and I
think<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.299> has<00:03:48.330> really<00:03:48.600> sparked<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.140> lot<00:03:49.170> of

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
think that has really sparked a lot of

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.229 
think that has really sparked a lot of
discussion<00:03:49.890> about<00:03:49.980> what<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.209> that

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
discussion about what is it that

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.970 
discussion about what is it that

know<00:03:59.700> we've<00:03:59.850> had<00:03:59.880> scholarships<00:04:00.630> for<00:04:01.230> 50<00:04:01.560> years

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
know we've had scholarships for 50 years

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.789 
know we've had scholarships for 50 years
and<00:04:02.130> we've<00:04:02.730> had<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.940> pretty<00:04:03.209> good<00:04:03.330> deal<00:04:04.230> i<00:04:04.290> think

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
and we've had a pretty good deal i think

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.680 
and we've had a pretty good deal i think
for<00:04:04.980> students<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.910> know<00:04:06.030> you<00:04:06.090> participate<00:04:06.660> in

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
for students you know you participate in

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.240 
for students you know you participate in
sport<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.380> get<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.530> scholarship<00:04:07.739> and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
sport and you get a scholarship and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.340 
sport and you get a scholarship and
that's<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.850> pretty<00:04:09.030> good<00:04:09.209> deal<00:04:09.390> but<00:04:09.900> i<00:04:09.959> think<00:04:10.230> we

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
that's a pretty good deal but i think we

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.770 
that's a pretty good deal but i think we
have<00:04:10.560> really<00:04:10.769> chewed<00:04:11.160> into<00:04:11.340> their<00:04:11.610> time<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.180> i

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
have really chewed into their time and i

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.539 
have really chewed into their time and i
think<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.410> educational<00:04:14.040> experience

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
think that the educational experience

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.520 
think that the educational experience
that<00:04:14.700> some<00:04:14.880> students<00:04:15.239> have<00:04:15.390> today<00:04:15.750> is<00:04:15.989> not

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
that some students have today is not

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.319 
that some students have today is not
what<00:04:16.769> they<00:04:16.890> had<00:04:17.010> hoped<00:04:17.220> for<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.940> i<00:04:17.970> think<00:04:18.060> we

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
what they had hoped for so i think we

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.449 
what they had hoped for so i think we
really<00:04:18.570> need<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.750> look<00:04:18.989> at<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.500> understand

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
really need to look at it and understand

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.360 
really need to look at it and understand
what<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.390> can<00:04:21.570> do<00:04:21.720> better<00:04:21.989> but<00:04:22.710> i<00:04:22.740> don't<00:04:23.070> think

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
what we can do better but i don't think

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.980 
what we can do better but i don't think
we<00:04:23.520> should<00:04:23.550> get<00:04:23.789> into<00:04:24.060> an<00:04:24.150> employer-employee

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
we should get into an employer-employee

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.230 
we should get into an employer-employee
relationship<00:04:25.560> i<00:04:25.890> think<00:04:26.130> that's<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.400> mistake

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
relationship i think that's a mistake

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.540 
relationship i think that's a mistake
I think<00:04:27.509> it<00:04:27.599> has<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.780> lot<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.259> unintended

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
I think it has a lot of unintended

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.379 
I think it has a lot of unintended
consequences<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.699> I<00:04:29.759> think<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> one<00:04:30.210> that

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
consequences and I think the one that

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.850 
consequences and I think the one that
people<00:04:30.539> are<00:04:30.750> rightfully<00:04:30.960> pointing<00:04:31.470> out<00:04:31.590> is

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
people are rightfully pointing out is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.159 
people are rightfully pointing out is
taxation<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:33.210> know<00:04:33.330> what<00:04:33.539> is<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.900> issue<00:04:34.020> of

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
taxation you know what is the issue of

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.260 
taxation you know what is the issue of
tax<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.889> think<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.490> second<00:04:35.880> one<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.150> they

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
tax I think the second one that they

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.990 
tax I think the second one that they
point<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.990> very<00:04:37.199> directly<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:38.000> student

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
point to very directly is student

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.969 
point to very directly is student
well-being<00:04:39.150> and<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.840> think<00:04:40.050> time<00:04:40.259> factors<00:04:40.770> into

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
well-being and I think time factors into

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.370 
well-being and I think time factors into
that<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.370> think<00:04:41.849> we<00:04:41.940> do<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.090> great<00:04:42.449> job<00:04:42.479> here<00:04:43.229> in

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
that I think we do a great job here in

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.550 
that I think we do a great job here in
testing<00:04:44.069> students<00:04:44.460> for<00:04:45.150> their<00:04:45.930> physical

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
was your reaction I think we struck a

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.379 
was your reaction I think we struck a
very<00:06:38.070> good<00:06:38.250> balance<00:06:38.610> you<00:06:38.760> know<00:06:38.880> we're<00:06:39.210> not

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
very good balance you know we're not

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.760 
very good balance you know we're not
eight<00:06:39.870> schools<00:06:40.289> anymore

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
eight schools anymore

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.730 
eight schools anymore
not<00:06:40.919> nine<00:06:41.160> schools<00:06:41.430> not<00:06:41.699> 12<00:06:42.000> or<00:06:42.270> 15<00:06:42.419> we<00:06:43.379> stretch

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
not nine schools not 12 or 15 we stretch

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.760 
not nine schools not 12 or 15 we stretch
from<00:06:44.039> from<00:06:45.000> Syracuse<00:06:45.840> New<00:06:46.020> York<00:06:46.080> to<00:06:46.440> Miami

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
from from Syracuse New York to Miami

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.260 
from from Syracuse New York to Miami
Florida<00:06:46.979> all<00:06:47.250> the<00:06:47.370> way<00:06:47.460> over<00:06:47.699> to<00:06:47.729> south<00:06:48.090> bend

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
Florida all the way over to south bend

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.360 
Florida all the way over to south bend
indiana<00:06:48.569> so<00:06:49.319> we're<00:06:49.530> a<00:06:49.560> very<00:06:49.830> different<00:06:50.220> league

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
indiana so we're a very different league

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.640 
indiana so we're a very different league
than<00:06:50.400> we<00:06:50.729> were<00:06:50.879> 10<00:06:51.449> years<00:06:51.629> ago<00:06:51.810> 15<00:06:52.259> years<00:06:52.289> ago

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
than we were 10 years ago 15 years ago

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.610 
than we were 10 years ago 15 years ago
so<00:06:53.280> having<00:06:53.909> it<00:06:54.210> be<00:06:54.389> north<00:06:54.750> carolina<00:06:55.139> century

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
so having it be north carolina century

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.680 
so having it be north carolina century
guys<00:06:55.770> think<00:06:56.129> is<00:06:56.220> very<00:06:56.370> important<00:06:56.909> so<00:06:57.300> having

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
guys think is very important so having

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.559 
guys think is very important so having
two<00:06:57.900> games<00:06:58.430> scheduled<00:06:59.430> now<00:06:59.550> 19<00:07:00.000> and<00:07:00.150> 20<00:07:00.419> back

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569 
two games scheduled now 19 and 20 back

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.180 
two games scheduled now 19 and 20 back
in<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:00.840> state<00:07:01.020> of<00:07:01.050> North<00:07:01.289> Carolina<00:07:01.349> or<00:07:01.830> two

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
in the state of North Carolina or two

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.040 
in the state of North Carolina or two
tournaments<00:07:02.669> I<00:07:03.270> think<00:07:03.720> is<00:07:03.810> a<00:07:03.840> good<00:07:03.990> thing

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
tournaments I think is a good thing

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.260 
tournaments I think is a good thing
moving<00:07:04.860> it<00:07:04.949> around<00:07:05.069> is<00:07:05.370> great<00:07:05.580> and<00:07:05.819> I<00:07:05.940> do<00:07:06.000> think

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
moving it around is great and I do think

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.689 
moving it around is great and I do think
playing<00:07:06.629> in<00:07:06.960> Brooklyn<00:07:07.680> is<00:07:07.830> outstanding<00:07:08.550> that

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
playing in Brooklyn is outstanding that

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:11.270 
playing in Brooklyn is outstanding that
is<00:07:08.819> an<00:07:08.940> outstanding<00:07:09.300> facility<00:07:10.080> that<00:07:10.560> people

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
is an outstanding facility that people

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.159 
is an outstanding facility that people
are<00:07:11.370> really<00:07:11.550> excited<00:07:11.669> about<00:07:12.030> getting<00:07:12.449> to<00:07:12.479> but

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
are really excited about getting to but

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.930 
are really excited about getting to but
I<00:07:13.199> don't<00:07:13.440> think<00:07:13.620> we<00:07:13.710> need<00:07:13.830> to<00:07:13.979> be<00:07:14.430> gone<00:07:14.669> from

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
I don't think we need to be gone from

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.580 
I don't think we need to be gone from
the<00:07:15.060> state<00:07:15.240> of<00:07:15.270> North<00:07:15.479> Carolina<00:07:15.539> that<00:07:16.349> much

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590 
the state of North Carolina that much

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.620 
the state of North Carolina that much
but<00:07:17.190> I<00:07:17.250> think<00:07:17.460> it's<00:07:17.580> a<00:07:17.639> very<00:07:17.759> good<00:07:17.880> balance<00:07:18.389> to

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.630 
but I think it's a very good balance to

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.210 
but I think it's a very good balance to
to<00:07:19.050> try<00:07:19.229> to<00:07:19.289> maintain<00:07:19.560> the<00:07:19.860> history<00:07:20.130> and

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
to try to maintain the history and

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.070 
to try to maintain the history and
tradition<00:07:20.580> of<00:07:20.699> the<00:07:20.789> league<00:07:20.970> yet<00:07:21.690> get

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
tradition of the league yet get

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.320 
tradition of the league yet get
ourselves<00:07:22.199> into<00:07:22.800> new<00:07:22.979> markets<00:07:23.159> that<00:07:23.849> really

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
ourselves into new markets that really

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.390 
ourselves into new markets that really
are<00:07:25.169> appealing<00:07:25.590> to<00:07:25.680> some<00:07:25.830> of<00:07:25.919> the<00:07:25.979> new<00:07:26.099> schools

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
are appealing to some of the new schools

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.820 
are appealing to some of the new schools
in<00:07:26.520> the<00:07:26.580> league<00:07:26.759> I<00:07:27.030> wish<00:07:27.900> we<00:07:28.080> could<00:07:28.319> just<00:07:28.710> sit
