00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
a 195 thread mess and then flash droid

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
a 195 thread mess and then flash droid
and<00:00:39.690> then<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> six<00:00:40.110> colors<00:00:40.500> were<00:00:41.190> painted<00:00:41.520> wet

on<00:00:41.820> wet<00:00:41.850> over<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> top<00:00:43.760> Wow<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.420> there's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
on wet over the top Wow so there's

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
on wet over the top Wow so there's
always<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> 305<00:00:46.469> team<00:00:46.800> first<00:00:47.070> down<00:00:47.280> wet<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.700> just

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
always a 305 team first down wet is just

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760 
always a 305 team first down wet is just
to<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:48.329> kit<00:00:48.660> opaque<00:00:49.200> layer<00:00:49.440> right

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to get your kit opaque layer right

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
to get your kit opaque layer right
that's<00:00:50.190> correct<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.969> end<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that's correct and you end up with a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.420 
that's correct and you end up with a
much<00:00:51.570> softer<00:00:51.870> handle<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> finished<00:00:53.160> print

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
much softer handle on the finished print

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
much softer handle on the finished print
but<00:00:53.550> first<00:00:53.760> down<00:00:53.969> means<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.809> what

colors there is there's a regular weight
in<00:00:58.980> our<00:00:59.070> first<00:00:59.309> down<00:00:59.489> way<00:00:59.699> yeah<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
in our first down way yeah we had the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.139 
in our first down way yeah we had the
super<00:01:00.629> cover<00:01:00.840> white<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.609> we'll<00:01:02.609> talk<00:01:03.030> about

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
super cover white so we'll talk about

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
super cover white so we'll talk about
the<00:01:03.300> first<00:01:03.329> down<00:01:03.690> white<00:01:03.899> first<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> super

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the first down white first so the super

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
the first down white first so the super
cover<00:01:05.400> white<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.850> sort<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> very<00:01:06.270> very<00:01:06.510> highly

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
cover white is sort of very very highly

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
cover white is sort of very very highly
pigmented<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.950> first<00:01:08.340> down<00:01:08.520> white<00:01:08.760> has<00:01:08.939> got

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
pigmented the first down white has got

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.399 
pigmented the first down white has got
less<00:01:09.360> pigment<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.080> got<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> much

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
less pigment in it but it's got a much

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
less pigment in it but it's got a much
bigger<00:01:10.590> tooth<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.520> effectively<00:01:11.909> act<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
bigger tooth so it effectively act as a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.100 
bigger tooth so it effectively act as a
primer<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.710> put<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:14.250> through<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
primer so you put that down through the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
primer so you put that down through the
screen<00:01:16.110> your<00:01:16.500> flash<00:01:16.740> drive<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> can

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
screen your flash drive and then you can

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
screen your flash drive and then you can
print<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.180> six<00:01:18.450> colors<00:01:18.810> wet<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.170> wet

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
print the other six colors wet on wet

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.340 
print the other six colors wet on wet
and<00:01:19.650> that's<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.280> another<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and that's a another first we have the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.070 
and that's a another first we have the
very<00:01:22.950> strong<00:01:23.280> environmental<00:01:24.060> commitment<00:01:24.840> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
very strong environmental commitment so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
very strong environmental commitment so
we<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.950> embarked<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.549> project<00:01:26.820> about

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
we we embarked on this project about

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.870 
we we embarked on this project about
three<00:01:28.170> years<00:01:28.320> ago<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.640> wanted<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
three years ago and we just wanted to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.899 
three years ago and we just wanted to
make<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.950> one<00:01:31.950> hundred<00:01:32.159> percent<00:01:32.220> water-based

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
make a one hundred percent water-based

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.310 
make a one hundred percent water-based
product<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.570> expected<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.200> our

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
product but we expected that our

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
product but we expected that our
customers<00:01:34.530> would<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> accommodate<00:01:36.000> some

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
customers would have to accommodate some

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.719 
customers would have to accommodate some
performance<00:01:37.020> compromises<00:01:37.740> by<00:01:38.340> working<00:01:38.579> with

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
performance compromises by working with

hundred percent more to base so every

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.110 
hundred percent more to base so every

positive<00:03:11.359> for<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.810> environment<00:03:12.109> so<00:03:13.099> this<00:03:13.340> is

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
positive for the environment so this is

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.490

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
additive put the finish think back in

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.510 
additive put the finish think back in
the<00:05:42.599> jar<00:05:42.839> in<00:05:43.500> other<00:05:43.710> words<00:05:43.949> when<00:05:44.099> you<00:05:44.129> had<00:05:44.279> ink

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
the jar in other words when you had ink

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.339 
the jar in other words when you had ink
left<00:05:44.819> over<00:05:45.240> you'd<00:05:45.389> pour<00:05:45.629> in<00:05:45.719> the<00:05:45.750> gyro<00:05:46.080> debt

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
left over you'd pour in the gyro debt

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:47.869 
left over you'd pour in the gyro debt
would<00:05:46.560> already<00:05:46.770> have<00:05:46.949> that<00:05:47.190> additive<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.729> yeah

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
would already have that additive is yeah

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.640 
would already have that additive is yeah
and<00:05:48.150> so<00:05:48.419> the<00:05:48.599> next<00:05:48.719> thing<00:05:48.839> I<00:05:48.960> come<00:05:49.169> along<00:05:49.409> he'd

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
and so the next thing I come along he'd

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.930 
and so the next thing I come along he'd
have<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.800> stretched<00:05:50.099> job<00:05:50.339> and<00:05:50.550> he'd<00:05:50.669> put

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
have a stretched job and he'd put

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.209 
have a stretched job and he'd put
stretch<00:05:51.509> at<00:05:51.719> it<00:05:51.810> in<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.379> then<00:05:52.650> putting<00:05:52.919> I<00:05:53.009> got

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
stretch at it in and then putting I got

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.159 
stretch at it in and then putting I got
two<00:05:53.370> additives<00:05:53.879> yeah<00:05:54.060> right<00:05:54.479> yep<00:05:54.839> so<00:05:55.020> you're

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
two additives yeah right yep so you're

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.320 
two additives yeah right yep so you're
really<00:05:55.319> polluting<00:05:55.889> the<00:05:55.979> stock<00:05:56.250> right<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:57.000> so

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
really polluting the stock right and so

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.680 
really polluting the stock right and so
with<00:05:57.629> this<00:05:57.779> at<00:05:58.310> all<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.819> qualities<00:06:00.150> built<00:06:00.539> in

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
with this at all the qualities built in

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.350 
with this at all the qualities built in
there<00:06:00.900> all<00:06:01.379> the<00:06:02.089> performance<00:06:03.089> all<00:06:03.210> the

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
there all the performance all the

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.420 
there all the performance all the
stretch<00:06:03.629> or<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.020> occasion<00:06:04.589> this<00:06:05.099> is<00:06:05.279> so

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
stretch or the occasion this is so

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.249 
stretch or the occasion this is so
strong<00:06:05.699> resistance<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.659> know<00:06:06.779> it<00:06:06.870> feels<00:06:06.900> like

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
strong resistance you know it feels like

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.050 
strong resistance you know it feels like
something<00:06:07.589> I'd<00:06:07.710> want<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:08.009> wear<00:06:08.159> yeah<00:06:08.729> well

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
something I'd want to wear yeah well

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.119 
something I'd want to wear yeah well
that's<00:06:09.479> that's<00:06:10.379> the<00:06:10.589> whole<00:06:10.740> thing<00:06:10.770> about

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
that's that's the whole thing about

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.100 
that's that's the whole thing about
screen<00:06:11.520> printing<00:06:11.789> for<00:06:11.909> textiles<00:06:12.479> is<00:06:12.659> it<00:06:12.930> needs

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
screen printing for textiles is it needs

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.110 
screen printing for textiles is it needs
to<00:06:13.259> be<00:06:13.349> comfortable<00:06:13.740> but<00:06:14.400> typically<00:06:14.819> if<00:06:15.029> you

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
to be comfortable but typically if you

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.559 
to be comfortable but typically if you
had<00:06:15.270> a<00:06:15.300> soft<00:06:15.629> product<00:06:16.080> added<00:06:16.529> wash<00:06:17.310> off<00:06:17.569> yeah

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
had a soft product added wash off yeah

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.869 
had a soft product added wash off yeah
this<00:06:18.900> energy<00:06:19.259> looked<00:06:19.469> at<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.770> that<00:06:20.129> we<00:06:20.699> have

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879 
this energy looked at it that we have

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.790 
this energy looked at it that we have
exclusive<00:06:21.479> access<00:06:21.599> to<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.199> proprietary

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
polymer that gives this softness and

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.860 
polymer that gives this softness and
strength<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.770> we've<00:06:26.250> had<00:06:26.490> this<00:06:26.639> tested<00:06:27.150> so

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
strength and we've had this tested so

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.689 
strength and we've had this tested so
this<00:06:28.020> is<00:06:28.050> special<00:06:28.529> chemistry<00:06:28.830> right<00:06:29.219> this<00:06:29.520> is

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
this is special chemistry right this is

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.579 
this is special chemistry right this is

else<00:06:31.709> really<00:06:31.919> has<00:06:32.159> this<00:06:32.370> that's<00:06:32.789> right

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
else really has this that's right

was<00:06:49.360> through<00:06:49.569> a<00:06:49.599> real<00:06:49.779> tough<00:06:49.990> why<00:06:50.259> should<00:06:50.559> a

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
was through a real tough why should a

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.219 
was through a real tough why should a
little<00:06:51.009> hot<00:06:51.189> that's<00:06:51.849> right<00:06:52.059> with<00:06:52.509> the

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:53.229 
little hot that's right with the

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.079 
little hot that's right with the
unprinted<00:06:53.979> areas<00:06:54.189> are<00:06:54.309> actually<00:06:54.580> degrading

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
unprinted areas are actually degrading

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:56.339 
unprinted areas are actually degrading
but<00:06:55.270> the<00:06:55.539> printer<00:06:55.809> there<00:06:55.990> is<00:06:56.110> we're<00:06:56.259> actually

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.349 
but the printer there is we're actually

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.649 
but the printer there is we're actually
helping<00:06:56.889> to<00:06:57.159> hold<00:06:57.339> the<00:06:57.460> textile<00:06:57.849> together<00:06:58.150> so

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659 
helping to hold the textile together so

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.959 
helping to hold the textile together so
you're<00:06:58.930> an<00:06:59.050> industrial<00:06:59.710> supplier<00:07:00.580> so<00:07:00.939> I

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:00.969 
you're an industrial supplier so I

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.549 
you're an industrial supplier so I
suppose<00:07:01.330> you<00:07:01.479> can<00:07:01.599> get<00:07:01.779> these<00:07:01.960> in<00:07:02.349> all

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:02.559 
suppose you can get these in all

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:06.600 
suppose you can get these in all
different<00:07:02.800> sizes<00:07:03.240> yep<00:07:04.240> the<00:07:04.749> small<00:07:05.469> size<00:07:06.399> we

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
different sizes yep the small size we

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.029 
different sizes yep the small size we
stock<00:07:06.909> is<00:07:07.210> the<00:07:07.330> 300<00:07:07.870> mil<00:07:08.020> which<00:07:08.259> is<00:07:08.499> just<00:07:08.710> under

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 
stock is the 300 mil which is just under

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:11.420 
stock is the 300 mil which is just under
11<00:07:09.069> ounce<00:07:09.520> right<00:07:10.120> we<00:07:10.330> then<00:07:10.509> have<00:07:10.749> the<00:07:11.139> liter

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
11 ounce right we then have the liter

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.450 
11 ounce right we then have the liter
looks<00:07:12.430> like<00:07:12.610> this<00:07:12.819> one<00:07:13.020> sorry<00:07:14.020> yep<00:07:14.529> the<00:07:15.009> liter

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
looks like this one sorry yep the liter

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.820 
looks like this one sorry yep the liter
which<00:07:16.029> is<00:07:16.270> just<00:07:16.809> a<00:07:16.960> bit<00:07:17.110> bigger<00:07:17.319> than<00:07:17.439> a<00:07:17.559> quart

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:17.830 
which is just a bit bigger than a quart

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.799 
which is just a bit bigger than a quart
all<00:07:18.219> those<00:07:18.490> come<00:07:18.759> in<00:07:18.909> all<00:07:19.120> the<00:07:19.360> colors<00:07:19.389> coming

00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:19.809 
all those come in all the colors coming

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:21.540 
all those come in all the colors coming
leader<00:07:20.080> all<00:07:20.439> the<00:07:20.589> colors<00:07:20.889> come<00:07:21.069> in<00:07:21.219> liters

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
leader all the colors come in liters

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.179 
leader all the colors come in liters
then<00:07:22.270> we<00:07:22.419> have<00:07:22.569> four<00:07:22.870> liters<00:07:23.259> which<00:07:23.499> is<00:07:23.740> just

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:24.189 
then we have four liters which is just

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.489 
then we have four liters which is just
