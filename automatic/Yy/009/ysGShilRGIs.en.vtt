hanging out with my friends in the
lunchroom<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:18.010> would<00:04:18.220> be<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.489> library<00:04:18.669> I

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
lunchroom I would be in the library I

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.699 
lunchroom I would be in the library I
was<00:04:19.450> treated<00:04:19.810> definitely<00:04:20.109> because<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.410> didn't

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
was treated definitely because I didn't

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.790 
was treated definitely because I didn't
allow<00:04:21.010> people<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.489> get<00:04:21.849> to<00:04:22.030> know<00:04:22.180> me<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:23.410> so

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
allow people to get to know me and so

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.559 
allow people to get to know me and so
I<00:04:23.830> would<00:04:24.129> kind<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.400> close<00:04:24.580> myself<00:04:24.819> off<00:04:25.120> and

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:25.569 
I would kind of close myself off and

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.899 
I would kind of close myself off and
didn't<00:04:25.960> like<00:04:26.139> allow<00:04:26.409> people<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:26.979> and<00:04:27.280> that's

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
didn't like allow people in and that's

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.460 
didn't like allow people in and that's
why<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.150> was<00:04:28.389> treated<00:04:28.690> differently<00:04:29.020> but<00:04:29.349> as

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.760 
I feel like I was hidden from the world
not<00:06:04.509> only<00:06:04.840> from<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.080> world<00:06:05.289> though<00:06:05.469> I<00:06:05.500> was

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
not only from the world though I was

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.550 
not only from the world though I was
like<00:06:05.889> hidden<00:06:06.069> from<00:06:06.370> myself<00:06:06.879> when<00:06:07.569> I<00:06:07.599> was<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:08.139> lot

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
like hidden from myself when I was a lot

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.790 
like hidden from myself when I was a lot
heavier<00:06:08.889> because<00:06:09.340> I<00:06:09.520> was<00:06:09.940> so<00:06:10.120> insecure<00:06:10.509> and<00:06:11.050> so

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
heavier because I was so insecure and so

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.850 
heavier because I was so insecure and so
shy<00:06:12.699> about<00:06:13.120> my<00:06:13.389> weight<00:06:13.629> that<00:06:13.960> I<00:06:13.990> really<00:06:14.469> didn't

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
shy about my weight that I really didn't

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.240 
shy about my weight that I really didn't
know<00:06:15.370> myself<00:06:15.639> I<00:06:16.240> didn't<00:06:16.449> know<00:06:16.569> me<00:06:17.529> at<00:06:17.590> all<00:06:17.740> so

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
know myself I didn't know me at all so

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.040 
know myself I didn't know me at all so
the<00:06:18.520> biggest<00:06:18.669> plus<00:06:19.000> side<00:06:19.240> of<00:06:19.509> losing<00:06:19.900> weight

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
the biggest plus side of losing weight

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.379 
the biggest plus side of losing weight
is<00:06:20.319> not<00:06:20.830> all<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.190> cute<00:06:21.400> clothes<00:06:21.759> I<00:06:21.909> can<00:06:22.090> fit<00:06:22.270> in

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389
