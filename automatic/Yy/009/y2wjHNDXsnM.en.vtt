00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.360

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.820
 that we are worth with reasons sometimes cape iv 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.510
 only on foot a little less available 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.880
 you are also told that there 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.520
 the series with with capi well going 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.870
 resume in February because for 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.409
 reason for hack compared to his elder and 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.540
 also so he banished and his a 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.239
 been good line what seems a trick of the 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.280
 style and get it back on February 5th 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.170
 what we will be able to do again but 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.390
 we will change a little 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.800
 we will change a little bit like me I'm going 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.840
 to make two characters is also 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.390
 so I think I do more to our souls 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.530
 after that daring to tell you I know 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.610
 not in the comments tell me if 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.530
 you want me to do to our hamlets 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.180
 of St. opt in to aignan 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.500
 completely sram since i'm going 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.630
 always played monster soul but with a 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.060
 osamodas or with his age that I 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.280
 would select and capi normally 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.780
 should play a rape and a sacred I 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.670
 I'm not sure but in any case it should 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.140
 to be that way we'll be able to handle a 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.370
 little more dunks why noah 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.470
 bad luck that it heals 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.100
 it also protects a little bit with 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.050
 toad it gives pm and dpa 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.150
 and then it invokes good stuff that 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.549
 can have a snack all this so for 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.260
 me it's a bit of a good class who 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.549
 could be really support otherwise 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.620
 after you can always propose 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.600
 your class and tell me why the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.830
 class and well here then that's all
