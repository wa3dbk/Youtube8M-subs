triangle started and you're going to go

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.210 
triangle started and you're going to go
under<00:02:09.209> where<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.350> straight<00:02:11.350> part<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.890> the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
under where the straight part of the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.670 
under where the straight part of the
triangle<00:02:12.850> is<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.820> overlapping

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
triangle is so that it's overlapping

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.699 
triangle is so that it's overlapping
like<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:18.840> you're<00:02:19.840> going<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.170> go<00:02:21.130> down<00:02:22.709> three

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
like this you're going to go down three

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:34.229 
like this you're going to go down three

times with that same color and then once

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.060 
times with that same color and then once
you<00:02:34.480> get<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.440> end<00:02:37.530> should<00:02:38.530> look<00:02:38.709> like<00:02:38.739> this

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
you get to the end should look like this

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.180 
you get to the end should look like this
I'm<00:02:39.640> going<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.000> take<00:02:40.209> one<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:42.010> band
