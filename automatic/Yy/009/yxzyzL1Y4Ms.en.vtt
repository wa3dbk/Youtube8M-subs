 I think you guessed it's okay 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.250
 really really great it makes me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.050
 really great pleasure to finally be able to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.930
 introduce you my very first video 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.490
 commented on call of duty black ops 3 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.840
 no i laugh call of duty black ops 2 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.250
 so good why I did not do 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.929
 rather video but just the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.390
 friends because I was not here I am 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.739
 really really sorry I have a very 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.420
 very big week at work 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.739
 as if by chance and you will tell me at 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.940
 when the odds of the spell I already had 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.399
 all planned I was going to see my little ones 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.050
 thumbnails and or not at work work 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.430
 work work but hey and then also 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.079
 there is also the code I told you that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.190
 I started the permit again 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.750
 today it is Saturday at the time of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.449
 choice the video Saturday morning I was at 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 code at 8am at 9.30am so 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.789
 frankly friends I really 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.289
 really did not have a minute for me 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.690
 this week but hey I hope that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.590
 it's the week that is going to be going 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.520
 say a lot more 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.870
 how could I tell you a lot 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.000
 lighter not really at the level of 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.110
 work is then at the level of the match 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 give you the information of course 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.830
 we are on the carrier map 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.170
 career or who said nothing as we want 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.180
 it's on an aircraft carrier and I'm playing 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.250
 matter by the team my class then my 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.170
 class I give it to you and excuse me 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.410
 I made a small picture so the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.660
 match is played with the pgw 57 at te number 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.270
 a I have light weight asset number 2 I 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.920
 evil is reached number 3 g dexterity 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.060
 so I really would not tell you to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.619
 what he's serving for now I do not have 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.080
 took the time to look at what they 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.040
 serve them and the trumps in fact I 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.440
 think I looked but I 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.810
 remember more like joker g overarm 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 on a moment that allows me to have a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.460
 main weapon as a secondary weapon 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.869
 so I chose the s12 oula s12 it's 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.369
 a shotgun that really do not like 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.440
 really not powerful I realized 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.850
 account from the first time I'm going 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.200
 use the shoot on a guy in the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.640
 back and I was really in the back of the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.320
 guy in the head 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.940
 eight markers so that frankly I 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.619
 do not understand me maybe after the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.550
 force says I'm going to unlock to be who 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.229
 will allow me to have a better 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.030
 power and for now it's 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.190
 really a shotgun I have that 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.959
 I will not recommend you here 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.100
 so at the level of black ops two of 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.390
 friends frankly I must confess 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.130
 that at the beginning when I first saw 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.590
 trailer I chatted with my friends from 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.209
 the church all that and I told them that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 frankly it really helps really 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.510
 weird because we are used to 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.250
 to play call of duty is going on 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.110
 in the past with the ancient wars 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.490
 all this with modern warfare 3 it's 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.770
 become we 'll say to + more recent but 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.000
 the torch with black ops from one goes from 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.120
 2009 Foreign not know how 1900 g10 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.099
 1972 to 2025 so see this is really 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.330
 really a huge leap in time and 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.620
 I thought it was really 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.599
 we change when I saw the trailer 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.260
 with bouncers that lets you see 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.549
 through the surface of 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.010
 I do not know if you've ever seen the 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.110
 chablais serve the super team 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.939
 sophisticated in color but 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.340
 I thought it really helps 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.269
 really weird because we do not have 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.010
 the habit of seeing the call of duty 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.689
 like that if we want a game going on 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.519
 in futuristic stuff like that a 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.500
 glass to the water and but frankly 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.090
 friends after testing back up 2 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 for about and I think I have 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.799
 played I had to maybe make a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.340
 thirty matches is it remains a 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.599
 call of duty 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.239
 this is true that the call of duty 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.220
 it's not really a thing 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.930
 different from usual it's a call of 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.670
 just right that the decorations we will say 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.319
 are different for example look 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.099
 this map 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.810
 that's what we're not used to 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.819
 play on an aircraft carrier with and lo 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.440
 what but how much is left? 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.310
 still excuse me a call of duty 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.379
 at the level of weapons 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.389
 what I remember is that really a 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.530
 horrible shooting rate that's really going 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.730
 want to horrible it's not in the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.670
 bad sense it's really going really 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.750
 super fast at the level of critics then 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.940
 frankly I do not like it at all 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.920
 system you have to make points for 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.440
 unlock how can I tell you 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.940
 it's to unlock the stuff we got 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.379
 what for example if I'm doing a kid 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.690
 it's 100 points then without me 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.370
 allow to do a little bit to 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.160
 right wasquehal the quay sprick in 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.139
 question but for example if I'm a 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.699
 guy if I do any assistance whatever 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.900
 it is to manage that I reject 50 points 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.849
 I do not even know if it's going to go up I 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.230
 remember it but it's more 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.819
 function of the kills that you do in 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.530
 function of the points you make 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.419
 yes at the same time you can tell me 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.560
 that's just as good because if you 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.000
 do a lot of insistence you can have 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.949
 killstreaks without killing people 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.230
 but frankly I prefer to have the 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.699
 modern warfare system 3 where we see 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.109
 frankly the little bars and 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.389
 kills people when seeing it 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.829
 when are we going to arrive at 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.180
 next tricolor that was really 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.519
 the system that I really appreciated 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.520
 pity he did not take for black 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.320
 ops 2 then at the level of the game in 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.460
 himself at the level of weapons it's true 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.349
 that the weapons are really really 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.460
 super powerful which is huge of air that 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.810
 called out 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.620
 ah shit forgets what's her name 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.990
 has missed I think it is 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.520
 first weapon of the class a jeans she 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.389
 really really really really 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.620
 strong 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.840
 that is, when you are going to shoot 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.720
 with its blades it's finished in one 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.520
 second the gas prices 45 ball yes that's 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.080
 really a weapon that here it is 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.789
 really beautiful and frankly I 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.500
 have not yet been able to test all 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.430
 weapons reels obviously you know 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.090
 what mistakes I tested at 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.099
 first sniper I tested the comece 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.750
 after I believe these experts 50 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.360
 unfortunately I did not have the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.120
 unlock because to unlock it 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.919
 these levels 52 for the use prod 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.979
 I had to learn from one of the classes by 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.630
 defect the scouts class so good 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.220
 at the level of style frankly friends 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.360
 it's going well for me 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.830
 I really enjoy watching 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.960
 there unfortunately I will take it 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.940
 but it will not do it I have a gameplay 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.280
 special sniper that you will see 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.960
 soon where I got myself I did a 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.970
 little quiet game at the level of 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.560
 style it's true that compared to 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.210
 the other blackops that really 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.370
 completely changed I've already done some 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.780
 costs of this body who hold that's what 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.909
 I told all face 2 blackhawks 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.870
 although I did not play it really 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.000
 a lot but I have already done everything at a 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.630
 fidelity quick scope and cleared little 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.039
 our scop 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.080
 frankly all this is on my computer 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.150
 you will see it soon at 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.430
 of the match let's analyze on the end 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.560
 I think so, there is about how much 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.020
 telly I watch her and a minute of 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.849
 gameplay to friends that really makes me 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.139
 really this need of finally being able to you 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.000
 present this first video I'm 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.349
 really sorry for the aunt at the level 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.750
 to adhere to the passage before I forget 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.270
 at the level of the team and xbrl of skiing and 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.740
 who wants to get started there he is me 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.050
 said that it would be nice if we could 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.400
 remake a small team as before and 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.300
 then in passing as I make videos 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.650
 we could do some small 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.300
 videos on my youtube channel if they are 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.470
 okay so 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.120
 I will see with him how to see 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.129
 how to have organized there I worked 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.210
 on an image for precisely the 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.280
 recruitments at the team level 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.300
 so all of this will be published soon 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.490
 on my facebook page 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.360
 I advise you to go are completed 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.870
 others to stay abreast of everything 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.860
 this and I'm finished in second place 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.169
 of my team I think unfortunately 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.310
 I did not do it with the sniper in 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.289
 do I do not know if I had never 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.050
 I have not seen at this tree 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.120
 keep it that is the tipp 95 of black ops 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.840
 that I think it's called the tipp 25 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.220
 something like that 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.780
 short friends I end up with a 15 8 1 88 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.729
 of five audience ratio I hope that 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.500
 this gameplay will have pleased you I tell you 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.419
 take care of yourself and friends 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.099
 still sorry for the tent frankly 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.909
 take care of yourself and see you next time 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.509
 for a new video 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.509
