00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
this if you look at this I can't really

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.620 
this if you look at this I can't really
tell<00:01:41.579> by<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> score<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> look<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
tell by the score but if you look at the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.940 
tell by the score but if you look at the
score<00:01:42.810> they've<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> demanding<00:01:43.530> lead<00:01:43.710> over

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
score they've got a demanding lead over

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
score they've got a demanding lead over
us<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:44.850> me<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.720> an<00:01:45.840> Asian

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
us so I'm me and in me and an Asian

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.389 
us so I'm me and in me and an Asian
invasion<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.860> conversing<00:01:47.159> we're

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
invasion are really conversing we're

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.649 
invasion are really conversing we're
saying<00:01:47.610> okay<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.479> what

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
saying okay what do we have to do what

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.690 
saying okay what do we have to do what
we<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.860> far<00:01:50.070> I'm<00:01:50.159> saying<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.579> got

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
we have to take so far I'm saying we got

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.399 
we have to take so far I'm saying we got
to<00:01:50.820> take<00:01:50.939> everything<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> back

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
to take everything just to get it back

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.219 
to take everything just to get it back
into<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> game<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> decide<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.869> hold

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
into the game so I decide if we can hold

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.289 
into the game so I decide if we can hold
a<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.890> flag<00:01:56.159> combination<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.790> got<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> hold<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
a to flag combination we got to hold a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.639 
a to flag combination we got to hold a
and<00:01:57.329> because<00:01:57.600> that's<00:01:57.930> probably<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.439> best

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and because that's probably the two best

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.969 
and because that's probably the two best
combos<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.729> hold<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.090> firing<00:02:00.329> range<00:02:00.630> because

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
combos to hold on firing range because

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
combos to hold on firing range because
if<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.159> holding<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.490> CB<00:02:02.850> combo<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
if you're holding a CB combo just that

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.170 
if you're holding a CB combo just that
building<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.740> front<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.250> B<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.820> just

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
building right in front of B is just

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.980 
building right in front of B is just
blocking<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:06.899> view<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> doesn't<00:02:07.619> give<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
blocking your view and doesn't give you

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.080 
blocking your view and doesn't give you
really<00:02:08.349> good<00:02:08.560> view<00:02:08.830> unless<00:02:09.520> you're<00:02:09.700> red<00:02:09.910> on

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
really good view unless you're red on

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.970 
really good view unless you're red on
top<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.450> flag<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.349> it's<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.530> bit<00:02:11.680> harder<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
top of the flag so it's a bit harder to

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.229 
top of the flag so it's a bit harder to
defend<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.459> which<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.790> why<00:02:12.910> I'd<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.060> to

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
defend it which is why I'd like to

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.640 
defend it which is why I'd like to
prefer<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> B<00:02:13.959> because<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.260> always<00:02:14.410> got

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
prefer the a B because you always got

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.370 
prefer the a B because you always got
this<00:02:15.160> wooden<00:02:15.580> tower<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:16.180> look<00:02:16.780> over<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.170> beef

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
this wooden tower to look over the beef

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.650 
this wooden tower to look over the beef
be<00:02:17.860> flag<00:02:18.099> in<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.849> know<00:02:18.970> it's<00:02:19.180> it's<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.510> bit

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
be flag in you know it's it's a bit

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.589 
be flag in you know it's it's a bit
easier<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:20.110> watch<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.770> B<00:02:20.860> at<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.069> same<00:02:21.250> time

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
easier to watch a and B at the same time

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.470 
easier to watch a and B at the same time
so<00:02:23.280> I'm<00:02:24.280> trying<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.849> do<00:02:24.970> whatever<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.390> can

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
so I'm trying to do whatever I can

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.330 
so I'm trying to do whatever I can
what's<00:02:25.989> going<00:02:26.200> through<00:02:26.349> my<00:02:26.410> go<00:02:27.010> what's<00:02:27.130> going

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
what's going through my go what's going

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.530 
what's going through my go what's going
through<00:02:27.489> my<00:02:27.519> mind<00:02:27.580> right<00:02:27.849> now<00:02:27.970> all<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.390> can

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
through my mind right now all I can

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.229 
through my mind right now all I can
think<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.260> capture<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.340> objective<00:02:31.000> that's

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
think of is capture the objective that's

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.759 
think of is capture the objective that's
all<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.870> things<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.410> are<00:02:32.500> running<00:02:32.680> through

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
all the things that are running through

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.009 
all the things that are running through
my<00:02:32.980> mind<00:02:33.130> right<00:02:33.250> now<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.700> defend<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.690> as<00:02:34.810> hard

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
my mind right now and defend it as hard

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.170 
my mind right now and defend it as hard
as<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.230> can<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.040> I'm<00:02:36.099> using<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.489> commando<00:02:36.940> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
as I can so I'm using the commando and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.300 
as I can so I'm using the commando and
I'm<00:02:37.480> picking<00:02:37.900> guys<00:02:37.989> off<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.769> see<00:02:38.950> now<00:02:39.130> what

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
I'm picking guys off you see now what

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.160 
I'm picking guys off you see now what
I'm<00:02:39.400> doing<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.760> I'm<00:02:39.819> paying<00:02:40.510> attention<00:02:40.930> very

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
I'm doing is I'm paying attention very

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.520 
I'm doing is I'm paying attention very
closely<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.220> UAV<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.989> what<00:02:43.989> really

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
closely to the UAV and what really

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.490 
closely to the UAV and what really
actually<00:02:44.739> my<00:02:44.980> radar<00:02:45.370> because<00:02:46.170> that's<00:02:47.170> telling

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
actually my radar because that's telling

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.960 
actually my radar because that's telling
me<00:02:47.590> where<00:02:47.739> my<00:02:47.830> teammates<00:02:48.190> are<00:02:48.340> spawning<00:02:48.610> where

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
me where my teammates are spawning where

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.850 
me where my teammates are spawning where
the<00:02:49.120> enemies<00:02:49.390> are<00:02:49.420> spawning<00:02:49.780> if<00:02:50.049> they<00:02:50.530> if<00:02:50.739> the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the enemies are spawning if they if the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.380 
the enemies are spawning if they if the
enemies<00:02:51.100> even<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> chance<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.940> flank<00:02:52.180> us

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
enemies even have a chance to flank us

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.350 
enemies even have a chance to flank us
so<00:02:52.980> that's<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.130> something<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.640> constantly

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
so that's just something you constantly

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.910 
so that's just something you constantly
constantly<00:02:55.600> need<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.080> realize<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> put

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
constantly need to realize and so I put

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.320 
constantly need to realize and so I put
a<00:02:56.950> motion<00:02:57.130> sensor<00:02:57.370> down<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.670> catch<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.150> ghost

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
a motion sensor down I catch the ghost

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.990 
a motion sensor down I catch the ghost
that's<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.110> huge<00:02:59.530> critical<00:02:59.769> moment<00:03:00.340> because<00:03:00.549> if

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
that's a huge critical moment because if

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.100 
that's a huge critical moment because if
I<00:03:01.450> die<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.900> here<00:03:03.090> eat<00:03:04.090> every<00:03:04.510> single<00:03:04.540> death

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
I die up here eat every single death

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.960 
I die up here eat every single death
that<00:03:05.799> I<00:03:05.830> get<00:03:06.099> from<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.370> point<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.819> is

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
that I get from this point on is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.830 
that I get from this point on is
critical<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:09.360> areas<00:03:10.360> where<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.540> could<00:03:10.750> have

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
critical so and areas where I could have

to work towards my dogs right now

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.319 
to work towards my dogs right now
because<00:04:01.209> as<00:04:01.389> you<00:04:02.380> guys<00:04:02.530> know<00:04:02.560> in<00:04:03.130> episode<00:04:03.609> 48<00:04:04.239> I

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
because as you guys know in episode 48 I

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.750 
because as you guys know in episode 48 I
think<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.930> explicitly<00:04:05.769> explained<00:04:06.519> why<00:04:06.700> the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
think I explicitly explained why the

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.590 
think I explicitly explained why the
dogs<00:04:07.120> are<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:08.200> better<00:04:08.609> kill<00:04:09.609> streak<00:04:09.819> to<00:04:10.060> use

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
dogs are a better kill streak to use

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.150 
dogs are a better kill streak to use
when<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.079> go<00:04:11.200> for<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.440> objective<00:04:11.889> and<00:04:12.069> you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
when you go for the objective and you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.250 
when you go for the objective and you
know<00:04:12.280> what<00:04:12.549> this<00:04:13.060> situation<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.810> objective

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
know what this situation the objective

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.070 
know what this situation the objective
is<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.440> only<00:04:14.650> thing<00:04:14.799> that's

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
is the only thing that's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.229 
is the only thing that's
on<00:04:15.140> my<00:04:15.260> mind<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:15.680> there<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.280> die<00:04:16.459> I<00:04:16.610> don't<00:04:17.030> care<00:04:17.180> i

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
on my mind so there I die I don't care i

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.759 
on my mind so there I die I don't care i
accidentally<00:04:17.810> call<00:04:17.989> my<00:04:18.200> chopper<00:04:18.530> while<00:04:18.680> I'm

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
accidentally call my chopper while I'm

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.710 
accidentally call my chopper while I'm
standing<00:04:19.010> there<00:04:19.310> but<00:04:19.820> I<00:04:19.850> think<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.450> think<00:04:20.480> I

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
standing there but I think and I think I

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.140 
standing there but I think and I think I
died<00:04:20.780> too<00:04:20.989> so<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:21.769> don't<00:04:22.370> know<00:04:22.430> silly<00:04:22.760> mistakes

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
died too so I don't know silly mistakes

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.730 
died too so I don't know silly mistakes
here<00:04:23.330> there<00:04:23.540> but<00:04:23.720> it's<00:04:23.840> always<00:04:24.080> in<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.290> heat

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
here there but it's always in the heat

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.690 
here there but it's always in the heat
of<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.920> moment<00:04:24.950> I<00:04:25.340> guess<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.670> got<00:04:25.910> caught<00:04:26.210> up<00:04:26.270> so

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
of the moment I guess I got caught up so

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.620 
of the moment I guess I got caught up so
right<00:04:28.700> now<00:04:28.730> what<00:04:29.030> I'm<00:04:29.150> doing<00:04:29.180> is<00:04:29.510> I'm

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
right now what I'm doing is I'm

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.840 
right now what I'm doing is I'm
explaining<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.620> invasion<00:04:31.040> where<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.580> enemies

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
explaining to invasion where the enemies

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.580 
explaining to invasion where the enemies
are<00:04:31.910> spawning<00:04:32.240> because<00:04:32.630> they're<00:04:33.080> spawning<00:04:33.350> at

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
are spawning because they're spawning at

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.170 
are spawning because they're spawning at
the<00:04:33.680> firing<00:04:33.980> range<00:04:34.070> backside<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.940> which

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
the firing range backside of a which

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.030 
the firing range backside of a which
means<00:04:35.500> obviously<00:04:36.500> we're<00:04:36.710> going<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.890> start

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
means obviously we're going to start

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.460 
means obviously we're going to start
spawning<00:04:37.280> at<00:04:37.520> sea<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:38.000> our<00:04:38.660> teammates<00:04:39.230> are

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
spawning at sea and our teammates are

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.620 
spawning at sea and our teammates are
going<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.800> start<00:04:40.040> flanking<00:04:40.850> around<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.270> bit<00:04:41.450> too

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
going to start flanking around a bit too

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.600 
going to start flanking around a bit too
far<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.470> in<00:04:42.530> order<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.770> compensate<00:04:43.130> for<00:04:43.460> that<00:04:43.490> I

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
far so in order to compensate for that I

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.760 
far so in order to compensate for that I

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480

get<00:05:35.540> there<00:05:35.780> holy<00:05:36.200> crap<00:05:36.560> if<00:05:37.400> we<00:05:37.610> lose<00:05:37.790> a<00:05:38.030> we

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
get there holy crap if we lose a we

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.210 
get there holy crap if we lose a we
might<00:05:39.080> actually<00:05:39.350> lose<00:05:39.650> this<00:05:39.860> game<00:05:40.070> because

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
might actually lose this game because

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.250 
might actually lose this game because
it's<00:05:40.430> very<00:05:40.850> very<00:05:41.150> possible<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.810> hold<00:05:41.990> an<00:05:42.080> AC

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
it's very very possible to hold an AC

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.050 
it's very very possible to hold an AC
split<00:05:42.710> on<00:05:42.830> this<00:05:42.980> map<00:05:43.190> although<00:05:43.640> it<00:05:43.910> may<00:05:44.000> be

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
split on this map although it may be

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.540 
split on this map although it may be
very<00:05:44.150> difficult<00:05:44.780> if<00:05:45.260> there<00:05:45.770> is<00:05:45.919> a<00:05:45.950> chance<00:05:46.400> that

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
very difficult if there is a chance that

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.950 
very difficult if there is a chance that
teams<00:05:47.480> can<00:05:47.600> pull<00:05:47.840> off<00:05:47.870> an<00:05:48.110> AC<00:05:48.230> split<00:05:48.680> and

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
teams can pull off an AC split and

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.600 
teams can pull off an AC split and
sometimes<00:05:50.960> that's<00:05:51.080> all<00:05:51.290> it<00:05:51.350> takes<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:51.950> win<00:05:52.400> the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
sometimes that's all it takes to win the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.180 
sometimes that's all it takes to win the
game<00:05:52.640> and<00:05:53.290> it<00:05:54.290> would<00:05:54.410> just<00:05:54.530> be<00:05:54.710> a<00:05:54.740> heartbreaker

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
game and it would just be a heartbreaker

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.470 
game and it would just be a heartbreaker
if<00:05:55.370> we<00:05:55.460> lost<00:05:55.640> this<00:05:55.820> game<00:05:55.910> let<00:05:56.150> me<00:05:56.240> tell<00:05:56.390> you
