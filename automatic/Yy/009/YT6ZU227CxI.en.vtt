00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.779
 carry particles by adding songs almost 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.799

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.369
 new ones 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.469
 I myself Julia often numbers the very neck drives with 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.569
 the songs of the authors are my parents are not very 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.539
 worthy love these songs very much 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:52.859
 like this 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.619
 i'm pretty simple one breath 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.769
 I hope they answered me 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.840
 time flew by 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.779
 it really is like a true prayer 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.319
 preaching I'm good 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.149

 so when I saw Alexei shirokov but also 

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:15.329
 a little bit originally 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.239
 was surprised

 that it seemed to me something not 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.919
 very much but in the center and that's not all for us 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.930
 I finally wanted a bright declaration 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.559
 with light 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:28.159
 and then I realized that like this spread 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.480

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.680
 surrounding
