00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.939 
really important for triathletes have a
super<00:00:56.489> arrow<00:00:56.899> triathlon<00:00:57.899> style<00:00:58.260> bike<00:00:58.469> it's<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
super arrow triathlon style bike it's a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.549 
super arrow triathlon style bike it's a
fantastic<00:00:59.640> machine<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.840> brakes<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.410> are

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
fantastic machine the brakes which are

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889 
fantastic machine the brakes which are
behind<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.100> forks<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.210> more

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
behind the forks which is more

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.109 
behind the forks which is more
aerodynamic<00:01:04.820> also<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.330> rear<00:01:06.570> brake<00:01:06.900> is

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
aerodynamic also the the rear brake is

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.179 
aerodynamic also the the rear brake is
enclosed<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> frame<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.200> reduce<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
enclosed into the frame to reduce the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
enclosed into the frame to reduce the
drag<00:01:11.880> as<00:01:12.299> well<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:13.380> has<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.890> thick<00:01:15.049> body

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
drag as well it has a really thick body

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
drag as well it has a really thick body
here<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.740> makes<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> bike<00:01:17.340> extra

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
here you know makes the bike extra

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
here you know makes the bike extra
strong<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.479> especially<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.439> me<00:01:19.560> being<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
strong or especially for me being a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.039

bigger<00:01:20.040> guy<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:21.119> me<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.420> year<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> chose

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
bigger guy so for me this year I chose

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.920 
bigger guy so for me this year I chose
to<00:01:22.650> write<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:23.009> oval<00:01:23.369> base<00:01:23.580> bar<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> new<00:01:24.720> bar

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to write an oval base bar it's a new bar

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.070 
to write an oval base bar it's a new bar
that's<00:01:25.200> come<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.090> flatter

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080
