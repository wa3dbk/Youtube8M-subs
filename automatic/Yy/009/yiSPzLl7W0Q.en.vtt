 the staff then here we are here the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.970
 Preparations for the trip is this here is the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
 camera that I'm going to use even in the dose of r 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.679
 520 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 the one that's going to do some tests then 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.230
 by the way a very good camera though 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.279
 has many functions here that have not yet 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 have a lot of people but you can also use 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.970
 here is our updated gps right 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.750
 the maps include the home on the basis of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 radar 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.710
 our friend called to us there 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 following the suggestion a good oscar left 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:47.450
 of that land that also wakes up 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:51.120
 so here's the key 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.920
 xavi and along with the brand put here 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 engage him to hide in 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.940
 guaratinga in the car here a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.240
 bit of notes that goes along with 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.950
 here is a little box with 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 some basic thing here is 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:21.810
 the box the technological chargers 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:26.759
 with the cameras with this card 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:31.979
 an adapter memory with the taxinha 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:36.090
 business drinks take the pets on 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.759
 hangu fruit if something here to be 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.259
 unnecessary stops following the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:48.479
 suggestion is a chisel where you can freeze 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:54.840
 and put in there that help should 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:59.960
 keep quiet always fix some 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.960
 but that's it, right? 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:11.300
 a person continuing here the first 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.930
 part of the video I used this only camcorder 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.099

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.090
 this is the waterproof here 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.180
 Only those who film underneath use it 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.519
 mind to use this sony piece that I think 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.319
 which is great that raises the filming 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.599
 some things yes the walks of such 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.610
 continue the video preparations 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:40.220
