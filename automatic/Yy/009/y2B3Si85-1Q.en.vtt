00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:16.289
 they both want the cushion first 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 which was that coincided there is a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.859
 explanation that the legs have something 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.590
 that does not seem very rational however 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.930
 several disagree here because in the type 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.670
 of double does not justify the case that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.189
 when we made the first call and the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.990
 first with some very high income it happened what 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.990
 next please the toy image 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.769
 12 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.199
 it ended up falling 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:17.229
 and like listening to the second one because 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.119
 despite everything he said dead respect but 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.890
 for me who only own feels a lot 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.820
 everything heard was talking about 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.820
 let go 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.390
 just like yes 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.760
 the video 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.250
 the artists 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.219
 that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.670
 very like a statue of the person to the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.670
 what is 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.300
 but it was not here 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.290
 that we are already here like this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 so we have reason never never 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.500
 plus
