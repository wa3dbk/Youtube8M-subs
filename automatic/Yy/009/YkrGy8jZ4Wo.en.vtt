00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
then with a catch basin underneath go

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:54.840 
then with a catch basin underneath go
ahead<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.260> break<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> guy<00:00:37.920> free

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.069

you're gonna drain about three and a
half<00:00:57.110> liters<00:00:57.800> from<00:00:58.100> this<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:58.579> just<00:00:58.790> go<00:00:58.940> ahead

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
half liters from this so just go ahead

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.420 
half liters from this so just go ahead
and<00:00:59.239> let<00:00:59.360> it<00:00:59.450> finish<00:00:59.570> up

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.060 

now<00:01:05.030> because<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:05.990> plug<00:01:06.230> is<00:01:06.260> still<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:06.920> good

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
now because this plug is still in good

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.470 
now because this plug is still in good
condition<00:01:07.130> I'm<00:01:07.610> going<00:01:07.760> to<00:01:07.820> be<00:01:07.880> using<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.240> again

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
condition I'm going to be using it again

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.940 
condition I'm going to be using it again
but<00:01:08.990> if<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.140> take<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.350> look<00:01:09.620> you<00:01:09.770> can<00:01:09.920> actually

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
but if you take a look you can actually

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.560

see<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:10.400> is<00:01:10.490> a<00:01:10.520> magnetic<00:01:10.910> plug<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.480> it's

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
see it is a magnetic plug and it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.600 
see it is a magnetic plug and it's
collected<00:01:11.990> some<00:01:12.260> shaving<00:01:12.980> some<00:01:13.160> sort<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.400> dark

how much fluid you drained from the
transmission<00:02:04.260> we<00:02:04.950> drained<00:02:05.220> 4.1<00:02:06.030> quarts<00:02:06.450> or

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
transmission we drained 4.1 quarts or

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.500 
transmission we drained 4.1 quarts or
about<00:02:06.960> 3.9<00:02:07.860> liters<00:02:08.490> so<00:02:09.060> we're<00:02:09.149> going<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.330> pour

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
about 3.9 liters so we're going to pour

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.480 
about 3.9 liters so we're going to pour
exactly<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.229> back<00:02:10.590> into<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.100> dipstick

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
exactly that back into this dipstick

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.430 
exactly that back into this dipstick
tube<00:02:11.700> we're<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.600> using<00:02:12.840> some<00:02:13.050> liqui

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
tube we're going to be using some liqui

tube we're going to be using some liqui
moly<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.830> tf3<00:02:14.310> transmission<00:02:15.150> fluid<00:02:15.450> these<00:02:16.440> are

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
moly a tf3 transmission fluid these are

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
moly a tf3 transmission fluid these are
one<00:02:16.800> liter<00:02:17.070> each<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.940> we're<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> use

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
one liter each so we're going to use

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:52.100 
one liter each so we're going to use
about<00:02:18.450> 3.9<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.860> them

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.059 

now<00:02:53.110> I've<00:02:53.230> measured<00:02:53.410> out<00:02:53.590> about<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.860> hundred

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
now I've measured out about a hundred

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.979 
now I've measured out about a hundred
milliliters<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.880> this<00:02:55.000> last<00:02:55.209> one<00:02:55.420> so<00:02:55.840> we're

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
milliliters of this last one so we're

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.970 
milliliters of this last one so we're
doing<00:02:56.110> exactly<00:02:56.640> 3.9<00:02:57.640> liters<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:02.590> clean<00:03:02.830> up

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
doing exactly 3.9 liters just clean up

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.780 
doing exactly 3.9 liters just clean up
if<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.640> spilled<00:03:03.970> any<00:03:08.430> under<00:03:09.430> place<00:03:09.610> your

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
if you spilled any under place your

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.400 
if you spilled any under place your
dipstick<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:13.239> because<00:03:13.569> you're<00:03:13.690> only<00:03:13.840> flushing

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
dipstick so because you're only flushing

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.830 
dipstick so because you're only flushing
out<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> portion<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.730> fluid<00:03:16.180> you'll<00:03:16.630> want

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
out a portion of the fluid you'll want

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.449 
out a portion of the fluid you'll want
to<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.140> same<00:03:17.319> procedure<00:03:17.500> in<00:03:17.980> about<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> week

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
to do the same procedure in about a week

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.580 
to do the same procedure in about a week
after<00:03:18.700> some<00:03:19.030> regular<00:03:19.360> driving<00:03:19.810> some<00:03:20.349> people

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
after some regular driving some people

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.259 
after some regular driving some people
will<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:20.800> it<00:03:20.920> three<00:03:21.220> or<00:03:21.250> four<00:03:21.370> times<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.150> let

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
will do it three or four times so let

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.330 
will do it three or four times so let
the<00:03:22.390> percentage<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.930> new<00:03:23.230> fluid<00:03:23.530> -<00:03:23.739> old<00:03:23.920> fluid

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
the percentage of new fluid - old fluid

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.449 
the percentage of new fluid - old fluid
is<00:03:24.459> much<00:03:25.000> much<00:03:25.239> higher<00:03:25.540> about<00:03:25.840> 96<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.709> 4%

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
is much much higher about 96 to 4%

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.100 
is much much higher about 96 to 4%
I<00:03:28.269> find<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.019> do<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.410> twice<00:03:29.799> every

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
I find that if I do it twice every

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.840 
I find that if I do it twice every
30,000<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.260> 50,000<00:03:32.920> miles<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.400> tends<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.700> do

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
30,000 to 50,000 miles it tends to do

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.699 
30,000 to 50,000 miles it tends to do
pretty<00:03:34.120> well<00:03:34.239> but<00:03:35.110> definitely<00:03:35.500> check<00:03:35.680> with

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
pretty well but definitely check with
