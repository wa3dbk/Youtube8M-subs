the<00:02:32.180> future<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.900> what<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.409> do<00:02:33.470> without

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the future and what can I do without

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.470 
the future and what can I do without
skating<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.879> mean<00:02:35.030> okay

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
skating I mean okay

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.210 
skating I mean okay
there<00:02:35.810> there<00:02:36.200> can<00:02:36.440> be<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.650> life<00:02:36.950> without

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
there there can be a life without

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.030 
there there can be a life without
skating<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.120> that's<00:02:38.480> not<00:02:38.750> why<00:02:38.959> what<00:02:39.349> I<00:02:39.379> wanted

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
skating but that's not why what I wanted

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.420 
skating but that's not why what I wanted
so<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:41.209> was<00:02:41.840> praying<00:02:42.170> every<00:02:42.739> night

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.340 

Tania's<00:02:48.430> Shevchenko<00:02:49.090> would<00:02:49.330> be<00:02:49.480> last<00:02:49.750> escaped

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350
