00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello i am rijn 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.769
 you may wonder what is he wearing 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.320
 do it well I want to get into it later 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.039
 sitting on my couch at the moment 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.779
 my 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.849
 lawn mower does the job and for that 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.670
 I therefore a robot lawn mower 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.869
 yes and there you have to prepare 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.980
 but no more worries inside 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.990
 to 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.910
 Well what you see now is that I have this thread 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.170
 about the tile a lay that own only 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.970
 but for this video 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.100
 Normally you would be under 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.350
 can cross the tile and then 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.850
 then pin and where you 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.220
 Of course you have to pay attention that you have the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.940
 tighten the thread and before you 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.940
 the pin in the grass lets me do it 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.729
 So now and there you will say 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.860
 maybe yes yes i still see wire 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.879
 which will soon be completely gone disappeared 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.830
 your lawn 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.299
 so you see nothing at all 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.000
 nobody notices that you are not 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.869
 mow the grass yourself but you 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.189
 robotic lawnmower does that 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:06.260
 well the distance you are between the 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.220
 handling pins is about one and a half 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.659
 meter 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.310
 but how the entire installation is 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.689
 work that you see in the following 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 movie 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.619
 the first step is to determine the 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.909
 best location for the base station 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.310
 your lawn 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.259
 place it on the main lawn after 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.179
 advise on the base station on a 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.070
 shadow spot and the backyard 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.400
 so that it is not visible from the 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.190
 public road 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.000
 do not place it on a slope 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.070
 close by and help or at inspire beginnings 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 at the base station 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.920
 draw wire end with the wire connector 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 from the plastic package 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.280
 ground the wire 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.660
 stuck at the place where a basic social 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 has to come 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.340
 keep about 30 centimeters of wire 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.690
 to finish the wire installation 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.240
 complete 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.660
 lay the thread loosely to the left along the gas 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660
 ignited 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.960
 start installing the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.729
 perimeter wire every few meters and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.240
 in the lawn corners wire pins too 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.240
 place 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.849
 used robo ruler to get the correct one 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.849
 get away from the healthy edge 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.299
 use the short distance from the oven 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.129
 ruler when no obstacle 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.590
 use the entire length of the red 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.590
 ruler for installation along the wall 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.190
 we advise to bend the thread 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.769
 not to install below 45 degrees 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.629
 below 90 degrees 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.170
 pull the thread tight before attaching the pin 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.299
 let down in the ground it is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.810
 Need the pin head 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.159
 to be hit below the grass level 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.650
 remember to make the first thread 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.599
 installation before testing the wire 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.579
 permanently fixed with extra pins 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.799
 use the drobo ruler for one 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.730
 accurate placement of the wire as you 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.739
 to get obstacles in the gas ignited their work 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.720
 if the edges or obstacles are too low or 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.639
 not sturdy enough to get through the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.040
 robomop bumpers to be noticed 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.620
 then use the perimeter wire 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.950
 to a perimeter island to the obstacles 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.950
 to make 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.670
 the two wires that lead to it 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.520
 perimeter island must run parallel 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.710
 touch each other use the same method 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.910
 for example, flower beds and young ones 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.710
 trees 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.020
 after the perimeter wire is everywhere 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.420
 tightened, twist the two loose threads 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.040
 end at the base station together 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.720
 Use the same thread pins to put them in 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.490
 to confirm the ground 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.620
 cut the wire ends without the green ones 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.920
 connector of equal length with others 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.470
 thread ends and turn them over 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.310
 strip 6 mm insulation from the wire ends 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.020
 off 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.730
 fix it in the opening of the 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.600
 green connector it in small 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.400
 screwdriver 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.140
 tighten the screw so that the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.140
 perimeter wire is tight
