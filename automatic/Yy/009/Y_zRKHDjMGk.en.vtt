00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.890
 you asked me to record you more videos of 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.290
 meals so good I show you what 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.130
 I have to eat 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 I start with my first dish which is a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.990
 bowl of chopped lettuce salad and the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.810
 I have put together with rice 70 grams of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.529
 raw rice 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.300
 and you follow me of other videos you will see that 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.480
 the amounts are now a little bit more 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.090
 high because I'm in volume phase 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.140
 so nothing that amounts like 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.470
 always then you have to adjust them to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.440
 your needs in the 70 grams of 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.589
 something are heavy in raw worth and the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.050
 lettuce without yielding normal and analyze it not 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.339
 I'm going to put all this we want for 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:59.110
 here that starts telling you I have corn 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:03.409
 what is this bonduel that is bio without 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.150
 sugars added as you see I put it very 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.520
 little amount because the index 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.290
 corn glycemic is quite elevated 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.950
 although good I just now I get to 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.490
 train here is cut into slices 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.820
 two sticks of crab sticks that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.280
 they are from cristian's state 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.990
 how good you already know that in comparison 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.140
 with other brands because they have less 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.610
 fats and less carbohydrates and fewer sugars 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.050
 pepper green pepper red pepper 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.850
 yellow onion and half tomato pear and 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.850
 nothing I'm going to put everything 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.909
 and well, as you can see, this is another 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.350
 thing already looks better is a first 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.720
 quite consistent term and that only 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.000
 it's pretty full with him 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.150
 and I'm going to put a little salt and 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.430
 post tonic that has that 70% less 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.760
 of sodium with aromatic herbs because 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.220
 It gives very good flavor 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.729
 I brought it to you so you can see the little touch 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.610
 this green video and maybe a trickle of 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.330
 vinegar but nothing more oil or anything 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.150
 of that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.630
 this would be my first dish 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.230
 and I have it done I have today 150 grams of 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.480
 entraña touches me beef you know that 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.210
 once or twice a week you can 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 include red meats shows you in 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.030
 our diet 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.300
 What I usually do is ask the 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.270
 butcher the leanest cuts possible 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.360
 and still style when I get home with the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.670
 scissors I dedicate myself to contribute everything 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.700
 the edges of fat and all that has 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.720
 because I try to avoid the excess of 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.910
 the unsaturated my diet and nothing else 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.740
 If you have not tasted the entraña I 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.400
 encourage because it is a very juicy meat 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.500
 It's very good I have not put good salt 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.000
 it's as such I have not put a little bit of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.950
 salt without 0% sodium and nothing more guys than 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.690
 this is all that I hope you have 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.880
 liked as always in the box 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.340
 information left us all the information 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.340
 nutritional and we give each other a little kiss
