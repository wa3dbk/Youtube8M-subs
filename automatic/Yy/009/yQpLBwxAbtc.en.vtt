it but this is the way I know how to do

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.650 
it but this is the way I know how to do
it<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.280> it's<00:00:37.760> pretty<00:00:37.970> quick<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.270> pretty<00:00:38.420> easy

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
it and it's pretty quick and pretty easy

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.689 
it and it's pretty quick and pretty easy
so<00:00:39.290> we're<00:00:39.530> going<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.710> go<00:00:39.739> ahead<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:40.400> jump

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
so we're going to go ahead and jump

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.689 
so we're going to go ahead and jump
right<00:00:40.910> into<00:00:41.449> it<00:00:41.680> get<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:42.710> new<00:00:42.980> layer<00:00:43.220> we're

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
right into it get a new layer we're

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:52.869 
right into it get a new layer we're
going<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.909> type<00:00:44.239> fire<00:00:45.280> make<00:00:46.280> it<00:00:46.430> white<00:00:51.879> going

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
going to type fire make it white going

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.780 
going to type fire make it white going
to<00:00:52.940> line<00:00:53.089> it<00:00:53.120> up<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.750> center<00:00:54.199> just<00:00:54.769> just<00:00:55.489> me

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
to line it up in the center just just me

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.390 
to line it up in the center just just me
too<00:00:56.000> but<00:00:56.420> for<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:57.290> tutorial<00:00:57.350> for<00:00:58.040> this<00:00:58.070> way

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
too but for this tutorial for this way

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.130 
too but for this tutorial for this way
that<00:00:58.580> I<00:00:58.640> do<00:00:58.699> it<00:00:59.000> make<00:00:59.239> sure<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.479> have<00:00:59.659> the<00:00:59.690> text

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
that I do it make sure you have the text

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.360 
that I do it make sure you have the text
where<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.350> want<00:01:00.559> to<00:01:00.710> be<00:01:00.830> because<00:01:01.010> you<00:01:01.220> are

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
where you want to be because you are

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.590 
where you want to be because you are
going<00:01:01.549> to<00:01:01.610> merge<00:01:01.760> layers<00:01:02.030> with<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.360> black

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
going to merge layers with the black

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.090 
going to merge layers with the black
behind<00:01:02.839> it<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:03.470> we're<00:01:03.589> gonna<00:01:03.680> go<00:01:03.799> ahead<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:03.979> do

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
behind it so we're gonna go ahead and do

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.350 
behind it so we're gonna go ahead and do
that<00:01:04.129> right<00:01:04.309> now<00:01:04.460> just<00:01:04.729> go<00:01:04.850> ahead<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.030> Virgil

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
that right now just go ahead and Virgil

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.990 
that right now just go ahead and Virgil
artifice<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.870> control<00:01:06.350> II<00:01:06.850> automaton<00:01:07.850> merge

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
artifice of control II automaton merge

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.770 
artifice of control II automaton merge
the<00:01:08.090> two<00:01:08.210> layers<00:01:08.420> together<00:01:09.970> we<00:01:10.970> are<00:01:11.180> going<00:01:11.510> to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
the two layers together we are going to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.080 
the two layers together we are going to
image<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:13.750> we<00:01:14.750> can<00:01:14.960> rotate<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:16.060> 90<00:01:17.060> degrees

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
image and we can rotate it 90 degrees

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.050 
image and we can rotate it 90 degrees
clockwise<00:01:17.650> so<00:01:18.650> that's<00:01:19.040> like<00:01:19.220> Texas<00:01:19.670> sideways

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
clockwise so that's like Texas sideways

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
clockwise so that's like Texas sideways
when<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.810> go<00:01:20.930> into<00:01:21.140> filters<00:01:21.620> arm<00:01:22.600> stylize<00:01:23.600> and

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
when I go into filters arm stylize and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.260 
when I go into filters arm stylize and
down<00:01:24.230> to<00:01:24.380> wind<00:01:24.650> we're<00:01:25.400> going<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.550> do<00:01:25.790> it<00:01:26.090> on

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
down to wind we're going to do it on

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.960 
down to wind we're going to do it on
wind<00:01:26.930> we're<00:01:27.170> going<00:01:27.290> to<00:01:27.380> go<00:01:27.440> from<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.760> left

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
wind we're going to go from to the left

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.480 
wind we're going to go from to the left
or<00:01:29.270> from<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.480> left<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.230> wind<00:01:30.470> fire<00:01:31.310> those

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
or from the left so the wind fire those

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.100 
or from the left so the wind fire those
games<00:01:31.640> coming<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.030> top<00:01:32.210> now<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:33.020> do

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
games coming to the top now you can do

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.090 
games coming to the top now you can do
this<00:01:33.230> on<00:01:33.410> any<00:01:34.160> way<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.880> can<00:01:35.380> for<00:01:36.380> instance<00:01:36.680> say

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
this on any way you can for instance say

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.460 
this on any way you can for instance say
if<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:38.060> wanted<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.990> could<00:01:39.110> have<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.410> go

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
if you wanted to you could have it go

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.660 
if you wanted to you could have it go
like<00:01:39.620> this<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:40.670> arm<00:01:41.980> the<00:01:42.980> fire<00:01:43.310> will<00:01:43.550> look

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
like this and so arm the fire will look

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.890 
like this and so arm the fire will look
like<00:01:43.790> it's<00:01:43.940> coming<00:01:44.000> off<00:01:44.300> a<00:01:44.330> different<00:01:44.660> way

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
like it's coming off a different way

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.560 
like it's coming off a different way
kind<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.230> up<00:01:45.320> like<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.770> but<00:01:46.070> tutorial<00:01:47.030> I'm

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
kind of up like that but tutorial I'm

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.200 
kind of up like that but tutorial I'm
gonna<00:01:47.750> leave<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.020> like<00:01:48.050> here<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.880> go<00:01:50.060> down

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
gonna leave it like here so go down

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.010 
gonna leave it like here so go down
filter<00:01:50.680> stylize<00:01:51.680> wind<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.700> do<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:53.660> and<00:01:53.780> then

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
filter stylize wind and do it and then

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.050 
filter stylize wind and do it and then
if<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.170> press<00:01:54.320> ctrl<00:01:54.710> f<00:01:54.890> arm<00:01:55.310> it'll<00:01:55.850> do<00:01:55.940> the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
if you press ctrl f arm it'll do the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.910 
if you press ctrl f arm it'll do the
same<00:01:56.210> style<00:01:56.450> again<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:56.930> so<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.530> make<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.830> look

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
same style again and so to make it look

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.760 
same style again and so to make it look
like<00:01:58.040> it's<00:01:58.190> coming<00:01:58.220> off<00:01:58.580> quite<00:01:59.740> higher<00:02:00.740> I

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
like it's coming off quite higher I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.830 
like it's coming off quite higher I
guess<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:01.490> look<00:02:01.790> bigger<00:02:02.090> flames<00:02:02.360> is<00:02:02.630> what's

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
guess so look bigger flames is what's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.130 
guess so look bigger flames is what's
going<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.170> be<00:02:03.380> armed<00:02:04.810> we're<00:02:05.810> going<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.020> go

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
going to be armed we're going to go

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.259 
going to be armed we're going to go
filter<00:02:07.599> distort<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:09.289> ripple<00:02:10.250> we're<00:02:11.090> going<00:02:11.180> to

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
filter distort and ripple we're going to

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.210 
filter distort and ripple we're going to
go<00:02:11.390> down<00:02:11.540> to<00:02:11.569> medium<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.260> change<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
go down to medium and change the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.119 
go down to medium and change the
percentage<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.909> 30<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.830> will<00:02:16.010> add

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
percentage to 30 and this will add

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.490 
percentage to 30 and this will add
little<00:02:16.370> ripples<00:02:16.819> as<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.420> name<00:02:17.629> it<00:02:17.840> called<00:02:18.110> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
little ripples as the name it called to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.699 
little ripples as the name it called to
make<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.739> look<00:02:18.860> more<00:02:18.920> fire<00:02:19.849> like<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:21.349> then

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
make it look more fire like and then

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.739 
make it look more fire like and then
when<00:02:21.829> you<00:02:21.950> go<00:02:22.040> filter<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.030> same<00:02:23.239> ripple

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:23.749 
when you go filter do the same ripple

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:24.740 
when you go filter do the same ripple
again

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
again

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.630 
again
instead<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.160> going<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:27.450> do<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:27.990> large

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
instead we are going to do it on a large

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.760 
instead we are going to do it on a large
with<00:02:29.640> forty<00:02:30.210> percent<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:30.840> what<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.380> does<00:02:31.710> is

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
with forty percent and what that does is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.850 
with forty percent and what that does is
it<00:02:32.010> make<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.310> look<00:02:32.520> like<00:02:32.670> there's<00:02:32.850> um<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:34.380> more

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it make it look like there's um the more

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.850 
it make it look like there's um the more
the<00:02:35.100> ripples<00:02:35.400> look<00:02:35.550> more<00:02:36.230> unnatural<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.680> come

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the ripples look more unnatural to come

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.090 
the ripples look more unnatural to come
out<00:02:38.010> more<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.320> always<00:02:40.560> change<00:02:40.800> them

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
out more and you can always change them

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.230 
out more and you can always change them
to<00:02:41.250> make<00:02:41.370> them<00:02:41.490> little<00:02:41.760> smaller<00:02:42.860> now<00:02:43.860> whatever

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
to make them little smaller now whatever

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.160 
to make them little smaller now whatever
i'm<00:02:45.240> actually<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.690> leave<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.959> right

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
i'm actually going to leave it right

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.170 
i'm actually going to leave it right
there<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.770> 28<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.670> has<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:47.970> bit<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
there on 28 so it has a little bit of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.840 
there on 28 so it has a little bit of
ripple<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:49.020> like<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.520> weird<00:02:50.520> one

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
ripple to it but not like a weird one

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.750 
ripple to it but not like a weird one
that<00:02:51.060> kind<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.330> messes<00:02:51.570> with<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:52.550> all<00:02:53.550> right

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
that kind of messes with it all right

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.010 
that kind of messes with it all right
then<00:02:53.940> we're<00:02:54.030> gonna<00:02:54.120> go<00:02:54.270> ahead<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.510> bring<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.990> a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
then we're gonna go ahead and bring in a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.290 
then we're gonna go ahead and bring in a
blur<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.459> we're<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.270> a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
blur to this we're just going to do a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300 
blur to this we're just going to do a
cartoon<00:02:57.750> blur<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.170> point<00:02:58.620> eight<00:02:58.860> anywhere

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
cartoon blur on point eight anywhere

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400 
cartoon blur on point eight anywhere
from<00:02:59.340> point<00:02:59.790> A<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.239> 1.5<00:03:00.810> depending<00:03:01.260> on

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
from point A to like 1.5 depending on

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.530 
from point A to like 1.5 depending on
what<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.830> want<00:03:02.130> arm<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:04.170> change<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:05.420> I'm<00:03:06.420> just

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
what you want arm to change it I'm just

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.840 
what you want arm to change it I'm just
going<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:06.989> it<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:07.140> point<00:03:07.380> eight<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.550> we<00:03:08.640> can

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
going to do it on point eight and we can

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.340 
going to do it on point eight and we can
go<00:03:09.060> ahead<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.570> rotate<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.010> canvas<00:03:11.310> back<00:03:12.350> so

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
go ahead and rotate the canvas back so

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.900 
go ahead and rotate the canvas back so
what's<00:03:13.530> back<00:03:13.709> up<00:03:13.739> straight<00:03:14.400> arm<00:03:16.400> all<00:03:17.400> right

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
what's back up straight arm all right

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.470 
what's back up straight arm all right
I'm<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.300> go<00:03:18.360> ahead<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.690> bring<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.440> a

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
I'm going to go ahead and bring in a

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.740 
I'm going to go ahead and bring in a
levels<00:03:21.480> me<00:03:21.810> fine<00:03:22.080> work<00:03:22.290> have<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.280> at<00:03:26.420> let<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.540> go

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
levels me fine work have it at let it go

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.729 
levels me fine work have it at let it go
oh<00:03:29.120> yeah<00:03:30.120> okay<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.350> we're<00:03:31.470> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.650> go<00:03:31.680> ahead

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:39.800 
oh yeah okay so we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:32.070> whiten<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.140> little<00:03:34.170> bit<00:03:38.780> not<00:03:39.780> too

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
and whiten it just a little bit not too

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.539 
and whiten it just a little bit not too
much<00:03:40.140> though<00:03:40.830> just<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.880> little<00:03:42.150> bit<00:03:46.549> just

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
much though just a little bit just

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.740 
much though just a little bit just
measure<00:03:47.760> your<00:03:48.000> level<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> little<00:03:48.420> bit<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.600> want

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
measure your level a little bit you want

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.449 
measure your level a little bit you want
to<00:03:48.810> get<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.930> nice<00:03:49.110> wife<00:03:49.440> will<00:03:49.709> have<00:03:49.799> some<00:03:50.100> still

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
to get a nice wife will have some still

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.539 
to get a nice wife will have some still
great<00:03:50.820> neutrals<00:03:51.660> in<00:03:51.720> there<00:03:51.900> too<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.549> think

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
great neutrals in there too I think

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.180 
great neutrals in there too I think
that'll<00:03:53.730> be<00:03:53.820> good<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.920> then<00:03:55.920> we're<00:03:56.040> going<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that'll be good and then we're going to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.170 
that'll be good and then we're going to
go<00:03:56.250> into<00:03:56.340> our<00:03:56.850> image<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.480> go<00:03:58.370> or<00:03:59.370> our<00:03:59.880> layer

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
go into our image and go or our layer

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.120 
go into our image and go or our layer
actually<00:04:00.750> I'm<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:00.989> hurt<00:04:01.260> your<00:04:02.100> image

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
actually I'm so hurt your image

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.960 
actually I'm so hurt your image
adjustments<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.299> then<00:04:03.480> go<00:04:03.690> down<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:04.970> make

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
adjustments and then go down to make

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.310 
adjustments and then go down to make
sure<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.180> have<00:04:06.329> your<00:04:06.360> file<00:04:06.630> like<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.110> fire

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
sure you have your file like the fire

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.390 
sure you have your file like the fire
layer<00:04:08.190> selected<00:04:08.810> so<00:04:09.810> image<00:04:10.220> adjustments<00:04:11.220> and

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
layer selected so image adjustments and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.640 
layer selected so image adjustments and
down<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.760> selective<00:04:12.180> color<00:04:12.470> you're<00:04:13.470> going<00:04:13.590> to

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
down to selective color you're going to

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
just take the layer and set it to screen

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.050 
just take the layer and set it to screen
fire<00:06:20.259> layer<00:06:20.530> to<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.800> screen<00:06:21.159> and<00:06:21.370> for<00:06:21.819> most<00:06:21.940> of

fire layer to the screen and for most of
you<00:06:22.240> know<00:06:22.440> what<00:06:23.440> screen<00:06:23.770> does<00:06:23.979> it<00:06:24.219> just<00:06:24.370> takes

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
you know what screen does it just takes

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.300 
you know what screen does it just takes
out<00:06:24.669> the<00:06:24.699> blacks<00:06:25.090> from<00:06:25.569> the<00:06:25.810> image<00:06:25.960> so<00:06:26.830> instead

out the blacks from the image so instead

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.999 
out the blacks from the image so instead
of<00:06:27.370> doing<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:28.289> I'm<00:06:29.289> gonna<00:06:29.469> show<00:06:29.590> you<00:06:29.620> as<00:06:29.830> why

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
of doing that I'm gonna show you as why

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.040 
of doing that I'm gonna show you as why
you<00:06:30.069> don't<00:06:30.370> do<00:06:30.490> that<00:06:30.639> if<00:06:31.479> you<00:06:31.570> were<00:06:31.690> to<00:06:31.750> press

you don't do that if you were to press

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.810 
you don't do that if you were to press
screen<00:06:32.500> which<00:06:32.889> takes<00:06:33.130> a<00:06:33.219> black<00:06:33.400> side<00:06:33.639> of<00:06:33.760> the

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
screen which takes a black side of the

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.050 
screen which takes a black side of the
image<00:06:33.940> you<00:06:34.300> can't<00:06:34.810> really<00:06:34.930> see<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.409> fire

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
image you can't really see the fire

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.180 
image you can't really see the fire
over<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.360> text<00:06:37.200> which<00:06:37.350> you<00:06:37.380> can<00:06:37.680> well<00:06:37.980> if<00:06:38.070> you

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
over the text which you can well if you

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.680 
over the text which you can well if you
wanted<00:06:38.460> I<00:06:38.580> thought<00:06:38.880> that<00:06:38.970> you<00:06:39.030> wanted<00:06:39.300> then

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
wanted I thought that you wanted then

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.050 
wanted I thought that you wanted then
you<00:06:39.810> can<00:06:39.930> do<00:06:40.020> that<00:06:40.169> on<00:06:40.610> but<00:06:41.610> doesn't<00:06:41.850> look<00:06:41.940> like

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
you can do that on but doesn't look like

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.260 
you can do that on but doesn't look like
the<00:06:42.150> Texas<00:06:42.480> actually<00:06:42.900> on<00:06:43.350> fire<00:06:43.800> or<00:06:44.669> if<00:06:45.150> you

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
the Texas actually on fire or if you

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.210 
the Texas actually on fire or if you
were<00:06:45.389> to<00:06:45.510> put<00:06:45.660> it<00:06:45.780> so<00:06:45.990> saline<00:06:46.350> your<00:06:46.470> dad<00:06:46.889> is<00:06:47.100> the

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
were to put it so saline your dad is the

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.760 
were to put it so saline your dad is the
same<00:06:47.430> thing<00:06:47.460> where<00:06:47.970> it's<00:06:48.150> just<00:06:48.360> you<00:06:49.320> can't<00:06:49.530> see

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
same thing where it's just you can't see

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.310 
same thing where it's just you can't see
it<00:06:49.860> over<00:06:50.190> now<00:06:51.150> if<00:06:51.270> you<00:06:51.360> wanted<00:06:51.660> to<00:06:51.720> do<00:06:51.810> it<00:06:51.990> on<00:06:52.139> a

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
it over now if you wanted to do it on a

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.129 
it over now if you wanted to do it on a
different<00:06:52.680> way<00:06:52.770> what<00:06:53.040> you<00:06:53.100> could<00:06:53.340> do<00:06:54.080> if<00:06:55.080> you

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
different way what you could do if you

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.090 
different way what you could do if you
press<00:06:55.380> ctrl<00:06:55.800> I<00:06:55.830> and<00:06:56.280> instead<00:06:57.210> of<00:06:57.330> to<00:06:57.419> multiply

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
press ctrl I and instead of to multiply

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.500 
press ctrl I and instead of to multiply
that<00:06:59.100> takes<00:06:59.340> the<00:06:59.520> negative<00:06:59.910> air<00:07:00.120> of<00:07:00.210> it<00:07:00.330> and

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
that takes the negative air of it and

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.260 
that takes the negative air of it and
then<00:07:00.750> it<00:07:00.870> does<00:07:01.050> it<00:07:01.200> just<00:07:01.440> um<00:07:02.120> takes<00:07:03.120> out<00:07:03.240> the

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
then it does it just um takes out the

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.970 
then it does it just um takes out the
white<00:07:03.570> so<00:07:04.169> it's<00:07:04.290> kind<00:07:04.440> of<00:07:04.500> a<00:07:04.590> different<00:07:04.860> way<00:07:04.950> of

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
white so it's kind of a different way of

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.620 
white so it's kind of a different way of
doing<00:07:05.070> it<00:07:05.250> but<00:07:05.370> see<00:07:05.550> this<00:07:05.700> one<00:07:06.000> always<00:07:06.270> shows

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
doing it but see this one always shows

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.000 
doing it but see this one always shows
on<00:07:06.840> the<00:07:06.960> white<00:07:07.139> and<00:07:07.350> it<00:07:07.410> doesn't<00:07:07.650> show<00:07:07.770> on<00:07:07.889> the

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010 
on the white and it doesn't show on the

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.129 
on the white and it doesn't show on the
arm<00:07:08.220> on<00:07:08.400> the<00:07:08.490> black<00:07:08.820> so<00:07:09.510> if<00:07:09.660> you<00:07:09.780> want<00:07:09.960> to<00:07:10.050> do

arm on the black so if you want to do

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:11.719
