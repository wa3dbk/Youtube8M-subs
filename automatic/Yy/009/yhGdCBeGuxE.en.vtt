00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.090
 welcome from alpa floor to bastia of 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.650
 post alpago one of the most references 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.289
 important in the province as far as 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.480
 it's about Christmas decorations and then 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.130
 today raniero we learn a moment 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.109
 bases to make the tree because at 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.220
 our shoulders alessandro is working 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.749
 with lights exactly alexander stands 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.619
 putting the lights on a tree in the 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:33.460
 exact way that is following each 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.829
 branch on each branch must go light 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.930
 strictly lit lights lit in 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.239
 this case for above all to see 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.609
 the effect was also distributed 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.070
 well this certainly then also for 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.780
 check of course that it works 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.519
 in short, therefore, their most common that 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.289
 we do at home is to take the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.480
 lights and turn around the tree while 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.910
 the tree must be penetrated exactly 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.710
 because it shows then when it is finished yes 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.199
 he sees the depth of the tree 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.789
 while he was spinning around, yes there was 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.230
 they want less but also the effect is 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.760
 different 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.730
 feel behind us there is already one of the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.350
 your trees and completely decorated 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.690
 wonderful tell me more or less how many 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.560
 lights are in here it's on this 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.200
 tree there are about I think 15 rows of 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.110
 lights for which over two thousand lights 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.050
 always turned to us for example like 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.060
 much light fix lights that vary 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.170
 the fixed light for me 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.570
 come back to me asking you instead 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.340
 another feature you give the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.869
 possibilities within strong alps 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.970
 choose the tree in all its forms 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.350
 and dimensions and to choose the decorations 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.090
 but there are also people who can 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.790
 take the tree home safely 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.190
 already de corato for all the rooms for 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.130
 all the needs we have goes trees 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.200
 various shapes of various heights now in 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.570
 this period is fashionable for them to study in 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.430
 that tree a little tighter than it is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.250
 fits all the corners of the houses a bit 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.759
 they are a bit small so they fit 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.660
 very well to every need 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.340
 perfect then i thank you for 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.869
 having taught us at least one of the secrets 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.750
 to decorate the tree 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.670
 you instead come here because it gives to the Pope 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.000
 is laying obviously pay is already 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.000
 Christmas
