00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.400
 I miss you so much. 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.700
 Movie theme song 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.300
 Lyrics: Wu Qingfeng 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.833
 Composer: Wu Qingfeng 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.200
 Opened the front of the lamp 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.100
 Lonely bed in a big room 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
 Turn off the lights all the same 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.600
 The injury in my heart cannot be shared 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.200
 Life goes with the years and goes old with the white hair 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.900
 As you leave, you are happy and have no news. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.600
 Go with the past and go to sleep with dreams 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.500
 Going away with the heart of paralysis 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.100
 I miss you, miss you so much. 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 But no trace 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.100
 I still miss my feet. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.400
 I still have a memory hover 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.800
 I still have tears in my eyes. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.900
 I still pretend not to care. 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:15.700
 I miss you so much, but I deceive myself. 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.500
 Opened the front of the lamp 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.800
 Lonely bed in a big room 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.900
 Turn off the lights all the same 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.200
 The injury in my heart cannot be shared 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.700
 Life goes with the years and goes old with the white hair 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.600
 As you leave, you are happy and have no news. 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.400
 Go with the past and go to sleep with dreams 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.200
 Going away with the heart of paralysis 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.400
 I miss you, miss you so much. 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.300
 But no trace 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.200
 I still miss my feet. 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.700
 I still have a memory hover 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.100
 I still have tears in my eyes. 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:14.400
 I still pretend not to care. 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:39.700
 I miss you so much, but I deceive myself. 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.700
 I miss you so much, I am deeply buried in my heart.
