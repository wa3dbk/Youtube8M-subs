00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
limits we can achieve with it see how

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.580 
limits we can achieve with it see how
fast<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.150> get<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.690> how<00:02:15.050> reliable<00:02:15.470> we

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
fast we can get it and how reliable we

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.070 
fast we can get it and how reliable we
can<00:02:15.710> keep<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.980> Sam<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:16.550> gonna<00:02:17.240> be<00:02:17.360> good<00:02:17.510> it
