00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello today in class we 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.480
 get acquainted with the accompaniment video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.429
 arpeggios on chord notes with return and 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.980
 learn to play music heal transfer to 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.880
 animal world 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.880
 listen to this song 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 the simplest part of this composition 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.050
 is a couplet night take off 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.360
 let's disassemble the left hand the left hand at us as 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.480
 I already said playing arpeggios by sounds 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.080
 chord with return 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:48.460
 First, consider what are these chords 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:56.380
 ramini no but 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.950
 G major Damajil in A minor raimi but not 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.940
 smear 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.460
 and C minor tonic of this 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.650
 the sequence is played several 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.150
 once in a row 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.149
 Now let's see how it will be played 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.149
 with arpeggios again play with return 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:22.640
 but did not give bass to play the penultimate 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:28.610
 notes in A minor further the next will oblige 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.250
 times farther next dream again and 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.260
 so then please note that you are 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.440
 as fingering can use 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.200
 instead of 4 fingers 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.310
 the third finger is more comfortable for someone like this 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.930
 here is the way I will play you 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.770
 arpeggios slowly all tunes you these 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.770
 again remember 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.799
 you know him consistently sarpi jim 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.109
 put melodies in us listen how 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.739
 combines the notes of the melody with the game 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.739
 arpeggio 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.310
 Now I played you the first phrase 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.310
 very long
