had in the movie they didn't breed and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.190 
had in the movie they didn't breed and
corrupt<00:02:06.060> humanity<00:02:06.570> apparently<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.110> were

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
corrupt humanity apparently they were

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I think some theologians and some

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.690 
I think some theologians and some
minister<00:02:15.900> said<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.069> know<00:02:17.189> the<00:02:17.280> Watchers

without blame a lot of love and a

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.580 
without blame a lot of love and a
brightness<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.939> now<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.569> messengers<00:02:43.409> are

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
brightness and now the messengers are

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.360 
brightness and now the messengers are
making<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.689> wooden<00:02:45.689> object<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.680> when<00:02:47.219> they

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
making a wooden object and when they

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.429 
making a wooden object and when they
have<00:02:47.519> completed<00:02:47.939> that<00:02:48.239> task<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.810> will<00:02:48.959> place<00:02:49.200> my

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
have completed that task I will place my

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.409 
have completed that task I will place my
hand<00:02:49.650> upon<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.340> preserve<00:02:50.669> it<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.060> there

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
hand upon it and preserve it and there

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.030 
hand upon it and preserve it and there
shall<00:02:51.629> come<00:02:51.689> forth<00:02:52.139> from<00:02:52.379> at<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.680> seed<00:02:52.889> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
shall come forth from at the seed of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.550 
shall come forth from at the seed of
life<00:02:53.219> and<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:54.000> change<00:02:54.359> shall<00:02:54.659> come<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.439> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
life and a change shall come so that the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.470 
life and a change shall come so that the
earth<00:02:55.590> will<00:02:55.949> not<00:02:56.129> remain<00:02:56.400> without<00:02:56.669> inhabitant

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
earth will not remain without inhabitant

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.179 
earth will not remain without inhabitant
so<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.959> makes<00:02:58.169> sense<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.590> me<00:02:58.680> now<00:02:58.709> because<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
so that makes sense to me now because I

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.740 
so that makes sense to me now because I
kept<00:02:59.430> trying<00:02:59.699> to<00:02:59.819> compute<00:03:00.209> for<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.419> longest

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
kept trying to compute for the longest

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.409 
kept trying to compute for the longest
time<00:03:01.189> how<00:03:02.189> that<00:03:02.250> Noah<00:03:02.549> built<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.909> ark<00:03:03.060> because

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
time how that Noah built the ark because

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.729 
time how that Noah built the ark because
I<00:03:03.480> mean<00:03:03.629> it<00:03:03.750> would<00:03:03.840> take<00:03:03.989> any<00:03:04.169> of<00:03:04.290> us<00:03:04.409> hundreds

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
I mean it would take any of us hundreds

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.399 
I mean it would take any of us hundreds
of<00:03:05.010> years<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.370> build<00:03:05.699> it<00:03:05.819> regardless<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:07.019> he

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
of years to build it regardless but he

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.740 
of years to build it regardless but he
had<00:03:07.590> helped<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.159> and<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.030> book<00:03:09.180> phenolic<00:03:09.629> is

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
had helped and and the book phenolic is

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.149 
had helped and and the book phenolic is
so<00:03:09.900> wonderful<00:03:10.319> if<00:03:10.379> you've<00:03:10.469> never<00:03:10.620> read<00:03:10.949> it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
father spoke to me that he said well be

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.809 
father spoke to me that he said well be
flames<00:03:25.169> of<00:03:25.349> fire<00:03:25.379> but<00:03:26.220> you're<00:03:26.400> saying<00:03:26.639> it's<00:03:26.790> a

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
flames of fire but you're saying it's a

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.599 
flames of fire but you're saying it's a
flood<00:03:27.030> it's<00:03:27.239> actually<00:03:27.569> interesting<00:03:27.780> because

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
flood it's actually interesting because

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.249 
flood it's actually interesting because
they<00:03:29.609> kind<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.909> portrayed<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.449> possibly

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:31.259 
they kind of portrayed that possibly

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.210 
they kind of portrayed that possibly
very<00:03:31.739> close<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.189> be<00:03:32.280> inaccurate<00:03:32.519> because

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
very close to be inaccurate because

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.469 
very close to be inaccurate because
Methuselah<00:03:35.220> might<00:03:35.939> not<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.239> been<00:03:36.299> as

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
Methuselah might not have been as

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.039 
Methuselah might not have been as
informed<00:03:37.049> about<00:03:37.729> the<00:03:38.729> second<00:03:39.150> coming<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
informed about the second coming and the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.740 
informed about the second coming and the
judgment<00:03:40.590> as<00:03:40.739> much<00:03:40.979> as<00:03:41.159> a<00:03:41.189> nominee<00:03:41.759> so<00:03:42.359> it<00:03:42.599> was

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
judgment as much as a nominee so it was

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.119 
judgment as much as a nominee so it was
interesting<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.409> might<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.919> actually

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
interesting that might have actually

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.490 
interesting that might have actually
played<00:03:44.519> off<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.060> truth<00:03:45.269> who<00:03:45.599> knows<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.199> just

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
played off and truth who knows but just

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.319 
played off and truth who knows but just
it<00:03:46.919> got<00:03:47.129> people's<00:03:47.489> thoughts<00:03:47.790> going<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.269> the
