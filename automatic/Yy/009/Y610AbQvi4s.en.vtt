00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.160
 family 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.160
 but it 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.160
 a lifestyle with you 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:28.279
 for me over all mountains with a lot 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.279
 swing and then just run free 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:41.310
 limit for me was so especially as ever 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.260
 multi-track master goes so before that as 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.100
 my ideas are young now 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.100
 experience rich front and hire 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.030
 corner point for my whole career there only 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.700
 in matters of the dream fulfillment and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 the depression as well as bring that one 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.340
 really the most downhill is set is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 unique and is it really something 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.090
 his special 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.680
 he 's pretty happy that way 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.680
 many ask 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.800
 a sweet wine if we dare 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.240
 we make the sun and explain 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:29.500
 through the fog by fearful state 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.680
 and forest rear where frustrations pro 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.830
 second such fear 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.540
 gladly thanks to the level so bring along 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:43.090
 with situations like to be around 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.960
 intuitively feels that it is dangerous 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 can in snowboard then this can be a 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.500
 step back 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:05.070
 Because winter broke a good winter 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:09.149
 come first the children and be 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.200
 made a tattooed giant leaps 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.390
 and in the snowploughs and at the beginning 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.570
 Season is always without projects for me 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.810
 im so warming up and that 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.250
 glue head free for 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.590
 spontaneous thing and what I am there 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.730
 not so stuck with the plan 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.720
 here it was what no borders relatively everything 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.390
 spontaneously where does fall then comes travel 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.380
 the more you like to live and much 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.920
 spontaneous and land the more experiences 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.920
 I join 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.680
 the best route relatively easy me 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:59.450
 have always the same subject aigner 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.450
 wanted better put make 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.600
 So my own word is the same to me 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.720
 He feels like meeting before meetings 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.190
 early season anticipation huge so 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.300
 that you just teach me on 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:28.200
 most fun when I entrÃ©e a nobody 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.140
 Gold or Mahlberg greg level 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.630
 actually the world but there now 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.630
 sometimes as mcqueen with more nuclear 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.239
 At home , one feels the duty to me 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:52.239
 something for a pressure 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:57.260
 Ever since what mitkriegt for pressure 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:59.900
 not on foreign countries and snowboarders 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.180
 I am generally international 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.489
 So it does not work so it sounds so 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.150
 Actually, I am doing very well what I do 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.530
 have grown up and then you realize 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.530
 more if you are yourself
