00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.040
 It is not difficult at all to make it and I think that I will be me again 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.010
 let my party find that he is on the internet and why would you meet the 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.740
 get started 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.590
 and that is why I look a little less than before, unfortunately a number of athletes became themselves 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.730
 needs this week for this at this time 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.009
 thinks that sounds and a bit of inspiration 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.009
 by 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.489
 In the winter of 2011 it does not go out with lumberjack shirts that are provided with 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 a great beautiful places the number that I already have enough interest and get 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.859
 what do you need the piece plays and my machine some nice buttons 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:40.770
 a diary 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.020
 to be 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.550
 we play with beijing material I made a nice curl on the path to paper 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.490
 and they seem to get up a little bit on the field right now because we 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.070
 have twice unnecessary to get a red card 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.070
 it's coming to an end 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.520
 and remediate this therapy 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.350
 this time will always stay is time to go 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.050
 the decline is that the competition is going to be a bit flat, the strongest 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:18.970
 winner announced 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.970
 that I get even more for 90 2 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.060
 2 especially and I have points at the area and sirte draw 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.210
 it was some beautiful region and other health care providers in the same city 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.330
 good plan 9 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.820
 because I can't let it slip it's important bee references 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.870
 excellent 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.930
 it is a question mark, by the way, is also very beautiful in the front that ensures 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.630
 for the finished season 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.289
 van eerd and i get you to finish he claimed to attack one 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.300
 boost 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.960
 I just see that for the 5 and 10 dollars in excess size, he says 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.910
 a lot to be but the pressure rates further down but of course it is 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.080
