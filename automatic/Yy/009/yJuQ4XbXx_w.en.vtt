okay<00:00:11.629> so<00:00:11.690> we're<00:00:12.019> going<00:00:12.110> to<00:00:12.170> look<00:00:12.379> at<00:00:12.469> chin-ups

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
okay so we're going to look at chin-ups

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.390 
okay so we're going to look at chin-ups
today<00:00:13.339> and<00:00:13.900> different<00:00:14.900> variations<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.129> I'm

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
today and different variations so I'm

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.859 
today and different variations so I'm
going<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.580> add<00:00:16.699> in<00:00:16.820> yell<00:00:17.029> demonstrate<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:17.750> the

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
going to add in yell demonstrate so the

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.679 
going to add in yell demonstrate so the
first<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:18.410> eat<00:00:18.829> most<00:00:19.160> easiest<00:00:19.610> group<00:00:19.820> grip<00:00:20.480> to

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
first and eat most easiest group grip to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.859 
first and eat most easiest group grip to
do<00:00:20.810> is<00:00:21.020> a<00:00:21.410> parallel<00:00:22.009> group<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.029> if<00:00:23.390> you<00:00:23.509> notice

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
do is a parallel group so if you notice

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.499 
do is a parallel group so if you notice
she<00:00:24.199> keeps<00:00:24.410> her<00:00:24.529> body<00:00:24.739> very<00:00:24.860> aligned<00:00:25.820> she

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
she keeps her body very aligned she

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.070 
she keeps her body very aligned she
pulls<00:00:26.779> with<00:00:26.929> the<00:00:27.019> lats<00:00:27.259> first<00:00:27.710> pull<00:00:28.539> and<00:00:29.539> goes

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
pulls with the lats first pull and goes

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.900 
pulls with the lats first pull and goes
up<00:00:30.289> to<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.500> top<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.070> see<00:00:31.250> your<00:00:31.339> deltoids

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
up to the top and you see your deltoids

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.229 
up to the top and you see your deltoids
touch<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.300> bars<00:00:32.480> or<00:00:32.780> bring<00:00:32.960> it<00:00:33.080> down<00:00:34.239> stretch

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
touch the bars or bring it down stretch

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.500 
touch the bars or bring it down stretch
and<00:00:35.510> pull<00:00:35.930> it<00:00:36.050> up<00:00:37.390> okay

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
and pull it up okay

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.290 
and pull it up okay
and<00:00:38.600> that's<00:00:39.170> perfect<00:00:39.620> sequencing<00:00:40.160> go<00:00:40.339> down<00:00:40.550> so

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
and that's perfect sequencing go down so

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.180 
and that's perfect sequencing go down so
she<00:00:41.420> pulls<00:00:41.809> with<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.049> large<00:00:42.320> muscles<00:00:42.860> first

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
she pulls with the large muscles first

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.719 
she pulls with the large muscles first
then<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:45.019> elbow<00:00:45.320> flexors<00:00:45.739> that's<00:00:46.430> very<00:00:46.610> good

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
then the elbow flexors that's very good

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.250 
then the elbow flexors that's very good
thank<00:00:46.909> you<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.850> next<00:00:50.089> progression<00:00:50.449> when

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
thank you the next progression when

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.460 
thank you the next progression when
you're<00:00:51.440> doing<00:00:51.619> chin-ups<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.640> do<00:00:52.820> them

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
you're doing chin-ups is to do them

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.340 
you're doing chin-ups is to do them
supinated<00:00:54.470> that<00:00:54.830> means<00:00:55.040> palms<00:00:55.309> up<00:00:55.580> and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
supinated that means palms up and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.660 
supinated that means palms up and
shoulder-width<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:57.739> she'll<00:00:58.040> face<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.489> bar

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
shoulder-width so she'll face the bar

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.969 
shoulder-width so she'll face the bar
this<00:00:59.119> way<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.860> then<00:01:01.460> shoulder-width<00:01:02.979> Shang's

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
this way and then shoulder-width Shang's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.530 
this way and then shoulder-width Shang's
from<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.369> bar<00:01:04.580> and<00:01:04.900> pulls<00:01:05.900> herself<00:01:06.020> up<00:01:06.409> as<00:01:07.540> you

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
from the bar and pulls herself up as you

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.630 
from the bar and pulls herself up as you
can<00:01:08.689> see<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.560> upper<00:01:09.830> chest<00:01:10.040> is<00:01:10.220> touching<00:01:10.549> your

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
can see the upper chest is touching your

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.910 
can see the upper chest is touching your
bar<00:01:10.790> that's<00:01:11.000> perfect<00:01:11.360> technique<00:01:11.630> go<00:01:11.810> down<00:01:12.020> do

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
bar that's perfect technique go down do

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.600 
bar that's perfect technique go down do
another<00:01:13.130> one<00:01:14.710> good<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.210> go<00:01:17.210> down<00:01:18.340> that's<00:01:19.340> good

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
another one good and go down that's good

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.760 
another one good and go down that's good
thank<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.860> okay<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:23.060> when<00:01:23.840> you<00:01:24.050> go<00:01:24.440> from

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
thank you okay so this when you go from

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.420 
thank you okay so this when you go from
a<00:01:25.870> parallel<00:01:26.870> grip<00:01:27.200> to<00:01:27.380> supinated<00:01:27.860> grip<00:01:27.890> you're

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
a parallel grip to supinated grip you're

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.810 
a parallel grip to supinated grip you're
about<00:01:28.640> 15%<00:01:29.210> weaker<00:01:29.990> okay<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.070> reason<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.490> why

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
about 15% weaker okay the reason is why

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.670 
about 15% weaker okay the reason is why
you're<00:01:32.030> strongest<00:01:32.510> with<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.780> parallel<00:01:33.200> grip<00:01:33.500> is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
you're strongest with a parallel grip is

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.190 
you're strongest with a parallel grip is
that<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.640> sum<00:01:34.909> of<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.210> four<00:01:35.480> elbow<00:01:35.750> flexors

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
that the sum of the four elbow flexors

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.950 
that the sum of the four elbow flexors
is<00:01:36.380> at<00:01:37.010> its<00:01:37.190> optimal<00:01:37.640> ratio<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.690> the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
is at its optimal ratio so the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.600 
is at its optimal ratio so the
brachioradialis<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.860> very<00:01:40.100> very<00:01:40.310> effective

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
brachioradialis is a very very effective

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.170 
brachioradialis is a very very effective
line<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.120> pull<00:01:41.300> the<00:01:42.490> biceps<00:01:43.490> brachii<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:43.940> not

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
line of pull the biceps brachii and not

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.360 
line of pull the biceps brachii and not
so<00:01:44.360> much<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.659> brachialis<00:01:44.990> always<00:01:45.470> worked<00:01:45.740> but

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
so much the brachialis always worked but

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.070 
so much the brachialis always worked but
if<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.820> look<00:01:46.970> at<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.150> sum<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.540> four<00:01:47.780> elbow

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
if you look at the sum of the four elbow

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.410 
if you look at the sum of the four elbow
flexors<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:48.860> is<00:01:49.070> optimal<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.700> goal<00:01:50.270> of

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
flexors it as is optimal and goal of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.469 
flexors it as is optimal and goal of
pull<00:01:50.720> when<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.620> answer<00:01:51.979> neutral<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.150> next

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
pull when the answer neutral the next

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.410 
pull when the answer neutral the next
grip<00:01:53.990> after<00:01:54.430> supinated<00:01:55.430> grip<00:01:55.460> would<00:01:56.299> be

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
grip after supinated grip would be

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.420 
grip after supinated grip would be
narrow<00:01:56.780> supinated<00:01:57.500> grip<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.830> Danielle<00:01:58.310> will

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
narrow supinated grip and Danielle will

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.170 
narrow supinated grip and Danielle will
demonstrate<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.870> in<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.500> case<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.880> space

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
demonstrate so in that case the space

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.030 
demonstrate so in that case the space
between<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.659> two<00:02:02.840> hands<00:02:03.260> is<00:02:03.380> usually<00:02:03.830> about

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
between the two hands is usually about

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.850 
between the two hands is usually about
four<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.299> ten<00:02:05.540> centimeters<00:02:06.229> and<00:02:06.650> she<00:02:07.220> pulls<00:02:07.430> up

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
four to ten centimeters and she pulls up

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.680 
four to ten centimeters and she pulls up
okay<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.009> again<00:02:10.280> she's<00:02:10.879> way<00:02:11.090> above<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.510> bar

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
okay and again she's way above the bar

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.460 
okay and again she's way above the bar
which<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:11.930> great

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
which is great

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.390 
which is great
do<00:02:12.709> another<00:02:12.890> one<00:02:13.099> please<00:02:14.049> stretches<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.400> up

very good and bring down
good<00:02:19.770> stuff<00:02:20.360> okay<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:23.959> when<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.080> start<00:02:25.379> with

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
good stuff okay so when you start with

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.280 
good stuff okay so when you start with
chin-ups<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.860> start<00:02:26.629> semi<00:02:27.629> supinated<00:02:28.260> grip

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
chin-ups you start semi supinated grip

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.640 
chin-ups you start semi supinated grip
and<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.970> move<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> supinated<00:02:31.140> grip<00:02:31.170> then

what I suggest you do is you if you want

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.140 
what I suggest you do is you if you want
to<00:03:04.709> do<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.829> cycle<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.489> improve<00:03:05.670> your<00:03:05.790> pull-ups

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to do a cycle to improve your pull-ups

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.949 
to do a cycle to improve your pull-ups
if<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.319> more<00:03:07.970> challenging<00:03:08.970> grip<00:03:09.569> every

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
if you do a more challenging grip every

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.559 
if you do a more challenging grip every
sixth<00:03:10.290> workout<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.310> let's<00:03:11.549> say<00:03:11.790> Danielle<00:03:12.450> is

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
sixth workout so let's say Danielle is

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.380 
sixth workout so let's say Danielle is
just<00:03:12.780> finished<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.170> grip<00:03:13.380> where<00:03:13.590> she's<00:03:13.799> narrow

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
just finished a grip where she's narrow

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.699 
just finished a grip where she's narrow
pronated<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> next<00:03:15.750> phase<00:03:15.930> would<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.230> wide

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
pronated the next phase would be wide

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.740 
pronated the next phase would be wide
pronated<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:20.489> she<00:03:20.549> will<00:03:20.790> use<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> grip<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.690> is

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
pronated so she will use a grip that is

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.030 
pronated so she will use a grip that is
slightly<00:03:22.170> wider<00:03:22.590> than<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.950> shoulders<00:03:23.810> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
slightly wider than the shoulders and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:34.699 
slightly wider than the shoulders and
pull<00:03:26.040> up<00:03:28.190> okay<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.329> more<00:03:30.769> pull<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:33.709> get

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
pull up okay and one more pull and get

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.540 
pull up okay and one more pull and get
all<00:03:35.609> right<00:03:35.760> excellent
