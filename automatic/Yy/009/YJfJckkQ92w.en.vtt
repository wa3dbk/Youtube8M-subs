00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.000
 break 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.590
 We offer songs and promises but we can 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.050
 attacking normally is because we 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.380
 confused with some prey I know by 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:03.440
 what sharks are attacking artists 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.440

 using a part of the brain 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.150
 while the other one sleeps 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.860

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.680
 most animals and we accompany the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.680
 next because we are more animals 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.349
