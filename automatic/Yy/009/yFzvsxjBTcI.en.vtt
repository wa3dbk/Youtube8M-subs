hey folks Matt from our to the image
comm<00:00:02.790> so<00:00:03.540> Sony's<00:00:04.020> got<00:00:04.259> out<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.650> new<00:00:05.420> a6000

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
comm so Sony's got out the new a6000

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.620 
comm so Sony's got out the new a6000
which<00:00:06.569> basically<00:00:07.020> replaces<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.919> NEX<00:00:08.460> six<00:00:08.940> and

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
which basically replaces the NEX six and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.600 
which basically replaces the NEX six and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
advancement over the NEX six of

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.740 
advancement over the NEX six of
interesting<00:00:25.740> note<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> a6000<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> one

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
interesting note here the a6000 is one

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.750 
interesting note here the a6000 is one
of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.109> cameras<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.769> lose<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.220> NEX

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
of the first cameras to lose the NEX

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.600 
of the first cameras to lose the NEX
part<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.170> name<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.340> looks<00:00:32.520> like

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
part of the name and it looks like

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.270 
part of the name and it looks like
sony's<00:00:33.210> making<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.750> move<00:00:33.960> away<00:00:34.170> from<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
sony's making the move away from the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340 
sony's making the move away from the
calling<00:00:36.149> cameras<00:00:36.540> any<00:00:36.719> accent<00:00:37.260> just

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
calling cameras any accent just

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.770 
calling cameras any accent just
amalgamating<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.489> into<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> line

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
amalgamating them all into the a line

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.750 
amalgamating them all into the a line
the<00:00:40.020> alpha<00:00:40.469> line<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.250> that's<00:00:41.430> kind<00:00:41.700> of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the alpha line so that's kind of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.479 
the alpha line so that's kind of
interesting<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> itself<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.370> we've

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
interesting in and of itself so we've

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.299 
interesting in and of itself so we've
got<00:00:44.640> nine<00:00:44.910> reasons<00:00:45.239> nine<00:00:45.899> things<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:47.039> are

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
got nine reasons nine things that are

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.779 
got nine reasons nine things that are
updated<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.899> a6000<00:00:49.829> first<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.460> foremost

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
updated on the a6000 first and foremost

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.810 
updated on the a6000 first and foremost
we've<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> 24<00:00:51.930> megapixel<00:00:52.530> sensor<00:00:53.399> versus

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
we've got a 24 megapixel sensor versus

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
we've got a 24 megapixel sensor versus
the<00:00:54.030> 16<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.129> Sony<00:00:56.610> NEX<00:00:56.879> six<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the 16 that was in the Sony NEX six so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.490 
the 16 that was in the Sony NEX six so
we've<00:00:58.379> got<00:00:58.649> eight<00:00:59.250> new<00:00:59.460> megapixels<00:01:00.239> and

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
we've got eight new megapixels and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.630 
we've got eight new megapixels and
continuing<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> trend<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.010> all<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> other

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
continuing the trend of all the other

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
continuing the trend of all the other
cameras<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> 24<00:01:03.930> megapixel<00:01:04.500> sensor

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
cameras with the 24 megapixel sensor

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.010 
cameras with the 24 megapixel sensor
that<00:01:05.640> Sony<00:01:05.939> makes<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> quite<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> nice

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that Sony makes which is quite a nice

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 
that Sony makes which is quite a nice
sensor<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:08.310> basically<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> sensor

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
sensor we basically got the sensor

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.859 
sensor we basically got the sensor
update<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.170> number<00:01:11.070> two<00:01:11.400> we've<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.000> gone<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
update here number two we've got gone to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.649 
update here number two we've got gone to
buy<00:01:13.229> ons<00:01:13.470> X<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.460> their<00:01:14.580> processing<00:01:15.180> engine

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
buy ons X for their processing engine

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.770 
buy ons X for their processing engine
versus<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> older<00:01:16.979> buy<00:01:17.520> ons<00:01:17.790> engine<00:01:18.330> which

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
versus the older buy ons engine which

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.570 
versus the older buy ons engine which
was<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.979> Sony<00:01:20.850> NEX<00:01:21.060> X<00:01:21.689> we've<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> newer

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
was in the Sony NEX X we've got a newer

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.289 
was in the Sony NEX X we've got a newer
faster<00:01:24.140> processing<00:01:25.140> engine<00:01:25.590> which<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.299> partly

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
faster processing engine which is partly

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240 
faster processing engine which is partly
probably<00:01:27.840> called<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:28.590> we're<00:01:28.950> moving

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
probably called for because we're moving

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.819 
probably called for because we're moving
up<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> 24<00:01:30.360> megapixel<00:01:30.509> sensor<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.680> needs

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
up to a 24 megapixel sensor so it needs

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
up to a 24 megapixel sensor so it needs
a<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.009> more<00:01:32.189> juice<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.150> handle<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a little more juice to handle that and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.719 
a little more juice to handle that and
also<00:01:35.030> probably<00:01:36.030> give<00:01:36.299> us<00:01:36.450> faster<00:01:36.930> performance

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
also probably give us faster performance

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
also probably give us faster performance
even<00:01:38.729> though<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.570> moved<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.740> sensor<00:01:41.100> as

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
even though it's moved up a sensor as

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.389 
even though it's moved up a sensor as
well<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> handle<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
well so not just the handle the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
well so not just the handle the
performance<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.119> new<00:01:45.270> sensor<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
performance of the new sensor but to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
performance of the new sensor but to
make<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> speedier<00:01:47.250> camera<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.880> around<00:01:48.299> as

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
make it a speedier camera all around as

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.230 
make it a speedier camera all around as
an<00:01:48.750> improvement<00:01:49.189> number<00:01:50.189> three<00:01:50.460> we've<00:01:51.090> got<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
an improvement number three we've got a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.350 
an improvement number three we've got a
new<00:01:51.390> focusing<00:01:52.020> system<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.009> we've<00:01:53.100> got<00:01:53.360> 25

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
new focusing system so we've got 25

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.300 
new focusing system so we've got 25
contrast<00:01:55.170> type<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.770> hundred<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
contrast type and a hundred and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.800 
contrast type and a hundred and
seventy-nine<00:01:56.880> face<00:01:57.810> type<00:01:58.170> points<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.610> new

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
seventy-nine face type points on the new

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.340 
seventy-nine face type points on the new
a6000<00:02:00.810> versus<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.799> NEX<00:02:02.159> six<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> 25<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.600> 99<00:02:04.049> so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
a6000 versus the NEX six is 25 to 99 so

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.520 
a6000 versus the NEX six is 25 to 99 so
we've<00:02:05.070> got<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> whole<00:02:05.399> new<00:02:05.579> AF<00:02:05.969> system<00:02:06.530> I

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
we've got a whole new AF system I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.430 
we've got a whole new AF system I
believe<00:02:08.160> Sony's<00:02:08.580> making<00:02:08.970> some<00:02:09.179> pretty<00:02:09.440> bold

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.480 
NEX six did not have been numbers where
are<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.110> we've<00:03:43.290> got<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.590> PC<00:03:44.010> remote

which is now available as with the a6000

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.330 
which is now available as with the a6000
and<00:03:48.090> we<00:03:48.510> didn't<00:03:48.750> have<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.080> on<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.770> NEX<00:03:50.040> six

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
and we didn't have that on the NEX six

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.260 
and we didn't have that on the NEX six
so<00:03:50.460> again<00:03:50.700> another<00:03:51.060> feature<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:53.120> ner<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
so again another feature of the ner the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.350 
so again another feature of the ner the
a6000<00:03:55.230> over<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> NEX<00:03:55.980> six<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:57.090> new

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
a6000 over the NEX six that's a new

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.210 
a6000 over the NEX six that's a new
feature<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.080> didn't<00:03:58.440> have<00:03:58.560> before<00:03:58.770> which

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
feature that we didn't have before which

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.970 
feature that we didn't have before which
is<00:03:59.250> which<00:03:59.610> is<00:03:59.760> welcome<00:04:00.260> battery<00:04:01.260> life<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.950> I

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
is which is welcome battery life so I

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.770 
is which is welcome battery life so I
guess<00:04:02.160> that's<00:04:02.250> number<00:04:02.460> eight<00:04:02.760> we're<00:04:03.450> at<00:04:03.630> an

here on the on the specs that I was

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
looking at that one of the ads from gear

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.050 
looking at that one of the ads from gear
shop<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:38.790> 648<00:04:39.680> some<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.830> times<00:04:41.010> those<00:04:41.520> top

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
shop is 648 some of the times those top

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.790 
shop is 648 some of the times those top
ads<00:04:42.330> are<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> little<00:04:42.780> bit<00:04:43.080> low<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.320> what<00:04:43.680> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
ads are a little bit low for what the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.160 
ads are a little bit low for what the
average<00:04:43.950> price<00:04:44.370> would<00:04:44.580> be<00:04:44.610> but<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.600> think<00:04:46.110> I've

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
average price would be but I think I've

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.490 
average price would be but I think I've
seen<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.440> for<00:04:46.530> between<00:04:46.800> 6<00:04:47.070> &amp;<00:04:47.220> 7<00:04:47.370> on<00:04:47.640> Amazon<00:04:48.150> so

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
seen it for between 6 &amp; 7 on Amazon so

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.670 
seen it for between 6 &amp; 7 on Amazon so
basically<00:04:49.500> we've<00:04:50.130> dropped<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.820> price<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.090> lot

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
basically we've dropped the price a lot

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.470 
basically we've dropped the price a lot
for<00:04:52.680> this<00:04:52.830> camera<00:04:53.220> because<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.790> NEX<00:04:54.090> 6<00:04:54.360> I

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
for this camera because the NEX 6 I

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.780 
for this camera because the NEX 6 I
think<00:04:54.510> was<00:04:54.810> $1000<00:04:55.560> when<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.860> came<00:04:55.980> out<00:04:56.160> with

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
think was $1000 when it came out with

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.400 
think was $1000 when it came out with
the<00:04:57.030> kit<00:04:57.240> lens<00:04:57.270> somewhere<00:04:58.020> in<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.140> price

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
the kit lens somewhere in that price

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.780 
the kit lens somewhere in that price
range<00:04:58.620> anyways<00:04:58.980> it<00:04:59.100> might<00:04:59.220> have<00:04:59.310> been<00:04:59.400> it

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
range anyways it might have been it

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.100 
range anyways it might have been it
might<00:04:59.880> have<00:05:00.000> been<00:05:00.120> between<00:05:00.300> 8<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> thousand

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
might have been between 8 and a thousand

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.870 
might have been between 8 and a thousand
depending<00:05:01.230> on<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.590> configuration<00:05:01.770> but<00:05:02.760> it

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
depending on the configuration but it

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.510 
depending on the configuration but it
but<00:05:03.060> we've<00:05:03.240> come<00:05:03.480> down<00:05:03.510> in<00:05:03.840> price<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:05.220> that's<00:05:05.400> a

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
but we've come down in price so that's a

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.970 
but we've come down in price so that's a
that's<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.910> big<00:05:05.940> advantage<00:05:06.510> over<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.290> NEX<00:05:07.650> 6

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980
