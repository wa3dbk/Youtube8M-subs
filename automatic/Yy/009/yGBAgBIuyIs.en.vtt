00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.740
 . yummy . 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.740
 factor is bursting 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.430
 hello everyone with you and on and be blog 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.180
 parents just decided today 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.810
 show you the rice cooking recipe with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.570
 vegetables 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.380
 he seems to be simple enough but i will 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 first cook today in a slow cooker 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.690
 which I brought him second I him 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.290
 I will greatly simplify I will 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.870
 cook large enough 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.879
 this flight and every day I try 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.200
 inventing something very interesting 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.100
 to make it tasty because children 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.770
 especially some 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.739
 different children not only mine they are far from 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.039
 all eat so I 2 cook all 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.920
 very very tasty so i think 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.699
 today we have three with vegetables too 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.760
 very tasty and so i will need 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.010
 I will need onion tomato and pepper 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 good on and butter 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.520
 actually rice with vegetables 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.420
 what you need for cooking 6 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 portions 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.729
 2 glasses of rice guests winter 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.400
 1 onion 3 medium tomatoes half 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.640
 or whole sweet pepper 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.390
 a tablespoon of ghee 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 taste 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.070
 5 glasses of water start with the fact that 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.740
 we clean we clean the onions 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 we start to cut onions 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:51.420
 when us babies on the slicker remain then 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.780
 it's pretty hard to guess at all 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.240
 threatened because kids are different from 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.909
 test 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.899
 on my now we have one girl 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.670
 permanently stays on prodlenku and 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.430
 guess so that everyone likes me 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.119
 it turned out so far only to one hundred 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.280
 percent and not all eat well 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.540
 it turned out only once yesterday yesterday I 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.540
 cooked something like robust 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.640
 potatoes with carrots and she is so 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.209
 I get delicious that they all ate two 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.739
 that is, plates were 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.360
 good combination today and dumped 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.459
 I try to guess again and here conceived 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.060
 do without a visa usually they all love but 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.040
 so before cooked just rice today 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.730
 decided to experiment a little bit 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.720
 with vegetables means putting a slow cooker on 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.209
 frying mode 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:58.230
 I put a huge oil there, I pour out 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:03:02.380
 onions and close on, I finely cut 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.780
 pepper vegetables usually i try enough 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.799
 finely cut you dishes for children because 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.700
 what is most often children easier 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.579
 perceive not very big on the side 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.820
 the smaller the sword and they cut those in 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.709
 Overall so better if I was cooking on 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.620
 I'm an adult company 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.769
 reasonable much bigger i myself very much 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:32.079
 I love all sorts of combinations of vegetables with pears 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.840
 but in this case, that's done on so 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.780
 how do i get half a pepper here 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:44.590
 don't score hard because fearing 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:47.350
 so that they all cut these cuts or tomatoes 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.109
 diced this recipe is a bit unusual 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.130
 so that we fell down not to hurt 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.680
 previously 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.590
 and 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.409
 Wasabi is not found, we will bake it 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.099
 and bake it in a slow cooker on 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.120
 mode 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.859
 baking, I have not cooked this 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:13.599
 you make it up very cool 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:21.160
 Looks like a handful of raisins 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:21.160
 that's even a half 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.699
 sends roasts 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:33.289
 and wait until the raisins are deflated 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:37.639
 yet cut tomatoes 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:39.830
 one more left as soon as our 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.490
 yon should be added there 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.490
 tomatoes 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:56.129
 add to it a berchik 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:05:01.749
 and tomatoes mix the whole thing and 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.729
 again how to cook rice with vegetables in 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:07.409
 multicooker 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:11.349
 heat up the butter in frying mode 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:14.919
 chop the onion finely and put in the bowl 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:17.949
 Multivarki pro stew 5 minutes add 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:21.569
 a handful of raisins and wait until the raisins 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:24.759
 peppers tomatoes 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:27.639
 dice add a bowl of multicooker and 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:32.580
 leave stew for about 10 minutes now 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.580
 I will take a closer look at that and here 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:48.329
 we go up and tomatoes now 

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:48.329
 heat up a little and add rice 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:04.250
 call with water and set up our slow cooker 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:08.960
 baking here automatically costs 50 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:13.190
 minutes and turn on everything now waiting 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.250
 result to stewed vegetables add 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.680
 rice and boiled water 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:22.660
 salt to taste put mode 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:26.540
 baking for 50 minutes so it took 20 minutes 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:34.000
 see what we get here so it 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:40.660
 Looks like all the vegetables down here 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.660
 that there can be refilled mix 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.190

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:00.390
