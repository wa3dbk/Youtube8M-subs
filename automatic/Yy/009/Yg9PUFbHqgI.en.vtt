first<00:00:25.189> of<00:00:25.369> all<00:00:25.489> let's<00:00:25.700> define<00:00:26.029> a<00:00:26.090> chord

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
first of all let's define a chord

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.589 
first of all let's define a chord
progression<00:00:26.559> well<00:00:27.559> it's<00:00:27.829> a<00:00:28.070> series<00:00:29.029> of<00:00:29.239> chords

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
progression well it's a series of chords

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.729 
progression well it's a series of chords
put<00:00:29.809> together<00:00:29.960> in<00:00:30.379> a<00:00:30.500> in<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.860> pattern<00:00:31.390> so<00:00:32.390> that

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
put together in a in a pattern so that

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.869 
put together in a in a pattern so that
chord<00:00:33.739> little<00:00:33.980> chord<00:00:34.309> progression<00:00:34.700> I<00:00:34.760> was

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
chord little chord progression I was

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.340 
chord little chord progression I was
playing<00:00:35.239> I<00:00:35.510> was<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.829> key<00:00:37.039> of<00:00:37.340> F

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:51.460 

now<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.100> playing<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> F<00:00:43.100> B<00:00:44.100> flat<00:00:44.130> a<00:00:46.670> C<00:00:48.050> B<00:00:49.050> flat<00:00:49.080> F

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
now is playing the F B flat a C B flat F

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.570 
now is playing the F B flat a C B flat F
now<00:00:53.239> chords<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.390> based<00:00:54.600> around<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:56.160> notes<00:00:56.370> in

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
now chords are based around the notes in

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.460 
now chords are based around the notes in
a<00:00:56.670> scale<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.390> call<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.900> key<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.260> F

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
a scale we call this the key of F

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.040 
a scale we call this the key of F
because<00:00:59.160> I'm<00:00:59.460> building<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.970> chords<00:01:00.420> based<00:01:00.750> on

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
because I'm building the chords based on

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.920 
because I'm building the chords based on
F

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
F

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.610 
F
major<00:01:03.530> scale<00:01:06.070> so<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.190> F<00:01:07.870> group<00:01:08.870> will<00:01:09.110> one

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
major scale so the F group will one

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.790 
major scale so the F group will one
