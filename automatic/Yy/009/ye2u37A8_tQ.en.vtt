00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi there this time I want to introduce

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.820 
hi there this time I want to introduce
you<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.110> my<00:00:04.290> newest<00:00:04.650> work<00:00:05.180> the<00:00:06.180> 25<00:00:06.990> piece<00:00:07.230> human

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
you to my newest work the 25 piece human

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.700 
you to my newest work the 25 piece human
cat<00:00:08.250> goats<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.210> zombie<00:00:09.809> eyeball<00:00:10.290> set<00:00:12.830> let's

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
cat goats and zombie eyeball set let's

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.650 
cat goats and zombie eyeball set let's
let's<00:00:16.710> start<00:00:16.920> by<00:00:17.430> explaining<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.150> first<00:00:18.420> eye

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
let's start by explaining the first eye

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.640 
let's start by explaining the first eye
objects<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> low-poly<00:00:21.449> human<00:00:21.960> eye<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
objects the low-poly human eye is the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.359 
objects the low-poly human eye is the
base<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> rest<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> eyeballs<00:00:25.010> it<00:00:26.010> has

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
base for the rest of the eyeballs it has

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.150 
base for the rest of the eyeballs it has
around<00:00:26.820> 300<00:00:27.300> triangles<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.619> procedural

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
around 300 triangles and procedural

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.959 
around 300 triangles and procedural
shaders<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.630> included<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.590> set

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
shaders and I included it in the set

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.700 
shaders and I included it in the set
because<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> subdivision

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
because you know with a subdivision

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.869 
because you know with a subdivision
modifier<00:00:35.059> it's<00:00:36.059> almost<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> rest<00:00:37.879> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
modifier it's almost like the rest and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.850 
modifier it's almost like the rest and
maybe<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> base<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.829> make

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
maybe you can use it as a base to make

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.950 
maybe you can use it as a base to make
your<00:00:41.160> own<00:00:41.340> keys<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:45.059> let's<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
your own keys to my now let's see the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.950 
your own keys to my now let's see the
human<00:00:46.559> eye<00:00:46.680> but<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.879> normal<00:00:48.329> version<00:00:48.660> not<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
human eye but the normal version not the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.930 
human eye but the normal version not the
low-poly<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:51.739> human<00:00:52.739> cats<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.430> goats

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
low-poly one human cats and goats

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080 
low-poly one human cats and goats
eyeballs<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> shape<00:00:55.559> key<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.309> open<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
eyeballs have a shape key to open the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.569 
eyeballs have a shape key to open the
iris<00:00:59.960> I'm<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.710> gonna<00:01:01.949> show<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
iris I'm going to I'm gonna show you the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.520 
iris I'm going to I'm gonna show you the
cat<00:01:02.820> eye<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> cat<00:01:07.049> iris

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
cat eye now you can see the cat iris

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
cat eye now you can see the cat iris
works<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.340> same<00:01:08.580> way<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:10.909> now<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.090> cycles

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
works the same way and now in cycles

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:19.749 
works the same way and now in cycles
preview<00:01:15.710> let's<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.250> next<00:01:17.490> layer<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
preview let's go to the next layer and

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.719 
preview let's go to the next layer and
check<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.180> goat<00:01:21.720> eyeball<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.400> works

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
check the goat eyeball this one works

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.469 
check the goat eyeball this one works
the<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.270> around<00:01:25.189> the<00:01:26.240> shape<00:01:27.240> key

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the other way around the shape key

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:37.010 
the other way around the shape key
closes<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> iris<00:01:28.409> instead

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.760 

and<00:01:38.020> finally<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:39.010> zombie<00:01:39.400> I<00:01:40.260> we<00:01:41.260> have<00:01:41.410> six

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
and finally this zombie I we have six

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.350 
and finally this zombie I we have six
variations<00:01:42.160> like<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.850> other<00:01:43.000> AI<00:01:43.090> types<00:01:45.360> blue

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
variations like the other AI types blue

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.830 
variations like the other AI types blue
eye<00:01:46.420> yellow<00:01:47.110> eye<00:01:47.230> blue<00:01:48.040> decade<00:01:48.460> yellow<00:01:49.150> decade

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.840 

also<00:01:52.840> there's<00:01:53.080> undead<00:01:53.800> orange<00:01:54.370> with<00:01:54.640> bloody

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
also there's undead orange with bloody

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:04.380 
also there's undead orange with bloody
sclera<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.450> black<00:01:56.110> sclera<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:03.700> let's<00:02:04.180> see

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
sclera and black sclera now let's see

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.720 
sclera and black sclera now let's see
how<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.690> textures<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.620> materials<00:02:05.740> work<00:02:11.730> I'm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
how the textures and materials work I'm

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.210 
how the textures and materials work I'm
gonna<00:02:13.180> open<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.690> new<00:02:13.840> window<00:02:14.020> here<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.740> go<00:02:15.040> into

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
gonna open a new window here and go into

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.220 
gonna open a new window here and go into
the<00:02:15.490> node<00:02:15.730> editor<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.270> there's<00:02:19.930> four

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
the node editor so there's four

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.770 
the node editor so there's four
materials<00:02:20.560> per<00:02:21.040> eye<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:22.060> materials<00:02:22.630> are

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
materials per eye and the materials are

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.190 
materials per eye and the materials are
linked<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> objects<00:02:24.190> not<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.790> data<00:02:25.200> this

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
linked to the objects not the data this

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.410 
linked to the objects not the data this
way<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.890> have<00:02:27.130> instance<00:02:27.700> at<00:02:27.820> copies<00:02:28.209> of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
way you can have instance at copies of

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.460 
way you can have instance at copies of
the<00:02:28.630> same<00:02:28.840> eyeball<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:29.920> different<00:02:30.310> shaders

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
the same eyeball with different shaders

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.410 
the same eyeball with different shaders
I'm<00:02:32.470> using<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:33.130> same<00:02:33.400> texture<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.300> all

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
I'm using the same texture for all

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.170 
I'm using the same texture for all
irises<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:35.380> using<00:02:35.800> masks<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.459> modify<00:02:36.940> their

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
irises but using masks to modify their

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.540 
irises but using masks to modify their
color<00:02:37.420> like<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:38.350> dark<00:02:38.650> brown<00:02:38.830> here<00:02:39.100> iris

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
color like this dark brown here iris

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.699 
color like this dark brown here iris
here<00:02:39.760> if<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.330> mute<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.690> color<00:02:40.989> nodes<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.560> can

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
here if I mute the color nodes you can

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.220 
here if I mute the color nodes you can
see<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> original<00:02:42.100> texture<00:02:42.870> let's<00:02:43.870> play<00:02:44.200> a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
see the original texture let's play a

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.820 
see the original texture let's play a
little<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.650> make<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.280> new<00:02:45.550> color<00:02:49.410> some<00:02:50.410> Liz

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
little and make a new color some Liz

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.260 
little and make a new color some Liz
Taylor<00:02:51.310> purple<00:02:51.730> eye<00:02:54.030> there<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.209> go

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.150 

now<00:02:59.140> I'm<00:02:59.320> going<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.710> show<00:02:59.920> you<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.340> RGB<00:03:01.030> masks

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
now I'm going to show you the RGB masks

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.800 
now I'm going to show you the RGB masks
and<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.280> special<00:03:03.610> note<00:03:03.790> group<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.330> extract

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
and the special note group to extract

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.180 
and the special note group to extract
the<00:03:05.080> different<00:03:05.410> channel<00:03:05.770> as<00:03:05.980> masks<00:03:08.010> as<00:03:09.010> you

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
the different channel as masks as you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.400 
the different channel as masks as you
can<00:03:09.340> see<00:03:09.550> each<00:03:09.790> color<00:03:10.210> channel<00:03:10.570> produces<00:03:11.260> a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
can see each color channel produces a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.330 
can see each color channel produces a
different<00:03:11.620> radial<00:03:12.190> gradient<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.160> use

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
different radial gradient you can use

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.730 
different radial gradient you can use
one<00:03:15.610> two<00:03:15.940> or<00:03:15.970> all<00:03:16.210> of<00:03:16.720> them<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.140> make<00:03:17.320> color

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
one two or all of them to make color

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:27.540 
one two or all of them to make color
effects<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.000> iris<00:03:25.680> okay<00:03:26.680> let's<00:03:27.250> talk

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
effects on the iris okay let's talk

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.900 
effects on the iris okay let's talk
about<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:28.150> sclera<00:03:28.570> materials<00:03:29.490> this<00:03:30.490> works<00:03:30.760> in

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
about the sclera materials this works in

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.800 
about the sclera materials this works in
the<00:03:31.000> same<00:03:31.150> way<00:03:31.210> the<00:03:31.840> iris<00:03:32.290> max<00:03:32.530> dose<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.600> used<00:03:34.600> my

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the same way the iris max dose I used my

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.160 
the same way the iris max dose I used my
RGB<00:03:35.320> mask<00:03:35.800> node<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.490> separate<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.150> edit<00:03:37.780> the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
RGB mask node to separate and edit the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.100 
RGB mask node to separate and edit the
three<00:03:38.500> masks<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.310> texture<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:41.020> the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
three masks in the texture one of the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.320 
three masks in the texture one of the
channels<00:03:41.380> have<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:42.010> gradient<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:43.180> other

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
channels have the gradient and the other

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.550 
channels have the gradient and the other
two<00:03:43.600> are<00:03:43.630> vein<00:03:44.140> layers<00:03:45.960> one<00:03:46.960> of<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.230> outer<00:03:47.380> eye

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
two are vein layers one of the outer eye

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.220 
two are vein layers one of the outer eye
materials<00:03:48.310> also<00:03:48.970> uses<00:03:49.300> this<00:03:49.450> technique<00:03:49.960> to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
materials also uses this technique to

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.290 
materials also uses this technique to
add<00:03:50.410> decay<00:03:50.830> and<00:03:51.100> blood<00:03:51.370> for<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.730> zombie<00:03:52.120> eye<00:03:52.150> I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
add decay and blood for the zombie eye I

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.420 
add decay and blood for the zombie eye I
use<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.510> direct<00:03:55.840> mix<00:03:56.080> as<00:03:56.350> an<00:03:56.620> alpha<00:03:56.770> mask<00:03:57.070> and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
use the direct mix as an alpha mask and

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.760 
use the direct mix as an alpha mask and
the<00:03:57.850> separated<00:03:58.390> channels<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.110> add<00:03:59.290> different

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
the separated channels to add different

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.320 
the separated channels to add different
color<00:04:00.040> layers<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:03.130> kind<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.550> give<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.730> cloudy

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
color layers this kind of give a cloudy

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.270 
color layers this kind of give a cloudy
effect<00:04:04.840> like<00:04:05.500> blowing<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.400> blind<00:04:06.670> person's<00:04:07.330> eye

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
effect like blowing a blind person's eye

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.980 
effect like blowing a blind person's eye
so<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.340> can<00:04:09.580> play<00:04:09.790> with<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.180> three<00:04:10.420> channels

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
so you can play with the three channels

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:26.150 
so you can play with the three channels
and<00:04:11.260> give<00:04:11.500> different<00:04:11.770> levels<00:04:12.460> of<00:04:12.640> decay

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.830 

okay<00:04:27.160> let's<00:04:27.550> see<00:04:27.790> their<00:04:28.060> textures<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:30.720> need<00:04:31.720> to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
okay let's see their textures I need to

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.290 
okay let's see their textures I need to
open<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.200> UV<00:04:32.380> editor<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:33.700> is<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:33.970> diffuse

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
open the UV editor this is the diffuse

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.570 
open the UV editor this is the diffuse
map<00:04:34.510> for<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.050> iris<00:04:37.800> I'm<00:04:38.800> working<00:04:39.370> with<00:04:39.520> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
map for the iris I'm working with the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.640 
map for the iris I'm working with the
diffuse<00:04:39.910> map<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.480> a<00:04:40.600> normal<00:04:40.810> map<00:04:41.140> for<00:04:41.530> all

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
diffuse map and a normal map for all

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:50.250 
diffuse map and a normal map for all
irises<00:04:47.760> I'm<00:04:48.760> changing<00:04:49.360> both<00:04:49.630> diffuse<00:04:50.170> and

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
irises I'm changing both diffuse and

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.410 
irises I'm changing both diffuse and
normal<00:04:50.920> by<00:04:51.130> just<00:04:51.430> adjusting<00:04:52.060> the<00:04:52.120> map

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
normal by just adjusting the map

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.020 
normal by just adjusting the map
coordinates<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.440> just<00:04:54.340> need<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.610> move<00:04:54.790> the

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
coordinates I just need to move the

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.870 
coordinates I just need to move the
texture<00:04:55.420> in<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.780> X<00:04:56.230> or<00:04:56.500> Y<00:04:56.830> direction<00:04:56.860> and<00:04:57.580> we

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
texture in the X or Y direction and we

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.570 
texture in the X or Y direction and we
will<00:04:58.060> have<00:04:58.270> another<00:04:58.300> iris<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.200> might<00:04:59.410> image<00:04:59.740> see

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
will have another iris I might image see

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.760 
will have another iris I might image see
the<00:05:01.270> cat<00:05:01.480> texture<00:05:01.990> won't<00:05:02.230> work<00:05:02.410> very<00:05:02.710> good

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
the cat texture won't work very good

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.860 
the cat texture won't work very good
with<00:05:03.100> the<00:05:03.280> gold<00:05:03.640> mesh<00:05:03.910> but<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.330> human<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.840> the
