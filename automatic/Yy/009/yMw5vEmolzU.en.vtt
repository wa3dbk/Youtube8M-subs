they look like and you put a photo in
them<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:40.800> i<00:02:40.860> thought<00:02:41.190> what<00:02:41.430> about

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
them but i thought what about

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.880 
them but i thought what about
inspirational<00:02:42.480> words<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:43.080> decorating<00:02:43.770> them

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
inspirational words or decorating them

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.820 
inspirational words or decorating them
like<00:02:44.130> everybody's<00:02:44.640> doing<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:45.830> wooden

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
like everybody's doing the little wooden

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.730 
like everybody's doing the little wooden
thimbles<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.570> spools<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.230> wooden<00:02:49.470> spools

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
thimbles or the spools the wooden spools

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.800 
thimbles or the spools the wooden spools
so<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.520> thought<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.330> would<00:02:51.450> be<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.570> great<00:02:51.780> idea

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
so I thought that would be a great idea

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.930 
so I thought that would be a great idea
or<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.770> could<00:02:52.950> stack<00:02:53.220> them<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.520> each<00:02:53.670> other

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
or you could stack them on each other

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.400 
or you could stack them on each other
and<00:02:56.120> they<00:02:57.120> stack<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:57.900> then<00:02:58.110> they<00:02:58.200> stay

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
and they stack and then they stay

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.020 
and they stack and then they stay
together<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.100> could<00:02:59.400> build<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.700> tower<00:02:59.910> with

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
together so you could build a tower with

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.240 
together so you could build a tower with
your<00:03:00.300> kids<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:01.890> thought<00:03:02.040> those

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
your kids on it but I just thought those

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.120
