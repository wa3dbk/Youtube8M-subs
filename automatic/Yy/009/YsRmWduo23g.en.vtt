a little spray foam in there ran my

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.369 
a little spray foam in there ran my
wires<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:29.490> light<00:04:29.669> that<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.120> have<00:04:30.449> that<00:04:31.139> just

yellow so I know that's the light and I
could<00:04:36.300> disconnect<00:04:36.599> that<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.229> then<00:04:37.349> just<00:04:37.560> get

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
could disconnect that and then just get

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.339 
could disconnect that and then just get
rid<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.949> that<00:04:38.159> I<00:04:38.580> also<00:04:39.090> have<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.509> blue<00:04:39.749> for<00:04:40.259> the

the fishfinder I can remove that and

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.279 
the fishfinder I can remove that and
this<00:04:56.639> is<00:04:56.819> the<00:04:56.939> transducer<00:04:57.599> deployment<00:04:58.139> arm

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
this is the transducer deployment arm

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.040 
this is the transducer deployment arm
you<00:04:59.189> know<00:04:59.310> put<00:04:59.550> that<00:05:00.180> in<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.449> water<00:05:00.629> and<00:05:00.870> you

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
you know put that in the water and you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.070 
you know put that in the water and you
could<00:05:01.199> get<00:05:01.319> your<00:05:01.409> temperature<00:05:01.979> and<00:05:02.129> your

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
could get your temperature and your

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.019 
could get your temperature and your
depth<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.379> fish<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.919> better<00:05:05.550> accurate

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:06.029 
depth and fish and better accurate

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.730 
depth and fish and better accurate
reading<00:05:06.419> then<00:05:06.599> when<00:05:07.050> you're<00:05:07.169> just<00:05:07.379> put<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.650> in

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
reading then when you're just put it in

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.260 
reading then when you're just put it in

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
the hall of the kayak so that's just a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.399 
the hall of the kayak so that's just a
quick<00:05:12.389> overview<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:14.310> my<00:05:15.150> tarpon<00:05:16.370> 120<00:05:17.370> and
