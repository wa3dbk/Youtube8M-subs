guess that has just stuck with me but

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.499 
guess that has just stuck with me but
this<00:02:08.530> color<00:02:08.890> reminded<00:02:09.399> me<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.550> my<00:02:09.850> mother<00:02:10.119> so

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
this color reminded me of my mother so

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.480 
this color reminded me of my mother so
much<00:02:10.539> because<00:02:11.230> she<00:02:11.440> wears<00:02:11.680> colors<00:02:12.130> like<00:02:12.280> this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
much because she wears colors like this

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.850 
much because she wears colors like this
like<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.030> dark<00:02:13.300> plums<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> dark<00:02:14.470> red

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
like the dark plums and the dark red

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.040
