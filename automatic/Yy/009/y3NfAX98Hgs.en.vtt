00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
this every day and some people find it

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
this every day and some people find it
really<00:01:13.409> hard<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.830> put<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.250> every<00:01:14.520> day<00:01:14.700> or

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
really hard to put it on every day or

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.510 
really hard to put it on every day or
they<00:01:15.450> forget<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.320> something<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:17.460> i

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
they forget or something like that but i

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.440 
they forget or something like that but i
think<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.409> easy<00:01:19.580> because<00:01:20.580> i<00:01:21.000> have

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
think it is so so easy because i have

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.899 
think it is so so easy because i have
combination<00:01:22.200> skin<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
combination skin but it's more on the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.960 
combination skin but it's more on the
dry<00:01:24.720> side<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.320> combination<00:01:25.950> skin<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.670> i<00:01:26.700> guess

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
dry side of combination skin so i guess

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
dry side of combination skin so i guess
by<00:01:27.270> putting<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.320> sunscreen<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
by putting the sunscreen on it's a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.280 
by putting the sunscreen on it's a
little<00:01:30.090> bit<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> relief<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.840> my<00:01:31.020> dry<00:01:31.229> skin
