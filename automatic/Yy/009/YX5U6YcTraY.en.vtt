00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.320
 hello very welcome to the corner of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.200
 mother 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.019
 I am marilyn 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.710
 and today we are going to learn to make thread with 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.710
 paper napkin 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.830
 To do this we need a napkin 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.619
 kitchen since they are quite absorbent 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.439
 let's start folding in half and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.900
 again in half until not 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.060
 we can fold the hand is simply 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.829
 to facilitate the cut as we have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.390
 what to do strips of a centimeter 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.390
 approximately wide 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.310
 since we have them cut we are going to 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.370
 Stretch and in a container with water the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.060
 let's go moistening if necessary 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.970
 we removed the surplus water and a 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 once ready we will start to roll up like this 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.270
 this way 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.979
 i 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.120
 ah 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.800
 the reason for moistening them is for 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.800
 facilitate rolling 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.930
 and also so that they have more 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.200
 flexibility when working with 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.200
 they 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.970
 yes 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.740
 yes 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.520
 I use this thread to do work 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.520
 with relief 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.170
 ah 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.640
 We will have to do the amount that 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.620
 we need for our work since 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.620
 when being humidity they are handled better 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.800
 although if we make many and we have left and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.560
 then we have to always use them 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.950
 We can moisten them again with a 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.950
 spray 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.850
 and here I present one of the works 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.850
 that I have decorated with this type of relief 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.940
 and this is all for today I hope it serves you 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.190
 to decorate many works 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.770
