00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello friends with you again I am Dmitry 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.160
 Yegorov 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.080
 again we are in the warehouses of the store 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.110
 rock air on the street star house 1 and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.929
 today an unusual review of two very 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.490
 interesting novelties and technologies which 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.240
 I 'll tell you now 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.840
 let's start a little from afar for another 20 years 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.269
 back in 1993 when a huge 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.220
 number of classic hip hop albums 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.779
 what I remember telling 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.910
 in almost every reviews where we are 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.369
 talking about this year came out and a lot 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.739
 many sneakers great technology 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.980
 this one was probably comparable by 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.260
 importance with 87 year when it was the same 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
 I will be afraid of this word a lot of new products 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.219
 well have we seen such an interesting 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.289
 ninety-third year well firstly 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.960
 eight jordan and who are very 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.180
 different from their predecessors 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 seventh jordans plus came out so 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.920
 wonderful as a model like nike air 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940
 good light about which we talk a little 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.370
 more 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
 technology hua raid or hu orochi 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.879
 differently they call it like this 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.700
 looks her logo she takes her 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.979
 beginning from the ancient south american 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.640
 sandals indians who were called 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.310
 chief physicians 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.850
 very comfortable sandals and this technology 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.500
 on in many running and basketball 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 running shoes used in particular 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 for example the seventh jordan and but 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.189
 famous bullet got exactly 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.070
 sneakers chlorine che you probably remember 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.840
 like last year we did a review on 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.420
 sneaker chlorine which hybrid 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280
 basketball and low cross country shorter with 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 nike free sole 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.090
 this year, nike pleased us 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.640
 the release of another model from the hua series 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.829
 racha this time karachi like and also with 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.360
 Sole nike free coloring they 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.619
 saved almost completely 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.340
 repeating the original in '93 but already 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.229
 modern sole 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.310
 Well, I must say that chlorine than in general 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.360
 Looks very, very, very 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.719
 organically look at such a system 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.270
 lacing on plastic with such snaps 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.159
 u very original and plus this one here 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.099
 sock where the foot is inserted 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.009
 comfortable sneakers just for 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.550
 years and if suddenly 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.830
 a riot of flowers is not your fad 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.550
 and want something quieter please 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.620
 there are the same but in gray such here 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.780
 hopelessness ashes now fashionable 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.910
 say what else can be answered in these 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.160
 hum orochi gradually at ninety 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.160
 the third year began to be traced 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 The tendency to make the icon to listen is not very 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.220
 big and small 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.530
 Well, as here that is sneakers 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.960
 speak for themselves and so understand 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 and know that this is nike and label them 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.960
 great listen don't necessarily remember yes 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.240
 that for example in the same 95 x 97 hair 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.700
 maxs this idea was brought to 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.040
 you are afraid of this technology to the maximum and 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.590
 drying has become quite small as 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.590
 almost all current running models 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.510
 nike sneakers top orochi light 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.210
 made from nike + technology so we 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.300
 take your ipod and iphone ipad and 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.660
 and run run and report me training 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.130
 we are doing and that's such an alloy 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.800
 The classic model is 93 years old and 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.110
 modern technology we move on to 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.450
 completely new technology 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.330
 fly no i think many of you read 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.850
 the first issue of Kaida magazine if not 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.860
 guys, we read where it was 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.900
 Detailed article about this brand new 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.910
 technology is it so interesting 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.370
 good that now briefly tell you more 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.050
 Once the wire these same sneakers is 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.750
 probably the first in the world 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.790
 knitted sneakers than it is interesting well 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.380
 First of all, they are absolutely soft. 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.760
 if you remove just such a supportive 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.070
 here you can see how soft they are 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.760
 despite being tight and tight 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:51.600
 they are connected weightless it is very thin 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.940
 weaving plus is still almost weightless 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.770
 lunarlon soles and very comfortable on 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.530
 how much we know last london 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.300
 olympiad several runners have already shown 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.340
 really outstanding results 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.959
 it is in these shoes 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.270
 after professional 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.880
 athletes tested them naturally 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.220
 the era of cross-country club approximately 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.050
 can ay que and then all the runners 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.980
 sneakers were so comfortable and 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.769
 so simple 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.500
 that they were adopted and simple 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.810
 people and this is one of those modern 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.400
 models that can be worn around the city 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.650
 absolutely what is called 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.630
 without some conceit but she is not 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.570
 you are very similar to classic running 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.330
 sneakers no this very light very 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.160
 simple shoes back to simplicity me this 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.380
 very much like the movement 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.330
 weightlessness of these sneakers should 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.240
 feel come to the store look 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.340
 try they are lightweight they are light they 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.830
 very comfortable it is really new 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.229
 technology for which the future plus more 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.220
 if suddenly you are a supporter 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:57.289
 Greenpeace live in harmony with nature 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.210
 you will be interested to know what 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.060
 almost completely these sneakers 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.889
 made up of recycled materials 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.410
 the thread itself is made from recycled 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.639
 materials and more so when sneakers 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.940
 maybe stop 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.620
 and then welded to the sole not 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.430
 no residue remains 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.430
 i.e. no scraps of harmful 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.530
 materials in the production process in 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.349
 nature is not thrown away which is also for 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.970
 ecology of course very well such 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.750
 wonderful sneakers i'm here two 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.400
 colors and again as soon 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.830
 the sport thing has become very very 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.720
 popular nike thought about 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.120
 make and everyday option 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.090
 these sneakers and please welcome 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.010
 fly no chuka high silhouette turn 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.530
 medium silhouette of these sneakers 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.030
 this is not running shoes though run 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.190
 I think they will also be relatively 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:53.120
 comfortable and sneakers for every day 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.039
 light breathing wonderful performed 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.250
 what I liked that as far as I know 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:01.010
 while in other Russian stores chuki 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.310
 fly no of sky I didn’t notice of course 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.820
 to be wrong but seeing here was nice 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.159
 surprised 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.430
 Naturally immediately included them in the review 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:13.520
 so take a look and you price them too 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.039
 Pleasantly pleased, it is even less than the price 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.760
 on the fly is not and but such shoes on 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.190
 everyday 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.080
 the same technologies that are in 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.889
 the original fly is not so it is 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.349
 the soles of lunarlon flywire throw off durable 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.930
 plus here is weaving which 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:32.620
 first probably fits any 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:36.320
 Variant legs will be beautiful so here 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.350
 to frame well and they are practically weightless 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.290
 walk all day we enter run jump 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.210
 convenient easy to not get tired in principle when 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.340
 only fly sneakers have appeared no I 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.500
 already wondered what will happen next 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.810
 how will develop this technology 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.730
 but also like what really is already 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.220
 development is already flyknit chukka 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.130
 there are still coaches in terms of and i think that 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.410
 this is only the beginning so friends follow 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.930
 for new technologies do not forget about 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.710
 wear retro sneakers with you
