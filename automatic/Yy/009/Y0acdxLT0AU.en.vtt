black hole said lowest-order are exactly
what<00:00:13.919> you<00:00:13.950> think<00:00:14.400> stuff<00:00:15.000> goes<00:00:15.209> in<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.690> it

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
what you think stuff goes in and it

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.510 
what you think stuff goes in and it
doesn't<00:00:16.349> come<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.009> that's<00:00:17.189> as<00:00:17.340> good<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
doesn't come out and that's as good a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.339 
doesn't come out and that's as good a
definition<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.210> black<00:00:18.390> hole<00:00:18.419> as<00:00:18.840> any<00:00:19.020> and

many of the questions about how exactly

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.670 
many of the questions about how exactly
they<00:00:23.189> grow<00:00:23.489> how<00:00:24.000> do<00:00:24.060> they<00:00:24.270> accrete<00:00:24.630> stuff<00:00:24.960> how

they grow how do they accrete stuff how

they grow how do they accrete stuff how
does<00:00:25.829> that<00:00:25.919> stuff<00:00:26.160> shine<00:00:26.490> all<00:00:27.029> critically

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
does that stuff shine all critically

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.290 
does that stuff shine all critically

extrapolate<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.089> for<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.019> time<00:00:34.260> we're

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:34.589 
extrapolate and for the first time we're

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:36.799 
extrapolate and for the first time we're

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
we're gonna be able to validate or even

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.299 
we're gonna be able to validate or even
more<00:00:39.449> exciting<00:00:39.900> maybe<00:00:40.079> invalidate<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.190> of

operate in practice and that's gonna

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
operate in practice and that's gonna
happen<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.620> brand-new

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
when we do and we release it I expect

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.020 
when we do and we release it I expect
that<00:01:18.929> image<00:01:19.289> to<00:01:19.800> run<00:01:19.979> above<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.459> fold<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.940> the

the<00:01:23.250> EHT<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.849> developing<00:01:24.300> so<00:01:24.479> rapidly<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:25.349> need

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the EHT is developing so rapidly we need

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.820 
the EHT is developing so rapidly we need
to<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.459> large<00:01:27.149> numbers<00:01:27.660> of<00:01:27.690> people<00:01:27.869> working

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
to have large numbers of people working

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.040 
to have large numbers of people working
in<00:01:29.039> concert<00:01:29.580> in<00:01:29.700> organized<00:01:30.179> fashion<00:01:30.450> being

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
in concert in organized fashion being

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.120 
in concert in organized fashion being
prepared<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.560> understand<00:01:32.130> what<00:01:32.819> it<00:01:32.940> gives<00:01:33.060> us

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
prepared to understand what it gives us

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.760 
prepared to understand what it gives us
so<00:01:35.130> perimeter<00:01:35.520> already<00:01:36.000> has<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:37.140> strong<00:01:37.470> focus

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so perimeter already has a strong focus

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
so perimeter already has a strong focus
on<00:01:38.099> black<00:01:38.369> hole<00:01:38.580> physics<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.539> think<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.959> one

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
on black hole physics and I think is one

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
on black hole physics and I think is one
of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.289> best<00:01:40.470> places<00:01:40.800> for<00:01:41.069> black<00:01:41.459> hole

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
of the best places for black hole

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.510 
of the best places for black hole
physics<00:01:41.940> in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> world<00:01:43.050> today<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
physics in the world today and that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.229 
physics in the world today and that
means<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.060> fantastic<00:01:45.840> place<00:01:45.989> to<00:01:46.679> perform

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.239 
means it's a fantastic place to perform

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.059 
means it's a fantastic place to perform
EHT<00:01:48.239> analysis<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.679> we<00:01:49.800> have<00:01:49.950> this

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
EHT analysis and so we have this

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.639 
EHT analysis and so we have this
opportunity<00:01:50.369> now<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:51.300> play<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.840> significant

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
opportunity now to play a significant

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.619 
opportunity now to play a significant
role<00:01:52.709> a<00:01:52.860> substantial<00:01:53.610> role<00:01:53.789> in<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.390> event

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:54.629 
role a substantial role in the event

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.359 
role a substantial role in the event

not<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.940> a<00:01:59.970> theoretical<00:02:00.479> physics<00:02:00.720> institute

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
not what a theoretical physics institute

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.109 
not what a theoretical physics institute
does<00:02:01.289> but<00:02:01.739> what<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.160> do<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.789> can<00:02:02.879> take

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
does but what we can do is we can take

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.699 
does but what we can do is we can take
that<00:02:03.270> data<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:04.050> we<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.289> turn<00:02:04.440> it<00:02:04.590> into

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
that data and we can turn it into

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.729 
that data and we can turn it into
science<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.660> at<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.899> juncture<00:02:07.349> given

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
science and so at this juncture given

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.199 
science and so at this juncture given
the<00:02:07.860> fact<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.399> expect<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.000> have

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
the fact that we expect to have

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.780 
the fact that we expect to have
transformative<00:02:09.989> data<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> next<00:02:11.250> year<00:02:11.520> or

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
transformative data in the next year or

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.420 
transformative data in the next year or
two<00:02:11.989> we<00:02:12.989> absolutely<00:02:13.349> need<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:14.010> talking

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
two we absolutely need to be talking

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.460 
two we absolutely need to be talking
about<00:02:14.700> bringing<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.510> people<00:02:16.140> who<00:02:16.349> have

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
about bringing in people who have

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.080 
about bringing in people who have
already<00:02:16.650> obtained<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.160> degree<00:02:17.280> people<00:02:17.760> already

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
already obtained a degree people already

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.119 
already obtained a degree people already
have<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> strong<00:02:18.750> skillset<00:02:19.469> and<00:02:19.680> assume

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
have a strong skillset and assume

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.530 
have a strong skillset and assume
positions<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.849> leadership<00:02:20.879> in<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
positions of leadership in the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.630 
positions of leadership in the
collaboration

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
collaboration

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
collaboration
and<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.000> an<00:02:24.120> opportunity<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:24.780> Canada<00:02:25.440> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
and this is an opportunity for Canada to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.710 
and this is an opportunity for Canada to
become<00:02:26.100> heavily<00:02:26.580> involved<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.570> an

become heavily involved in an
opportunity<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.590> at<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.860> reasonable

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
opportunity to do it at a reasonable

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.670 
opportunity to do it at a reasonable
cost<00:02:29.630> Canada<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.080> by<00:02:31.230> funding<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
cost Canada can do it by funding the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.460 
cost Canada can do it by funding the
analysis<00:02:32.250> effort<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.760> essentially<00:02:33.470> being
