then going to a juvenile detention

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
then going to a juvenile detention
center<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.210> as<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.600> right<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:42.930> still

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
center and as of right now I'm still

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.080 
center and as of right now I'm still
kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> unclear<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:43.829> she<00:00:43.950> actually<00:00:44.129> did<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
kind of unclear what she actually did to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.430 
kind of unclear what she actually did to
get<00:00:45.270> her<00:00:45.390> sent<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.780> juvenile<00:00:46.140> detention

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
get her sent to this juvenile detention

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.690 
get her sent to this juvenile detention
center<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> feeling<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.610> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
center so I have a feeling it's going to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
center so I have a feeling it's going to
be<00:00:47.789> revealed<00:00:48.239> slowly<00:00:48.629> throughout<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> story

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
be revealed slowly throughout the story

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610 
be revealed slowly throughout the story
and<00:00:50.059> it'll<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.329> really<00:00:51.510> cool<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.110> then<00:00:52.350> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and it'll be really cool and then just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.700

about<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.949> girl<00:04:11.310> who<00:04:11.669> was<00:04:11.849> sexually<00:04:12.090> assaulted

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
about a girl who was sexually assaulted

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.809 
about a girl who was sexually assaulted
at<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.959> party<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.560> think<00:04:13.859> it<00:04:13.980> is<00:04:14.099> her<00:04:14.340> assaulter

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
at a party I think it is her assaulter

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.210 
at a party I think it is her assaulter
is<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.329> golden<00:04:15.810> boy<00:04:15.989> who<00:04:16.289> is<00:04:16.470> popular

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
is like this golden boy who is popular

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.099 
is like this golden boy who is popular
guy<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.030> nobody<00:04:18.419> believes<00:04:18.750> her<00:04:18.930> though

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
guy and so nobody believes her though

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.390 
guy and so nobody believes her though
like<00:04:19.260> no<00:04:19.440> he<00:04:19.680> wouldn't<00:04:19.889> do<00:04:20.039> something<00:04:20.220> like

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
like no he wouldn't do something like

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.159 
like no he wouldn't do something like
that<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.329> kind<00:04:21.539> of<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.810> has<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.049> do

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
that and so it kind of just has to do

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:22.879 
that and so it kind of just has to do
with<00:04:22.289> after<00:04:22.680> my

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879
