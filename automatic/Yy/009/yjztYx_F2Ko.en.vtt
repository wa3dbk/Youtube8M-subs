wizard on this USB stick will actually

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.250 
wizard on this USB stick will actually
mount<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.580> an<00:00:17.970> Ethernet<00:00:18.420> port<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.020> uses

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
mount as an Ethernet port so it uses

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.910 
mount as an Ethernet port so it uses
some<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.770> built-in<00:00:20.160> drivers<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.910> windows

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
some of the built-in drivers in windows

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.810 
some of the built-in drivers in windows
there<00:00:22.920> we're<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.580> through<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
there we're just going through the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.589 
there we're just going through the
normal<00:00:24.720> install<00:00:25.140> process<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.420> once<00:00:27.420> that's

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
normal install process and once that's

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.089 
normal install process and once that's
all<00:00:27.840> finished<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.410> could<00:00:28.529> open<00:00:28.740> control

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
all finished you could open control

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
all finished you could open control
panels<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.840> appears

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
panels and see that it just appears

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.410 
panels and see that it just appears
under<00:00:31.980> your<00:00:32.130> normal<00:00:32.550> network<00:00:32.910> connections

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
under your normal network connections

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.740 
under your normal network connections
and<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:34.320> also<00:00:34.559> mounts<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.399> serial<00:00:36.090> port<00:00:36.420> which

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and it also mounts a serial port which

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.350 
and it also mounts a serial port which
can<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.079> used<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.440> debugging<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.850> device<00:00:39.149> in

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
can be used for debugging the device in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
can be used for debugging the device in
real<00:00:39.510> life<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:40.800> showing<00:00:41.040> running<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
real life here we're showing running the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.229 
real life here we're showing running the
serial<00:00:42.120> port<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.520> has<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> little

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
serial port and it just has a little

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.090 
serial port and it just has a little
menu<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> change<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> some

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
menu if you want to change some of some

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.049 
menu if you want to change some of some
of<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.370> options<00:00:51.980> which<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.190> brings<00:00:53.460> us<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
of the options which then brings us to

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
of the options which then brings us to
actually<00:00:54.360> using<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.550> over<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> network<00:00:58.550> so

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
actually using this over a network so

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.369 
actually using this over a network so
there<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.850> can<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.989> network

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
there you can see it's in network

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
there you can see it's in network
connections<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.420> modify<00:01:03.750> some<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
connections and you can modify some of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
connections and you can modify some of
the<00:01:04.199> properties<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.890> needed<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.530> since<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the properties as needed and since it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
the properties as needed and since it
just<00:01:08.640> matches<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.119> normal<00:01:09.510> Ethernet<00:01:09.960> port<00:01:10.229> you

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
just matches a normal Ethernet port you

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.530 
just matches a normal Ethernet port you
can<00:01:10.770> even<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.010> wireshark<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.330> makes

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
can even use wireshark on it which makes

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.190 
can even use wireshark on it which makes
debugging<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.470> easy<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:15.049> Wireshark<00:01:16.049> will

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
debugging really easy and Wireshark will

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.670 
debugging really easy and Wireshark will
actually<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.860> both<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.790> 802<00:01:18.540> 15<00:01:19.259> dot<00:01:19.439> 4

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
actually see both the 802 15 dot 4

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.539 
actually see both the 802 15 dot 4
packets<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:21.119> ipv6<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.460> example

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
packets and the ipv6 so as an example

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.399 
packets and the ipv6 so as an example
this<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> other<00:01:24.600> part<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> atmel

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this is the other part of the atmel

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 
this is the other part of the atmel
raven<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.009> one<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:27.210> boards

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
raven it's one of the little boards

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.530 
raven it's one of the little boards
there<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.650> pirate<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:30.210> some

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
there you pirate it on and you see some

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.890 
there you pirate it on and you see some
neighbor<00:01:30.930> advertisements<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.610> ipv6<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
neighbor advertisements the ipv6 and the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.609 
neighbor advertisements the ipv6 and the
raw<00:01:34.079> 802<00:01:34.680> dot<00:01:34.890> 15<00:01:35.280> dot<00:01:35.460> 4<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.320> there's<00:01:37.530> an

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
raw 802 dot 15 dot 4 so then there's an

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
raw 802 dot 15 dot 4 so then there's an
example<00:01:38.040> after<00:01:38.159> doing<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.850> few<00:01:39.119> lines<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> setup

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
example after doing a few lines of setup

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.499 
example after doing a few lines of setup
you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.020> simply<00:01:40.380> ping<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.490> Raven<00:01:41.970> board<00:01:42.180> so

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you can simply ping that Raven board so

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.580 
you can simply ping that Raven board so
here's<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.840> running<00:01:43.380> ping<00:01:43.619> from<00:01:43.979> windows

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
here's just running ping from windows

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.359 
here's just running ping from windows
and<00:01:48.409> there<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> see<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.740> pains<00:01:50.040> going

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and there you see the pains going

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
and there you see the pains going
through<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.750> only<00:01:51.899> about<00:01:52.020> 30

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
through and it's only about 30

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
through and it's only about 30
millisecond<00:01:53.240> time<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:56.210> finally<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
millisecond time there and finally the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
millisecond time there and finally the
really<00:01:57.659> cool<00:01:57.840> thing<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.310> run<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
really cool thing is you can just run a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.609 
really cool thing is you can just run a
web<00:01:59.759> server<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.299> those<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.960> Raven<00:02:01.290> boards

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
web server on those little Raven boards

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.950 
web server on those little Raven boards
so<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.520> Windows<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.360> put<00:02:03.659> your<00:02:03.750> web

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
so on Windows you just put your web

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560 
so on Windows you just put your web
address<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.590> Firefox<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:05.759> whichever<00:02:06.180> browser

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
address in Firefox or whichever browser

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:17.200 
address in Firefox or whichever browser
you<00:02:06.810> wish<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.110> use<00:02:07.910> hit<00:02:08.910> enter<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.270 

you
