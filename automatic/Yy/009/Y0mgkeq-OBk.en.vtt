103 its defenses 80 special tech 70
special<00:00:18.270> defensive<00:00:18.720> 70<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.350> its<00:00:19.470> speed<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.770> 92

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
special defensive 70 and its speed is 92

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580 
special defensive 70 and its speed is 92
so<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.720> its<00:00:21.840> defenses<00:00:22.289> are<00:00:22.439> all

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so you can see its defenses are all

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.620 
so you can see its defenses are all
rights<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.369> got<00:00:23.550> pretty<00:00:24.029> fast<00:00:24.300> speed

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
rights and it's got pretty fast speed

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.810 
rights and it's got pretty fast speed
and<00:00:24.960> pretty<00:00:25.230> good<00:00:25.380> attacks<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.099> we're<00:00:26.670> going

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
and pretty good attacks so we're going

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.720 
and pretty good attacks so we're going
to<00:00:26.880> build<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.240> move<00:00:27.420> set<00:00:27.720> around<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.730> they

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to build a move set around that they

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.060 
to build a move set around that they
give<00:00:29.910> them<00:00:30.000> an<00:00:30.179> infant<00:00:30.539> h<00:00:30.810> er<00:00:30.960> that's<00:00:31.740> high

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
give them an infant h er that's high

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.760 
give them an infant h er that's high
defense<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.640> low<00:00:32.790> special<00:00:33.239> attack<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:34.440> kind

defense and low special attack to kind

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.430 
defense and low special attack to kind
of<00:00:34.829> boost<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.280> defenses<00:00:36.000> they're<00:00:36.440> his

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
of boost it defenses they're his

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
abilities could be chloral foot

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.549 
abilities could be chloral foot
chlorophyll<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.780> you'll<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.110> why<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
chlorophyll and you'll see why in a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.959 
chlorophyll and you'll see why in a
second<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.430> we're<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> give<00:00:41.790> him<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
second and we're going to give him a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.650 
second and we're going to give him a
focus<00:00:42.390> sash<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.989> he<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.350> does<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.920> two

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
focus sash because he just does have two

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.170 
focus sash because he just does have two
times<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:46.110> weaknesses<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> pretty

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
times for weaknesses I think you pretty

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
times for weaknesses I think you pretty
much<00:00:48.300> need<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> stick<00:00:49.079> focus<00:00:49.469> sash<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.890> there

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
much need to stick focus sash on there

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.040 
much need to stick focus sash on there
because<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:51.030> fire<00:00:51.270> attack<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.809> flying

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
because one fire attack one flying

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
because one fire attack one flying
attack<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.620> he<00:00:52.680> might<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.129> dead<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
attack and he might be dead so you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.389 
attack and he might be dead so you
should<00:00:54.629> probably<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.160> we're<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.219> put

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
should probably do that we're gonna put

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.819 
should probably do that we're gonna put
250<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> an<00:00:57.090> attack<00:00:57.390> 252<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> special<00:00:58.559> defense

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
250 to an attack 252 a special defense

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
250 to an attack 252 a special defense
and<00:00:59.250> foreign<00:00:59.280> speed<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.020> he's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and foreign speed this is because he's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
and foreign speed this is because he's
already<00:01:01.559> fast<00:01:01.859> enough<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.699> didn't<00:01:03.030> want<00:01:03.149> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
already fast enough so I didn't want to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.719 
already fast enough so I didn't want to
add<00:01:03.329> any<00:01:03.539> more<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.899> speed<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.220> did<00:01:05.489> want<00:01:05.670> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
add any more to speed but I did want to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.760 
add any more to speed but I did want to
focus<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.090> his<00:01:06.330> defenses<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.080> he<00:01:07.200> doesn't<00:01:07.619> run

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
focus on his defenses so he doesn't run

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.530 
focus on his defenses so he doesn't run
into<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> problem<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.330> know<00:01:09.420> being

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
into the problem of you know being

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.560 
into the problem of you know being
knocked<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.049> by<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.590> times<00:01:10.920> four<00:01:11.189> move<00:01:11.570> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
knocked out by one times four move so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
knocked out by one times four move so
that's<00:01:13.080> why<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> got<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> impish<00:01:13.890> nature

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that's why you got the impish nature

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.130 
that's why you got the impish nature
type<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> 252<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> special<00:01:15.900> defense

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
type of the 252 and special defense

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.330 
type of the 252 and special defense
should<00:01:16.439> make<00:01:16.619> him<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.130> more

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
should make him a little bit more

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 
should make him a little bit more
defensive<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:17.880> he<00:01:18.090> normally<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:19.439> 252

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
than chlorophyll is going to have it

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.420 
than chlorophyll is going to have it
double<00:01:55.979> its<00:01:56.130> speed<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.670> it'll<00:01:56.790> be<00:01:56.820> faster<00:01:57.630> but

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
double its speed so it'll be faster but

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.899 
double its speed so it'll be faster but
be<00:01:59.430> careful<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.619> sunny<00:02:01.619> day<00:02:01.920> also<00:02:02.189> boosts
