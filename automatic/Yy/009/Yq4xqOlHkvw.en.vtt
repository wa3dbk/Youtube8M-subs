00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.809
 back to our second class now 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.490
 We are going to talk about the habilitation. 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 let's know some terms and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.920
 settings related to enabling pp 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.900
 permission to direct permission 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.750
 to address refers to 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.519
 provisional authorization which may be in 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.660
 category a in category d or even 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.600
 categories a and b 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:43.140
 simultaneously another term is the acc 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 authorization to drive mopeds 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.980
 this type of housing is specific to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.239
 driving mopeds which are 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.989
 mopeds 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.960
 we'll know in a little while the cce 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 will be provisional acc 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.430
 valid for one year 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 after one year since you do not commit 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.350
 no serious or very serious 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.590
 whether it is a repeat offender of average 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.020
 you can request the change of your turn 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.580
 and provisional in the final sentence 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.110
 a third term related to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.150
 qualification is the cnh national portfolio of 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.270
 enabling 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.920
 reference is usually made to cnh as 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.920
 being the definitive authorization 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.009
 therefore for the ends of the hour that we should 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.090
 to consider it as a qualification 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.280
 definitive recapping then ppd 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.130
 always will be a provisional authorization 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.790
 the ccc will be provisional in its first 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.100
 year 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.450
 soon after will be definitive acc and cnh 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.189
 qualification will always be considered 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.680
 final 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.340
 of course that in your habilitation you can 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.290
 have b and c 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.750
 simultaneously not being necessary to 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.259
 the issue of a document for each 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.060
 of these qualifications 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.760
 we talked earlier about the acc 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.730
 authorization to drive a moped 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.530
 this generates 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.769
 in most of the candidates I believe 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.970
 may all be doubtful at first 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.769
 and it is precisely on this that we go 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.720
 speak definition of moped now 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.200
 scooter and motorcycle learning 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:33.220
 differentiate these vehicles here 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.370
 moped is a motorized cycle of two 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.519
 or three wheels with a cylinder capacity not exceeding 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 to 50 cubic centimeters and speed 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.370
 maximum of 50 kilometers per hour 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.459
 the two-wheel moped moped 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.590
 driven by a driver in position 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:59.440
 last sitting motorcycle vehicle 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.230
 self-propelled two-wheeled vehicle driven by a 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.870
 driver in assembled position 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.910
 very well observed is that the image of 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.340
 each of these vehicles we need 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.750
 know how to distinguish between them 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.629
 through the terms described here in 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.209
 front first thing you need 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:23.739
 observe between these three vehicles 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:28.000
 the moped it is a vehicle of two or more 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:35.919
 three wheels will observe while the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.540
 two-wheeled motorcycle and motorcycle two 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.700
 wheels 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.970
 we also know that there is a 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.349
 quadricycle that requires no 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.349
 was not put here because it is not the 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.329
 in case of doubt of distinction between a 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.620
 and another quadricycle is totally 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.019
 different from these vehicles here now 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.970
 between these three there is always the doubt whether 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.329
 scooter motorcycle first promoter 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.120
 thing this if the engine two or three wheels 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:05.200
 motorcycle 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.750
 wheels the moped he differentiates himself 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.260
 also on the motorcycle scooter 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.109
 for this reason , 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.859
 maximum 50 cc and speed 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.789
 maximum manufacturing capacity of 50 kilometers 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.250
 per hour 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.419
 It's the famous 50's, it's only 50 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.919
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.900
 fifty cubic centimeters 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.180
 50 miles per hour on a motor scooter 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.699
 self-propelled two-wheel drive vehicle 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.479
 driver in any sitting position 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.610
 difference in motorcycle scooter is 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.530
 just it here 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.199
 the scooter you drive into position 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.810
 sitting and motorcycle opposition will 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.600
 What difference is it on the scooter when 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.699
 You sit and you can find the 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.130
 your knees meet one with the 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.889
 another motorcycle in not one knee 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.650
 side of the other and characterizes them 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.810
 the mount you rode in the vehicle 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:05.330
 while the scooter you're sitting on 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.090
 there is no distinction between 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.229
 such vehicles by engine power or 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.380
 velocity 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.440
 this happens only from the moped in 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.430
 relation to the other two in the 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.130
 other two 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.060
 the difference is only in the position in 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:25.430
 that this vehicle is driven seated and 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.870
 assembled and pay attention to what is 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.840
 exactly here that will make 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.949
 difference when you respond to this 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.949
 type of question in evidence
