00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
wanted to line up with this line here

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.200 
wanted to line up with this line here
some<00:01:59.159> boys<00:01:59.460> just<00:02:00.329> move<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.630> down<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> bit<00:02:02.210> that's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
some boys just move it down a bit that's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.620 
some boys just move it down a bit that's
pretty<00:02:03.750> good<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.180> I'm<00:02:06.180> also<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
pretty good and I'm also going to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.359 
pretty good and I'm also going to
convert<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> civil<00:02:07.619> shift<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.220> were

convert this to a civil shift you were

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.410 
convert this to a civil shift you were
ever<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.910> symbols<00:02:10.220> again<00:02:11.220> graphic<00:02:11.970> matching

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
ever to symbols again graphic matching

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.760 
ever to symbols again graphic matching
to<00:02:12.540> change<00:02:12.810> numbers

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
to change numbers

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.810 
to change numbers
360<00:02:14.760> s<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.890> other<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.460> want

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
360 s just like the other one I want

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.340 
360 s just like the other one I want
these<00:02:17.940> two<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.150> light<00:02:18.390> up<00:02:18.570> basically<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.170> same

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
these two to light up basically the same

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.570 
these two to light up basically the same
so<00:02:19.560> I'm<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.830> do<00:02:19.890> exactly<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.550> same

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
so I'm going to do exactly the same

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.500 
so I'm going to do exactly the same
thing<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.600> I<00:02:21.660> did<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.020> fridge<00:02:22.250> alpha<00:02:23.510> zero

you also have to go to the other p frame

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.720 
you also have to go to the other p frame
you<00:03:27.510> made<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.959> convert<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> symbol<00:03:29.640> as

you made and convert that to a symbol as

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.260 
you made and convert that to a symbol as
well<00:03:31.100> so<00:03:32.100> it's<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.610> end<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.850> world<00:03:33.090> if

in<00:04:29.000> order<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.300> make<00:04:29.419> that<00:04:29.630> transition<00:04:29.870> smooth

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
in order to make that transition smooth

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.990 
in order to make that transition smooth
you<00:04:30.560> also<00:04:30.800> have<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:30.979> make<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.370> into<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.699> little

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
you also have to make that into a little

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.390 
you also have to make that into a little
tween<00:04:32.180> I'm<00:04:32.500> going<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.560> go<00:04:33.650> to<00:04:33.710> little<00:04:33.979> one<00:04:34.099> and

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
tween I'm going to go to little one and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.409 
tween I'm going to go to little one and
go<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.300> very<00:04:35.509> end<00:04:35.690> 115<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:37.430> on<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.610> 115th

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
go to the very end 115 so on the 115th

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.499 
go to the very end 115 so on the 115th
frame<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:39.770> words<00:04:40.009> don't<00:04:40.430> look<00:04:40.729> be<00:04:41.060> completely

out of the text box and in order to make

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.390 
out of the text box and in order to make
that<00:04:44.419> a<00:04:44.449> smooth<00:04:44.720> transition<00:04:45.169> have<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.250> make

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
that a smooth transition have to make

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.629 
that a smooth transition have to make
that<00:04:46.580> emotion<00:04:46.970> between<00:04:47.060> as<00:04:47.330> well<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:49.340> if<00:04:49.520> you
