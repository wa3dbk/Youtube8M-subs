00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 remember to do engraving on your 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.190
 phone it was on the show I thought 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.740
 What device can not buy yourself 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 home to do well for 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 engrave yourself 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 or for friends in general tvik small business 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.089
 it turns out you can here is small 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.100
 inexpensive 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.230
 engrave is also called 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.630
 engraving shorter machines there 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.340
 more expensive this one costs less than 120 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.590
 dollars they are all set the same 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.800
 there is one engine that moves 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.300
 pad well or moves in general to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.890
 one plane and second engine 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.780
 which moves the laser to another 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.450
 the plane here moves the playground 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.059
 avatar moves of course there are vases 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.219
 vases come in different capacities on this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:48.120
 it is written by the way that's clean eyes too 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.579
 written I can not understand how much he is on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 in fact it doesn't matter the link is in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.170
 parcel description can read 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.309
 fully technical specifications 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.440
 it turns out he is a computer on a tanker 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.390
 installed installed application 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.329
 look here painted an apple on 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 In fact , our hub connect this 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.409
 computer one cable will kill 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 power feeds this engrave and by 2 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.810
 There is a management but here there is still 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.299
 such is the inscription templ studio there 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 written this is a secret development from 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.990
 apple we now know that they will release 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.479
 following hours which they are completely 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.210
 recently introduced they will be engaged 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 Now such a side at all like 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.509
 some kind of thing is generally a mechanism 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.280
 control with a computer signal and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.040
 controls two motors 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960
 and the power is returnable but in general the list 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.049
 all materials this works with 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.579
 engrave and also in the item description and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.240
 still in the complete set go here such fishing rods 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.450
 so I donâ€™t really want my eyes there 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.250
 will be metal yes 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.100
 can be reflected somewhere and right in 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.740
 eye so we wear glasses and go 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.929
 burn out we have a new heart 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.500
 frame so decided to print started 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.810
 xiaomi 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.020
 a rabbit if you do not know to go down 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.090
 more accurately survive not print all put on 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.159
 glasses 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.690
 no you closed your eyes at all i hope 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:14.739
 the camera will not get anything become smoke 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:24.130
 went see how it smells delicious like 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:30.670
 as if it burns itself I would say the process 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:33.130
 slow enough supplied me apparently 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.390
 on the subconscious mind that maza works here 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:49.329
 eye all flew not only come on me 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:53.470
 see the other side and self suggestion that 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:55.620
 I got Lazar's eye protection from 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.450
 Landro hit the eye and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.840
 first experiment but due to the fact that 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.930
 this avaz tree still turned out to be 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.989
 powerful little time manages to look for 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.280
 you can get out of it 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.200
 you can print than now 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.970
 the contour we put is checked than it is possible 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.549
 burn found some kind of metal 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.799
 door and but something fell off somewhere to us 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.740
 could not give normal meters and so 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.560
 on it you will go on burning 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.360
 there we burn eyes released let's 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.200
 let's move the platform so let a little 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.540
 warmed up there 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:37.160
 and move a little bit 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.160
 turn off our eyes see what happens 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.080
 no on this metal burns out 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.180
 you saw the wood yesterday perfectly 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.760
 burning holes the unit is foam 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.990
 you may still stink 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:05.960
 case of a sudden he instantly prozhzhat 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:08.790
 eyes and go turn on not understand not 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.640
 copes yes no focus anointed his wife 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.690
 my wife's track I don't want him too big 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.549
 This he dispels in this brand as 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.549
 now see burn the hole 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.520
 he doesn't take foam 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.520
 Well, the question on the tree is that 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:37.750
 hanging on a tree 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.180
 what are you saying that if he's there through and through 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.669
 dinner after through 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.030
 nothing there is no foam no longer 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:53.770
 beret 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:57.330
 We look that here it for a hogwash if is 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.330
 yes here on this draws 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.840
 not just draws in principle thin 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.050
 material can be burned through then 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.289
 there can be cut out figures and what we have 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:23.240
 still cardboard card well cardboard for all 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.240
 must take where he went barrels 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.000
 you can need you need the content we really 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.669
 it turns out it's just 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.470
 burner can be on wood and plastic 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:46.120
 metal does not take into this for some reason carries 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:51.349
 but on thin ones what do it verdict what 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.720
 you can expect very raw software boards 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:56.270
 wheels damp face will update 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.710
 dream is downloaded no maybe other software 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:03.620
 can be used quite so on his 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:09.409
 the phone is nothing scary oh so so 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.680
 cool then where did the main thing go right through 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.680
 burn through 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.860
 something was drawn but very slowly 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:22.550
 slow is not a powerful laser do not compare here 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.479
 so that this is engraved in 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.479
 no area
