00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
evasive action err blocking because it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.600

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610

guy well I think with his few laps left

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.970 
guy well I think with his few laps left
I<00:05:55.630> think<00:05:55.690> it's<00:05:56.080> you<00:05:56.290> know<00:05:56.410> I<00:05:56.440> don't<00:05:56.770> think<00:05:56.920> the

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
I think it's you know I don't think the

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.650 
I think it's you know I don't think the
tires<00:05:57.220> are<00:05:57.490> gonna<00:05:57.580> mean<00:05:57.850> a<00:05:57.880> huge<00:05:58.240> difference

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
tires are gonna mean a huge difference

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.900 
tires are gonna mean a huge difference
but<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:59.080> think<00:05:59.200> those<00:06:00.100> three<00:06:00.250> Hendrick<00:06:00.550> cars<00:06:00.760> up

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
but I think those three Hendrick cars up

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.130 
but I think those three Hendrick cars up
they're<00:06:01.030> gonna<00:06:01.120> play<00:06:01.330> a<00:06:01.360> factor<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:01.900> I<00:06:01.930> just

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.140 
they're gonna play a factor and I just

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.330 
they're gonna play a factor and I just
it's<00:06:02.410> hard<00:06:02.530> to<00:06:02.680> see<00:06:02.830> how<00:06:02.920> it's<00:06:03.040> gonna<00:06:03.100> shake

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
it's hard to see how it's gonna shake

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.860 
it's hard to see how it's gonna shake
out<00:06:03.520> but<00:06:03.670> the<00:06:03.730> 20<00:06:03.970> has<00:06:04.060> been<00:06:04.150> stout<00:06:04.420> down<00:06:04.720> there
