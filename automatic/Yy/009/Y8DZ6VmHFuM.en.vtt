00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
doesn't have exe and that is because you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that doesn't really matter it should say

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.539 
that doesn't really matter it should say
character<00:01:03.539> editor<00:01:03.949> but<00:01:04.949> most<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
character editor but most of you
