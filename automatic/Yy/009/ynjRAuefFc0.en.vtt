00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
certain places in a certain order and if

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.030 
certain places in a certain order and if
you<00:04:05.470> defeat<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.860> boss<00:04:06.069> too<00:04:07.000> early<00:04:07.769> they<00:04:08.769> have<00:04:08.920> to

defeat later on in to advance the
storyline<00:04:11.200> to<00:04:11.440> get<00:04:11.590> new<00:04:11.739> characters<00:04:12.160> then<00:04:12.459> you

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
storyline to get new characters then you

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.520 
storyline to get new characters then you
basically<00:04:13.239> break<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.810> chain<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.170> can't<00:04:14.380> get

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
basically break the chain you can't get

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.620 
basically break the chain you can't get
more<00:04:14.650> characters<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.180> got<00:04:16.269> to<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.419> really

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
more characters so you got to be really

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.219 
more characters so you got to be really
