00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
magnetic sensor because obviously that's

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.070 
magnetic sensor because obviously that's
proven<00:06:08.429> itself<00:06:08.789> and<00:06:09.240> I<00:06:09.689> don't<00:06:09.929> feel<00:06:10.020> like

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080

but there it is I don't know if the

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.749 
but there it is I don't know if the
biggest<00:06:15.599> difference<00:06:16.139> is<00:06:16.349> the<00:06:16.830> type<00:06:17.399> of<00:06:17.430> rubber

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
biggest difference is the type of rubber

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.510 
biggest difference is the type of rubber
that<00:06:17.849> I'm<00:06:18.379> using<00:06:19.379> on<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:19.830> stopper<00:06:20.219> there<00:06:20.369> or

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
that I'm using on the stopper there or

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.739 
that I'm using on the stopper there or
what<00:06:20.699> that<00:06:22.069> works<00:06:23.069> perfect<00:06:23.490> one<00:06:23.909> pedal<00:06:24.149> both

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:24.749 
what that works perfect one pedal both

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:34.110 
what that works perfect one pedal both
both<00:06:25.529> kits
