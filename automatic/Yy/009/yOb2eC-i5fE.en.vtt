00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.190
 Hello everyone, glad to welcome you on 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 channel game revizor and with you I pathos 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.379
 This review is dedicated to the game shadow company 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.690
 emma shooters in russia game from gives 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.750
 innovation companies and at the last exhibition 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.590
 igromir 2012 game presented as 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.320
 revolutionary 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.510
 what did I manage to visit zbt i 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 tell you what there saw such 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.430
 and is she really 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.129
 perhaps start with a revolutionary 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.170
 that when she just ran from me 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.050
 there was a strong feeling of deja vu 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.879
 the fact is that all the menus are done in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.519
 the style is the same as it is done 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.980
 eg point blank or crossfire and 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.260
 or painted sevan that is absolutely 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.690
 identical design we first choose 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.940
 server there we choose one of the areas in 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.739
 areas we choose rooms in rooms 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.289
 we are already waiting for our enemies of which 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.960
 we have to fight in general, nothing 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.359
 new here is not well in principle this menu 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.580
 and nothing really revolutionary there 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.620
 wait and not worth it just weird 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.330
 claim that they were playing evolutionary somehow 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.080
 don't bother changing at least a little 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 menu 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 oh well everything would be fine but when i 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.700
 got into a fight that sense of movement is not that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.130
 which is not lost but intensified immediately in two 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.340
 I was back at some Olya field 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.350
 point blank olya operations i have in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.750
 hands were weapons which is designed 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.240
 about the same graffiti and in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.190
 In principle, all zones looked like 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.110
 It was in the same point form and in the same 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.360
 survey 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 the only thing really 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.230
 Add this to the fact that we can do 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.940
 peculiar let's call them a tackle when you 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.740
 run push the button and your 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.110
 the character falls on his back and some 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.360
 time rolls and then rises again 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.580
 it could be called revolutionary 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.100
 if not for one thing 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.350
 it was already in the warface and warface 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.350
 it was made much more interesting 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.940
 juicy and there it was part of the gameplay then 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.520
 have we often had to really 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.160
 rolls up to get something there 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.260
 the enemy here is completely stupid 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.750
 occupation because when you rolls up 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.060
 you are absolutely helpless for but i 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.340
 I donâ€™t know seconds maybe 3 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.600
 shoot you pull up still hold 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.900
 some time on the floor 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.900
 during this time I was killed by enemies therefore 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.750
 not only is it not so new 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.420
 so also absolutely pointless 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.360
 just no need to copy 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.580
 don't need it there well rather it could 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.590
 need to be but it's there so stupid and 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.480
 did what I'd rather prefer just 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.270
 run around an obstacle than roll 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.430
 below them about the levels themselves in 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.760
 principle say anything because it is 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.190
 zbt and there until granted only 4 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.870
 probably or five levels and you know 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.290
 what's interesting i drew attention to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.620
 that drop in the game in 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.870
 Beta test for some reason strongly 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.060
 differ in style such as when 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.459
 we play on the roof there such a style 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.060
 all that blue is bright beautiful 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.030
 in other areas the opposite is true of some 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.880
 gray faded ugly from ruined 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.530
 just a completely different style 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 graffiti and I don't know why so 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.790
 it turned out so these cards did 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.010
 completely different people who did not think 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.670
 about what they are doing 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.640
 others whether it is something like this idea 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.420
 the developer will not judge but me 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.959
 It seemed so if you touch 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.819
 of the issue 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.129
 modes that we can play on these 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.040
 maps then everything is much less 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.440
 sad and even somewhere quite interesting 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.980
 I personally was able to play it in 3 mode 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.349
 defmatch team dirty money and 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.510
 bomb disposal team defmatch and 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.400
 bomb disposal quite understandable 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.739
 modes and and we dwell on them 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.090
 let's talk a little about this mode 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.299
 like dirty money 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.190
 this mode is really new but by 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.389
 at least he didn't come across to me before 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.879
 Ivan friend shooter 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.889
 the main purpose of this hold mode 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.230
 kind of flag only here it is 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.629
 money itself is interesting what is in this mode 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.060
 we divide me into two teams like this 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.980
 it usually happens 4 and each of 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.920
 teams has a goal to capture 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.870
 a bag of money basically everything you need 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.370
 make it grab a bag of money and 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.340
 keep him yourself for the allotted 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.860
 time but it is very difficult to do so 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.870
 how opponents kill here just with 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.270
 lightning speed you have not had time 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.820
 see him and he shot us already 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.590
 you will not even have time I will not respond 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.320
 say good or bad because 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.300
 for each it is individually someone 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.639
 on the contrary like when you can quickly 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.410
 kill and supposedly describes it with realism 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.169
 someone on the contrary loves when you can 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.900
 run a little longer personally to me 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.820
 liked it but sometimes it is very strange 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.710
 that is, when I ran from the starting 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.169
 weapons all players who have been more 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.199
 good guns they literally killed me 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.270
 instantly when I bought a machine 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.220
 players who ran with standard 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.180
 weapons they still killed me 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.040
 faster than me them 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.200
 what can you say about the game in 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.970
 principle nothing revolutionary no this 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.790
 the same kind of shooter millions on 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.670
 the old Internet has its own 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.830
 certain advantages it will be fresh 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.200
 some time but personally i will play no 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.720
 forget and decided for myself that after the release 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.730
 I will not try it because there is 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.970
 lots of more interesting shooters on 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.970
 which I am willing to spend my time and 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.490
 shadow company do not apply to them 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.200
 this was all you pathos subscribe
