00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.170
 the wreck of the fair represents in 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.340
 panorama of extreme diving 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.290
 eastern Liguria 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.910
 the most fascinating hull the best 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.910
 preserved of a warship 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.850
 requisitioned by the marine direction on the 13th 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.920
 May of 1940 it was armed is 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.920
 turned into submersible fighters 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.379
 collapsed four years later to 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.600
 following a ramming by 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.120
 a German unit offshore 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.269
 of the Punta Montenero in five locations 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.269
 lands 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.700
 excellent is not always guaranteed 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.330
 visibility on this point of delusion 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.740
 moons but today is a lucky day 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.960
 because already about twenty meters of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.990
 depth we can see the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.990
 Shape 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.580
 we distinguish the superior structures 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 represented by the two fungaioli ci 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.220
 approach 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.710
 we observe them carefully up to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.479
 discover with great amazement and am 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.479
 colonized by neither the jewel 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.740
 from this position we can guess 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.870
 that I read and slightly skid on 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:22.510
 side of behavior we pass the castle 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.510
 command in the direction of the bow 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.070
 here is finally the antier cannon and ho 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.360
 positioned in a concreted blanket but 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.100
 well it preserved the imposition of shooting 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:47.270
 made famous and with numerous photographs 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:49.940
 illustrating the water wreck in 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.860
 effects is a very suggestive subject e 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.860
 lends itself to being taken by occasionally 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.010
 and the joy of photos and videos also adds up 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.640
 if in reality its function was much more 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.640
 dramatic 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.840
 the bow highlights in racy 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:00.330
 cut off the anchors left by them 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.330
 place and the ebit passes carli 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.140
 how does that say we are again? 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.610
 attracted by the fee 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.769
 this time to attract attention 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.769
 but they are the commands that they regulated 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:40.270
 at the height of the command castle in 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.699
 high a small plaque to circulate e 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.620
 bears the name of the ship la 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.620
 city ​​in which it was registered 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.600
 it is possible to inspect the internal areas 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.600
 and other accommodations 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.770
 we take advantage of the large empty spaces left 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.540
 from my blog 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.060
 internally flat power supply 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.000
 collapsed and the part can be seen 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.980
 hundred alternating current where so 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.170
 messy both uphill and not centered 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.170
 point the remains of the superstructures 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.500
 immediately aft of the castle of 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.479
 command is located at the steri cio that 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.699
 leads to the engine room yes 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.699
 they recognize hatches and access doors 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.669
 we notice a machine gun that 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.180
 probably shocked by the impact it fell 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.180
 from the side 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.019
 we have thus reached the deck 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.849
 aft the operational area from which 

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:58.149
 the band of were lowered into the sea 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:03.279
 depth unfortunately in this point the 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:05.289
 visibility is greatly reduced by 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:08.580
 pupa go up a few meters 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.580
 the remains of a network 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.380
 before going up again we dedicate a 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.310
 last look trying to fix in the 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.560
 average 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.560
 the captivating perfect silhouette 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.030
 and the framing is singular 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.760
 laterally of the wreck going further 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.790
 the sea parapet the ship seems to emerge 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.040
 from foscolo clear and defined the 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:05.450
 deck profile and all his 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:08.680
 invisible structures impalpable everything 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.680
 how alone he is
