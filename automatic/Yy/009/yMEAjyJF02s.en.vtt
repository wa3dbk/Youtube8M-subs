containers<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.200> actually<00:00:10.650> smaller<00:00:11.040> than

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
containers are actually smaller than

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.820 
containers are actually smaller than
this<00:00:11.460> these<00:00:12.450> are<00:00:12.690> just<00:00:12.719> recycle<00:00:13.559> containers

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
this these are just recycle containers

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.980 
this these are just recycle containers
my<00:00:14.250> neighbors<00:00:14.580> drop<00:00:14.849> off<00:00:15.030> containers<00:00:15.570> that

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
my neighbors drop off containers that

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.790 
my neighbors drop off containers that
they<00:00:16.170> use<00:00:16.410> during<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> year<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.760> so

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
they use during the year and so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.750 
they use during the year and so
essentially<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:19.949> free<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.520> project

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
essentially it's free so this project

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.900 
essentially it's free so this project
will<00:00:21.600> cost<00:00:21.750> me<00:00:22.250> nothing<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> cost<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
will cost me nothing but the cost of the

potato in here you plant it about a
third<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> way<00:01:04.170> down<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.409> fill<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.860> with

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
third of the way down and fill it with

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
third of the way down and fill it with
dirt<00:01:05.189> let<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> grow<00:01:06.119> let<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> top<00:01:07.110> growth<00:01:07.320> die

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
dirt let it grow let the top growth die

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.260 
dirt let it grow let the top growth die
back<00:01:07.830> dump<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.549> out<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.970> then<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.240> have

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.020 
back dump it out and then you have
potatoes<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:10.950> an<00:01:11.189> insert<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
potatoes or you can make an insert and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.840 
potatoes or you can make an insert and
this<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.049> insert<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.790> take<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
this is the insert all you do is take a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
this is the insert all you do is take a
container<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:20.430> has<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
container like this it has to be a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
container like this it has to be a
little<00:01:21.030> bit<00:01:21.180> smaller<00:01:21.509> than<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> container

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
little bit smaller than the container

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.820 
little bit smaller than the container
you<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.939> cut<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.290> square

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you have and you cut out a square

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.580 
you have and you cut out a square
doesn't<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.090> perfect<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> cut

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
doesn't have to be perfect but you cut

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.499 
doesn't have to be perfect but you cut
out<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.770> sides<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.549> top<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> cut

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
out the sides the top and then you cut

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.350 
out the sides the top and then you cut
in<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:30.960> an<00:01:31.110> inch<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.409> two<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:32.159> each<00:01:32.430> side<00:01:32.460> so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
in about an inch or two on each side so

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.530 
in about an inch or two on each side so
that<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> flat<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.130> see

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
that you can have a flat and you can see

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.069 
that you can have a flat and you can see
that<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.460> can<00:01:38.460> pull<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> sides<00:01:39.060> down<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that I can pull the sides down and I

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
that I can pull the sides down and I
will<00:01:40.229> actually<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:41.220> able<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.790> harvest<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
will actually be able to harvest the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.749 
will actually be able to harvest the
potatoes<00:01:42.619> from<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> side<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.490> will<00:01:44.640> be

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
potatoes from the side and I will be

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.359 
potatoes from the side and I will be
able<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.360> how<00:01:45.600> they're<00:01:45.810> growing<00:01:46.220> now<00:01:47.220> of

able to see how they're growing now of
course<00:01:48.799> it's<00:01:49.799> March<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.399> don't<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.729> any

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
course it's March so I don't have any

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.730 
course it's March so I don't have any
potatoes<00:01:51.149> prepared<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.049> made<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.500> mock

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
potatoes prepared but I made a mock

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.469 
potatoes prepared but I made a mock
trial<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:55.520> let's<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.700> how<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
trial and let's see how I can get this

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.800 
trial and let's see how I can get this
out<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> essentially<00:01:59.759> put<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.240> potato<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
out so essentially put your potato and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.330 
out so essentially put your potato and
you<00:02:00.899> plant<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.619> third<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> way

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
you plant it about a third of the way

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
you plant it about a third of the way
down<00:02:02.549> fill<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.149> dirt<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.689> let<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
down fill it with dirt and you let the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.029 
down fill it with dirt and you let the
potato<00:02:04.259> grow<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.520> growing<00:02:06.829> you<00:02:07.829> can

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
potato grow as it's growing you can

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.040 
potato grow as it's growing you can
check<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.429> it<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.060> check<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.569> simply

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
check on it and you check on it simply

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.820 
check on it and you check on it simply
by<00:02:10.410> taking<00:02:11.310> out

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
by taking out

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.920 
by taking out
the<00:02:13.830> insert<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:16.080> side<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.720> see

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
the insert on this side you don't see

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.210 
the insert on this side you don't see
anything<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.470> would<00:02:19.620> be<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> potato<00:02:20.070> that

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
anything and this would be a potato that

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.430 
anything and this would be a potato that
just<00:02:20.580> started<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.600> let's<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.990> assume<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
just started but let's just assume the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.550 
just started but let's just assume the
potatoes<00:02:22.830> been<00:02:23.040> growing<00:02:23.280> for<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> while<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
potatoes been growing for a while and it

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.020 
potatoes been growing for a while and it
so<00:02:25.710> it's<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> end<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.190> season<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.760> would

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
so it's the end of the season you would

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.880 
so it's the end of the season you would
take<00:02:27.240> it<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:28.140> would<00:02:28.260> look<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.440> this

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
take it out and it would look like this

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.190 
take it out and it would look like this
and<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.580> would<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:29.910> your<00:02:30.030> potatoes<00:02:30.570> growing

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
and you would see your potatoes growing

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.140 
and you would see your potatoes growing
in<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.500> container<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.400> could<00:02:32.580> actually<00:02:32.730> take

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
in the container you could actually take

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
in the container you could actually take
them<00:02:33.330> out<00:02:33.480> if<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.720> want<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.930> harvest<00:02:34.290> them<00:02:34.440> or

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
them out if you want to harvest them or

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.820 
them out if you want to harvest them or
you<00:02:35.370> could<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.700> let<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.720> whole<00:02:36.930> container

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
you could just let the whole container

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.040 
you could just let the whole container
mature<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.850> just<00:02:39.030> goes<00:02:39.180> right<00:02:39.390> back<00:02:39.600> into<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
mature it just goes right back into the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.080 
mature it just goes right back into the
holding<00:02:43.320> container<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.550> have<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
holding container and here you have a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.360 
holding container and here you have a
simple<00:02:45.660> potato<00:02:46.170> bucket<00:02:46.970> where<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.150> can<00:02:48.360> grow

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
simple potato bucket where you can grow

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.820 
simple potato bucket where you can grow
specialty<00:02:50.370> potatoes<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.240> again<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.650> want

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
specialty potatoes and again I just want

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.620 
specialty potatoes and again I just want
to<00:02:52.950> explain<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.850> put<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.150> one<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.390> two

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
to explain you put in one or two

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.460 
to explain you put in one or two
potatoes<00:02:55.140> about<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.740> size<00:02:56.240> put<00:02:57.240> in<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:58.230> soil

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
potatoes about this size put in the soil

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.500 
potatoes about this size put in the soil
to<00:02:58.590> about<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> third<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.700> set<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.060> potatoes

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
to about a third just set the potatoes

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.310 
to about a third just set the potatoes
on<00:03:00.690> fill<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.920> top<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:03.060> you're<00:03:04.050> good<00:03:04.290> to

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
on fill it to the top and you're good to

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.720 
on fill it to the top and you're good to
go<00:03:04.440> well<00:03:04.770> actually<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.130> would<00:03:05.220> look<00:03:05.340> like<00:03:05.400> this

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
go well actually it would look like this

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390 
go well actually it would look like this
you<00:03:05.970> close<00:03:06.240> this<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.720> put<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.770> inside<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
you close this up put it inside the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.610 
you close this up put it inside the
container<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.270> is<00:03:09.420> how<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.630> plant<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.590> a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
container and this is how you plant so a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.790 
container and this is how you plant so a
third<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.130> soil<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:12.120> small<00:03:12.540> potatoes<00:03:13.020> fill

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
third of the soil to small potatoes fill

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.680 
third of the soil to small potatoes fill
the<00:03:13.920> dirt<00:03:14.100> up<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.490> top<00:03:14.700> let<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.210> grow<00:03:15.420> and

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the dirt up to the top let it grow and

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.860 
the dirt up to the top let it grow and
you<00:03:16.140> can<00:03:16.170> check<00:03:16.500> on<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:17.340> by<00:03:17.750> taking<00:03:18.750> it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
you can check on it just by taking it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.400 
you can check on it just by taking it
