00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello so we are a few 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
 days of the opening of the fishery the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 brown trout in the rivers of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.180
 first category as well as in the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.119
 2nd category river so we are 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.730
 in the extreme south of France 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.869
 since we are in the bouches-du-rhÃ´ne 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.190
 less known for trout fishing 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.010
 fario better known for sea fishing 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.260
 but there are still populations of 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.980
 departmental trout therefore of 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.340
 wild trout that you can 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.719
 possibly capture from the opening 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.969
 either fly or knock will be a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.170
 other technique but here today I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.820
 will actually show you everything 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 simply I will try to you 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360
 show an imitation that I use 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 during these opening periods so 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 called the walk brawn or the brunette of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 March so a little ephemeral there it's 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.930
 in this case it's a I'm going to 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.080
 climb so I'm going to try to limit 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.680
 on one day they are 14 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:12.180
 with once brown second s60 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 so taking a first place I'm going 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:22.530
 set my self on the hook is all 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:23.070
 just here is tech up to the entrance 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.610
 curvature 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.020
 then I take what is called 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.090
 sabers 2 doing I take a few 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.030
 fibers so to mimic the circles beyond 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.150
 dry fly 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:44.909
 I take some fibers and I come 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.329
 the places and so at the entrance to the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.490
 curvature so we can slightly the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.759
 to make passes and a lace the insect 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.590
 flying 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.479
 it would have been a child would not 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.040
 shorten the length of the circles place 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.890
 and the flying insect so the Serbs are 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.689
 well outside I'm doing a two laps tour 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.350
 to secure the whole and I come 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.280
 slightly behind them for 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.400
 try to put everything together 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.230
 ok then then I take bing of 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.900
 rabbit or hare 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.040
 brown I come so 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.110
 normally we use what is called 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.239
 a bad luck there I'm just going to saliva 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.849
 and my mount me up and I 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.250
 Come on bing on it so 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.530
 wrap it around to fix it on the to 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.060
 assault mounting like these for 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:43.090
 in fact simply form the body 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:47.799
 of my imitation there and I come to roll 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.370
 so no bing that I had then 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.069
 bring me feather duck rumps 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.709
 so to slide duck cells and 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.370
 I come to take two that I come 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.920
 juxtaposed formed a kind of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.519
 small or thin enough thick films 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.019
 since the duck I come there fixed 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:13.030
 like these on my sister my soul are 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:20.220
 so here I can cut there a surplus of 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.220
 feathers and I just cover it all up 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.900
 like that then I resume du bing 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.130
 this time we can change the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.169
 tones and we can take a more 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:38.349
 clear I come the germans moisten 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.599
 mastrad fitting and tendrils and so my 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.220
 bing all around 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:46.840
 so here you see I'm not very 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.980
 greedy bing it's not necessary to 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:56.680
 overload here and I come form a 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:58.090
 a beautiful bo bobo a beautiful chest here 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.190
 once that happens and here I come I 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.450
 I'm going to take my hairs from then but more 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.950
 for our part in kuhn's feathers 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.169
 duck my son of duck cu and I 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.169
 come knock them in front like this 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.540
 here you see it forms a kind of back 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.989
 like that bulky one so the bag to 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.010
 the air and I take my fibers from who 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.830
 are before that I just passed 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:31.150
 in front to fold them backwards 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.860
 like this I just add some 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.620
 deer fibers and so we're going 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.190
 increase the floatation of our 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.180
 imitation simply here we go 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.410
 figure well- trained helpers out 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.250
 like this so we end up with 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.380
 a beautiful scarecrow 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.380
 we will cut the surplus klur to possible 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:59.290
 like those here and there at that moment we're going 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.980
 to be able to come in front to form the head 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.360
 and then we do the finishing 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.360
 first key to assemble and 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:14.560
 two more keys to start fixing 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:19.770
 to make of them do not see there another hop 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.770
 set of keys 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.310
 as well as another is there the montage is 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:35.000
 finished the fly I pass or if it holds 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:38.370
 here they cut the mounting floss 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.740
 and you have a brand braun so here 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.270
 flying insects that you will be able to 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.009
 so you see to charge them in 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.530
 floating materials for ducks more 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.030
 deer so there on the currents alive 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.650
 early season is no problem 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.770
 you will see your imitation good 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.770
 opening
