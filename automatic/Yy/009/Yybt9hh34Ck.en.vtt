that uh were against his decision but he

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.249 
that uh were against his decision but he
has<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.090> what's<00:01:51.299> best<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.570> LeBron<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
has to do what's best for LeBron and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.130 
has to do what's best for LeBron and
quite<00:01:52.890> honestly<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.579> don't<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.810> LeBron

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
quite honestly I don't think LeBron

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
quite honestly I don't think LeBron
really<00:01:55.560> cares<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.299> his<00:01:57.299> critics<00:01:58.009> he<00:01:59.009> won<00:01:59.219> he

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
really cares about his critics he won he

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.330 
really cares about his critics he won he
won<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.829> weight<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.219> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
won now so I it that that weight like I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800 
won now so I it that that weight like I
said<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.700> off<00:02:02.820> his<00:02:02.969> shoulders<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.299> he<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
said it's off his shoulders and he can I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.389 
said it's off his shoulders and he can I
think<00:02:04.259> you'll<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> different<00:02:04.740> LeBron<00:02:05.189> now
