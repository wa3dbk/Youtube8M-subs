00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
will not sway so that's a big kind of

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.770 
will not sway so that's a big kind of
thing<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.970> just<00:01:46.030> go<00:01:46.240> ahead<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.479> believe<00:01:46.570> that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
thing you just go ahead and believe that

you<00:01:46.840> can<00:01:46.960> be<00:01:47.050> okay<00:01:47.320> but<00:01:48.009> once<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.250> do<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.369> you

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
you can be okay but once you do that you

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.190 
you can be okay but once you do that you
can<00:01:48.759> ride<00:01:48.909> back<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.240> hopefully<00:01:50.080> you've
