00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
built a little more heat and as we just

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.969 
built a little more heat and as we just
went<00:01:31.750> on<00:01:31.870> with<00:01:31.900> developing<00:01:32.500> making<00:01:32.830> more

superchargers in general well what we

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.810 
superchargers in general well what we
did<00:01:37.810> is<00:01:37.869> basically<00:01:38.770> made<00:01:39.070> what<00:01:39.280> we<00:01:39.400> call<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.610> bed

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
did is basically made what we call a bed

you<00:01:43.180> seen<00:01:43.420> it<00:01:43.570> working<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:48.250> are<00:01:48.280> testing

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
you seen it working and you are testing

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.190 
you seen it working and you are testing
that<00:01:50.700> normally<00:01:51.700> when<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.570> run<00:01:52.750> these<00:01:52.869> cars

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that normally when you run these cars

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.730 
that normally when you run these cars
like<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:55.180> do<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> spirited<00:01:55.810> drive<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.500> make<00:01:56.680> a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
like you do a spirited drive to make a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.050 
like you do a spirited drive to make a
cup<00:01:56.920> of<00:01:56.950> hot<00:01:57.160> laps<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:57.550> may<00:01:57.670> come<00:01:57.880> back<00:01:58.000> and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
cup of hot laps you may come back and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.270 
cup of hot laps you may come back and
raise<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.479> hood<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.530> really<00:01:59.979> can't<00:02:00.220> even

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
raise the hood you really can't even

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.740 
raise the hood you really can't even
touch<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.790> front<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.150> floor<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:01.540> red

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
touch the front of the floor it's red

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.430 
touch the front of the floor it's red
hot<00:02:01.960> actually<00:02:02.710> maybe<00:02:03.280> 200<00:02:03.790> degrees<00:02:04.290> well<00:02:05.290> if

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
hot actually maybe 200 degrees well if

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.630 
hot actually maybe 200 degrees well if
you've<00:02:05.590> measured<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.040> back<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.460> floor

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
you've measured the back of the floor

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.310 
you've measured the back of the floor
where<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.910> inlet<00:02:07.120> air<00:02:07.300> is<00:02:07.450> coming<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.200> a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
where the inlet air is coming in it's a

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.109 
where the inlet air is coming in it's a
hundred<00:02:08.530> degrees<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:09.760> actually<00:02:09.850> got<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
hundred degrees so we actually got a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.000 
hundred degrees so we actually got a
variance<00:02:10.540> of<00:02:10.660> around<00:02:10.899> 100<00:02:11.230> degrees<00:02:11.530> front<00:02:11.920> to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
variance of around 100 degrees front to

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.400 
variance of around 100 degrees front to
rear<00:02:12.190> on<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.340> supercharger<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.410> definitely

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
rear on a supercharger that definitely

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.030 
rear on a supercharger that definitely
will<00:02:14.950> cause<00:02:15.160> case<00:02:15.550> warpage<00:02:16.150> rotor<00:02:16.450> rub<00:02:17.040> issues

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
will cause case warpage rotor rub issues

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.820 
will cause case warpage rotor rub issues
just<00:02:18.250> develop<00:02:18.730> from<00:02:19.209> there<00:02:19.440> well<00:02:20.440> with<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> uh

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
just develop from there well with the uh

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.699 
just develop from there well with the uh
with<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.880> venom<00:02:22.209> fear<00:02:22.480> it'll<00:02:23.470> drop

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
with the venom fear it'll drop

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.440 
with the venom fear it'll drop
temperatures<00:02:24.510> 75<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.720> 150<00:02:26.230> degrees<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:27.450> it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
temperatures 75 to 150 degrees and it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.420 
temperatures 75 to 150 degrees and it
will<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.780> supercharger<00:02:29.530> running<00:02:29.860> even

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
will have a supercharger running even

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.670 
will have a supercharger running even
temperatures<00:02:31.120> front<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.600> back<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
temperatures front to back so it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.540 
temperatures front to back so it
eliminate<00:02:33.130> warpage<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.910> overall<00:02:34.360> run<00:02:34.630> cooler

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
eliminate warpage and overall run cooler

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.460 
eliminate warpage and overall run cooler
we're<00:02:36.550> very<00:02:36.760> excited<00:02:36.880> about<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.260> we

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
we're very excited about it and we

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.740 
we're very excited about it and we
wanted<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.800> show<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.040> today<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:40.510> was<00:02:40.720> a

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
wanted to show you today this was a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.449 
wanted to show you today this was a
working<00:02:41.050> prototype<00:02:41.410> which<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.040> could<00:02:42.190> see<00:02:42.340> is

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
working prototype which you could see is

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.520 
working prototype which you could see is
rough<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:43.480> we've<00:02:43.690> been<00:02:43.840> driving<00:02:44.019> this<00:02:44.350> all

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
rough but we've been driving this all

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.039 
rough but we've been driving this all
summer<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.390> doing<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> development<00:02:46.660> like

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
summer and doing the development like

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.590 
summer and doing the development like
that<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:48.700> see<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.970> kind<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.330> this<00:02:49.420> in

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
that so you see in kind of this in

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.390 
that so you see in kind of this in
action<00:02:49.780> now<00:02:50.500> we're<00:02:50.620> going<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.769> look<00:02:50.980> over<00:02:51.280> we

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
action now we're going to look over we

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.850 
action now we're going to look over we
got<00:02:51.549> these<00:02:51.670> finished<00:02:52.150> units<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:53.620> want<00:02:53.799> to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
got these finished units that we want to

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.949

tagged and I guess Don I'll explain a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.090 
tagged and I guess Don I'll explain a
little<00:03:35.610> bit<00:03:35.760> how<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.120> does<00:03:36.390> work<00:03:36.950> when<00:03:37.950> we

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
little bit how this does work when we

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.060 
little bit how this does work when we
made<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.489> unit<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:40.380> waters<00:03:40.920> actually

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
made this unit the waters actually

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.280 
made this unit the waters actually
traveling<00:03:41.640> through<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> casting<00:03:42.290> bit

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
traveling through the casting bit

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.540 
traveling through the casting bit
trembling<00:03:43.800> up<00:03:44.520> up<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.450> back<00:03:45.660> side<00:03:46.160> comes<00:03:47.160> over

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
trembling up up the back side comes over

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.960 
trembling up up the back side comes over
down<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:49.680> direction<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.400> then<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.850> then

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
down this direction and then and then

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.250 
down this direction and then and then
back<00:03:51.150> through<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.510> casting<00:03:51.720> we've<00:03:52.080> actually

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
back through the casting we've actually

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.430 
back through the casting we've actually
created<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:53.100> water<00:03:53.610> pocket<00:03:54.239> by<00:03:54.750> sealing<00:03:55.140> this

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
created a water pocket by sealing this

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.030 
created a water pocket by sealing this
up<00:03:55.650> here<00:03:56.900> it's<00:03:57.900> worked<00:03:58.230> much<00:03:58.470> better<00:03:58.500> than

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
up here it's worked much better than

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.030 
up here it's worked much better than
we'd<00:03:59.220> even<00:03:59.340> hoped<00:03:59.670> far<00:04:01.910> also<00:04:03.200> on<00:04:04.200> what<00:04:04.920> we

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
we'd even hoped far also on what we

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.470 
we'd even hoped far also on what we
decided<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.519> do<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.760> do<00:04:05.880> some<00:04:06.060> push<00:04:06.269> lock

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480

11:00<00:05:12.100> I'll<00:05:12.280> just<00:05:12.460> build<00:05:12.810> heat<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.110> point

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
11:00 I'll just build heat to the point

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.560 
11:00 I'll just build heat to the point
of<00:05:14.710> bearing<00:05:15.130> failures<00:05:15.610> on<00:05:16.000> any<00:05:16.210> kind<00:05:16.480> of

but<00:05:48.630> durability<00:05:50.340> is<00:05:51.340> going<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.610> be<00:05:51.730> greatly

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
but durability is going to be greatly

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.880 
but durability is going to be greatly
improved<00:05:54.990> so<00:05:55.990> that's<00:05:56.200> it<00:05:56.410> I<00:05:56.620> mean<00:05:56.650> they're

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
improved so that's it I mean they're

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.290 
improved so that's it I mean they're
known<00:05:57.040> as<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.340> Phantom<00:05:57.610> coolers<00:05:58.060> they're

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
them and we have a working prototype on

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.780 
them and we have a working prototype on
the<00:06:05.260> gt500<00:06:05.830> car<00:06:06.480> and<00:06:07.480> it<00:06:08.080> will<00:06:08.170> be<00:06:08.380> complete<00:06:08.920> in

the gt500 car and it will be complete in

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.520 
the gt500 car and it will be complete in
a<00:06:10.000> week<00:06:10.210> it's<00:06:10.480> actually<00:06:10.660> on<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.110> car<00:06:11.320> right

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
a week it's actually on the car right

now<00:06:11.560> being<00:06:11.920> run<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.990> paperwork's<00:06:14.800> getting

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
now being run the paperwork's getting

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.600 
now being run the paperwork's getting
done<00:06:15.280> on<00:06:15.460> that<00:06:15.520> and<00:06:15.700> then<00:06:16.030> the<00:06:16.390> TBS<00:06:16.930> is<00:06:17.520> in<00:06:18.520> the

done on that and then the TBS is in the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.600 
done on that and then the TBS is in the
works<00:06:18.850> also<00:06:19.950> and<00:06:20.950> we<00:06:21.040> think<00:06:21.250> that<00:06:21.310> would<00:06:21.490> be
