00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.270
 hi how about youtube friends how are you 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.680
 health in the missing 90 with a new 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.450
 video and good gentlemen on that occasion 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.599
 we have in a boxing and I'm going to say a 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.150
 boxing in quotes because this video 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.460
 I 'm going to sit to deceive you and achieve 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.200
 previously only that they put the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.579
 problems that the card in very waters 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.170
 and the video came out damaged and could not be 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.720
 record complete then what's better 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.059
 instead of trying again to record the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.270
 unboxing like that as if it had happened 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.980
 nothing and what better will I go back to 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.649
 do it since good they will see that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.840
 obviously the art team is already 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.219
 It's open and I will not be able to do it 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.739
 live from none of that because use of 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.269
 mind of blinding gloves but through 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.370
 a video of poor quality I decided better 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.100
 do it again as you can 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.769
 know this we have in a boxing of another 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.699
 instead of the samsung galaxy s 4 in this 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.670
 occasion with movistar this team is the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.820
 that has an act with eight cores 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.409
 that are two processors a processor to 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.720
 1.7 gigahertz quad core and other 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.729
 1.2 year processor equal quad core 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.450
 in this case the version of 16 gigas and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.039
 well let's talk 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.710
 specifications that all this has 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.780
 This equipment has a screen of 5 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.340
 inches as you can see full hd is 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.189
 super amoled can play and record 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.929
 1080p full HD video we also have a 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.880
 3-megapixel rear camera and one 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.960
 2 - megapixel front camera 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.710
 obviously has gps sensors 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.170
 LED sensor type or remote control one 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.759
 incredible battery of 2600 media means and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.829
 well obviously with the android system 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.149
 and right now I was using it all day 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.549
 yesterday so it is very good to be able 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.829
 like I 'm going to the editor since such a 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.909
 This team did not appear, I also wanted it 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.090
 record in this way to be able to 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.950
 explain this when we open as 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.240
 can see only brings what is the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.409
 device let's put a side 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.509
 because we are going to focus on him 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.689
 and here in what is the box brings us what 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.299
 which are manual first-hand use 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.890
 use of guarantees and other things that I can 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.080
 regular we never read USB usb cable to 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.519
 micro usb of additional moody s for what 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.239
 which are the hearing aids that we 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.879
 includes and a power adapter to 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.410
 usb a wall afternoon they call 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's put all that aside this box 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.040
 well we will not need it anymore and we're going 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.989
 to focus a little on what is the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.239
 good team as you can see we have already 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.370
 simple view a huge screen gentlemen 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.170
 a huge screen with a quality the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.549
 truly awesome and something that I 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.160
 was quite surprised is the quality of the 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.720
 5-inch screen the truth the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.670
 screen is one of the things that 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.530
 they excel quite a bit in this team we see 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.390
 at the top what are sensors 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.879
 this coast gives me a led for what 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.340
 are notifications the front camera 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.470
 to be able to make video calls or take 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.150
 photographs and good thousand and one sensors 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.099
 who has this device in the part 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.829
 lower we see what a button is what 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.319
 the options button made the home button 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.389
 and the return button in the part 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.340
 back let's see what the camera is 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.260
 of 13 mega pixels 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.000
 its led flash and on the bottom 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.739
 we see what is the speaker of this 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.569
 team on the side we will see 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.069
 the button to block our 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.080
 device or to turn it off too 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.970
 it works for that a small tab 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.069
 with which we can remove the cap 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.250
 this device to be able to access the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.950
 battery to change the racing or also 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.420
 this put a sd memory and the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.610
 front we see the buttons to upload 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.860
 lower volume at the bottom we see 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.480
 the adapter for micro usb to be able 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.220
 connect it to current or synchronize it 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.190
 with data and at the top we see 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.340
 what is the 3.5 mm connector 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.569
 jack connector for hearing aids and good 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.640
 as I already told you the truth is a 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.860
 very fast computer is a hardware of 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.840
 very robust truth has infinity of 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.790
 sensors something that I really like is what 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.260
 who did samsung with the version of 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.360
 Android not customized in its version 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.379
 from android and added a lot of things 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.840
 very interesting 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.459
 using the specific hardware the flood and 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.959
 is the one that this team works with is 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.579
 incredible the truth that I liked 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.829
 pretty and good another thing that I liked 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.319
 much the ability to be able to increase the 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.180
 storage had a microsd memory 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.680
 the truth that is amazing the first 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.880
 impression when we turn it on it brings us 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.800
 included 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.100
 number of applications already pre-installed 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.420
 and most just google how is 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.580
 maps email and good 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.230
 different things not all that is the 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.150
 google environment another route preinstalled 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.850
 and good here horta in a day that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.080
 been when installing some things the 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.060
 true the pollution level of 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.590
 Androids is amazing that has always 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.330
 liked it a lot but we're going to 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.180
 talk a little bit about the team and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.770
 how has been my experience on this day 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.320
 of use as I have always said the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.060
 I really think this team is very good 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.680
 since the hardware it handles is 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.660
 excellent the truth was not operational 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.650
 very noble in general as I tell them I 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.840
 liked is this shore that has 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.190
 metallic the headquarters looks very good and this 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.230
 alga difference from other devices 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.530
 for example the s3 feels like more 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.240
 sturdy feels do not know how heavier 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.950
 as it holds a little bit longer since 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.170
 before I felt it like very plastic we 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.180
 anger has passed and now the galaxy 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.860
 it definitely looks very, very good 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.810
 so then if we leave here 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.080
 the little unboxing said I do not want 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.880
 take it as much as review or do 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.020
 To extend myself a lot with this, it seems that 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.480
 I'm going to ask you who 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.680
 would like the stadium this device 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.960
 if they want me to make a prize 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.220
 complete about all the functions or 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.320
 a review about the functions that 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.760
 added samsung the operating system in 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.710
 yes who do you think some comparative 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.470
 with in this case it can be with the iphone 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.900
 although we obviously know who would be the 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.640
 winner in terms of speed and those things 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.200
 and well I left the comments that 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.570
 video they like to watch with this device 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.950
 since in the next days he would be 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.420
 fulfilling those requirements of 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.590
 you to be able to have that content 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.940

 subscribe to the channel if you like it in case 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.010

 channel that they would like to see about 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.250

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.210
 next video I know lack 90 friends 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.210
