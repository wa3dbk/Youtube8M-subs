once<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.390> would<00:01:42.570> use<00:01:42.780> here's<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.710> reason<00:01:43.920> why

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
once I would use here's one reason why

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.819 
once I would use here's one reason why
other<00:01:44.460> than<00:01:44.579> he's<00:01:45.090> very<00:01:45.299> strong<00:01:45.630> pretty<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.740> a

other than he's very strong pretty and a
nice<00:01:47.039> point<00:01:47.369> they<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> flat<00:01:48.569> surface<00:01:48.899> so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
nice point they have a flat surface so

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
nice point they have a flat surface so
you<00:01:49.829> have<00:01:50.340> takes<00:01:50.640> very<00:01:51.000> little<00:01:51.270> pressure<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you have takes very little pressure to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.910 
you have takes very little pressure to
control<00:01:52.259> what

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
control what

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.850
