00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.080 

this<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> tool<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.230> sent<00:00:22.470> back<00:00:23.090> you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
this is a tool that was sent back you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.779 
this is a tool that was sent back you
notice<00:00:24.419> that<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.750> tip<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.039> curled<00:00:26.460> over

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.979 

this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> fuller

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
this is a fuller

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.310 
this is a fuller
I<00:00:31.970> think<00:00:32.970> it's<00:00:33.090> low<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.809> see<00:00:33.989> how<00:00:34.170> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I think it's low so you can see how it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.149 
I think it's low so you can see how it's
been<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:35.930> want<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> notice<00:00:37.500> also<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:38.159 
been I want you to notice also that the

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.740 
been I want you to notice also that the
only<00:00:38.309> place<00:00:38.699> that<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.089> tool<00:00:39.720> has<00:00:39.930> been<00:00:39.960> worked

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
only place that the tool has been worked

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.540 
only place that the tool has been worked
where<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.930> shiny<00:00:43.230> they're<00:00:44.059> not<00:00:45.059> back<00:00:45.360> here

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
where it's shiny they're not back here

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
where it's shiny they're not back here
so<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:47.670> caused<00:00:47.909> this<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:49.079> caused<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
so what caused this what caused that to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.910 
so what caused this what caused that to
curl<00:00:49.949> over<00:00:50.159> like<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:51.530> let's<00:00:52.530> go<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.799> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
curl over like that let's go to the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.070 
curl over like that let's go to the
other<00:00:53.010> side<00:00:58.159> and<00:00:59.159> notice<00:00:59.519> that<00:00:59.809> every<00:01:00.809> hammer

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
other side and notice that every hammer

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.980 
other side and notice that every hammer
blow<00:01:01.640> was<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.059> inside<00:01:03.509> edge<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:06.630> notice

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
blow was on this inside edge you notice

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.770 
blow was on this inside edge you notice
how<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.290> mushroomed<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.540> tool

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
how it's mushroomed so when this tool

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
how it's mushroomed so when this tool
was<00:01:12.990> used<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.250> placed<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.790> shoe<00:01:19.640> not

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
was used it was placed in the shoe not

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
was used it was placed in the shoe not
only<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.810> an<00:01:21.930> angle<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:24.170> but<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.650> was

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
only at an angle like so but also it was

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.800 
only at an angle like so but also it was
leaned<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.280> fuller<00:01:29.520> never<00:01:30.060> got<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
leaned out so the fuller never got to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.430 
leaned out so the fuller never got to
respond<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.860> supposed<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
respond like it's supposed to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.380 
respond like it's supposed to
so<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.620> floor<00:01:34.830> was<00:01:35.159> struck<00:01:35.520> only<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.180> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
so the floor was struck only on this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.940 
so the floor was struck only on this
inside<00:01:36.810> edge<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> never<00:01:41.610> laid<00:01:41.940> flat<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.830> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
inside edge and never laid flat so it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.180 
inside edge and never laid flat so it
just<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.640> hit<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.720> angle<00:01:46.760> and<00:01:47.760> at<00:01:48.570> this

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
just was hit at this angle and at this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.820 
just was hit at this angle and at this
point<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.640> top<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:52.049> that's<00:01:52.260> not<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> way

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
point on the top and that's not the way

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.420 
point on the top and that's not the way
you<00:01:52.890> used<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.340> tool<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.220> fuller

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you used a tool if I'm going to fuller

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.570 
you used a tool if I'm going to fuller
in<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.820> manner<00:01:57.150> where<00:01:57.979> where<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> fuller<00:01:59.370> is

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
in this manner where where the fuller is

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.200 
in this manner where where the fuller is
perpendicular<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.420> my<00:02:00.690> body<00:02:01.400> if<00:02:02.400> even<00:02:02.940> if<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
perpendicular to my body if even if I

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.660 
perpendicular to my body if even if I
lean<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.720> some<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.350> am<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> try<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.400> make

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
lean it some I am going to try to make

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.449 
lean it some I am going to try to make
sure<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.150> my<00:02:06.360> hammer<00:02:06.690> head<00:02:06.990> comes<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.250> in

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
sure that my hammer head comes down in

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.589 
sure that my hammer head comes down in
the<00:02:08.549> center<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.989> tool<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:12.060> fuller<00:02:12.299> one

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
the center of that tool and a fuller one

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.429 
the center of that tool and a fuller one
that's<00:02:12.750> used<00:02:13.549> it<00:02:14.549> rocks<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.510> comes<00:02:16.260> the

struck in order to get to this center

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.860 
struck in order to get to this center
portion<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.930> almost<00:02:31.740> have<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.190> raise<00:02:32.459> my<00:02:33.450> my

portion I almost have to raise my my
shoulder<00:02:34.440> up<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.040> bit<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:36.510> get

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
shoulder up just a little bit to get

shoulder up just a little bit to get
over<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.709> top<00:02:38.000> with<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.030> hammer<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
over the top with my hammer so that I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.250 
over the top with my hammer so that I
make<00:02:41.640> sure<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.420> hitting<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> center<00:02:43.080> of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
make sure that I'm hitting the center of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.710 
make sure that I'm hitting the center of
my<00:02:43.380> tool<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.970> never<00:02:45.300> want<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.660> hit<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.989> edge

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
my tool and never want to hit this edge

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.660 
my tool and never want to hit this edge
because<00:02:48.720> that's<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.080> result<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.770> end<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.580> with

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
because that's the result I end up with

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.479 
because that's the result I end up with
this<00:02:50.850> mushroom<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.500> folding<00:02:53.010> material

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
this mushroom and a folding material

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.880 
this mushroom and a folding material
over<00:02:53.730> eventually<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.450> material<00:02:55.020> will<00:02:55.200> crack

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
over eventually that material will crack

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.440 
over eventually that material will crack
and<00:02:56.130> snappin<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.910> fly<00:02:57.300> off<00:02:59.150> and<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.209> certainly

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
and snappin and fly off and I certainly

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.180 
and snappin and fly off and I certainly
don't<00:03:00.780> want<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.320> happen<00:03:01.500> down<00:03:01.800> below<00:03:02.600> as

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
don't want this to happen down below as

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.250 
don't want this to happen down below as
I<00:03:05.190> strike<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.910> I<00:03:06.150> want<00:03:06.510> my<00:03:06.690> tool<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.080> come

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
I strike it so I want my tool to come

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.699 
I strike it so I want my tool to come
down<00:03:07.440> flat<00:03:08.510> strike<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> center<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.530> let's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
down flat strike the center so let's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:05:51.800 
down flat strike the center so let's
turn<00:03:13.890> this<00:03:14.100> grinder<00:03:14.489> on<00:03:14.640> we'll<00:03:14.880> fix<00:03:15.090> this

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.920 

we're<00:05:52.530> back<00:05:52.710> in<00:05:52.889> business
