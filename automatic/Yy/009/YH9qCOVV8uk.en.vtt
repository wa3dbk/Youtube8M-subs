00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hello my dears 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.710
 we're back here this time we're going 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 take a tour around the snow and go to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.199
 comment that we thought 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 interesting ne 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 when randomly here by the snow does not 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.539
 it's too cold, you 're doing more or 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 less a degree then the snow will soon 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.900
 exhaust but you can show something 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.450
 cool and me walking here randomly 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.420
 has a specific as well as the worst 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.969
 thing that we can observe what 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.930
 Do you think it's beautiful? 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.489
 happens 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.989
 her at the side of the street for example to stay 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.930
 with that this dirt she got snow 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.390
 It's disgusting here, so it's not so bad. 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.710
 so beautiful when you think of some 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.870
 Places, right? 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.160
 the places are untouched it gets more 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.439
 cool if in the places more clean success 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.570
 It gets cooler let's see what it is 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.360
 The more we can show here I 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.750
 I'm going walking through life there 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.090
 Streets nev find something 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.070
 interesting, we'll see today it's 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.150
 a very pleasant day although not 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.900
 look like you're only doing a degree 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.689
 positive even then am 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.340
 really does not have no problem 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.850
 to complain about snow does not 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.460
 beautiful with the place plus one more a num 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.150
 made it difficult for some of the problems 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.740
 snow 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.240
 the person you want to upload here 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.550
 with stroller in the human not only 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 by the street and sidewalk 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.870
 an you see that it is a bit difficult to 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.050
 walking 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.480
 We can figure this out and come on. 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.320
 let's continue the snow also low 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.320
 as you can see here too 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.330
 here the jet kicked I already kicked it arrives 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.190
 in floor 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.710
 only a small layer of snow that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.420
 we have here an amusement park to 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.340
 people can even see children playing there 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.490
 I do not know if you can see it in the face, but if 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.310
 some kids playing in the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.430
 toys to tone selleck is fine 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 Nice even the cars are covered 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.280
 they did not leave so give them a 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.050
 interesting aspect of a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.450
 visually it is only 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.410
 you have your car parked outside 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.780
 From home 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.110
 You're not going to like anything at all. 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.940
 this right but it is not our case that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.680
 people inside the garage what I 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.800
 I talked about rain 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.250
 looks clash gets dirty disgusting to ice 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.080
 walked on stage and is very slippery 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.290
 so if you do not take care you fall 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.290
 same 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.900
 Let's get in here on this street and detained 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.630
 random our way do not know what 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.590
 we run into but you 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.380
 They like street tours through the streets, right? 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.450
 I'll enjoy it and I'll show it okay. 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.260
 solid fiscal that is not too snowy 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.820
 do not even get to calgary feet 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:35.860
 It's a little snow on top right. 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:35.860
 and nothing compromising too right 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.190
 another thing that curious the goalkeeper of 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.130
 Sewer 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.650
 He does not get snowy, I think he should 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.790
 have some heating system to 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.180
 it does not get covered in snow a 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.070
 security issue obviously 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.080
 again when showing the cars 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:02.390
 the whole car destroyed 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.790
 Come on, I 'm taking advantage of 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.920
 filming today because I do not know how much 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.650
 time the snow will last and the forecast 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.430
 time when tomorrow rain already starts 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.420
 so have you seen it? 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.350
 I want to see what happens, the rain started. 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.890
 will turn over should only stay in wet snow 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.530
 will turn into a fan ice care that 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.840
 that invisible ice you only know 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.090
 that the person slips 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.090
 basically we go back here 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:40.669
 handsome man I like I like the artwork 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.639
 of the trees with the snow in the branches I think 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.419
 which gives a very nice effect 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:52.789
 it is a very classic thing that landscape 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:56.689
 snow classic she looks how cute there is 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:05:01.869
 several dry trees with the 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:04.419
 snow 5 glaci glacier coverage 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:10.369
 what we have 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:16.729
 they made a snowman like that of 

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:18.679
 show a snowman here they did 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:26.419
 but then took the complement of 

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:28.719
 income but also had the structure of it 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.719
 it's good 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.050
 come on 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:47.180
 here a curiosity here than a 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:47.180
 dead orca 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:56.159
 Obviously in winter it will be 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:58.259
 difficult to grow there, let's go up the stairs 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:00.840
 selection without ground without snow do not know if 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:03.930
 someone took the salt I've seen 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.509
 other part was only on the ground or 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.240
 by the people walking the snow is not 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:14.939
 common is not the same confirmed 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:19.289
 O watch here from here is the salt that he 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:21.870
 puts it on the ground so there's no snow melting 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.960
 Key places no use also by 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.460
 everywhere the points for example if 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.009
 have snow one slide will 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.949
 to be slightly unpleasant 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:35.310
 displeased good our video did not stay 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:41.310
 very big and will split him a car 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:45.139
 now like the video like a favorite 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.139
 and sign up for our channel 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.360
 and
