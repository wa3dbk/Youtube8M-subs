00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it was decided that he would give me a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.179

half<00:01:28.829> share<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.460> three<00:01:30.270> pops<00:01:30.590> in<00:01:31.590> return<00:01:32.040> for

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
half share and three pops in return for

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.789 
half share and three pops in return for
me<00:01:32.340> training<00:01:32.729> them<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:34.619> are

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
me training them so here they are

um<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> serious<00:01:37.170> training<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.710> probably<00:01:38.520> just

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
um the serious training is probably just

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.760 
um the serious training is probably just
about<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.090> commence<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.590> actually

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
about to commence and you are actually
going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> training<00:01:41.369> yourself<00:01:41.579> fine<00:01:42.090> that's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
going to training yourself fine that's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
going to training yourself fine that's
certainly<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.780> idea<00:01:42.869> pervaded<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.100> given

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
certainly the idea pervaded I get given

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.969 
certainly the idea pervaded I get given
a<00:01:44.399> license<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.119> I've<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> people<00:01:46.710> work

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.039 
think horse training is going to be
compared<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> dog<00:01:54.450> training<00:01:54.479> well<00:01:54.899> there's

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
compared to dog training well there's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.899 
compared to dog training well there's
got<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> huge<00:01:55.619> number<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.979> similarities

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
got to be a huge number of similarities

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.330 
got to be a huge number of similarities
I<00:01:57.149> set<00:01:57.570> out<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.990> principle<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
I set out with a principle that with the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
I set out with a principle that with the
horses<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.119> was<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> aim<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.979> feed

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
horses that I was going to aim to feed

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
horses that I was going to aim to feed
them<00:02:02.189> harder<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.689> feed<00:02:03.930> them<00:02:04.049> more

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
them harder and what I feed them more

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.440 
them harder and what I feed them more
and<00:02:04.500> work<00:02:04.829> them<00:02:05.040> harder<00:02:05.430> than<00:02:05.610> than<00:02:06.090> anybody

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and work them harder than than anybody

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.540 
and work them harder than than anybody
else<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> ensure<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.380> they<00:02:07.500> were<00:02:07.590> 100%<00:02:08.280> fit

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
else and ensure that they were 100% fit

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.199 
else and ensure that they were 100% fit
I<00:02:08.929> can't<00:02:09.929> say<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.440> I've<00:02:10.619> done<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.790> quite<00:02:12.000> so

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
I can't say that I've done it quite so

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.700 
I can't say that I've done it quite so
dramatically<00:02:12.750> differently

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
dramatically differently

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.100 
dramatically differently
I<00:02:13.770> say<00:02:14.370> my<00:02:14.700> first<00:02:14.910> imagined<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.540> was<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:15.960> to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I say my first imagined I was going to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.370 
I say my first imagined I was going to
but<00:02:16.410> um<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.970> know<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.180> plan<00:02:18.930> with<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> dogs

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
but um you know the plan with the dogs

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.380 
but um you know the plan with the dogs
is<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.770> set<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.370> similar<00:02:20.850> principles

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
is to set out with similar principles

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
is to set out with similar principles
and<00:02:21.690> see<00:02:22.560> how<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> goes

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
and see how it goes

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.360 
and see how it goes
the<00:02:23.520> dogs<00:02:23.790> are<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.530> bit<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.190> light

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the dogs are just just a bit of light

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.100 
the dogs are just just a bit of light
relief<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.940> hobby<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.390> at<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.600> same<00:02:27.780> time

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
relief and a hobby but at the same time

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.140 
relief and a hobby but at the same time
we<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> win<00:02:29.370> good<00:02:29.520> whiskey's<00:02:29.850> with<00:02:30.000> them

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
we want to win good whiskey's with them

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
we want to win good whiskey's with them
so<00:02:30.990> what's<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> next<00:02:31.410> step<00:02:31.620> from<00:02:31.830> here<00:02:31.860> you're

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
so what's the next step from here you're

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
so what's the next step from here you're
going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> gallop<00:02:32.610> from<00:02:32.760> here<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.120> we'll

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
going to gallop from here but we'll

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.030 
going to gallop from here but we'll
start<00:02:33.420> taking<00:02:33.750> insert<00:02:34.080> rack<00:02:34.320> let's<00:02:34.530> go<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.770> but

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
start taking insert rack let's go to but

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.270 
start taking insert rack let's go to but
first<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:36.450> my<00:02:36.990> training<00:02:37.650> traps<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
first of all my my training traps and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.790 
first of all my my training traps and
lure<00:02:38.690> should<00:02:39.690> be<00:02:39.810> arriving<00:02:40.230> in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.440> next<00:02:40.470> few

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
lure should be arriving in the next few

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.380 
lure should be arriving in the next few
days

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
days

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.790 
days
so<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.570> first<00:02:42.750> gallops<00:02:43.170> will<00:02:43.380> all<00:02:43.500> take<00:02:43.770> place

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
so the first gallops will all take place

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.120 
so the first gallops will all take place
here<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.380> then<00:02:46.380> they'll<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.770> go<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
here and then they'll have to go to a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.830 
here and then they'll have to go to a
track<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.580> some<00:02:47.790> trials<00:02:48.120> well<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.570> think<00:02:48.660> we're

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
track for some trials well I think we're

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
track for some trials well I think we're
definitely<00:02:48.960> gonna<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.440> keep<00:02:49.620> an<00:02:49.740> eye<00:02:49.830> out

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
definitely gonna have to keep an eye out

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.130 
definitely gonna have to keep an eye out
for<00:02:50.010> these<00:02:50.220> ones<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:51.180> tell<00:02:51.540> us<00:02:51.570> their<00:02:51.870> pet
