00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.450
 yap people six weeks for new 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.190
 video for the presentation of my 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.570
 resources pack so the one greenpac whose 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.250
 why greenpac simply because 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 that I did not have too many ideas so I 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 decided to make you a pack based on the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.250
 green to change so the pack will be 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.930
 available at 180 with people is that we 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.400
 is capable 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.260
 so without further ado start with 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 the presentation of the pack which by 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.670
 the interface of the step that they present themselves 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.590
 already the buttons that are like those 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.620
 so when you select a 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.969
 button that you put it in glass and the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.379
 Buttons are gray so 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.670
 the interface of the pa that stands as 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.860
 this with mark greenpac and leave 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.550
 images that I found on google in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.840
 green that makes it so nice so we go 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.960
 start with the presentation of 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 Netherlands at the college so already the ears that 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.590
 are 16 x 16 swords 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 so I wanted to make pc either 16 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 to change a little bit so I have a lot 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.500
 bet on the fluo green on this pact that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 it's my favorite glass just so 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.170
 all swords are with a handle 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.150
 towards apart from the podiums what is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.900
 So totally green sword in jam 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.439
 this case is nice 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.390
 the sword in iron the sword in gold the sword in 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.280
 stone and the sword in August so swords 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.530
 nice enough so I personally love 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.840
 the country are pretty cool they are they 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 are simple and cool so arched as 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.549
 this so I said in glass aside 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.310
 the half kg arrows that are behind 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.390
 the bow I took from another tray so that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.659
 makes it pretty good 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.460
 so this part of the defect arc and at 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.079
 total it gave that so frankly if 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.180
 this issue of me so the particles 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.880
 who are in verve or green stars 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.310
 to the arrow that is like this here 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.570
 the boots that are like these so 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.369
 friends nice enough for the pp mates 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.280
 So these are nice enough friends the 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.530
 particles that are like these here 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.159
 so the soups that are low like this 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.319
 like this so who are I am 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.720
 part of the impact soups defect is 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.400
 quickly and in total it gave that that I 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.420
 putting in glass and who moans small 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.830
 personal touch that makes it nice enough 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.569
 so the armor in Gaul therefore the armor 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.980
 which are basic armor set to 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.260
 to speak peace in diane what I wrote 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.720
 myself I put in green what 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.730
 iron armor is my favorite ball 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.580
 armor in dimon that makes it super nice 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.519

 tools in gold the tools in iron and the 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.780
 tools in dimon that I put in glass 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.370
 to stay in the theme of the pack so 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.849
 inventories that are like these 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.849
 like this 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.420
 the flames that are in glass like that 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.710
 and the water particles that are like 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.750
 that's the water that in light blue that 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.020
 I love the clear personal angle it goes great 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.240

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.459
 change a little 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.069
 also after that there are only various 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.150
 it's a bit of a culinary experience 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.000
 what are the legs of 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.130
 beauf who are like these here so 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.380
 for the not that I have not everything but 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.270
 I put a little pde to a 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.680
 yellow people and a little blue that the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.130
 blue too it's pretty close diverge 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.100
 too much so I want to show I want to put 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.160

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.630
 develops and so is already the water that is 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.380
 like that you've already seen them 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.510
 different woods so the minerals 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.680
 which are two bases of the crowd fesf so 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.890
 all blocks are fesf funds 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.450
 apart from the little gem the ore in 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.630
 jam what I said in green that makes 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:17.130

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:20.310
 topal this is a little quiet hood that I have 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.830

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.400
 some mush that I put in verse and a 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.630
 yellow that yellow is pretty close to the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.770
 glass so I did not want to put everything in 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.510
 glass all in green because if I 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.070
 I was time for a little ugly or 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.669
 jamie yellow and green and it makes super 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.330
 swag be chicken baby enough to return 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.130
 at the spawn we will test the particles have 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.870
 created the kraft particles of the p'tits 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.460
 golems disgusting up so already here's a 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.889
 golem 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.039
 I'm not happy at kraft a golem 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.919
 do not worry the kinds up so 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:04.220
 already the particles of charnay what they 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.349
 are like these and the two cnca so 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.069
 light green and stars towards clear 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:12.069
 different stars and stars and canvases 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.150

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.210
 personally said baleti thing I have 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:34.540
 changed and so already edith länder father 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:38.040
 take a shot at the compass my hand I 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:43.690
 put in english ok like ps like pathe 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.240
 and the diamond diamond here is already 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.100
 Länder range who like that alain quinet 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.260
 of super looks that I remember 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.500
 not against where I escaped 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.880
 pretty 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.620
 I remember I ask them what 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.140
 pack but I had it price of a package I 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.140
 change a little green all this more 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:07.240
 bybee hm already intrigues already already the 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.639
 bucket of water that's like that 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.780
 that I said so the wounded soldier of 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:13.030
 base the bucket of frozen water but in blue 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.910
 clear for that it's okay it goes 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.729
 with the oim it makes sense therefore the 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.949
 compass like this therefore I 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.120
 Green layout that was the township to 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.830
 dock as I know that there are a lot of 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.400
 people who love it the touch compass 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.740
 pack 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.289
 so I have the caveats so the 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.630
 dimon who is the one of the crowd fesf but 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.970
 that I said to him so it does not fill 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:38.660
 his swings 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:41.280
 So here you are by last little trick 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.650
 so the mouth I changed nothing put to 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.470
 share down the sub you have seen 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.479
 let's put aside the steak already the 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.830
 raw steak and steak cooked so it gives 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.110
 that's a hamburger that I have 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.669
 taken in a pack 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.690
 so here I think I did the 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.030
 rate of play not that people so 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.560
 I hope you enjoyed the pack at all 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.750

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.060
 you do it so the pack will be available at 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.860
