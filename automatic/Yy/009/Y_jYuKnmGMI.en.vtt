00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.590
 what is it like to win a typical 0 0 competition 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.260
 he did this in a great sense of victory because we have 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.860
 and just that your view in budgets suffered is not on both teams 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.059
 would actually score 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.769
 and then you are 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.130
 we never really want to do that 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.609
 very ugly match it worked a lot of hard 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.179
 the father from both sides and certainly from my van ado den haag but ours 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.210
 almost no chance and if you win it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.239
 we have 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.239
 yes that gives one there we just get better from football and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.880
 the tukker wednesday have shown the set is delicious 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.880
 what did he miss tonight at FC Groningen 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.800
 I found that we have 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.110
 the goal if more had played football so a bit more through the sides 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.270
 and then yes I wish to pass for the goal 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.920
 then I think we have created a lot more opportunities now and the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.500
 past two sides only a header from mexico after almost 3 0 we 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 try way too much through the center with a pair of air conditioning heelball 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.240
 can always get through in the small space 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.259
 yes what apple stood for days therefore yes very close together a whole 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.380
 The compact ones were still just not coming through so I guess we just got the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.560
 play more effectively, but the most important thing is that 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.560
 at the same time it just becomes fitter and comes on again 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.180
 jade that those are only those who win sped for the future 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.170
 in particular competition and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.100
 we know how to win so it looks like three years it is now all there now 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.950
 new book falls 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.520
 how is it that despite all good intentions I assume that it is nevertheless one 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.100
 drama of the match 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.620
 since that we do not participate 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.450
 it was just dramatic and it was all very slow 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.490
 but 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.719
 the second half is all worked together 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.669
 she is also busy and we know exactly how to walk along with the last bit 

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:50.059
 knows where the trail starts and that it then feels very fair and good 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.250
 trust is gone 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.880
 it was actually the only good attack by Groningen and you can do that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.470
 to give 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.610
 on the Asian Football Association 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.380
 i think i did a while later and put up a new project 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.909
 then got another one from asphalt with guts that could kick the ball in and that was 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.630
 another country 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.589
 and another good one 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.369
 all the rest and 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.329
 as I sign for it with reading and some talent ticked in
