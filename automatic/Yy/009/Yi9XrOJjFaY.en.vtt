a<00:00:00.210> lot<00:00:01.079> of<00:00:01.110> people<00:00:01.350> don't<00:00:01.740> know<00:00:01.949> this<00:00:02.190> but<00:00:02.429> on

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
a lot of people don't know this but on

trucks trailers and caravans the wheels
sometimes<00:00:06.450> get<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.810> little<00:00:06.870> bit<00:00:07.230> loose<00:00:07.470> in

wheel comes off don't worry it's not

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.230 
wheel comes off don't worry it's not
often<00:00:13.380> happening<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.700> something<00:00:15.000> of

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
often happening but it's something of

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.660 
often happening but it's something of
importance<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.740> mystery<00:00:17.160> though<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
importance and it's a mystery though it

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.519 
importance and it's a mystery though it
is<00:00:17.820> fair<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.150> say<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> wheel<00:00:19.260> that's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
is fair to say that of the wheel that's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.650 
is fair to say that of the wheel that's
most<00:00:19.770> likely<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.250> come<00:00:20.430> off<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.000> always<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
most likely to come off is always the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.349 
most likely to come off is always the
one<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> door<00:00:22.380> side<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.010> curb<00:00:23.340> side<00:00:23.730> the

one on the door side the curb side the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.929 
one on the door side the curb side the
reason<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.840> simple<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.320> suppose<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.760> go

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
reason is simple I suppose as you go

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.660 
reason is simple I suppose as you go
forwards<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.109> wheel<00:00:28.320> rotates<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
forwards the wheel rotates in that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
forwards the wheel rotates in that
direction<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.260> exactly<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.099> same

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
direction which is exactly the same

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.450 
direction which is exactly the same
direction<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.710> loosening<00:00:34.710> direction

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

through<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> wheel<00:00:36.180> bolt<00:00:36.770> some<00:00:37.770> people<00:00:38.070> don't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
through a wheel bolt some people don't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
through a wheel bolt some people don't
tighten<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.030> wheel<00:00:39.180> bolts<00:00:39.629> efficiently<00:00:40.230> or

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
tighten the wheel bolts efficiently or

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.709 
tighten the wheel bolts efficiently or
check<00:00:40.710> them<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:41.760> something<00:00:42.120> which

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
check them and that's something which

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.770 
check them and that's something which
needs<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.350> tightness<00:00:44.129> device<00:00:44.579> called<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.239> torque

needs a tightness device called a torque

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.260 
needs a tightness device called a torque
wrench<00:00:45.920> now<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> torque<00:00:47.670> wrench<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
wrench now this is a torque wrench and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.869 
wrench now this is a torque wrench and
it<00:00:48.420> ensures<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.440> bolt<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.730> be

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it ensures that the bolt is going to be

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.990 
it ensures that the bolt is going to be
tight<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.500> required<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.640> caravan

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it out in this case on this caravan we

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850 
it out in this case on this caravan we
have<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> set<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.370> torque<00:01:02.910> wrench<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:04.379> stop

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
have to set the torque wrench to stop

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
have to set the torque wrench to stop
turning<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.519> bolt<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> reaches<00:01:06.689> a

that's<00:01:10.860> set<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.939> part<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.900> torque

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that's set on this part of the torque

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.429 
that's set on this part of the torque
wrench<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.920> by<00:01:14.580> rotating<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.509> handle<00:01:16.020> we

wrench here by rotating the handle we

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130 
wrench here by rotating the handle we
can<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> scale<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.939> we've<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:18.810> got<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can see on a scale that we've now got a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
can see on a scale that we've now got a
tightness<00:01:19.740> setting<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.909> hundred<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
tightness setting of the hundred and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.590 
tightness setting of the hundred and
thirty<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> torque<00:01:23.549> wrench<00:01:23.820> set<00:01:24.210> we

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
thirty so with the torque wrench set we

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.670 
thirty so with the torque wrench set we
start<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.350> tighten<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.400> bolt<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.680> then

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
start to tighten the bolt and then

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740 
start to tighten the bolt and then
you'll<00:01:29.100> suddenly<00:01:29.430> reach<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.939> point<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you'll suddenly reach a point when it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.569 
you'll suddenly reach a point when it's
near<00:01:30.990> tightness<00:01:31.700> when<00:01:32.700> it'll<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> click

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
near tightness when it'll make a click

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.969 
near tightness when it'll make a click
there's<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.820> click<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:37.020> confirms<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
there's the click that confirms that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.149 
there's the click that confirms that
this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.939> now<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> correct<00:01:39.720> tightness<00:01:40.229> now

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
this is now the correct tightness now

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
this is now the correct tightness now
look<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.460> funny<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:41.970> over<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> years

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
