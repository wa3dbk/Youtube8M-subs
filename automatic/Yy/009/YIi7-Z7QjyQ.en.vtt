00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
together this little this little ring

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.219 
together this little this little ring
here<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.330> how<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.509> Chinese<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.110> it

they pop it in they stick this in and by

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
they pop it in they stick this in and by
compression<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.930> compress<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.250> pops

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
compression to compress this and it pops

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
compression to compress this and it pops
into<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.880> machined<00:01:24.390> ring<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.960> holds<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
into a machined ring it holds it in

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.830 
into a machined ring it holds it in
place<00:01:25.740> until<00:01:26.580> someone<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.210> us<00:01:27.360> comes<00:01:27.600> along

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
place until someone like us comes along

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.319 
place until someone like us comes along
and<00:01:27.990> figures<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.030> need<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and figures this out and all we need to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.030 
and figures this out and all we need to
do<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> remove<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.110> plug<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.829> need<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
do is remove this plug we need to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.390 
do is remove this plug we need to
overwhelm<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:33.270> spring<00:01:33.960> tension<00:01:34.500> pop<00:01:35.159> this

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
overwhelm this spring tension pop this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
overwhelm this spring tension pop this
dude<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> disc<00:01:37.470> back<00:01:37.619> falls

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
dude out and then the disc back falls

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410 
dude out and then the disc back falls
out<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.549> let's<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:38.939> can<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
out so let's see if we can make it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 
out so let's see if we can make it
happen<00:01:39.680> I'll<00:01:40.680> try<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> work<00:01:42.060> around

snagged a couple of those disks at the
same<00:03:15.370> time

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:51.040 

let<00:03:27.000> me<00:03:27.060> find<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.360> beater<00:03:29.330> not<00:03:30.330> ideal<00:03:30.750> but<00:03:30.930> hey

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.900 

I'm<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.080> gun<00:03:52.320> this<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.740> by<00:03:53.040> far<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.310> toughest

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
I'm a gun this is by far the toughest

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:04.310 
I'm a gun this is by far the toughest
one<00:04:01.370> there<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.490> go<00:04:02.640> well<00:04:03.630> this<00:04:03.780> one's<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.080> little

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
one there we go well this one's a little

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.170 
one there we go well this one's a little
more<00:04:04.470> substantial<00:04:04.710> as<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.580> see<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.030> was

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
more substantial as you see that was

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.720 
more substantial as you see that was
quite<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.540> surprise<00:04:06.750> I<00:04:07.400> probably<00:04:08.400> should<00:04:08.640> have

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
quite a surprise I probably should have

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.960 
quite a surprise I probably should have
kept<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.180> my<00:04:09.330> shed<00:04:10.490> but<00:04:11.490> you<00:04:11.610> can<00:04:11.730> see<00:04:11.850> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
kept this on my shed but you can see the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.640 
kept this on my shed but you can see the
disc<00:04:12.150> does<00:04:12.360> come<00:04:12.570> out<00:04:12.690> it's<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.140> same<00:04:13.350> design

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
disc does come out it's the same design

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.950 
disc does come out it's the same design
it's<00:04:13.920> just<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.130> little<00:04:14.340> bit<00:04:14.460> thicker<00:04:14.810> than<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
it's just a little bit thicker than the

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.750 
it's just a little bit thicker than the
other<00:04:16.080> which<00:04:16.860> first<00:04:17.700> time<00:04:17.880> I've<00:04:18.030> seen<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.300> so

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
other which first time I've seen that so

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.620 
other which first time I've seen that so
there's<00:04:20.760> what<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:20.940> looks<00:04:21.090> like<00:04:21.210> but<00:04:21.360> it's<00:04:21.480> held

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
there's what it looks like but it's held

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.370 
there's what it looks like but it's held
in<00:04:21.750> place<00:04:21.870> by<00:04:21.960> the<00:04:22.200> same<00:04:22.500> clip<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:25.020> one<00:04:25.200> was<00:04:25.350> a

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
in place by the same clip this one was a

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.960 
in place by the same clip this one was a
little<00:04:25.530> more<00:04:25.800> difficult<00:04:26.280> than<00:04:26.430> all<00:04:26.790> the

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
little more difficult than all the

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.840 
little more difficult than all the
others<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:28.380> get<00:04:28.560> out<00:04:28.740> but<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.220> end<00:04:29.340> result<00:04:29.670> is

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
others to get out but the end result is

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.930 
others to get out but the end result is
the<00:04:30.060> same<00:04:30.770> if<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.920> look<00:04:32.100> in<00:04:32.310> we<00:04:32.610> now<00:04:32.730> have

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
the same if you look in we now have

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.290 
the same if you look in we now have
access<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.390> the<00:04:33.570> entire<00:04:33.720> disc<00:04:34.200> back<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:36.030> I'll

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
access to the entire disc back and I'll

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.620 
access to the entire disc back and I'll
try<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.540> change<00:04:36.780> I'll<00:04:37.380> dump<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.860> off<00:04:38.630> so

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
try to change I'll dump it off so

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.050 
try to change I'll dump it off so
there's<00:04:39.810> our<00:04:39.930> guts<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.470> lock<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:41.010> then<00:04:41.610> if

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
there's our guts of the lock and then if

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.700 
there's our guts of the lock and then if
we<00:04:42.540> look<00:04:42.720> up<00:04:42.870> inside<00:04:43.230> of<00:04:43.260> there

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
we look up inside of there

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.910 
we look up inside of there
this<00:04:43.860> one<00:04:44.070> does<00:04:44.310> again<00:04:44.820> quite<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.510> surprise<00:04:45.920> it

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
this one does again quite a surprise it

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.380 
this one does again quite a surprise it
has<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:47.400> metal<00:04:48.030> body<00:04:49.700> so<00:04:50.700> if<00:04:50.850> we<00:04:50.970> can<00:04:51.120> dump<00:04:51.330> that

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
has a metal body so if we can dump that

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.350 
has a metal body so if we can dump that
out<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:52.140> ball<00:04:52.290> bearings<00:04:52.880> there's<00:04:53.880> our<00:04:54.090> metal

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
out the ball bearings there's our metal

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.910 
out the ball bearings there's our metal
body

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
body

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.370 
body
there's<00:04:55.920> our<00:04:56.070> ball<00:04:56.280> bearing<00:04:56.670> one<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:56.910> them<00:04:57.380> and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
there's our ball bearing one of them and

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.580 
there's our ball bearing one of them and
then<00:04:58.650> our<00:04:58.770> hasp<00:04:58.980> completely<00:04:59.760> falls<00:05:00.060> out<00:05:00.590> and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
then our hasp completely falls out and

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.430 
then our hasp completely falls out and
that's<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.100> end<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.490> it's<00:05:03.450> no<00:05:03.690> ABLOY<00:05:04.110> but<00:05:04.410> I

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
that's the end of it it's no ABLOY but I

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.570 
that's the end of it it's no ABLOY but I
got<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.710> tell<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:04.980> this<00:05:05.100> was<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.310> little

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
got to tell you this was a little

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.840 
got to tell you this was a little
tougher<00:05:05.940> than<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.210> other<00:05:06.360> Chinese<00:05:06.870> ones

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
tougher than the other Chinese ones

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.150 
tougher than the other Chinese ones
they're<00:05:08.850> mix
