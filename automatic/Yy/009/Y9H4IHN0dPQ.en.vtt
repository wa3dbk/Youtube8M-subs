two hundred percent

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.509 
two hundred percent

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.660 

go<00:01:14.780> ahead<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.080> do<00:01:15.290> this<00:01:15.470> overall<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.430> same

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
go ahead and do this overall the same

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.710 
go ahead and do this overall the same
time<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.840> you'll<00:01:18.020> learn<00:01:18.790> where<00:01:19.790> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
time and you'll learn where to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.290 
time and you'll learn where to
make<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.500> selections<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.760> backtrack

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
make your selections like backtrack

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.680 
make your selections like backtrack
through<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> selection<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.500> order<00:01:26.370> to

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.300 

skip<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.740> part<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.160> it<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.730> didn't

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.840 

again

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.630 

let's<00:01:40.270> see<00:01:40.420> how<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:40.710> went<00:01:41.710> through<00:01:41.950> here<00:01:42.369> and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
let's see how I went through here and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.330 
let's see how I went through here and
then<00:01:43.180> up<00:01:43.360> here

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
then up here

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.050 
then up here
looped<00:01:44.579> backwards<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:46.079> order<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.759> miss<00:01:47.759> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
looped backwards in order to miss this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250 
looped backwards in order to miss this
part

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.899 

you'll<00:01:53.860> get<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.250> just<00:01:54.940> need<00:01:55.120> to<00:01:55.270> practice

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.529 

so<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.539> panel<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.200> complete<00:02:01.679> I<00:02:02.159> always<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.179> I

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
so that panel is complete I always do I

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.529 
so that panel is complete I always do I
break<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> panel's<00:02:04.679> first<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:06.149> in

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
break down the panel's first and then in

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.280 
break down the panel's first and then in
solid<00:02:07.049> color<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.649> break<00:02:08.549> down<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.940> people

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.100 

so<00:02:11.439> panels<00:02:11.920> than<00:02:12.159> people<00:02:12.579> and<00:02:12.849> then<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.840> usually

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
so panels than people and then I usually

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
so panels than people and then I usually
once<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:15.069> person<00:02:15.549> is<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:15.939> locked<00:02:16.480> out

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
once the person is all locked out

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.089 
once the person is all locked out
I<00:02:18.180> will<00:02:18.750> go<00:02:18.900> ahead<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.379> go<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.860> do<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
I will go ahead and go in and do the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.050 
I will go ahead and go in and do the
background<00:02:20.370> details

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:44.690 

so<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.540> saved<00:02:27.840> them<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.440> last

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.000 

when<00:02:45.239> you're<00:02:45.360> going<00:02:45.390> underneath<00:02:46.050> black<00:02:46.620> lines

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
when you're going underneath black lines

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.309 
when you're going underneath black lines
solid<00:02:47.670> black<00:02:47.849> lines<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.569> not<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.170> be

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
solid black lines you do not have to be

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.580 
solid black lines you do not have to be
as<00:02:49.590> careful

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
as careful

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.540 
as careful
as<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.250> are

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.280 

thicker<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.060> lines<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.510> better<00:02:59.690> means<00:03:00.110> you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
thicker the lines the better means you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:11.920 
thicker the lines the better means you
can<00:03:00.410> get<00:03:00.500> through<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.890> faster

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.590 

so<00:03:12.620> another<00:03:13.189> thing<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.489> note

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
so another thing to note

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.330 
so another thing to note
program<00:03:16.170> i'm<00:03:16.770> using<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:18.200> adobe<00:03:19.200> photoshop<00:03:19.680> and

program i'm using is adobe photoshop and
i'm<00:03:20.580> also<00:03:20.760> using<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:22.280> Wacom<00:03:23.280> tablet<00:03:24.060> instead<00:03:24.420> of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
i'm also using a Wacom tablet instead of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.530 
i'm also using a Wacom tablet instead of
a<00:03:24.750> mouse<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:25.860> can<00:03:26.040> do<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.460> with<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.670> mouse<00:03:26.940> it

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
a mouse you can do this with a mouse it

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.890 
a mouse you can do this with a mouse it
just<00:03:27.930> takes<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.500> lot<00:03:29.130> longer<00:03:29.370> I<00:03:29.880> started<00:03:30.720> out

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
just takes a lot longer I started out

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.380 
just takes a lot longer I started out
plotting<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.620> used<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.920> mouse<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:33.000> soon

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
plotting and I used a mouse and I soon

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.270 
plotting and I used a mouse and I soon
realized

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
realized

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.640 
realized
tablet<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.450> way<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.630> go

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:57.710 

this

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.690 

I<00:03:57.810> apologize<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.770> I'm<00:03:58.920> speeding<00:03:59.280> through<00:03:59.580> this

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
I apologize if I'm speeding through this

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.440 
I apologize if I'm speeding through this
too

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
too

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
too
but<00:04:01.599> I<00:04:01.720> think<00:04:02.080> you<00:04:02.200> probably<00:04:02.349> get<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:02.920> idea<00:04:02.980> by

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
but I think you probably get the idea by

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.640 
but I think you probably get the idea by
now

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.580 

basically<00:04:06.640> just<00:04:06.670> tracing<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.750> lines

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.500 

and<00:04:11.739> it's<00:04:12.370> important<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:12.970> note<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.150> you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
and it's important to note that you

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.009 
and it's important to note that you
should<00:04:13.540> always<00:04:13.930> do<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.980> same<00:04:15.250> colors<00:04:15.989> for<00:04:16.989> a

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
should always do the same colors for a

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.870 
should always do the same colors for a
character<00:04:17.410> throughout<00:04:17.949> this<00:04:18.190> throughout<00:04:18.699> the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
character throughout this throughout the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.840 
character throughout this throughout the
page<00:04:19.120> so<00:04:19.959> that<00:04:20.169> when<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.160> go<00:04:21.310> back<00:04:21.519> in<00:04:21.549> and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
page so that when you go back in and

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.570 
page so that when you go back in and
make<00:04:22.000> selections<00:04:22.630> if<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.080> want<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.350> select

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
make selections if you want to select

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.960 
make selections if you want to select
every

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.930 

skin<00:04:28.630> tone<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:29.830> character<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.700> page

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
skin tone of that character on the page

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.800 
skin tone of that character on the page
it<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.350> can

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
it you can

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.460 
it you can
so<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.290> do

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
so you do

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.230 
so you do
mess<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:35.950> all<00:04:36.040> up

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
mess it all up

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.529 
mess it all up
making<00:04:38.020> him<00:04:38.580> dark-skinned<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:39.759> one<00:04:39.940> panel<00:04:40.419> on

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
making him dark-skinned in one panel on

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.620 
making him dark-skinned in one panel on
light-skinned<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.259> another

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.030 

that<00:04:44.110> just<00:04:44.350> makes<00:04:44.530> more<00:04:44.800> work<00:04:44.830> colors

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.670 

and<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.580> always<00:04:48.940> use<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.180> same<00:04:49.510> white<00:04:49.870> for<00:04:50.530> the

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
and I always use the same white for the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.880 
and I always use the same white for the
eyes<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:51.570> every<00:04:52.570> character<00:04:53.050> I<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:53.740> that's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
eyes of every character I think that's

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.150 
eyes of every character I think that's
the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.810 
the
way<00:04:55.610> most<00:04:55.850> people<00:04:56.000> do<00:04:56.390> it

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:07.330 

think<00:04:59.870> these<00:05:00.870> two<00:05:01.140> panels<00:05:01.560> are<00:05:01.740> just

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.900 

just

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.540 

make<00:05:11.480> seat

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.500 

I<00:05:16.290> snag<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.590> wrong<00:05:17.940> and<00:05:18.940> it<00:05:19.060> seemed<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.390> work

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
I snag the wrong and it seemed to work

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:29.550 
I snag the wrong and it seemed to work
ok

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.909 

you'll<00:05:30.240> learn<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.300> more<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.930> do<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:32.860> how

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
you'll learn the more you do this how

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.370 
you'll learn the more you do this how
far<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.639> break<00:05:33.880> down<00:05:34.180> things<00:05:35.130> sometimes

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
far to break down things sometimes

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.230 
far to break down things sometimes
page<00:05:37.980> and<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.310> don't<00:05:38.520> need<00:05:38.700> to<00:05:38.850> break<00:05:39.060> down

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
page and you don't need to break down

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.850 
page and you don't need to break down
every<00:05:39.720> single<00:05:40.080> thing

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
every single thing

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.740 
every single thing
it<00:05:42.189> really<00:05:42.460> also<00:05:42.699> will<00:05:42.969> depend<00:05:43.360> on<00:05:43.569> the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
it really also will depend on the

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.820 
it really also will depend on the
colorist<00:05:44.199> you're<00:05:44.409> working

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.980 

here

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.040 

Oh<00:05:55.220> another<00:05:56.220> thing

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.830 

you<00:06:00.169> can<00:06:00.379> make<00:06:00.680> your<00:06:00.860> selection

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.909 

I<00:06:03.870> use<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.770> regular<00:06:05.100> lasso<00:06:05.520> tool<00:06:05.730> there<00:06:05.910> and

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
I use the regular lasso tool there and

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.460 
I use the regular lasso tool there and
when<00:06:07.919> you<00:06:08.070> fill<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.610> in<00:06:09.139> you<00:06:10.139> can<00:06:10.320> actually<00:06:10.530> use

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
when you fill it in you can actually use

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.740 
when you fill it in you can actually use
the<00:06:13.470> paint<00:06:13.680> bucket<00:06:13.830> anywhere<00:06:14.520> that<00:06:15.419> same

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
the paint bucket anywhere that same

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.140 
the paint bucket anywhere that same
color<00:06:16.020> is<00:06:16.320> see<00:06:17.070> I<00:06:17.100> didn't<00:06:17.580> have<00:06:17.699> to<00:06:17.850> make<00:06:18.000> it

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
color is see I didn't have to make it

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.450 
color is see I didn't have to make it
inside<00:06:18.300> the<00:06:18.810> selection<00:06:19.290> that<00:06:20.010> will<00:06:20.220> really

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
inside the selection that will really

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.770 
inside the selection that will really
save<00:06:20.729> you<00:06:20.910> time<00:06:21.150> along<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.320> way

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.300 

I<00:06:27.280> believe

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.540 

check<00:06:33.000> it<00:06:33.150> out

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
check it out

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.360 
check it out
you<00:06:35.120> see<00:06:35.330> how<00:06:35.480> all<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.870> colors<00:06:36.250> butt<00:06:37.250> up

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
you see how all the colors butt up

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.900 
you see how all the colors butt up
against<00:06:37.790> each<00:06:37.910> other

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.000 

so<00:06:43.300> you<00:06:43.840> can<00:06:43.960> go<00:06:44.080> ahead<00:06:44.170> and<00:06:44.290> check<00:06:44.650> out<00:06:44.830> my

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
so you can go ahead and check out my

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.700 
so you can go ahead and check out my
other<00:06:45.190> video<00:06:45.670> that<00:06:46.030> will<00:06:46.150> be<00:06:46.300> a<00:06:46.570> walk<00:06:47.440> through

other video that will be a walk through

other video that will be a walk through

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
think I need to explain things better
