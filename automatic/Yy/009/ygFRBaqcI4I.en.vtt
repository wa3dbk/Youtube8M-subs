tightly another thing that I use to
guide<00:03:18.150> me<00:03:18.360> this<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> sensitivity<00:03:19.590> analysis

guide me this is a sensitivity analysis

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.790 
guide me this is a sensitivity analysis
and<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.580> basically<00:03:21.090> takes<00:03:22.050> each<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.680> the

and it basically takes each of the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.640 
and it basically takes each of the
envelope<00:03:23.280> aspects<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.150> adjusts<00:03:24.930> them<00:03:25.140> from

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.770 
the design you know the current design
value<00:03:28.950> would<00:03:29.130> be<00:03:29.250> right<00:03:29.459> here<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.540> takes

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
value would be right here and it takes

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.699 
value would be right here and it takes
it<00:03:30.989> down<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.260> 10%<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.400> then<00:03:32.489> up<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.810> 200%<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.530> if

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
it down to 10% and then up to 200% so if

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.970 
it down to 10% and then up to 200% so if
let's<00:03:35.130> say<00:03:35.250> we<00:03:35.550> had<00:03:35.840> 12<00:03:36.840> inches<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.320> roof

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980

analysis<00:04:07.170> like<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:08.070> is<00:04:08.280> what<00:04:09.239> maybe<00:04:09.480> 15

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
analysis like this this is what maybe 15

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.160 
analysis like this this is what maybe 15
15<00:04:11.519> different<00:04:12.180> parameters<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.050> I'm

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
15 different parameters that I'm

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.890 
15 different parameters that I'm
adjusting<00:04:13.530> 10<00:04:14.430> times<00:04:14.790> each<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.660> there's<00:04:15.840> a

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
adjusting 10 times each so there's a

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.500 
adjusting 10 times each so there's a
hundred<00:04:16.290> 50<00:04:16.799> different<00:04:17.549> building<00:04:18.150> designs

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
hundred 50 different building designs

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.960 
hundred 50 different building designs
that<00:04:18.780> are<00:04:18.840> being<00:04:19.109> analysed<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.340> displayed<00:04:20.790> at

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
that are being analysed and displayed at

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.020 
that are being analysed and displayed at
once<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.540> if<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.840> adjust<00:04:22.289> any<00:04:22.560> any<00:04:23.430> aspect<00:04:23.910> of

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
once and if I adjust any any aspect of

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.460 
once and if I adjust any any aspect of
the<00:04:24.090> building<00:04:24.270> it'll<00:04:24.570> do<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.810> again<00:04:25.050> nearly

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
the building it'll do it again nearly

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.260 
the building it'll do it again nearly
instantly<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.280> 150

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
instantly so 150

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.439 
instantly so 150
different<00:04:27.930> design<00:04:28.319> options<00:04:29.449> calculated

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
different design options calculated

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.120 
different design options calculated
almost<00:04:30.720> instantaneously<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.860> do<00:04:31.979> that

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
almost instantaneously and to do that

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.300 
almost instantaneously and to do that
dynamically<00:04:32.699> would<00:04:32.940> would<00:04:33.270> be<00:04:33.389> painful

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
dynamically would would be painful

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.309 
dynamically would would be painful
there<00:04:35.310> are<00:04:35.400> basically<00:04:35.699> three<00:04:36.050> three<00:04:37.050> roof

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
there are basically three three roof

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.650 
there are basically three three roof
assemblies<00:04:37.919> on<00:04:38.069> this<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.430> I've<00:04:38.550> got<00:04:38.759> roof

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
assemblies on this so I've got roof

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.960 
assemblies on this so I've got roof

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
fruit so to speak this line for instance

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.240 
fruit so to speak this line for instance
this<00:05:14.819> is<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.120> wall<00:05:15.389> cavity<00:05:15.930> insulation<00:05:16.500> so<00:05:17.130> if

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
this is the wall cavity insulation so if

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.790 
this is the wall cavity insulation so if
I<00:05:17.479> you<00:05:18.479> can<00:05:18.630> see<00:05:18.900> that<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.229> it's<00:05:19.500> made<00:05:19.770> a

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
I you can see that it it's made a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.499 
I you can see that it it's made a
tremendous<00:05:19.919> difference<00:05:20.699> getting<00:05:21.150> to<00:05:21.330> here

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
tremendous difference getting to here

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.899 
tremendous difference getting to here
and<00:05:21.630> it's<00:05:21.780> starting<00:05:22.349> to<00:05:22.380> flatten<00:05:22.949> out<00:05:23.159> which

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
and it's starting to flatten out which

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.320 
and it's starting to flatten out which
means<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.479> there<00:05:25.139> are<00:05:25.310> substantially

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
means that there are substantially

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.399 
means that there are substantially
diminishing<00:05:27.330> returns<00:05:27.720> at<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:28.110> point

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
diminishing returns at this point

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:29.960 
diminishing returns at this point
compared<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:28.949> somewhere<00:05:29.310> over<00:05:29.580> here<00:05:29.789> where

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
compared to somewhere over here where

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.300 
compared to somewhere over here where
it's<00:05:30.090> a<00:05:30.180> very<00:05:30.210> very<00:05:30.810> steep<00:05:31.139> decline<00:05:31.680> so<00:05:32.219> it

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
it's a very very steep decline so it

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.120 
it's a very very steep decline so it
just<00:05:32.490> helps<00:05:32.849> me<00:05:33.169> decide<00:05:34.169> which<00:05:34.530> of<00:05:34.590> the<00:05:34.889> knobs

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
just helps me decide which of the knobs

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.640 
just helps me decide which of the knobs
to<00:05:35.430> turn<00:05:35.669> at<00:05:36.300> any<00:05:36.330> given<00:05:36.750> point<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.380> of<00:05:37.469> course

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
to turn at any given point and of course

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.260 
to turn at any given point and of course
if<00:05:37.770> I<00:05:37.860> change<00:05:38.190> for<00:05:38.639> instance<00:05:38.699> the<00:05:39.030> wall

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
if I change for instance the wall

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.480 
if I change for instance the wall
insulation<00:05:39.690> its<00:05:40.650> relationship<00:05:41.340> to

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
insulation its relationship to

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.159 
insulation its relationship to
everything<00:05:41.550> else<00:05:42.000> will<00:05:42.240> change<00:05:42.509> as<00:05:42.719> well<00:05:42.870> I

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
everything else will change as well I

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.969 
everything else will change as well I
think<00:05:43.500> it's<00:05:43.740> a<00:05:43.830> very<00:05:44.370> good<00:05:44.699> verification<00:05:45.599> tool

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
think it's a very good verification tool

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.070 
think it's a very good verification tool
you<00:05:46.979> you<00:05:47.310> know<00:05:47.460> it's<00:05:47.969> a<00:05:48.060> lot<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.479> do<00:05:48.690> here<00:05:48.960> but

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
you you know it's a lot to do here but

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.180 
you you know it's a lot to do here but
once<00:05:49.259> you<00:05:49.380> learn<00:05:49.530> how<00:05:49.560> to<00:05:49.710> do<00:05:49.889> it<00:05:50.009> it's<00:05:50.130> pretty

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
once you learn how to do it it's pretty

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.580 
once you learn how to do it it's pretty
quick<00:05:50.580> but<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.509> you<00:05:51.780> know<00:05:51.810> you<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:52.259> put<00:05:52.560> a

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
quick but you you know you you put a

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.499 
quick but you you know you you put a
building<00:05:52.830> in<00:05:53.070> here<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.460> gives<00:05:53.550> you<00:05:53.789> what's

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
building in here and it gives you what's

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.390 
building in here and it gives you what's
been<00:05:54.719> field-tested<00:05:55.199> to<00:05:55.770> be<00:05:55.919> a<00:05:55.949> fairly

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
been field-tested to be a fairly

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.419
