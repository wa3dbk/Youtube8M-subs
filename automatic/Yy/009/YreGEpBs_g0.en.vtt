00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.020
 today we are going to refer 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.699
 change of spark plugs in the bec 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.119
 first we are going to withdraw 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.239
 the power cord 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.239
 Second step we are going to withdraw the homeland 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.810
 but be careful when you took it out 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.619
 p avoid 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.560
 pl once you have spent more power than they are in the engine enter inside the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.989
 combustion chamber 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.069
 which can produce scratches in the cinema 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.760
 3 followed by this 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.730
 the productivity 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.690
 without using fat in the liver I must place them 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.830
 and rotate it by hand 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.710
 until then 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.650
 as an actor quim meters 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.370
 leroy tighten 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.380
 in this case for this search for this model 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.220
 the tables indicate twenty minutes 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.510
 of success 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.510
 enough 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 I should not squeeze my hand 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.050
 placed on the power cord 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.400
 I squeeze the door first with my hand then opted for monfort and metro and in this 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.260
 case for a door 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.280
 of this spark plug model the maximum tightening 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.850
 2 500 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.110
 I must repeat it 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.990
 the four entities in this case 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.630
 four centuries ago 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.680
 I must never change a single voice and take charge of the other three 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.920
 ancient 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.200
 nor should I mix without brand 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 of spark plugs 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.980
 when we should change a spark plug 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.890
 this important 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 replace it 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.690
 while 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.840
 We can similar fujián bar 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 abroad 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.730
 especially in what we call investment is the distance between the adjustment fund 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.249
 and the end of the world 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.869
 this distance is very important since the 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:16.919
 pujía that is inside the combustion chamber yes sir used a 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.779
 spark plug 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.729
 of greater investment 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.099
 I can get 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.610
 to the piston his career up and volcano and rumba and 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:32.049
 synthesized one of lower investment I will not achieve the temperature in the 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.870
 combustion chamber that the vehicle needs so I must repeat to you 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.239
 Catalogue 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.559
 change for the spark plug 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:47.709
 I should always consult the dealer that has the catalogs they were going to know 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.599
 advise me
