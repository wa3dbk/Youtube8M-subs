00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
word art wouldn't be very exciting if we

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.609 
word art wouldn't be very exciting if we
just<00:00:54.119> cut<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.479> out<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.019> so<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.589> I

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
shape of this particular pattern just to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.179 
shape of this particular pattern just to
give<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.609> whimsy<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:43.039> you<00:01:44.039> can

give it a little more whimsy now you can
do<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.179> nodes<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> with

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
do that with any of the nodes and with

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
do that with any of the nodes and with
word<00:01:46.890> art<00:01:47.130> patterns<00:01:47.549> some<00:01:47.819> work<00:01:47.999> better<00:01:48.240> than

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
word art patterns some work better than

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.840 
word art patterns some work better than
others<00:01:48.810> once<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.799> get<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.189> node<00:01:50.460> moved

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
of the curve you just created so you can

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
kind of effect it just depends on what

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.760 
kind of effect it just depends on what
you're<00:02:02.729> looking<00:02:03.119> for<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.630> pattern<00:02:03.899> but

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you're looking for in your pattern but

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
you're looking for in your pattern but
you<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.429> ability<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.240> some<00:02:06.509> pretty

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
you have the ability to make some pretty

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.480 
you have the ability to make some pretty
neat<00:02:06.959> changes<00:02:07.439> here<00:02:07.709> and<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:08.340> all

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
neat changes here and it's all

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.490 
neat changes here and it's all
interactive<00:02:09.240> with<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.600> mouse<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.350> you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
interactive with the mouse so as you

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.150 
interactive with the mouse so as you
change<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
change it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.470 
change it
it'll<00:02:11.400> make<00:02:11.550> these<00:02:11.790> changes<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.830> case

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
it'll make these changes so in this case

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.060 
it'll make these changes so in this case
these<00:02:15.480> changes<00:02:15.990> are<00:02:16.110> probably<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.650> what<00:02:16.950> we

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
these changes are probably not what we

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.920 
these changes are probably not what we
would<00:02:17.250> want<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.700> piece<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.030> clip<00:02:18.240> we're

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
would want in a piece of clip we're

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.509 
would want in a piece of clip we're
maybe<00:02:19.379> something<00:02:19.739> like<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.069> might<00:02:20.310> be<00:02:20.489> a

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
maybe something like that might be a

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.280 
maybe something like that might be a
little<00:02:20.700> better<00:02:21.000> then<00:02:21.659> we<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:22.019> ahead<00:02:22.109> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
little better then we can go ahead and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.849 
little better then we can go ahead and
select<00:02:22.439> our<00:02:22.739> pick<00:02:22.980> tool<00:02:23.239> select<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.469> box<00:02:25.469> or

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
select our pick tool select the box or

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.399 
select our pick tool select the box or
rectangular<00:02:26.519> tool<00:02:26.900> create<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.959> little<00:02:28.230> base

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
rectangular tool create a little base

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.149 
rectangular tool create a little base
for<00:02:28.769> it

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
for it

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.670 
for it
draw<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> lasso<00:02:30.359> around<00:02:30.569> all<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.560> can

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
draw a lasso around all of it you can

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.759 
draw a lasso around all of it you can
use<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.129> weld<00:02:32.370> tool<00:02:33.209> up<00:02:33.510> here<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:34.349> weld<00:02:34.560> this

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
use the weld tool up here to weld this

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.910 
use the weld tool up here to weld this
together<00:02:35.099> into<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.579> pattern<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:37.079> I<00:02:37.530> think<00:02:37.829> you

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
together into a pattern and I think you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.619 
together into a pattern and I think you
can<00:02:38.040> see<00:02:38.219> that's<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.579> nicer<00:02:38.909> looking<00:02:39.209> pattern

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
can see that's a nicer looking pattern

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.990 
can see that's a nicer looking pattern
for<00:02:40.079> a<00:02:40.109> piece<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.500> word<00:02:40.709> art<00:02:40.950> than<00:02:41.370> just<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
for a piece of word art than just to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.030 
for a piece of word art than just to
type<00:02:42.719> the<00:02:42.900> words<00:02:43.079> on<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.379> screen<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.799> let<00:02:43.920> it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
type the words on the screen and let it

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.459 
type the words on the screen and let it
go<00:02:44.159> so<00:02:44.459> there's<00:02:45.060> an<00:02:45.239> example<00:02:45.719> of<00:02:45.930> another<00:02:46.049> tool

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
go so there's an example of another tool

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.020 
go so there's an example of another tool
in<00:02:46.650> CorelDraw<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.519> might<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.849> able<00:02:47.909> to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
in CorelDraw that you might be able to

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.080 
in CorelDraw that you might be able to
use<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.480> create<00:02:48.900> some<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.260> your<00:02:49.500> patterns<00:02:50.090> good

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
