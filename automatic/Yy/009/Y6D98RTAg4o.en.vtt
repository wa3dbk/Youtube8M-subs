the misinformation campaign in revenge
of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> Fallen<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> worked

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
of the Fallen I don't think it worked

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
of the Fallen I don't think it worked
quite<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.600> good<00:01:01.020> as<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.440> thought<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.739> would

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
quite as good as you thought it would

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.240 
quite as good as you thought it would
work<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.600> time<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.559> worked<00:01:04.890> because

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
work but in this time it worked because

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.760 
work but in this time it worked because
I<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:06.150> thrown<00:01:06.479> off<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:07.110> blown<00:01:07.350> away<00:01:07.380> by<00:01:07.740> all

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
I was thrown off I was blown away by all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.100 
I was thrown off I was blown away by all
the<00:01:07.979> surprises<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> things<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the surprises and a lot of things that I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.690 
the surprises and a lot of things that I
guests<00:01:10.580> were<00:01:11.750> incorrect<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.979> example<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
guests were incorrect so for example the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
guests were incorrect so for example the
first<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.119> we'll<00:01:15.270> start<00:01:15.540> off<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
first thing we'll start off with was the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.320 
first thing we'll start off with was the
fact<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.729> thought<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> twins

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
fact that I really thought the twins

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170 
fact that I really thought the twins
were<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.790> dark<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:20.970> moon

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
were going to be in dark of the moon

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.450 
were going to be in dark of the moon
because<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.900> saw<00:01:22.080> them<00:01:22.290> being<00:01:22.470> filmed<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.400> I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
because we saw them being filmed but I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
because we saw them being filmed but I
think<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.030> cut<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.390> last<00:01:24.900> minute

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
think they got cut out that last minute

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.990 
think they got cut out that last minute
because<00:01:25.320> Michael<00:01:26.040> Bay<00:01:26.130> said<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> twins

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
because Michael Bay said that the twins

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.550 
because Michael Bay said that the twins
were<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.049> point<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.530> he

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
were not in it but at that point when he

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.230 
were not in it but at that point when he
announced<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.430> still<00:01:29.939> didn't<00:01:30.210> believe

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
announced that I still didn't believe

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.690 
announced that I still didn't believe
him<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.470> later<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.770> he<00:01:31.890> said<00:01:32.130> okay<00:01:32.460> well

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
him but then later on he said okay well

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
him but then later on he said okay well
if<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.570> find<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.560> twins<00:01:34.829> performing

this isn't really a part of
misinformation<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:07.209> was<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.630> one<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.840> my

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
misinformation this was just one of my

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.490 
misinformation this was just one of my
theories<00:04:08.380> that<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.850> totally<00:04:10.329> off<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.780> i

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
theories that was totally off and i

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.530 
theories that was totally off and i
thought<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.430> Wreckers<00:04:12.850> were<00:04:13.030> actually

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
thought that the Wreckers were actually

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.630 
thought that the Wreckers were actually
a<00:04:13.750> collaboration<00:04:14.620> between<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:15.070> humans<00:04:15.549> and

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
a collaboration between the humans and

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.770 
a collaboration between the humans and
the<00:04:15.790> Autobots<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:17.140> make<00:04:18.070> something<00:04:18.600> make<00:04:19.600> like

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the Autobots to make something make like

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.390 
the Autobots to make something make like
weaponized<00:04:20.260> nascar's<00:04:20.919> that's<00:04:21.220> what<00:04:21.370> i

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
weaponized nascar's that's what i

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.700 
weaponized nascar's that's what i

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.760 
thought it was going to happen one way
but<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.900> happened<00:05:08.200> in<00:05:08.290> completely<00:05:08.650> different

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
but it happened in completely different

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.700 
but it happened in completely different
other<00:05:09.400> way<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:10.479> you<00:05:11.020> can<00:05:11.169> post<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:11.500> in<00:05:11.620> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.620 
comments section below the main thing
for<00:05:13.510> me<00:05:13.690> was<00:05:13.990> obviously<00:05:14.889> Soundwave<00:05:15.639> being<00:05:16.360> the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
for me was obviously Soundwave being the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.480 
for me was obviously Soundwave being the
mercedes-benz<00:05:17.050> sls<00:05:17.590> AMG<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:18.010> thought<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:18.400> was

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
mercedes-benz sls AMG I thought it was

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.400 
mercedes-benz sls AMG I thought it was
going<00:05:18.639> to<00:05:18.700> have<00:05:18.850> some<00:05:19.090> other<00:05:19.180> mode<00:05:19.479> like<00:05:19.690> like

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
going to have some other mode like like

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.350 
going to have some other mode like like
the<00:05:20.530> armored<00:05:20.860> truck<00:05:20.889> or<00:05:21.430> he<00:05:21.910> was<00:05:22.030> going<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.210> be

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
the armored truck or he was going to be

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.480 
the armored truck or he was going to be
like<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.930> satellite<00:05:23.410> having<00:05:23.889> his<00:05:24.010> alt<00:05:24.250> mode

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
like the satellite having his alt mode

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.010 
like the satellite having his alt mode
and<00:05:24.729> then<00:05:25.000> when<00:05:25.120> he<00:05:25.180> comes<00:05:25.360> down<00:05:25.479> he's<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.750> robot

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
and then when he comes down he's a robot

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.719 
and then when he comes down he's a robot
and<00:05:26.229> it<00:05:26.500> doesn't<00:05:26.800> have<00:05:26.919> an<00:05:27.040> earth<00:05:27.250> mode<00:05:27.550> that's

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
and it doesn't have an earth mode that's

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.850 
and it doesn't have an earth mode that's
what<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:27.970> thought<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.630> of<00:05:28.720> course<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:29.260> totally
