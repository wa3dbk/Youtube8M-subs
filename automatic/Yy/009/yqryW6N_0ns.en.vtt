00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
see dads I think people generally don't

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.859 
see dads I think people generally don't
understand<00:00:30.070> how<00:00:30.340> effective<00:00:30.850> they<00:00:31.000> are<00:00:31.030> yes

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
understand how effective they are yes

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.260 
understand how effective they are yes
that's<00:00:32.020> right<00:00:32.199> that's<00:00:32.680> right<00:00:32.739> yeah<00:00:33.370> I<00:00:33.430> got<00:00:34.180> my

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
that's right that's right yeah I got my

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.330 
that's right that's right yeah I got my
own<00:00:34.300> their<00:00:34.540> float<00:00:34.840> ledger<00:00:35.050> I'm<00:00:35.860> always<00:00:36.190> very

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
own their float ledger I'm always very

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.280 
own their float ledger I'm always very
keen<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:36.940> use<00:00:37.210> litter<00:00:37.480> floats<00:00:37.870> wherever<00:00:38.110> I<00:00:38.170> can

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
keen to use litter floats wherever I can

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.570 
keen to use litter floats wherever I can
because<00:00:38.830> it's<00:00:38.980> one<00:00:39.070> of<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.190> most<00:00:39.250> sensitive

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
because it's one of the most sensitive

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.990 
because it's one of the most sensitive
matters<00:00:40.120> for<00:00:40.360> bite<00:00:40.690> indicator<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.260> pike<00:00:41.559> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
matters for bite indicator of the pike I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.430 
matters for bite indicator of the pike I
think<00:00:43.000> it's<00:00:43.120> vitally<00:00:43.839> important

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
think it's vitally important

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.410 
think it's vitally important
particularly<00:00:45.010> when<00:00:45.250> there's<00:00:46.059> chance

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
particularly when there's chance

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.820 
particularly when there's chance
obviously<00:00:46.870> of<00:00:46.989> deep<00:00:47.140> poking<00:00:47.320> fish<00:00:47.620> if<00:00:47.739> you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
obviously of deep poking fish if you

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.469 
obviously of deep poking fish if you
don't<00:00:48.040> hit<00:00:48.370> them<00:00:48.519> quick<00:00:48.670> enough<00:00:48.909> that's<00:00:49.269> right

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
don't hit them quick enough that's right

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.140 
don't hit them quick enough that's right
indication<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.290> is<00:00:50.650> vital<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.610> really<00:00:52.000> do

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
indication is is vital you really do

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.060 
indication is is vital you really do
need<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.559> sense<00:00:53.559> what's<00:00:53.769> happening

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
need to sense what's happening

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.530 
need to sense what's happening

accordingly<00:00:55.989> that's<00:00:56.589> right<00:00:56.830> I've<00:00:57.309> got<00:00:57.519> called

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
accordingly that's right I've got called

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.579 
accordingly that's right I've got called
as<00:00:57.940> i<00:00:58.089> said<00:00:58.269> on<00:00:58.299> a<00:00:58.449> float<00:00:58.629> measured<00:00:59.019> riga<00:00:59.320> i

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
as i said on a float measured riga i

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.619 
as i said on a float measured riga i
tend<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.010> use<00:01:00.100> very<00:01:00.430> few<00:01:00.699> rigs<00:01:01.059> I<00:01:01.299> think<00:01:01.479> Riggs

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
tend to use very few rigs I think Riggs

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.479 
tend to use very few rigs I think Riggs
must<00:01:01.809> be<00:01:01.900> as<00:01:01.989> simple<00:01:02.199> as<00:01:02.379> possible<00:01:02.589> I<00:01:02.979> quite

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
must be as simple as possible I quite

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.760 
must be as simple as possible I quite
agree<00:01:03.610> i<00:01:03.790> think<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:04.030> lot<00:01:04.120> of<00:01:04.150> anglers

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
agree i think a lot of anglers

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.480 
agree i think a lot of anglers
particularly<00:01:05.770> with<00:01:05.860> regard<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.100> pike<00:01:06.310> fishing

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
particularly with regard to pike fishing

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.910 
particularly with regard to pike fishing
tend<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.030> overcomplicate<00:01:07.600> rigs<00:01:07.990> yeah<00:01:08.650> that's

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
tend to overcomplicate rigs yeah that's

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.710 
tend to overcomplicate rigs yeah that's
right<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.400> basic<00:01:09.729> rigs<00:01:09.909> are<00:01:10.299> still<00:01:10.570> very

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
right the basic rigs are still very

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.290 
right the basic rigs are still very
effective<00:01:11.549> perhaps<00:01:12.549> we<00:01:12.670> should<00:01:12.700> go<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.210> have

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
effective perhaps we should go and have

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.790 
effective perhaps we should go and have

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
nine inches with a poly ball at the top

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.660 
nine inches with a poly ball at the top
of<00:03:42.650> their<00:03:43.239> sliding<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:45.140> then<00:03:45.379> you<00:03:46.010> have<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.220> 10

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
of their sliding and then you have a 10

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.890 
of their sliding and then you have a 10
to<00:03:46.819> 12<00:03:47.060> inch<00:03:47.239> length<00:03:47.659> of<00:03:48.140> much<00:03:48.470> stiffer<00:03:49.000> lying

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
to 12 inch length of much stiffer lying

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.710 
to 12 inch length of much stiffer lying
this<00:03:51.590> tends<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.099> act<00:03:52.370> in<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.909> manner<00:03:53.239> of<00:03:53.420> rig

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
this tends to act in the manner of rig

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.360 
this tends to act in the manner of rig
too<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:54.230> without<00:03:54.470> having<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:54.890> complicate

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
too but without having to complicate

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.000 
too but without having to complicate
things<00:03:55.579> by<00:03:55.730> lots<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.090> reaching<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:57.049> he<00:03:57.230> never

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
things by lots of reaching and he never
