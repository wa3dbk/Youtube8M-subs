00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.884
 Latest at Dark Armada: 

00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:07.040
 Alexander, what happened there? 

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:10.122
 We were on a diplomatic mission to Y'Nok 

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:15.497
 I want to talk about Y'Nok. 

00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:18.344
 Yes, I remember that. 

00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:22.679
 According to the scans it is ... 

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:25.379
 ... very harmful to residents. 

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:27.296
 Focus everything on the front shuttle ... 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.703
 ... and destroy it completely. 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.610
 A shuttle is attacking us, sir. 

00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:45.811
 Have we caused much damage? 

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:46.955
 Not much... 

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:49.161
 I want to send a shuttle to offer help. 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.154
 It's going according to plan. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.967
 We come to offer help. 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.780
 Can you confirm me to your shuttle? 

00:00:56.028 --> 00:00:58.972
 And now the sequel: 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.080
 Captain's log, Stardate 66112.5. It was a long day. 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.200
 Ensign Belissa and Ensign Roberts are on their way to the settlers in need. 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.140
 And the repairs to the warp drive are almost complete. Let's... 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.140
 Talek for Richardson. 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.230
 What is it, Captain? 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.090
 I have an officer on board who asks for a transfer to Batavia. 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.140
 Who wants to leave you this time? 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.080
 Yuri Vasiliev, Lieutenant 3rd class. He is a member of my technical staff. 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.230
 Very well. 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.130
 I send his personal information to your screen. 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.040
 Thanks. 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.160
 Come on in. 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.130
 Yuri Vasiliev, 3rd class lieutenant, reports for duty, sir. 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.120
 Welcome to the Batavia, Mr. Vasiliev. 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.130
 Thank you, sir. 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.140
 I keep it short because we are busy right now. 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.190
 I'm sending you to Lieutenant T'Mock's Warp Boosting Project. 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.070
 Sounds cool ... interesting, I mean, sir. 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.090
 It certainly is. 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.060
 I will try not to disappoint you. 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.070
 To attempt? 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.020
 I will not disappoint you, sir. 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.030
 Good. Register with T'Mock in the engine room. 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.070
 Yes, sir. 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.100
 You can go. 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.000
 Thank you, sir. 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.630
 Okay then ... Thank you, old man. 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.760
 His warp core is overheating. 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.520
 I operate the transporter. 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.020
 Get out of here now. 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.180
 I'm glad we made it. 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.760
 Cheer not too early. 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.110
 Welcome to the team, Mr. Vasiliev. 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.060
 Thank you, Chief. 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.100
 As you can see, you are just in time. We have just finished repairing the warp core. 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.140
 That went quickly. I heard there was an attack just now. 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.130
 That's right, but this ship can handle a lot. However, it is now getting too late. 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.080
 Register with me at 06:00. 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.170
 Yes, sir. 6 a.m. 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.040
 T'Mock for Richardson. 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.050
 What is it, Chief? 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.070
 The warp drive is working again, sir. 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.220
 Very beautiful, fast as always. 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.020
 Captain, we're getting a message from the Sardam. 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.100
 On screen. 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.130
 What does this mean? 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.190
 What do you think yourself, Captain 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.180
 Release my officers. 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.180
 First, let's talk about what I want. 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.130
 What do you want? 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.190
 Planet Y'Nok, all the way. 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.240
 You know I can't just give that to you. 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.120
 Then say goodbye to your officers. 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.100
 No wait, maybe I have something for you But I have to talk to Belissa first. 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.010
 Soon then. 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.110
 Belissa, I'm sorry you're in this situation. But Celissia was right. 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.020
 No! 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.000
 They are back, sir. 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.050
 Captain, do I have to fire? 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.090
 "You always have a choice." 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.050
 Captain? 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.050
 No, don't, use a draw beam. 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.040
 What did that mean? 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.010
 Oh well, could be better. 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.180
 Stick to your plan, comrade. 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.080
 When are you ready? Yuri? 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.140
 The promotion starts at exactly 7 a.m. 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.030
 Magnificent. 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.020
 Come on in. 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.030
 Hi, Alex. 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.100
 Celissia, how are you? 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.160
 I'm a little tired and feel a little weird. Far too much action for a day. 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.190
 You're right. Sit down. 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.790
 I've been thinking. 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.010
 Really? 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.140
 Yes, I do that sometimes. 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:05.500
 I think the telepathic connection we had in the shuttle left something telepathic. 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.130
 How do you mean? 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.170
 Sometimes I can feel what you feel. 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.000
 Oh. now I understand. 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.100
 Strange huh? 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.010
 Hold my hands, Alex. 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.940
 Wow! What do I feel? 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.020
 I think you now feel everything I feel. 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.130
 It is so much. I think that I... 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.140
 That's how your ship feels, Alex. This is all life aboard this ship. 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:42.060
 So many emotions. Hope, fear, compassion, love. 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.230
 Good morning, Captain. 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.050
 'tomorrow. 

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.820
 Computer, light. 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.720
 Coffee, extra sugar. 

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.810
 Okay... 

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.060
 Captain, you probably don't like this. 

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.060
 The plasma tubes are inflated. The main energy has failed.
