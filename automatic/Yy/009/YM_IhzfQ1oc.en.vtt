 already signed up for sisu this year 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.690

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.099
 select students for universities 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.610

 try to enter a federal college of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.410
 her saga and thousands of her 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.380
 started as a result of the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.740
 which it took to leave on the 14th of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.740
 January after the clear wait celebrated 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.180
 improved significantly compared to the year 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 past in being in that year of study 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.620
 I hope I can get in to have 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.260
 sure of that came the next stage 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.910
 five days later with the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.210
 sisu review lets you choose 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.899
 two colleges as an option but does not have 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 a very clear goal that the IMF and the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.289
 of cutting that goes much of its power 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.359
 fulfill this dream or not 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.299
 after registration in sisu begins to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.430
 monitoring season the candidate 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.310
 can change colleges and courses 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.549
 chosen as many times as you want 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.420
 the four days of registration with 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.970
 cut notes are changing daily and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.250
 depending on the university's criteria 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.770
 increase the chances of guaranteeing 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.860
 a place, for example if a student has 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.590
 a very good average but he took a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.200
 very high above the average writing is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.810
 better for him to choose an institution 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.540
 which gives the editors a greater weight 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.040
 will maximize the chance of this student to be 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 approved and conquer the vacancy 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.640
 but for now anxiety anxiety and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.070
 nervousness are still the main 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 company declares sisu result only 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.590
 January 26th type the bag of 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.100
 values of the vestibular every day changes 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.200
 and it may be that in the end 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.890
 has a very significant difference 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.280
 Also respect trade show.
