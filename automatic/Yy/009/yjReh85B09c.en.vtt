Avengers<00:03:58.670> huh<00:03:59.680> but<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:00.709> thought<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.160> was<00:04:01.220> not

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430

Avengers huh but I thought it was not
going<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.610> be<00:04:01.730> connected<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.360> thought<00:04:02.629> that

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
going to be connected I thought that

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.420 
going to be connected I thought that
what<00:04:03.410> they<00:04:03.590> didn't<00:04:03.830> say<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.220> connected<00:04:04.489> uh

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
what they didn't say it is connected uh

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.009 
what they didn't say it is connected uh
so<00:04:07.430> something<00:04:08.000> more<00:04:08.150> interesting<00:04:08.450> came<00:04:08.840> out
