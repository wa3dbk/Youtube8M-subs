00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.360
 mottaki at antec iv is now in the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.880
 1.7 point 10 appeared exactly on 18 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.770
 january 2015 here on the canal and in 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 technology launcher yes and I have it myself 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.619
 directly download it to me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.050
 how is that still going on? 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.609
 when new technology motto pack appears 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.289
 I would like to briefly for it again 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.580
 excuse me if my wellensiek im 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.250
 background hears unfortunately are always 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.790
 quite loud and yes the gymnasts and how 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.920
 always around 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.600
 Well, let's take a look at the world today 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 to have already generated and to 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.090
 I would like to say that now 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.860
 no official let's play here yet 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.390
 The result is but first time in succession 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 quietly a little something will look 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.170
 I'll go to it all day today 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.520
 bit livestream also whether square is 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.050
 me the moped today as long as I 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.969
 Lust have a look in the live stream 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.469
 you are welcome to watch if you want 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.969
 Link to this can be found below in the video 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.579
 description if the video already something 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.039
 is older and he says okay I have 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 this mopac just found new 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.739
 This video is older 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.090
 then the live stream is likely 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.489
 not online anymore 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.799
 Well let's have a look at what it is here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 So everything gives the world a start 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.549
 normal with very many 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.200
 different mods and we have under 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.900
 Of course again open blogs 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.549
 which enables the car and the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.470
 auto enchantment table I know that too 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.570
 both things of open blogs are straight 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.520
 but there are definitely here we 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.840
 have the 70 pages in the state book what 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.700
 I 'll be a little closer 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.159
 we would like to have a look 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 bear trap a big button the man 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.000
 can use a blog placer and one 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.790
 block breaker that we already know 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 even a drawing for the building guide 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.759
 table and a lift blogs tilted 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.640
 Fans a dropper way 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.360
 stone for decoration there is nothing to change 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.399
 as we know the sky blocks 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.290
 sprinkler vacuum stool 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.329
 Oops, you can farm xps inside and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.130
 so on and so on there is great 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.570
 cool new things like a dealer there 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.399
 a running box we already out 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.829
 to get to know the tech 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.049
 there are brushes there is a sleeping bag 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.060
 There are so many cool things here 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.550
 even gives a windshield wiper 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.860
 I think that's cool, we will definitely 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.239
 If you are here, this moped is something for me 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.470
 quite interesting in the object of this 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.060
 In fact, that's it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.040
 really not on an old version 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.640
 but actually runs in the 1.7 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.080
 point 10 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.430
 that means I will look that me 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.380
 installed via the shader motto 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 get me and so together you 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.880
 Here's a nice let's play we do 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.000
 will actually play in this match 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.200
 do not go to magic 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.459
 Of course you can do magic too 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.260
 I'll just magic a bit behind 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.030
 I bet he's farming 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.220
 operate and I will rather technology 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.819
 do things because in the old network 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:49.500
 place I have always shown how to use 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:53.190
 magic things to deal with how is yes 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.599
 magic plays how to play the ribery 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 Everything was so magee clothes I have 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.700
 I never really caring for technology 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.239
 also interested and loyal 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.069
 said the big enough in terms of technology 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.110
 so just look at us in the opec 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.480
 a little bit more the technology pages 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.810
 yes and I would say now I start 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.330
 again shortly before the game mode 1 before 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.200
 this video ends then i fly myself 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.459
 a little bit around and see me 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.230
 here again the world a little bit 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.420
 and of course I look at it completely 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.280
 in short, the inventory of what we have everything 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.510
 So we have many different ones here 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.260
 things again we have terminal 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.769
 expansion 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.120
 we have terminal foundation where i am 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.540
 honestly do not know me anymore 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.190
 but then changed 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.799
 again we have deaf power as magic 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.299
 mods then I have it myself 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.970
 perhaps knows yes or 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.010
 Other mister crayfish's decoration 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.750
 smart the super cool is redstone 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.670
 arsenal maybe there is also 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.920
 weapons and things sounds great 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.959
 exciting 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.109
 avis power because you can join even 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.590
 in calamari form and so on and so on 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.900
 on 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.450
 then I'm back in kind 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.920
 nature protection natura never say never and 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.970
 Everything else here is likely 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.480
 no longer look like it always does 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.769
 looks 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.560
 There is even a laptop per 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.989
 trilogy offered with butterflies or 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.130
 super cool to because you can 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.150
 probably also catch and 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.570
 investigate 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.040
 There is again the bee mod 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.210
 forestry of minecraft is the end 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.100
 which I will also look at 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.640
 I can say exactly , unfortunately 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.960
 not yet what it is really because 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.610
 I do not really know at the moment 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.980
 Well , there are many different ones 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.350
 mods maybe knows that there are yes 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.510
 Also play the cool old again 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.800
 is that because you just give it 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.660
 toys play things mod the mappack 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.860
 will definitely super super cool me 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.990
 I'll try the whole match really 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.490
 to play like we have never 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.050
 have seen on a channel so 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.310
 really the mods we do not even have 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.410
 I'll imagine so 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.180
 far as I know if you were bocked 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.530
 on this mopac then switch 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.810
 Just now if you like that 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.890
 has seen on the same day again a 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.720
 livestream it probably will 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.410
 the only day I will be live 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.640
 stream 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.110
 You should decide that I have 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.360
 mappack would rather live stream 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.250
 Unbelievable the moped rather than 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.420
 video format on a channel 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.340
 I wanted the video simply make time 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.410
 yes, a little bit 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.690
 to introduce because it also just 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.400
 has come out today so much I can 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.410
 as I said not to say except 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.910
 that here you are pretty much like her 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.160
 pretty many cool different things 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.960
 Like this our little village wants what 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.330
 Nothing much to demand from there is also 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.890
 again, among other things, a majors now 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.270
 I'm just watching the recording 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.590
 I was super short stuck 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.670
 Here's a little bit I do not know 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.870
 why it is maybe my 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.800
 hard disk just full maybe 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.230
 I in the background some other 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.000
 but watch it I do it 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.650
 simply mega also fits here built 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.680
 I do not know what that is for free 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.770
 greatly of a mod of groth 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.860
 there are still names on it 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.560
 from grudging ops so that's loud 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.900
 create ops from the motto bread Kraft ja 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.090
 thank you so much for watching this 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.230
 small videos you will find more of them 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.110
 then probably on a canal 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.820
 What this is about and then I would 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.860
 say banal tunes in 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.660
 future when the mappack is online 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.490
 see her or others, whether ex manager 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.500
 Otherwise, many thanks for 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.790
 love watching people until then and has 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.790
 Of course, have a nice day
