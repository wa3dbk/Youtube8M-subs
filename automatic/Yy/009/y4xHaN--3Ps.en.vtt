try this trick that's that's their

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.740 
try this trick that's that's their
biggest<00:02:46.820> drawback<00:02:47.820> when<00:02:48.030> trying<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.390> learn<00:02:48.540> it

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
biggest drawback when trying to learn it

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.570 
biggest drawback when trying to learn it
is<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:49.320> not<00:02:49.470> being<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:49.920> top<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.370> bar

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
is just not being on top of the bar

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.150 
is just not being on top of the bar
because<00:02:51.060> yes<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:51.900> in<00:02:52.110> into<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.530> over
