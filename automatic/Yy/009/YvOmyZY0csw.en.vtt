00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.170

 There were people and lovers who never met 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:13.000
 But though I met in the section without quality 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 I would like to say that my boyfriend is present when girls talk with friends in the school department 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.780
 But I do not know how to explain how I met 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.900
 I've been polishing myself since about 16 but I can't even look back at university seniors 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.530
 was 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 Even if you can make a boyfriend online, you can not introduce it to your house 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.370
 Other Ed is my stick 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.820
 that 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:03.880
 As you really write yourself to be aware of yourself 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:10.210
 It is a net addiction, and how to take communication on the net with a net addiction 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.340
 Interact with the conversation in that Down Syndrome I still people and the people are the Kedomo I think you know 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.360
 It is totally different according to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.870
 It's different sensuously 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.670
 And of course 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:28.090
 Immediately Well hey also thought coming message I net 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.670
 I can return even with revisions, but now I have to release this store too much 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.890
 Men also It will be quite deep 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:41.520
 I myself of contents is I'm conversation to speak if there is exiting this for that was said 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:47.830
 Of course you can see the expression and you can hear the tone of your voice 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:52.570
 You can see the Toka movement after day to that in the first place net, etc. 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.400
 Please think once as a completely different real 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.459
 So 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 Those who got to know at a net love site 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.300
 With people who have never been 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.300
 that 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.540
 Kedomo that was not even human and dating that there was a dating thing I have written Oh Rutte 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:23.780
 You will be attracted to a person who has never been there with just one sentence n 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:27.730
 I think that there is a weak conscious perhaps of the consciousness, so for those who are met with real 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.580
 I have avoided this until now 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.940
 Because I think the place 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.710
 I thought that I might have a slight sense of weakness 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.860
 Such the in the not match that feel 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.060
 When I become stressed 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.060
 Even if you get to know in real 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:56.370
 So the timing you think you do n't feel may be a little earlier 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:04:01.160
 Berth tab its ordinary and Netsuto so much I timing that I think I have a minute care does not fit 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:05.020
 Not from people who are going to be real in the real world 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:09.910
 A little more than people who are doing 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:11.010
 I think that the timing of thinking that I can not do it is early in that case 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.190
 Because 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.320
 Masu I feel I think do not fit not not you think to say it is foam does not meet even 23 months color 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.820
 About 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:29.090
 Well talk variously and talk freely 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:34.070
 Girls talk to is anything good Toka story of the story Toka Beauty after favorite story Cosmetics Toka or 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:38.310
 Let's talk about such things and deepen the relationship gradually 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.830
 It is said that the text of the other person's feelings can be transmitted directly as much as the sentences 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.240
 But 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:49.280
 It is turbid only from the two plans 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:55.139
 I think that full Is there that I think I Yaro'm thinking Fu What there be after 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:05:02.289
 So I think that I do not know the person unless I talk a lot 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:05.750
 So I'd also seen weak conscious of that weak formula once and throw it away 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.980
 Please try to have a real relationship with people 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.310
 I'm just fine with people who have never been fine 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:19.150
 More of those who have been there 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:25.640
 Is this person like the expression of this person or the voice of this child skates like this person's gesture? 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.770
 I think that there are various points of light , so I'm going to go outside that one 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.800
 Out 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:34.139
 Please try to interact with various people 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:39.240
 I think the world will expand more and more Please do your best 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:44.610
 Kojima: It feels like it 's like I 'm having trouble consulting with a seemingly online romance
