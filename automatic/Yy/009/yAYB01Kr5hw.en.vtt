morning approaching the wind loaded

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.430 
morning approaching the wind loaded
slope<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.940> wind<00:00:40.210> is<00:00:40.360> blowing<00:00:40.390> from<00:00:40.900> left<00:00:41.230> to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.860 
slope the wind is blowing from left to
right<00:00:41.620> so<00:00:42.250> that's<00:00:42.430> why<00:00:42.610> wendy<00:00:43.060> is<00:00:43.090> choosing

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
right so that's why wendy is choosing

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.470 
right so that's why wendy is choosing
the<00:00:44.020> route<00:00:44.200> on<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.500> left<00:00:45.280> side<00:00:45.520> of<00:00:45.910> that

the route on the left side of that
obstacle<00:00:47.260> Here<00:00:48.100> I<00:00:48.160> am<00:00:48.250> jumping<00:00:48.579> a<00:00:48.820> small

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
obstacle Here I am jumping a small

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.970 
obstacle Here I am jumping a small
little<00:00:49.329> test<00:00:49.750> slope<00:00:50.020> this<00:00:50.230> a<00:00:50.290> safe<00:00:50.649> little

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
little test slope this a safe little

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.520 
little test slope this a safe little
spot<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.610> just<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.690> see<00:00:53.260> what<00:00:53.410> the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
spot and just to see what the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.229 
spot and just to see what the
north-facing<00:00:53.800> slopes<00:00:54.399> are<00:00:54.550> like<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.969> see<00:00:55.149> if

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
north-facing slopes are like to see if

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.569 
north-facing slopes are like to see if
they<00:00:55.390> react<00:00:55.780> see<00:00:56.620> if<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.920> wind<00:00:57.130> loading<00:00:57.340> is

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
they react see if the wind loading is

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.280 
they react see if the wind loading is
affecting<00:00:58.030> them<00:00:58.210> poke<00:00:58.630> around<00:00:58.809> a<00:00:59.020> little<00:00:59.050> bit

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
affecting them poke around a little bit

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.650 
affecting them poke around a little bit
i<00:00:59.469> sell<00:01:00.040> them<00:01:00.160> pass<00:01:00.399> up<00:01:00.700> a<00:01:00.880> little<00:01:01.090> test<00:01:01.390> slopes

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
i sell them pass up a little test slopes

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.970 
i sell them pass up a little test slopes
like<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.170> think<00:01:02.410> they're<00:01:02.559> very<00:01:02.590> very

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
like that I think they're very very

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.380 
like that I think they're very very
valuable<00:01:04.829> up<00:01:05.829> along<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.250> ridges<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.909> wind<00:01:07.210> of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
valuable up along the ridges the wind of

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.840 
valuable up along the ridges the wind of
course<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.869> howling<00:01:08.590> along<00:01:08.979> that's<00:01:09.429> the<00:01:09.609> main

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
course is howling along that's the main

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.020 
course is howling along that's the main
hazard<00:01:10.479> for<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:11.020> day<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:12.009> wind<00:01:12.249> wind<00:01:12.880> is

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
hazard for the day the wind wind is

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.359 
hazard for the day the wind wind is
eroding<00:01:13.659> from<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.929> upwind<00:01:14.200> signs<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.920> ridges

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
eroding from the upwind signs of ridges

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.739 
eroding from the upwind signs of ridges
and<00:01:15.399> depositing<00:01:16.299> on<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.810> downwind<00:01:17.259> sides<00:01:17.590> and

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:18.749 
and depositing on the downwind sides and

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:21.779 
and depositing on the downwind sides and
so<00:01:19.749> we<00:01:19.869> wanted<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.259> test<00:01:20.560> some<00:01:20.859> of<00:01:20.979> that<00:01:21.100> we

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
so we wanted to test some of that we

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.639 
so we wanted to test some of that we
worked<00:01:22.029> our<00:01:22.179> way<00:01:22.209> down<00:01:22.689> a<00:01:22.719> very<00:01:23.350> shallow

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
worked our way down a very shallow

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.789 
worked our way down a very shallow
angled<00:01:24.490> slope<00:01:25.149> into<00:01:25.749> the<00:01:25.869> monitor<00:01:26.079> bowls<00:01:26.499> and

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
angled slope into the monitor bowls and

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.529 
angled slope into the monitor bowls and
could<00:01:26.920> look<00:01:27.130> back<00:01:27.369> at<00:01:27.579> some<00:01:27.609> of<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:27.969> recent

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
could look back at some of the recent

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.749 
could look back at some of the recent
cornice<00:01:29.079> falls<00:01:29.319> coming<00:01:29.799> up<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.100> some<00:01:30.340> skiers

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
cornice falls coming up and some skiers

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.109 
cornice falls coming up and some skiers
had<00:01:31.259> skied<00:01:32.259> the<00:01:32.289> slope<00:01:32.649> probably<00:01:33.219> earlier<00:01:33.819> in

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
had skied the slope probably earlier in

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.319 
had skied the slope probably earlier in
the<00:01:34.270> morning<00:01:34.479> I<00:01:34.869> would<00:01:35.380> guess<00:01:35.999> Wendy<00:01:36.999> coming

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
the morning I would guess Wendy coming

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.709 
the morning I would guess Wendy coming
on<00:01:37.509> down<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.319> was<00:01:38.740> quite<00:01:39.459> good<00:01:39.490> but<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.689> course

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
on down it was quite good but of course

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.059 
on down it was quite good but of course

we<00:03:59.359> wanted<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.690> stomp<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.139> some<00:04:00.379> cornices<00:04:00.889> to

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
we wanted to stomp on some cornices to

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.110 
we wanted to stomp on some cornices to
test<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.780> wind<00:04:02.780> loading<00:04:02.989> Here<00:04:03.349> I<00:04:03.379> am<00:04:04.120> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
test the wind loading Here I am the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.319 
test the wind loading Here I am the
first<00:04:05.900> rule<00:04:06.139> of<00:04:06.169> jumping<00:04:07.010> on<00:04:07.280> cornices<00:04:07.819> uses<00:04:08.209> a

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
first rule of jumping on cornices uses a

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.629 
first rule of jumping on cornices uses a
belay<00:04:08.599> rope<00:04:08.629> also<00:04:09.620> make<00:04:09.799> sure<00:04:09.829> nobody's<00:04:10.340> below

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
belay rope also make sure nobody's below

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.180 
belay rope also make sure nobody's below
you<00:04:10.699> third<00:04:11.569> is<00:04:11.840> start<00:04:12.139> farther<00:04:12.560> back<00:04:12.799> than<00:04:12.859> you

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
you third is start farther back than you

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.400 
you third is start farther back than you
think<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.639> need<00:04:13.910> to<00:04:13.940> just<00:04:14.389> in<00:04:14.959> case<00:04:15.169> you've

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
think you need to just in case you've

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.650 
think you need to just in case you've
misjudged<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:16.190> cornice<00:04:16.579> look<00:04:17.180> from<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.479> side

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
misjudged the cornice look from the side

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.210 
misjudged the cornice look from the side
have<00:04:17.959> somebody<00:04:18.320> spot<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.459> from<00:04:19.609> the<00:04:19.789> side

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
have somebody spot you from the side

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.700 
have somebody spot you from the side
so<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:21.120> can<00:04:21.420> know<00:04:21.630> how<00:04:21.870> far<00:04:22.170> you<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.440> go<00:04:22.590> out

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
so you can know how far you can go out

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.050 
so you can know how far you can go out
on<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:22.980> cornice<00:04:23.310> this<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.670> fairly<00:04:23.910> small

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
on the cornice this is a fairly small

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.440 
on the cornice this is a fairly small
cornice<00:04:24.810> but<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:25.680> all<00:04:25.860> we<00:04:26.010> had<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.150> case

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
cornice but it's all we had in this case

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.480 
cornice but it's all we had in this case
and<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:28.080> wasn't<00:04:28.320> really<00:04:28.440> triggering<00:04:28.860> much<00:04:29.100> a

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
and it wasn't really triggering much a

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.450 
and it wasn't really triggering much a
blank<00:04:29.940> hardly<00:04:30.870> anything<00:04:31.050> as<00:04:31.860> far<00:04:32.070> as<00:04:32.190> slabs

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
blank hardly anything as far as slabs

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.960 
blank hardly anything as far as slabs
underneath<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.870> we<00:04:37.050> headed<00:04:37.290> on<00:04:37.470> back<00:04:37.680> home

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
underneath so and we headed on back home

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.970 
underneath so and we headed on back home
wind<00:04:38.970> loading<00:04:39.210> still<00:04:39.720> continuing<00:04:40.380> with

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
wind loading still continuing with

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.880 
wind loading still continuing with
blowing<00:04:41.250> snow<00:04:41.610> on<00:04:42.390> downwind<00:04:43.050> terrain<00:04:43.680> so

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
blowing snow on downwind terrain so

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.800 
blowing snow on downwind terrain so
that's<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.190> main<00:04:44.400> hazard<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.330> we'll<00:04:45.690> have

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
that's the main hazard that we'll have

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.020 
that's the main hazard that we'll have
to<00:04:45.960> worry<00:04:46.140> about<00:04:46.290> tomorrow<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.490> of<00:04:47.790> course

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
to worry about tomorrow and of course

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.570 
to worry about tomorrow and of course
today<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:50.130> great<00:04:50.610> day<00:04:50.850> for<00:04:51.090> snow<00:04:51.270> geeks
