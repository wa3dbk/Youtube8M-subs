hi this is John Galvez with Marquand

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.019 
hi this is John Galvez with Marquand
here<00:00:04.020> with<00:00:04.170> another<00:00:04.350> update<00:00:04.589> in<00:00:04.859> Yuma<00:00:05.850> Arizona

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
here with another update in Yuma Arizona

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.000 
here with another update in Yuma Arizona
we're<00:00:06.960> in<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.109> field<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.410> romaine<00:00:07.649> right<00:00:07.859> now

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
we're in a field of romaine right now

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.709 
we're in a field of romaine right now
and<00:00:08.340> it's<00:00:08.970> actually<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.269> really<00:00:09.420> good<00:00:09.599> example

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
and it's actually a really good example

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.530 
and it's actually a really good example
of<00:00:10.139> why<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:11.070> walk<00:00:11.280> fields<00:00:11.790> completely<00:00:11.969> from

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
of why we walk fields completely from

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.450 
of why we walk fields completely from
one<00:00:12.719> side<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.139> other<00:00:13.280> especially<00:00:14.280> right

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
one side to the other especially right

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
one side to the other especially right
now<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.150> time<00:00:15.179> where<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.320> freezing

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
now in a time where the freezing

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.900 
now in a time where the freezing
temperatures<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.160> we've<00:00:17.310> been<00:00:17.430> reporting

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
temperatures that we've been reporting

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.970 
temperatures that we've been reporting
on<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.420> affected<00:00:18.869> crops<00:00:19.109> everywhere

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
on have affected crops everywhere

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.400 
on have affected crops everywhere
we<00:00:20.369> know<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.850> strong<00:00:21.300> quality<00:00:21.840> lettuce

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
we know that the strong quality lettuce

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.599 
we know that the strong quality lettuce
is<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.010> hard<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.279> come<00:00:23.400> by<00:00:23.550> these

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
is going to be hard to come by these

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.460 
is going to be hard to come by these
days<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.480> real<00:00:24.689> important<00:00:25.050> for<00:00:25.080> us<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
days so it's real important for us to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.650 
days so it's real important for us to
really<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.550> thorough<00:00:26.760> when<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.240> our<00:00:27.269> field

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
really be thorough when we do our field

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
really be thorough when we do our field
inspections<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.560> work<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.130> our<00:00:29.160> suppliers

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
inspections and work with our suppliers

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.269

parts of their fields that they have
available<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.380> field<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:35.070> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
available in this field here this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.020 
available in this field here this
variety<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.450> romaine<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.110> more<00:00:37.590> open<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.250> it's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
variety of romaine is more open and it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.729 
variety of romaine is more open and it's
showing<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.510> more<00:00:39.540> frost<00:00:40.050> damage<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
showing a lot more frost damage on the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
showing a lot more frost damage on the
leaves<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> good<00:00:41.940> example<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
leaves you can see a good example of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
leaves you can see a good example of
that<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.960> leaf<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.460> back

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that on this leaf here and as we back

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.959 
that on this leaf here and as we back
out<00:00:45.350> throughout<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> field<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.520> has<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.730> lot

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
out throughout the field it has a lot

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.340 
out throughout the field it has a lot
more<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.329> frost<00:00:48.629> damage<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> crews

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
more of this frost damage that the crews

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
more of this frost damage that the crews
will<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> avoid<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.730> aside<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.180> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
will have to avoid but aside from that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.080 
will have to avoid but aside from that
because<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:52.980> open<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.940> also<00:00:55.850> was<00:00:56.850> more

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
because it is more open it also was more

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
because it is more open it also was more
exposed<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> freezing<00:00:58.050> temperatures<00:00:58.649> on

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
exposed to the freezing temperatures on

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.189 
exposed to the freezing temperatures on
the<00:00:59.129> inside<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> outside<00:01:00.149> portions<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the inside and outside portions of the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.880 
the inside and outside portions of the
leaves<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.049> open<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.320> head<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
leaves so as I open up this head and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.520 
leaves so as I open up this head and
start<00:01:05.400> peeling<00:01:05.549> these<00:01:05.850> leaves<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.350> can

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
start peeling these leaves down you can

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
start peeling these leaves down you can
see<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.189> blister<00:01:08.760> that's<00:01:09.720> already

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
see that there's blister that's already

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.890 
see that there's blister that's already
started<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> open<00:01:10.939> on<00:01:11.939> its<00:01:12.240> own<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.600> been<00:01:12.750> 2

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
started to open on its own it's been 2

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
started to open on its own it's been 2
weeks<00:01:12.930> since<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.530> first<00:01:13.770> freeze<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.640> had

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
weeks since the first freeze that we had

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 
weeks since the first freeze that we had
and<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> result<00:01:16.650> after<00:01:16.770> growing

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and so this is the result after growing

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010 
and so this is the result after growing
for<00:01:17.490> two<00:01:17.640> weeks<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.119> blitzer<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.630> formed

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
for two weeks that blitzer that formed

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.440 
for two weeks that blitzer that formed
has<00:01:19.380> popped<00:01:19.770> open<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.549> both<00:01:20.820> sides<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
has popped open on both sides of the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649 
has popped open on both sides of the
leaf<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:22.549> but<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.759> said<00:01:23.820> we're<00:01:24.360> walking

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
leaf here but as I said we're walking

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.780 
leaf here but as I said we're walking
these<00:01:24.810> fields<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.229> thoroughly<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
these fields as thoroughly as we can and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.469 
these fields as thoroughly as we can and
fortunately<00:01:27.750> for<00:01:27.810> us<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.920> field<00:01:29.479> has

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
fortunately for us this field has

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
fortunately for us this field has
another<00:01:30.810> variety<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.860> we're<00:01:32.040> packing<00:01:32.400> our

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
another variety that we're packing our

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
another variety that we're packing our
orders<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.680> walked<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> side<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
orders in because we walked that side of

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.319 
orders in because we walked that side of
the<00:01:35.340> field<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.729> felt<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the field and felt that it was a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.649 
the field and felt that it was a
stronger<00:01:36.900> quality<00:01:37.380> romaine<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.700> we'll<00:01:39.509> about

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
stronger quality romaine and we'll about

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
stronger quality romaine and we'll about
to<00:01:39.869> show<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.079> why<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.979> variety<00:01:41.579> grows

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
to show you why this this variety grows

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810 
to show you why this this variety grows
more<00:01:42.119> Cup<00:01:42.470> it's<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.680> closed<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.610> those

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
more Cup it's more closed and so those

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.330 
more Cup it's more closed and so those
inner<00:01:45.090> leaves<00:01:45.270> were<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.140> protected<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.979> did

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
inner leaves were more protected and did
