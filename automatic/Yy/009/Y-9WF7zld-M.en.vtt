00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.380
 although of course such factors as 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.270
 detergents it applies to washing 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.040
 powders and a cut for washing dishes and many 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 other chemicals that 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.350
 often contains its composition 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.119
 highly aggressive components which 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.039
 affect skin and abrasive 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.160
 contours giving high concentration of acids 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.189
 for example peel the skin and 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.289
 for this reason they dry it 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.929
 there is also an important factor severity 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.800
 There is certainly something that a person has 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.800
 big load and this load 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 enough 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 intensely 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.960
 affects the cape but at the same time static 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.720
 mode because all the time the same type 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.760
 movements that is sting 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.820
 this may hinder 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.920
 normal blood flow thermometer 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.480
 here is absolutely not 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.350
 in vain 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.430
 because we know that the lessons are on par with 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.660
 face exposed 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.880
 environment more degree and on 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.910
 the street is cold but until then 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.160
 frost snow pushed minus 15 but this pair 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.290
 many go without gloves without you 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.810
 live and naturally that skin 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.260
 undergoing such an extreme 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.910
 cooling she too is aging faster 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.370
 talk to our experts 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.370
 in our studio Andrei Nikolaevich 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.110
 in government 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.560
 taxes for the country Nikolai Azarov 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.530
 this 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.980
 on our program 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.690
 by the way, again, let's talk floor 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.000
 guard 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.010
 in ways and reduce aggressively 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.399
 effects on the skin of the hands 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.039
 which well every man in 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.529
 can actually process about 

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:43.750
 this will take care 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.800
 First of all, what we started is rubber 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.930
 gloves are totally trite but the thing is 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:49.710
 what 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.119
 any detergent contains superficially 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.650
 active substances that dissolve 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.080
 then a protective shell 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.050
 Tsoi water and fat called hard 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.940
 lipid mantica then place all skin 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.660
 car and especially hands of course weighty 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.470
 therefore, to the effects of such decided by 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.850
 essentially not representing 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.450
 aggressive but precisely leads to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.790
 lipid flushing loss of whoever it is 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.980
 skin is very high that dries up yes 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.390
 surely this is one of the important factors 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.710
 leading rap process aging 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.759
 launch a sphere with a sphere 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.019
 what temperature does the water go in too 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.409
 important factor what temperature 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.709
 water should be 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.780
 but when the percentage of washing dishes when just 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.340
 my work is in the end 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.810
 extreme temperatures of course 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.609
 it is also unacceptable here 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.149
 what 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:37.989
 it comes damage superficially 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:38.719
 protective 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.749
 skin functions leaching from it 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.529
 useful substances by the way 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.449
 glove is desirable before avid 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.389
 rubber glove on hand attention first 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.559
 many accounting can only be honorable to 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.379
 there was no direct contact operator 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.569
 the fact that they are only direct chemical 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.199
 There are also a number of allergens ufa can 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.119
 drive 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.549
 to changes the skin of the hands but after it 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.559
 wash your hands 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.079
 probably there is a need 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.389
 use cream 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.449
 Of course I am very important that the boat area was 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:08.719
 balanced in composition 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.380
 modern creams 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.250
 knowing should not only be contained 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.690
 moisturizing but already knowing supplements 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.749
 and it is very important that he 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.879
 water lipid to water ratio 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.799
 there was a certain proportions second 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.109
 the film should hold water in 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.029
 skin 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.009
 in particular hands create such 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:30.709
 lipid film through which will 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.849
 obstructions moisture evaporation 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.099
 in addition to cars 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.559
 if some 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:38.169
 hand care 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.959
 andrew with me prevention here 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.759
 initially important because the process 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.339
 hand skin aging will begin as early as 30 35 years 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:45.789
 speaking of 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.719
 he preventive measures the most 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.359
 probably common 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.509
 polar is the treatment of timid 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.429
 cream containing particles either 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.219
 smoked peels which 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.409
 allow the whole surface layer 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.889
 skin yes thousands better than to such actions 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.989
 give some for this purpose applies 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.949
 the center of May was reported acids strongly 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.279
 it's about chemical sciences 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.520
 associate professor of this method skin definitely 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.460
 possible use only in blood on 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.120
 in the hands of a specialist doctor many 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.900
 do plastic surgery militia yes 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.269
 to become younger 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.060
 the matter is that different suspenders percentage 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.459
 make shots n 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.190
 only males can stand 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.110
 onslaught to be on hand 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.270
 it's hard enough to make it like this 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.039
 existing method and one of the methods 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.439
 add ahead of schedule 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.999
 relations 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.999
 in the hands of being replenishing 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.099
 this time the ranks of subcutaneous fat 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.099
 fiber thanks mine nikolayu 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:47.680
 hands on each other 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.069
 I just had to take care 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.580
 but because strangely enough but no 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.139
 most vulnerable to them accounted for more 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.729
 the total load is therefore necessary 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.869
 try to avoid extreme 

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:01.249
 impacts 3 aggressive 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.539
 Avto means washing and negative 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:05.729
 or vice versa redundant 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.209
 temperatures and heavy loads and at the same time 

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.799
 need a percentage in normal life 

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:12.729
 be guided by very simple 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.419
 rules 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.990
 that is, use rubber gloves 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.999
 when you work with detergents 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.979
 try to cancel the lessons 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.849
 comfortable temperature or 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:22.870
 use 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.850
 cream that will prevent 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.139
 keep the skin rub all this will allow your 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
 look like your hands 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:35.089
 real and wish age 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.169
 portal dress 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.139
 I suppose tai sparkled souls and we can imagine 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.410
 imagine what hands 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.820
 this is a visit 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.980
 card of your body
