thanks very much coming in it's
obviously<00:00:16.470> very<00:00:16.529> very<00:00:16.949> different<00:00:17.310> from<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
obviously very very different from the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.340 
obviously very very different from the
old<00:00:17.880> Vectra<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.600> how<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> still<00:00:19.080> know<00:00:19.199> it's

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
old Vectra but how do we still know it's

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.010 
old Vectra but how do we still know it's
a<00:00:19.410> voxel<00:00:19.740> well<00:00:20.430> we've<00:00:20.609> been<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:21.180> from<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
areas you know the the creased surface
is<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.109> dynamic<00:00:31.740> lamp<00:00:31.980> some<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> dynamic

features<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.170> we've<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.590> been

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
features but what we've really been

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.410 
features but what we've really been
trying<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> course<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.270> now

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
trying to do with the course and now

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
trying to do with the course and now
really<00:00:36.840> with<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> insignia<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.770> take<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
really with the insignia is take that to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
really with the insignia is take that to
a<00:00:38.520> whole<00:00:39.149> new<00:00:39.360> level<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.989> really<00:00:40.320> build<00:00:40.620> on

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
a whole new level and really build on

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.010 
a whole new level and really build on
some<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.129> those<00:00:41.340> core<00:00:41.670> attributes<00:00:42.270> okay<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
some of those core attributes okay I

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.060 
some of those core attributes okay I
noticed<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.670> surfaces<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.690> blade

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
noticed the surfaces of this blade

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.049 
noticed the surfaces of this blade
styling<00:00:47.070> he<00:00:47.160> talked<00:00:47.340> us<00:00:47.460> through<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
styling he talked us through that this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.690 
styling he talked us through that this
sort<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.870> flared<00:00:49.410> effect<00:00:49.800> well<00:00:50.100> really

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
sort of more flared effect well really

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.340 
sort of more flared effect well really
what<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.239> I've<00:00:51.390> tried<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.809> instill<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
what what I've tried to instill is a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.770 
what what I've tried to instill is a
philosophy<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.460> call<00:00:53.780> sculptural

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
philosophy what we call sculptural

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.750 
philosophy what we call sculptural
artistry<00:00:55.110> combined<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.070> German<00:00:56.489> precision

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
artistry combined with German precision

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
artistry combined with German precision
and<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.690> means<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.320> he's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
and what that really means is he's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
and what that really means is he's
really<00:00:59.190> taking<00:00:59.609> flowing<00:01:00.239> sculptural<00:01:01.079> shapes

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
really taking flowing sculptural shapes

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.139 
really taking flowing sculptural shapes
to<00:01:01.770> give<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> car<00:01:02.340> more<00:01:02.489> emotion<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to give the car more emotion and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.539 
to give the car more emotion and
dynamism<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.110> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> same<00:01:04.920> time<00:01:05.250> then

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
dynamism and at the same time then

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.600 
dynamism and at the same time then
combine<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.470> German<00:01:08.040> precision

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
combine that with this German precision

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.920 
combine that with this German precision
that<00:01:08.729> we've<00:01:08.880> been<00:01:09.000> talking<00:01:09.360> about<00:01:09.450> which

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that we've been talking about which

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.410 
that we've been talking about which
really<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.770> featured<00:01:11.250> by<00:01:11.400> things<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
really is featured by things like the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.780 
really is featured by things like the
the<00:01:12.900> accent<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> body<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.340> which<00:01:14.610> in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the accent in the body here which in

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
the accent in the body here which in
this<00:01:14.939> case<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.780> car<00:01:16.110> forms<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.650> blade

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this case on this car forms this blade

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.399 
this case on this car forms this blade
feature<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.850> very<00:01:18.420> unique<00:01:18.780> body<00:01:19.049> side

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
feature this very unique body side

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.770 
feature this very unique body side
feature<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.490> gives<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> car<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.240> dynamic

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
feature that gives the car this dynamic

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
feature that gives the car this dynamic
character<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.369> much<00:01:23.520> bigger<00:01:23.759> than<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
character now it's much bigger than the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539 
character now it's much bigger than the
old<00:01:24.119> Vectra<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.920> fact<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.220> bigger<00:01:26.430> than

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
old Vectra and in fact it's bigger than

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.260 
old Vectra and in fact it's bigger than
the<00:01:26.610> Mondeo

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the Mondeo

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.359 
the Mondeo
well<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.229> whining<00:01:28.619> why<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:28.979> gone

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
well it's whining why have you gone

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
well it's whining why have you gone
through<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.000> much<00:01:30.090> largest<00:01:30.540> sizing<00:01:30.930> well<00:01:31.140> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
through so much largest sizing well I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.929 
through so much largest sizing well I
mean<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.560> vehicle<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> probably<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> first

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
mean this vehicle is probably the first

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.270 
mean this vehicle is probably the first
of<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> new<00:01:33.570> generation<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.500> vehicles<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.159> I'm

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
of a new generation of vehicles and I'm

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
of a new generation of vehicles and I'm
talking<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:35.759> from<00:01:35.939> every<00:01:36.240> manufacturer

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
talking about from every manufacturer

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
talking about from every manufacturer
where<00:01:37.320> we've<00:01:37.890> got<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> take<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> very

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
where we've got to take on the very

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450 
where we've got to take on the very
latest<00:01:39.210> standards<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.900> crash<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.590> pedestrian

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
latest standards of crash a pedestrian

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
latest standards of crash a pedestrian
protection<00:01:41.720> etc<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> much<00:01:43.200> higher<00:01:43.229> level

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
protection etc to a much higher level

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.219 
protection etc to a much higher level

overall vehicle efficient within that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.100 
overall vehicle efficient within that
footprint<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.880> see<00:01:57.119> these<00:01:57.479> segment<00:01:57.930> cars

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.630 
footprint do you see these segment cars
continuing<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.159> path<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> getting

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
continuing down this path of getting

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.609 
continuing down this path of getting
larger<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.149> larger<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:01.170> we're<00:02:01.380> probably

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
larger and larger I think we're probably

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.260 
larger and larger I think we're probably
at<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.790> limit<00:02:03.240> now

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
at the limit now

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.139 
at the limit now
with<00:02:04.570> new<00:02:04.900> technologies<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.460> really

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
with new technologies and and really

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.820 
with new technologies and and really
applying<00:02:07.479> some<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.869> those<00:02:08.050> things<00:02:08.440> yeah

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
applying some of those things yeah

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.979 
applying some of those things yeah
hopefully<00:02:09.099> we<00:02:09.550> can<00:02:09.789> contain<00:02:10.300> the

this a new design direction or do you

this a new design direction or do you
see<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.660> as<00:02:58.720> an<00:02:58.930> interpretation<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.769> what

yesterday<00:03:02.260> well<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.620> think<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.489> Astra<00:03:03.940> was

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
yesterday well I think the the Astra was

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.870 
yesterday well I think the the Astra was
a<00:03:04.290> foundation<00:03:05.290> car<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.650> would<00:03:06.040> say<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.340> really

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
a foundation car I would say to really

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.759 
a foundation car I would say to really
get<00:03:07.060> us<00:03:07.209> on<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> right<00:03:07.690> path<00:03:07.750> but<00:03:08.049> certainly

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
get us on the right path but certainly

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.220 
get us on the right path but certainly
this<00:03:09.010> car<00:03:09.370> takes<00:03:10.060> us<00:03:10.269> to<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> whole<00:03:10.780> new<00:03:10.989> level

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
this car takes us to a whole new level

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.819 
this car takes us to a whole new level
of<00:03:11.709> execution<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.850> quality<00:03:13.299> both<00:03:13.829> exterior

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
of execution of quality both exterior

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.740 
of execution of quality both exterior
and<00:03:15.070> very<00:03:15.609> much<00:03:15.820> on<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.150> interior<00:03:16.630> the

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
and very much on the interior the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.590 
and very much on the interior the
interiors<00:03:17.350> moved<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.829> dramatically<00:03:18.609> now<00:03:19.150> for

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
interiors moved on dramatically now for

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.050 
interiors moved on dramatically now for
me<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:20.560> biggest<00:03:20.769> change<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.730> insignia

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
me the biggest change in this insignia

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.880 
me the biggest change in this insignia
compared<00:03:23.019> with<00:03:23.109> the<00:03:23.200> Vectra<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.709> this

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
compared with the Vectra is this

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.180 
compared with the Vectra is this
interior<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:24.640> is<00:03:25.049> much<00:03:26.049> more<00:03:26.290> premium<00:03:26.920> feel

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
interior which is much more premium feel

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.160 
interior which is much more premium feel
much<00:03:27.519> plusher

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
much plusher

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.780 
much plusher
how<00:03:29.170> have<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.380> created<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.859> where<00:03:30.489> who<00:03:30.670> are

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
how have you created that where who are

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.280 
how have you created that where who are
you<00:03:30.910> which<00:03:31.209> other<00:03:31.359> manufactures<00:03:31.930> did<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.140> use

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
you which other manufactures did you use

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.640 
you which other manufactures did you use
as<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> benchmark<00:03:32.680> yeah<00:03:33.609> well<00:03:33.819> we<00:03:33.970> really<00:03:34.650> we

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
as a benchmark yeah well we really we

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.770 
as a benchmark yeah well we really we
almost<00:03:35.829> end<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.310> interior<00:03:36.880> avoided<00:03:37.540> doing

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
almost end the interior avoided doing

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.449 
almost end the interior avoided doing
benchmarks<00:03:38.440> against<00:03:38.920> their<00:03:39.100> current

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
benchmarks against their current

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
notice is this very inviting one

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.250 
notice is this very inviting one
wraparound<00:03:54.280> feel<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.750> what<00:03:55.959> we've<00:03:56.109> done

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
wraparound feel and what we've done

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.289 
wraparound feel and what we've done
there<00:03:56.530> was<00:03:56.709> basically<00:03:56.950> take<00:03:57.489> all<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
there was basically take all of the

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:00.900 
there was basically take all of the
components<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.079> push<00:03:59.319> them<00:03:59.560> away<00:03:59.680> from<00:04:00.639> you

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
components and push them away from you

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.849 
components and push them away from you
