00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
back we see this beautiful bronze

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.500 
back we see this beautiful bronze
texture<00:00:39.510> reflecting<00:00:40.500> nicely<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:42.360> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
texture reflecting nicely and this is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.510 
texture reflecting nicely and this is
the<00:00:42.629> actual<00:00:42.750> antenna<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.980> located<00:00:44.340> in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the actual antenna and it's located in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.790 
the actual antenna and it's located in
here's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.940> very<00:00:45.210> thin<00:00:45.450> antenna<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.590> has

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here's a very thin antenna and it has

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.369 
here's a very thin antenna and it has
all<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.550> distribution<00:00:48.020> exactly<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> sign

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
all the distribution exactly the sign

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
all the distribution exactly the sign
for<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> iPhone<00:00:49.980> 6<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> takes<00:00:51.000> radiation

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
for the iPhone 6 so it takes radiation

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.410 
for the iPhone 6 so it takes radiation

seems too awkward I love this opening I
don't<00:01:45.729> like<00:01:45.910> cases<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.570> have<00:01:46.750> individual

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
don't like cases that have individual

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.680 
don't like cases that have individual
cuttings<00:01:47.830> for<00:01:48.070> each<00:01:48.310> for<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.820> because<00:01:49.390> if<00:01:49.570> you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
cuttings for each for it because if you

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.750 
cuttings for each for it because if you
want<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:49.930> use<00:01:50.080> another<00:01:50.229> type<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.620> charger<00:01:51.250> you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
want to use another type of charger you

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.610 
want to use another type of charger you
can't<00:01:52.120> or<00:01:52.450> another<00:01:52.690> type<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:52.960> headphone<00:01:53.380> but

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
can't or another type of headphone but

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.340 
can't or another type of headphone but
this<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:54.100> perfect<00:01:55.000> we've<00:01:55.780> talked<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.170> lot<00:01:56.200> about

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
this is perfect we've talked a lot about

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.640 
this is perfect we've talked a lot about
design<00:01:57.040> but<00:01:57.400> now<00:01:58.030> comes<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.690> real<00:01:59.229> world

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
design but now comes the real world

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.740 
design but now comes the real world
scenarios<00:02:00.340> we're<00:02:00.880> gonna<00:02:01.000> do<00:02:01.180> some<00:02:01.390> speed

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
scenarios we're gonna do some speed

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.170 
scenarios we're gonna do some speed
tests<00:02:02.170> without<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.890> case<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.369> with<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.820> case

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
tests without the case and with the case

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.960 
tests without the case and with the case
so<00:02:04.930> let's<00:02:05.200> remove<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:06.040> case<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.580> see<00:02:06.729> how

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
so let's remove the case and see how

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:25.070 
so let's remove the case and see how
difficult<00:02:07.780> this<00:02:08.410> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.460 

I<00:02:26.000> can't<00:02:27.000> remove<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> case<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:28.200> is

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
I can't remove the case this is
