00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:10.810 

she<00:00:04.549> goes<00:00:04.730> through<00:00:04.910> like<00:00:05.029> Mike's<00:00:05.390> first<00:00:09.820> it's

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
she goes through like Mike's first it's

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.570 
she goes through like Mike's first it's
just<00:00:10.849> the<00:00:11.120> the<00:00:11.450> or<00:00:11.960> call<00:00:12.110> at<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:12.290> 57<00:00:12.919> it's<00:00:13.309> an<00:00:13.460> M

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
just the the or call at the 57 it's an M

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.200 
just the the or call at the 57 it's an M
69<00:00:14.089> but<00:00:14.360> call<00:00:14.690> it<00:00:14.839> 57<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:16.150> dynamic

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.440 

and<00:00:21.840> impedance<00:00:22.500> which<00:00:23.280> is<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> bit

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
and impedance which is like a bit

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.660 
and impedance which is like a bit
different<00:00:24.810> transformer<00:00:25.470> say<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:26.370> all<00:00:26.490> about

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
different transformer say I'm all about

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:36.350 
different transformer say I'm all about
30<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.340> would<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.550> 1200<00:00:36.060> supposed<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> be

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
30 so this would be 1200 supposed to be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.680 
30 so this would be 1200 supposed to be
a<00:00:36.390> little<00:00:36.630> less<00:00:36.840> base<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> bit<00:00:37.500> more<00:00:37.680> mid<00:00:37.860> right

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.450 

so<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.780> bring<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.080> second<00:00:46.440> microphone<00:00:46.890> in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so we bring the second microphone in

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.330 
so we bring the second microphone in
which<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.120> 4<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.330> transformer<00:00:53.510> pad

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
which is a 4 so we go transformer pad

00:00:55.340 --> 00:02:01.120 
which is a 4 so we go transformer pad
switch<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:59.630> pad<00:01:00.630> to<00:01:00.780> power<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.350> low-cut

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:31.440 

you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:03:33.430 

near<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.540> tailor<00:02:32.870> which<00:02:33.319> one

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.500 

you
