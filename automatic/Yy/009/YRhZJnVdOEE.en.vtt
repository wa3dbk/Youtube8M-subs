so this was done by the knit stitch and
going<00:01:35.820> back<00:01:36.830> we'll<00:01:37.830> use<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:40.020> next<00:01:40.350> stitch<00:01:44.600> etc

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
going back we'll use the next stitch etc

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.859

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
now if you choose to do nothing but the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
will do will look like this if you do

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.529 
will do will look like this if you do
nothing<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.539> purl<00:01:57.840> stitch<00:01:58.729> then<00:01:59.729> the

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
nothing but the purl stitch then the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.109 
nothing but the purl stitch then the
front<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.080> your<00:02:01.289> work<00:02:01.470> will<00:02:01.799> look<00:02:02.039> like<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.850 

but<00:02:06.119> either<00:02:06.360> way<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.929> result<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> same

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.740 

there<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.039> however<00:02:11.310> another<00:02:11.819> way<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> achieve

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
there is however another way to achieve

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.710 
there is however another way to achieve
the<00:02:13.200> stockinette<00:02:13.830> stitch<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.480> by

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
the stockinette stitch and that is by

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.630 
the stockinette stitch and that is by
performing<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.650> e-wrap<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.650> result<00:02:20.100> won't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
performing the e-wrap the result won't

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.809 
performing the e-wrap the result won't
be<00:02:20.819> exactly<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.690> same<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.430> why<00:02:23.640> they

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
be exactly the same and that is why they

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.390 
be exactly the same and that is why they
also<00:02:24.000> call<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> inverted<00:02:25.739> stockinette

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
also call this the inverted stockinette

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.849 
also call this the inverted stockinette
stitch<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.900> it'll<00:02:28.769> be<00:02:28.920> close<00:02:29.190> enough<00:02:30.859> let's

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
stitch but it'll be close enough let's

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.130 
stitch but it'll be close enough let's
do<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> few<00:02:32.459> rows<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.060> I'll<00:02:33.540> show<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
do a few rows and I'll show you the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.789 
do a few rows and I'll show you the

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
results of what is the difference

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.360 
results of what is the difference
between<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.930> knit<00:02:40.170> stitch<00:02:40.470> stockinette

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370

stockinette stitch see in a few minutes

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.179 
stockinette stitch see in a few minutes
okay<00:02:49.629> let's<00:02:50.170> get<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.890> off<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.430> loom<00:02:53.189> let's

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
okay let's get this off the loom let's

00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:08.759 
okay let's get this off the loom let's
see<00:02:54.909> what<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.269> looks<00:02:55.510> like

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.559 

it's<00:03:09.769> really<00:03:10.280> easy<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.609> see<00:03:10.969> the<00:03:11.120> difference

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
it's really easy to see the difference

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.339 
it's really easy to see the difference
this<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:11.959> more<00:03:12.859> of<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.189> whimsical<00:03:13.640> loose-knit
