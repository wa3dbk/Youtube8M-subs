00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 This tutorial is going to explain a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.440
 serious problem that have arisen as a result of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.370
 these of these smart batteries the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.620
 problem that we have with this matter 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.090
 are two connectors let's turn off the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.060
 battery for you to see 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.610
 we are the battery and the battery carries 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.820
 two beige correctors that are those two 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.090
 little points that we have right there that 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.570
 what it does is that to avoid type 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:35.350
 iphone the copies of the possible 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.050
 Chinese batteries have put a 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.150
 kind of chip that recognizes that 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.940
 recognizes the battery means that 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.110
 If we do not get an original battery as 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.809
 would give us the message of invalid battery 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.559
 until days until right car but the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.800
 problem arises because there has been some 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.910
 especially if a case of people who 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.290
 has been in the forum 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.620
 that has given him the battery error we're going 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.060
 to explain they will teach how that goes 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.580
 error and so you know about this 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.070
 pending and some tips with 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.479
 regarding that to that connector then 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.330
 the problem is that when he has left 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.080
 that error message to people who 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.360
 I still did not have the software updated 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.880
 what the phantom did is directly 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.470
 it ran out of energy and we passed 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.700
 we were flying ten meters from 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.789
 height 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.130
 these connectors failed and what I was doing 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:36.920
 because in principle it was configured 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.610
 this left the device and the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.720
 device then fell to the void also without 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.000
 without batteries with which the destruction of 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.319
 apparatus and all the components that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 there is also a response from jota and the 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.190
 answer that was from jota and is that you're 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.380
 that error is worth it we had to record 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.470
 so the one who did not have the camera 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.120
 recording because it had no way of 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.539
 show it then to have no way of 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.190
 show it now let's go to some of 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.170
 the gigantillos will be in the forum with 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.530
 problems with this type of battery 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.010
 what happened as a result of this brings us together and has 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.110
 removed a software update from 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.310
 done me when I bought it first 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.180
 what they told me was to update the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.700
 software precisely to avoid that 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.459
 kind of problem what is going on 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.080
 now if we have the battery and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.510
 you can give the case and I'll explain 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.060
 right now the reason for that error of 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.950
 matter now what does the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.200
 phantom through the rate of that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.849
 Software change is that if you give the error 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.550
 of immaterial inbar what would do is that 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.660
 would land would not do as a go to home 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.930
 but but in the place that is 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.350
 donated from there would analyze and it's easy and 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.340
 then it's easy and everything is to root 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.350
 of these two connectors that you have here 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.500
 What is the problem, so I explained in 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.120
 the first video that I hit enough 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.460
 strong with enough energy the battery 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.470
 so I do that so that it arrives 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.250
 as much as possible read in several 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.860
 forums and documenting what was being said 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.010
 is that he with a doctor with a caliber 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.290
 that the distance between the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.940
 connectors that we have in the phantom that 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.650
 if you see it, it's those two connectors 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.330
 little ones from the bottom not the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.520
 two big ones that we have above but 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.770
 would be those at the bottom of the 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.590
 distance there was a connection that 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.390
 there was between the connector that we have here 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.940
 tiny and those that we have in the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.670
 phantom was minimal with which any 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.500
 variation of that battery what I would do is 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.780
 that would make a false contact and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.980
 our invalid error would come out 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.379
 drums 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.159
 that's why I already tell you to always try 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.610
 give an eye, obviously, but 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:02.380
 if an energetic blow so that the battery 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.760
 all around it is completely 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.080
 irritated you know that there is no gap that does not 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.940
 be slack because there are times that I 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.580
 be true that observed that when putting it 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.770
 it stays with a little bit of slack 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.390
 that little bit of slack is enough 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.940
 so that he can give us an invalid 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.400
 battery but at the time of pasting if 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.799
 at the time of flight tips with 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.660
 regarding the subject of imbali materia and in 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.170
 the theme of the two connectors first 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.710
 never under any circumstances leave the 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.420
 battery on because because the two 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.210
 connectors that we have carry two 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.220
 springs that when we insert the 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.570
 what I would do is push 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.320
 are the springs and that's what the 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.770
 contact what happens if we leave the battery 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.500
 put we lose effectiveness of that 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.560
 dock the effectiveness may be that we 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.590
 errors is not usual but you can 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.170
 give the case another thing to have in 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.020
 account is always having those with two 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:03.620
 Clean contacts are two contacts as 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:07.220
 you can see what you have here you see me 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.300
 I will not be able to observe any trouble and 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.789
 this has 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.750
 and I say to watch whenever you are 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:17.789
 clean the water in contact and then 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.180
 observe that both are at the same 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.650
 height he wants to say he's never 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.710
 one more down than another because it has been given 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.199
 cases that gave an error because one 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.409
 it was lower than the other then 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:34.020
 clear when it came to putting the battery 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.230
 the error that we commented on invading 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.750
 homeland 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:43.140
 well said this 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:46.230
 I'm going to catch you I'm going to insert the battery 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.840
 and we are going to simulate 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.390
 that error for us what there are are 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:55.620
 two we would take a piece of insulation tape 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:58.350
 tap we would make the two connectors that 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.680
 you have here and now we will insert a 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.680
 drums 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.420
 we would understand by pressing once returning 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.420
 to leave tight 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:18.269
 if you would understand our funk we would catch 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:20.769
 we would understand our our mobile 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:25.089
 our tablet or any any 

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:29.409
 apparatus that we have for and establish 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:31.969
 the fpv we would look for our network 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.039
 from phantom 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:35.449
 well, once our network is hosted 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:39.129
 from phantom 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.129
 we would open our program 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.410
 we would understand our camera 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:54.680
 and as you can see it gives an error that 

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.680
 it's on battery 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.689
 and that is a consequence of the non-connection 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.409
 of the 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:07.679
 of the two contacts we would return to 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:09.889
 that you see we would take our 

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:09.889
 drums 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.070
 ok we would remove our our tape 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:23.090
 insulating 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:25.870
 and we would go back 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.870
 because 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.889
 the battery would go back to the 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.159
 Program 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:36.499
 and as you see right now we already get the 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.509
 problem of the invalid battery ya 

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:40.849
 I say that this is a serious problem now 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:43.219
 the problem of our super batteries 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:45.620
 smart and good is something to have in 

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:48.650
 account is simply that all 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.870
 those observations that we have told you not 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:54.650
 ye mind when performing a 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:57.229
 flight is worth this has been everything to give a like 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.180
 I like and good anything 

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:01.340
 Any comment that you can leave what 

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.830
 you can leave here below in the video 

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.330
 tutorial and if not then you can visit us 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:09.770
 already 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:12.220
 in www.pamplona.es come a greeting and 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.220
 until another
