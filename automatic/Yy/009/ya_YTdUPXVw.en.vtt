just<00:00:05.370> like<00:00:06.020> 30<00:00:07.020> years<00:00:07.230> ago<00:00:07.429> having<00:00:08.429> computers

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
just like 30 years ago having computers

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.299 
just like 30 years ago having computers
in<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.000> home<00:00:09.150> was<00:00:09.450> science<00:00:10.349> fiction<00:00:10.410> well

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
in the home was science fiction well

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.879 
in the home was science fiction well
that<00:00:11.880> came<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.269> be<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.660> we'll<00:00:13.200> see<00:00:13.410> robots<00:00:13.679> in

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
that came to be and we'll see robots in

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.379 
that came to be and we'll see robots in
the<00:00:13.980> home<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.580> similar<00:00:14.940> way

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the home in a similar way

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.660 
the home in a similar way
in<00:00:15.630> fact<00:00:15.929> robots<00:00:16.680> will<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.279> commonplace

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
in fact robots will be so commonplace

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.670 
in fact robots will be so commonplace
that<00:00:18.330> they'll<00:00:18.600> be<00:00:18.750> part<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.080> everyday<00:00:19.410> living

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
that they'll be part of everyday living

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.130 
that they'll be part of everyday living
and<00:00:20.029> eventually<00:00:21.029> you'll<00:00:21.420> wonder<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:21.840> he<00:00:21.900> ever

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and eventually you'll wonder how he ever

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.070 
and eventually you'll wonder how he ever
got<00:00:22.289> by<00:00:22.710> without<00:00:23.369> them<00:00:26.689> today<00:00:27.689> we're<00:00:27.900> seeing

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
got by without them today we're seeing

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.259 
got by without them today we're seeing
robots<00:00:28.500> making<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> transition<00:00:29.849> from<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
robots making the transition from the

lab to the living room to do that you
have<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.630> easy<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.230> use<00:00:34.550> communicate<00:00:35.550> with

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
have to be easy to use communicate with

us understand us and understand each

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.360 
us understand us and understand each
other<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.390> really<00:00:40.110> want<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.620> robot<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.219> your

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
other if we really want a robot in your

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.280 
other if we really want a robot in your
home<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.239> do<00:00:42.360> multiple<00:00:42.540> things<00:00:42.840> that's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
home that can do multiple things that's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
home that can do multiple things that's
general<00:00:43.710> purpose<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.430> an<00:00:44.550> assistant<00:00:45.120> then

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
general purpose like an assistant then

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
general purpose like an assistant then
you<00:00:45.600> need<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.020> robot<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.500> much<00:00:46.739> more

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you need the robot to be much more

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
you need the robot to be much more
intelligent<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.570> we're

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
intelligent and that's really what we're

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
intelligent and that's really what we're
pushing<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.800> lab<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.340> try<00:00:50.730> to

of that robot and some of the ways maybe
that<00:02:25.600> people<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:26.080> with<00:02:26.200> pets<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.800> when<00:02:26.950> you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
that people do with pets so when you

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.670 
that people do with pets so when you
train<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> dog<00:02:27.520> at<00:02:28.150> home<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.840> know<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.020> follow

the rules of your house we want to do

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.150 
the rules of your house we want to do
something<00:02:31.630> similar<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:32.080> robots<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:32.980> don't

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
something similar with robots we don't

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.670 
something similar with robots we don't
necessarily<00:02:33.370> want<00:02:33.820> robots<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:35.170> are<00:02:35.440> going

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
necessarily want robots that are going

necessarily want robots that are going
to<00:02:35.770> be<00:02:35.890> our<00:02:36.100> equals<00:02:36.580> in<00:02:36.790> every<00:02:37.000> possible<00:02:37.180> way

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
to be our equals in every possible way

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.420 
to be our equals in every possible way
but<00:02:37.870> we<00:02:38.020> do<00:02:38.140> want<00:02:38.350> robots<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.860> do<00:02:38.980> some<00:02:39.220> things

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
but we do want robots to do some things

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.610 
but we do want robots to do some things
for<00:02:39.700> us<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.090> think<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.960> approach<00:02:41.380> of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
for us and I think that that approach of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.040 
for us and I think that that approach of
having<00:02:41.800> capable<00:02:42.730> robots<00:02:43.150> that<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.690> interact

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
having capable robots that can interact

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.860 
having capable robots that can interact
but<00:02:44.410> are<00:02:44.560> not<00:02:44.800> themselves<00:02:45.270> very<00:02:46.270> reminiscent

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
but are not themselves very reminiscent

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.200 
but are not themselves very reminiscent
of<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.260> human<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.740> probably<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.790> best<00:02:49.000> way<00:02:49.180> to

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
of a human is probably the best way to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.330 
of a human is probably the best way to
make<00:02:49.480> them<00:02:49.660> socially<00:02:50.080> acceptable<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
make them socially acceptable this is a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.100 
make them socially acceptable this is a
great<00:02:51.700> time<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.150> be<00:02:52.270> involved<00:02:52.600> in<00:02:52.960> robotics

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
great time to be involved in robotics

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.580 
great time to be involved in robotics
research<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.550> see<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> huge<00:02:55.450> need<00:02:55.990> for<00:02:56.020> people

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
research so I see a huge need for people

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.780 
research so I see a huge need for people
who<00:02:56.680> were<00:02:56.800> trained<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.220> educated<00:02:57.250> in

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
who were trained and educated in

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.610 
who were trained and educated in
robotics<00:02:58.120> very<00:02:59.020> bright<00:02:59.170> future

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
robotics very bright future
