whether we read our thing that was just
popping<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.340> yeah<00:00:44.960> that<00:00:45.960> doesn't<00:00:46.350> happen<00:00:46.730> no

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
witnessed was an innovator in Minecraft
and<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.870> can<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.350> looked<00:01:07.770> area<00:01:08.070> south<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and you can see I looked area south of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.040 
and you can see I looked area south of
actually<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.880> ain't<00:01:09.870> no<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.430> hallways

lighting issues
did<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> break<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.840> yes<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.500> did<00:01:19.680> break

invented or actually I invented it's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.200 
invented or actually I invented it's
made<00:01:33.270> its<00:01:33.479> using<00:01:33.720> frames<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:35.940> is<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
made its using frames and here is the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.770 
made its using frames and here is the
control<00:01:36.960> circuitry<00:01:38.300> tutorial<00:01:39.300> coming<00:01:39.600> later

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
control circuitry tutorial coming later

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.150 
control circuitry tutorial coming later
soon<00:01:40.080> as<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.229> attempt<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> record<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
soon as they attempt to record it

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.770 
soon as they attempt to record it
because<00:01:41.759> right<00:01:41.970> now<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.179> don't<00:01:42.330> have<00:01:42.539> time<00:01:42.750> for

that we only have ten record the next
one<00:01:44.580> or<00:01:44.610> two<00:01:44.700> episodes<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.440> yeah<00:01:46.440> that's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
one or two episodes and yeah that's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.969 
one or two episodes and yeah that's
about<00:01:46.679> it<00:01:47.179> yeah<00:01:48.289> do<00:01:49.289> they<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.710> frame

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
about it yeah do they have to frame

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.639 
about it yeah do they have to frame
motors<00:01:50.479> one<00:01:51.479> poking<00:01:52.110> downwards<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.560> then

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
motors one poking downwards and then

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.889 
motors one poking downwards and then
pointing<00:01:53.100> upwards<00:01:53.429> which<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.179> both

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
looked up to do a delay which is coming

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.330 
looked up to do a delay which is coming
from<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.899> power<00:01:58.289> plant<00:01:58.560> right<00:01:58.679> here<00:02:01.340> don't

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
from that power plant right here don't

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
from that power plant right here don't
mind<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:03.110> yeah

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
as you can see the elevators going down

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.280 
as you can see the elevators going down
without<00:02:07.979> me<00:02:10.220> good<00:02:11.220> work<00:02:11.930> either<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
without me good work either on the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.640 
without me good work either on the
server<00:02:13.530> if<00:02:13.860> friends<00:02:14.190> are<00:02:14.280> quite<00:02:14.550> laggy<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
server if friends are quite laggy the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.700 
server if friends are quite laggy the
data<00:02:16.860> version<00:02:17.040> yeah<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.640> basic<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.690> worth<00:02:19.050> H

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
data version yeah so basic the worth H

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.140 
data version yeah so basic the worth H
is<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.640> they're<00:02:21.240> just<00:02:22.640> yeah<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.940> there's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
is the they're just yeah and there's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.550 
is the they're just yeah and there's
also<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.630> thing<00:02:24.690> which<00:02:24.960> is<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> deployer

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
also this thing which is a deployer

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.410 
also this thing which is a deployer
photos<00:02:26.190> frames<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.210> block

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
photos frames and this is a block

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.900 
photos frames and this is a block
breaker<00:02:27.720> which<00:02:28.560> breaks<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.310> blocks<00:02:29.730> that

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
breaker which breaks the blocks that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.050 
breaker which breaks the blocks that
when<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:30.990> so<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.680> saw<00:02:32.060> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
when going down so you just saw and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.290 
when going down so you just saw and
these<00:02:33.870> are<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.530> gates<00:02:34.950> with<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> timer<00:02:35.610> because

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
these are and gates with a timer because

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.699 
these are and gates with a timer because
without<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.170> not<00:02:37.319> going<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.530> move<00:02:37.650> down

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
without this it's not going to move down

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.280 
without this it's not going to move down
continuously<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:39.480> gonna<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:39.810> stop

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
continuously it's gonna just stop

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.070 
continuously it's gonna just stop

randomly I tried it out this should be
set<00:02:43.319> to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
set to

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.960

point the point to like that one I know

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.790 
point the point to like that one I know
why<00:02:50.240> that<00:02:50.270> got<00:02:50.630> set<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.870> 1.3<00:02:52.420> whatever<00:02:53.800> well

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
why that got set to 1.3 whatever well
