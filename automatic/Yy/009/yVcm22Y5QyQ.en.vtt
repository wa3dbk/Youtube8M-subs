poles the advantage of duratec
fiberglass<00:01:01.629> is<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.350> it's<00:01:02.530> very<00:01:02.679> tough<00:01:02.920> and

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
fiberglass is that it's very tough and

very durable in comparison to standard
fiberglass<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:06.280> is<00:01:06.430> due<00:01:06.550> to<00:01:06.610> having<00:01:06.940> a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
fiberglass this is due to having a

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.460 
fiberglass this is due to having a
protective<00:01:07.480> sheath<00:01:07.659> around<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.140> outside<00:01:08.439> of

protective sheath around the outside of

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.679 
protective sheath around the outside of
it<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:08.799> as<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.340> can<00:01:09.460> see<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:10.210> sheath<00:01:10.420> has

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
it and as you can see that sheath has

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.510 
it and as you can see that sheath has
these<00:01:10.990> crisscross<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:11.920> firewalls<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.310> run

these crisscross and firewalls that run

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.340 
these crisscross and firewalls that run
all<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.850> way<00:01:12.939> along<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.299> pole<00:01:13.479> just<00:01:14.049> meaning

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
all the way along the pole just meaning

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.840 
all the way along the pole just meaning
that<00:01:14.380> when<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> pool<00:01:14.920> starts<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.340> bend<00:01:15.490> it's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
that when the pool starts to bend it's

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.399 
that when the pool starts to bend it's
not<00:01:16.030> going<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.240> snap<00:01:16.420> anywhere<00:01:16.930> near<00:01:17.110> as

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
not going to snap anywhere near as

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.950 
not going to snap anywhere near as
quickly<00:01:17.619> as<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.979> standard<00:01:18.430> fiberglass<00:01:18.880> pole<00:01:19.090> we

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
quickly as a standard fiberglass pole we

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.179 
quickly as a standard fiberglass pole we
can<00:01:19.990> also<00:01:20.200> see<00:01:20.439> that<00:01:20.560> each<00:01:20.680> pole<00:01:20.950> is

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
can also see that each pole is

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.910 
can also see that each pole is
color-coded<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.689> relevant<00:01:23.560> sleeve

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.849 
stable on the when stabilizer system
we'll<00:02:04.810> also<00:02:05.020> see<00:02:05.350> that<00:02:05.469> we<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.710> these

and you've got your head taut jump also
we<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:14.920> see<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> guidelines

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
we can see that the guidelines

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.020 
we can see that the guidelines
themselves<00:02:15.879> are<00:02:16.360> luminous

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
themselves are luminous

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.309
