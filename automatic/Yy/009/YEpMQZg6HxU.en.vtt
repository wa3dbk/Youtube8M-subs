 necessary and this judgment 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.759
 but this thesis is still a preponderant role risk assessment 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.009
 cardiovascular 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.159

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.899
 the strikers 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:31.839
 it was a person who reads 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:32.890

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.020
 to control its weight 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.250

 it will contribute to better control of the decades 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.850

 as risk factors are modifiable and risk factors 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.880
 are numerous 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.399
