an insight of what to expect when you

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.460 
an insight of what to expect when you
choose<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.919> come<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.279> st.<00:00:20.460> Andrews<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:21.470> think

choose to come to st. Andrews I think

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.960 
choose to come to st. Andrews I think
there<00:00:22.589> are<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.679> number<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.919> special<00:00:23.490> things<00:00:23.820> but

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
there are a number of special things but

if I had to highlight one thing in
particular<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.429> as<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:26.999> from<00:00:27.300> day<00:00:27.480> one

and<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.149> something<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.629> find<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and that is something that I find and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
and that is something that I find and
most<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.100> colleagues<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.519> guess<00:00:56.699> would

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
most of my colleagues I guess would

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
most of my colleagues I guess would
agree<00:00:57.420> find<00:00:57.809> being<00:00:58.260> very<00:00:58.469> special<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> st.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
agree find being very special to st.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
Andrews let me just say a few words on

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.610 
Andrews let me just say a few words on
what<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> expect<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.050> and<00:01:04.170> how<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.410> degree

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
what to expect you and how the degree

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.650 
what to expect you and how the degree
works<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.460> basically<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.150> four<00:01:06.450> year<00:01:06.630> degree

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
works it's basically a four year degree

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.490 
works it's basically a four year degree
split<00:01:07.560> into<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:07.980> parts<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.630> first<00:01:09.660> few<00:01:10.020> parts

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
split into two parts the first few parts

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
split into two parts the first few parts
is<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.340> call<00:01:11.520> sub<00:01:11.820> honours<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.420> pre

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
is what we call sub honours or pre

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.360 
is what we call sub honours or pre
honours<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.230> the<00:01:13.470> third<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> fourth<00:01:14.070> year<00:01:14.250> is

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
honours and the third and fourth year is

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.970 
honours and the third and fourth year is
the<00:01:14.640> honors<00:01:15.230> period<00:01:16.230> Junior<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.620> his<00:01:16.770> third

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
the honors period Junior on his third

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.130 
the honors period Junior on his third
year<00:01:17.190> and<00:01:17.370> fourth<00:01:18.150> he<00:01:18.270> being<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.690> senior

year and fourth he being as senior

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.320 
year and fourth he being as senior
honours<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> beauty<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.300> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
honours and I think the beauty is that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.750 
honours and I think the beauty is that
throughout<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.230> first<00:01:22.410> two<00:01:22.590> years<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.730> least

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
throughout the first two years at least

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.270 
throughout the first two years at least
looking<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.540> history<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.900> what<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.170> offer<00:01:25.350> you

looking at history and what we offer you

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.940 
looking at history and what we offer you
could<00:01:27.060> expect<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.750> broad<00:01:28.020> survey<00:01:28.350> courses

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
could expect very broad survey courses

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.750 
could expect very broad survey courses

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
weeks of teaching based on three

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.190 
weeks of teaching based on three
lectures<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:44.970> week<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.480> again<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.870> beautiful

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
lectures a week but again the beautiful

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.830 
lectures a week but again the beautiful
part<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.970> come<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.510> lectures

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
part is that you come from the lectures

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.530 
part is that you come from the lectures
and<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.140> sit<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.380> very<00:01:49.620> small<00:01:49.890> class

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
and you sit in very small class

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
and you sit in very small class
tutorials<00:01:51.540> anything<00:01:52.530> between<00:01:52.650> five<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
tutorials anything between five and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.830 
tutorials anything between five and
seven<00:01:53.490> students<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.300> is<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.630> where

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
seven students and this is really where

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.630 
seven students and this is really where
you<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.650> chance<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.100> interact<00:01:56.400> with

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you have the chance to interact with

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.230 
you have the chance to interact with
peers<00:01:56.910> with<00:01:57.750> professors<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.770> tutors<00:01:59.240> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
peers with professors with tutors and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.180 
peers with professors with tutors and
that<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.660> way<00:02:00.780> how<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.020> teach<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.650> sub<00:02:01.920> 1s

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
that is the way how we teach at sub 1s

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.360 
that is the way how we teach at sub 1s
level<00:02:02.490> throughout<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> first<00:02:03.210> two<00:02:03.420> years<00:02:04.370> you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
level throughout the first two years you

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.460 
level throughout the first two years you
then<00:02:05.520> move<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.910> honors<00:02:06.270> first<00:02:07.050> year<00:02:07.290> junior

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
then move on to honors first year junior

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.770 
then move on to honors first year junior
honors<00:02:07.800> second<00:02:08.190> year<00:02:08.340> senior<00:02:08.819> honors<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.420> you

honors second year senior honors and you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.319 
honors second year senior honors and you
have<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> broad<00:02:10.259> range<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.890> choices<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.670> modules

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
have a broad range of choices of modules

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.580 
have a broad range of choices of modules
which<00:02:12.689> in<00:02:12.959> 30

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
which in 30

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.050 
which in 30
run<00:02:14.459> for<00:02:14.850> semester<00:02:15.270> each<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:17.610> ranges

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
run for semester each and it ranges

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180 
run for semester each and it ranges
really<00:02:18.270> from<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.540> early<00:02:18.840> medieval<00:02:19.410> period<00:02:19.590> to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
really from the early medieval period to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
Asian history and perhaps one of the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.340 
Asian history and perhaps one of the
best<00:02:29.730> parts<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.239> find<00:02:30.540> personally<00:02:30.750> teaching

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
best parts I find personally teaching

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.070 
best parts I find personally teaching
here<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.190> fourth<00:02:32.580> year<00:02:32.840> where<00:02:33.840> we<00:02:33.930> offer

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
here is in fourth year where we offer

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.020 
here is in fourth year where we offer
so-called<00:02:34.560> special<00:02:34.950> subjects<00:02:35.489> again<00:02:35.850> it's

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
so-called special subjects again it's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.990 
so-called special subjects again it's
based<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.420> very<00:02:36.480> very<00:02:36.840> small<00:02:37.260> groups<00:02:38.000> for

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
based on very very small groups for

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.070 
based on very very small groups for
instance<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.300> teach<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.780> German

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
instance I teach on the German

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.559 
instance I teach on the German
enlightenment<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:41.370> ranges<00:02:41.850> across<00:02:42.150> two

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
enlightenment it ranges across two

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.930 
enlightenment it ranges across two
semesters<00:02:43.140> again<00:02:43.470> based<00:02:43.770> with<00:02:44.250> based<00:02:44.790> on

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
semesters again based with based on

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.600 
semesters again based with based on
small<00:02:45.209> groups<00:02:45.480> anything<00:02:46.290> between<00:02:46.410> three<00:02:47.280> four

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
small groups anything between three four

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.370 
small groups anything between three four
up<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.239> seven<00:02:48.540> students<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.110> again<00:02:49.290> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
up to seven students and again the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.110 
up to seven students and again the
beauty<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.130> get<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.489> know<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> students

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
beauty is you get to know the students

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
beauty is you get to know the students
you<00:02:51.720> work<00:02:51.900> very<00:02:52.170> closely<00:02:52.440> once<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.130> week

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
you work very closely once a week

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.250 
you work very closely once a week
usually<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.000> Wednesday<00:02:54.330> morning<00:02:54.750> for

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
usually on the Wednesday morning for

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.470 
usually on the Wednesday morning for
three<00:02:55.470> hours<00:02:55.620> very<00:02:56.430> closely<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.940> primary

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
three hours very closely on primary

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.840 
three hours very closely on primary
sources<00:02:57.810> secondary<00:02:58.170> sources<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.040> again<00:02:59.610> it's

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
sources secondary sources and again it's

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.460 
sources secondary sources and again it's
it's<00:03:00.120> there<00:03:00.390> it's<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.750> time<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.319> have

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
it's there it's the time that you have

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890 
it's there it's the time that you have
to<00:03:01.500> develop<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.280> sort<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.700> spirit<00:03:03.630> with<00:03:03.780> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
to develop and sort of spirit with the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.410 
to develop and sort of spirit with the
group<00:03:04.080> again<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> small<00:03:05.700> group<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.180> know

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
group again with a small group you know

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.750 
group again with a small group you know
the<00:03:06.540> names<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.989> know<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> faces<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.800> this<00:03:08.640> is

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the names you know the faces and this is

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.400 
the names you know the faces and this is
very<00:03:08.940> roughly<00:03:09.269> how<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.450> degree<00:03:09.900> is

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
very roughly how the degree is

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.580 
very roughly how the degree is
structured<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:12.420> way<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.690> degree<00:03:12.959> works<00:03:13.380> in

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
structured the way the degree works in

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.650 
structured the way the degree works in
total<00:03:13.920> again<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.430> perhaps<00:03:14.790> saying<00:03:15.180> they're

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
total again is perhaps saying they're

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.690 
total again is perhaps saying they're
two<00:03:15.930> distinct<00:03:16.350> phases<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.920> upon<00:03:17.370> us<00:03:17.400> for<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
two distinct phases this upon us for the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.970 
two distinct phases this upon us for the
first<00:03:17.910> two<00:03:18.090> years<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:18.690> honors<00:03:19.110> for<00:03:19.799> year

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
first two years and then honors for year

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.610 
first two years and then honors for year
three<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.430> four<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.299> again<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.320> think<00:03:22.380> one<00:03:22.590> of

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
three and four and again I think one of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.410 
three and four and again I think one of
the<00:03:22.769> strains<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.400> slightly<00:03:24.030> longer

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the strains of that slightly longer

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.880 
the strains of that slightly longer
compared<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.110> English<00:03:25.440> system<00:03:25.590> that's

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
compared to the English system that's

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.710 
compared to the English system that's
likely<00:03:26.070> longer<00:03:26.489> degree<00:03:26.790> we<00:03:27.269> have<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.420> fourth

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
likely longer degree we have a fourth

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.420 
likely longer degree we have a fourth
year<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.350> throughout<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.799> first<00:03:29.250> two

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
year is that throughout the first two

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.490 
year is that throughout the first two
years<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:29.910> upon<00:03:30.239> us<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:31.049> have<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.200> quite

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
years it's upon us you have a quite

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.940 
years it's upon us you have a quite
broad<00:03:32.070> range<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:33.140> choosing<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.320> dipping<00:03:34.769> into

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
broad range of choosing and dipping into

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.940 
broad range of choosing and dipping into
a<00:03:35.579> subject<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.390> for<00:03:36.600> instance<00:03:36.959> we<00:03:37.590> do<00:03:37.769> get

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
a subject so for instance we do get

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.699 
a subject so for instance we do get
quite<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> lot<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> students<00:03:38.940> who<00:03:39.650> may<00:03:40.650> think

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
quite a lot of students who may think

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.229 
quite a lot of students who may think
initially<00:03:41.310> they<00:03:41.400> just<00:03:41.610> come<00:03:41.820> in<00:03:41.850> for<00:03:42.120> one

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
initially they just come in for one

initially they just come in for one
module<00:03:42.680> let's<00:03:43.680> say<00:03:43.799> module<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.430> second

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060

but that is the beauty of the first two
years<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.390> basically<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:58.049> a

years that you basically you have a
broad<00:03:58.350> range<00:03:58.590> where<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.100> can<00:03:59.280> try<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.299> see

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
broad range where you can try and see

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.990 
broad range where you can try and see
and<00:04:01.019> find<00:04:01.320> your<00:04:01.709> way<00:04:01.890> into<00:04:02.160> st.<00:04:02.489> Andrews<00:04:02.820> for

degree that you can study you can also

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.450 
degree that you can study you can also
specialize<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:27.690> Scottish<00:04:28.290> history<00:04:28.320> or<00:04:28.890> Middle

specialize in Scottish history or Middle
Eastern<00:04:29.820> Studies<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.830> those<00:04:31.980> are<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.160> five

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
Eastern Studies so those are the five

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.600 
Eastern Studies so those are the five
different<00:04:32.790> degrees<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.570> we<00:04:33.750> offer<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.740> then

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
different degrees that we offer and then

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.120 
different degrees that we offer and then
there's<00:04:35.820> also<00:04:36.000> variety<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:36.900> whether<00:04:37.440> or<00:04:37.830> not

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
there's also variety and whether or not

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.480 
there's also variety and whether or not
you<00:04:38.280> want<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.670> specialise<00:04:39.210> let's<00:04:39.780> say<00:04:39.960> in

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
you want to specialise let's say in

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.910 
you want to specialise let's say in
history<00:04:41.490> or<00:04:41.730> single<00:04:42.630> honours<00:04:42.800> modern<00:04:43.800> or

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.220 
medieval history or whether you prefer
to<00:04:46.230> combine<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.860> with<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.370> different<00:04:47.490> subject<00:04:48.230> a

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
to combine is with a different subject a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.580 
to combine is with a different subject a
very<00:04:50.040> popular<00:04:50.460> choice<00:04:50.640> is<00:04:50.970> doing<00:04:51.540> history<00:04:52.410> of

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
very popular choice is doing history of

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.440 
very popular choice is doing history of
modern<00:04:52.740> history<00:04:53.160> with<00:04:53.340> I<00:04:53.520> our<00:04:53.820> international

combination<00:04:57.270> with<00:04:57.420> one<00:04:57.600> of<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.810> history

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
combination with one of the history

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.570 
combination with one of the history
degrees<00:04:58.380> is<00:04:58.590> also<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> very<00:04:59.130> popular<00:04:59.340> choice

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
degrees is also a very popular choice

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.400 
degrees is also a very popular choice
and<00:05:00.000> again<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.270> gives<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.660> broad<00:05:00.900> variety

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
and again it gives you the broad variety

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.300 
and again it gives you the broad variety
of<00:05:02.660> how<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.720> wish<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.050> combine<00:05:04.380> different

of how you wish to combine different
degree<00:05:05.550> elements<00:05:06.110> in<00:05:07.110> terms<00:05:07.290> of<00:05:07.500> getting<00:05:07.800> you

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
degree elements in terms of getting you

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.670 
degree elements in terms of getting you
a<00:05:08.010> perhaps<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.400> better<00:05:08.790> idea<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.210> what<00:05:09.960> sangun

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
a perhaps a better idea of what sangun

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.870 
a perhaps a better idea of what sangun
was<00:05:10.830> can<00:05:11.010> often<00:05:11.340> what<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:11.610> history

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
was can often what the history

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.120 
was can often what the history
department<00:05:12.300> can<00:05:12.420> offer<00:05:12.570> yes<00:05:13.260> perhaps<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.860> the

department can offer yes perhaps the the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.430 
department can offer yes perhaps the the
degree<00:05:14.430> comes<00:05:14.760> first<00:05:15.090> but<00:05:15.330> beyond<00:05:15.660> this<00:05:15.840> there

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
degree comes first but beyond this there

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.810 
degree comes first but beyond this there
is<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.560> history<00:05:16.830> society<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:18.870> offers<00:05:19.610> even<00:05:20.610> a

is a history society that offers even a

is a history society that offers even a
broader<00:05:21.090> let's<00:05:21.720> say<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:22.080> social<00:05:22.560> aspect<00:05:23.100> beyond

broader let's say a social aspect beyond
the<00:05:24.570> more<00:05:24.750> narrow<00:05:24.930> at<00:05:25.260> curriculum

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
the more narrow at curriculum

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.850 
the more narrow at curriculum
requirements<00:05:26.330> then<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.510> course<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:28.710> again

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
requirements then of course and again

requirements then of course and again
perhaps<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.460> comes<00:05:29.670> back<00:05:29.850> to<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.090> very<00:05:30.360> small

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
perhaps it comes back to the very small

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.890 
perhaps it comes back to the very small
student<00:05:32.640> numbers<00:05:32.970> that<00:05:33.060> we<00:05:33.180> have<00:05:33.360> in<00:05:33.480> classes

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
student numbers that we have in classes

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.290 
student numbers that we have in classes
that<00:05:33.930> by<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:34.980> time<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:35.490> move<00:05:35.670> on<00:05:35.790> to<00:05:36.000> honors

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
that by the time you move on to honors

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.060 
that by the time you move on to honors
into<00:05:36.540> third<00:05:36.780> or<00:05:36.990> fourth<00:05:37.230> year<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.530> know<00:05:37.860> your

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
into third or fourth year you know your

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.450 
into third or fourth year you know your
peers<00:05:38.340> it's<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.330> small<00:05:39.600> place<00:05:40.040> you<00:05:41.040> bump<00:05:41.250> into

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
peers it's a small place you bump into

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.370 
peers it's a small place you bump into
each<00:05:41.610> other<00:05:41.760> also<00:05:42.150> beyond<00:05:43.020> classroom

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
each other also beyond classroom

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.560 
each other also beyond classroom
activity<00:05:44.220> so<00:05:44.460> I<00:05:44.490> think<00:05:44.760> again<00:05:45.000> this<00:05:45.210> is<00:05:45.270> one

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
activity so I think again this is one

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.140 
activity so I think again this is one
aspect<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:46.170> makes<00:05:46.380> st.<00:05:46.860> Andrew's<00:05:47.160> special

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
aspect that makes st. Andrew's special

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.710 
aspect that makes st. Andrew's special
and<00:05:48.420> it<00:05:49.230> does<00:05:49.410> feed<00:05:49.680> into<00:05:49.950> overall<00:05:50.280> a<00:05:51.030> very

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
and it does feed into overall a very

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.720 
and it does feed into overall a very
high<00:05:51.900> student<00:05:52.320> satisfaction<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:53.010> we<00:05:53.130> get

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
high student satisfaction that we get

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.120 
high student satisfaction that we get
back<00:05:53.880> from<00:05:54.060> feedback<00:05:54.770> so<00:05:55.770> where<00:05:55.920> would<00:05:56.040> you

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
back from feedback so where would you

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.770 
back from feedback so where would you
end<00:05:56.280> up<00:05:56.400> after<00:05:56.580> four<00:05:56.910> years<00:05:56.940> at<00:05:57.270> st.<00:05:57.510> Andrews
