Great Scott what we rip the fuel line
and<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> cast<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.520> leaking<00:01:20.910> out<00:01:21.710> okay<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.920> just

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and the cast is leaking out okay we just

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.590 
and the cast is leaking out okay we just
need<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.490> get<00:01:23.640> some<00:01:24.000> gas<00:01:24.360> station<00:01:25.250> Marty<00:01:26.250> its

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
need to get some gas station Marty its

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
need to get some gas station Marty its
1885<00:01:27.600> there<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.410> no<00:01:28.620> gas<00:01:28.890> stations<00:01:29.400> or<00:01:29.580> even

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
1885 there are no gas stations or even

1885 there are no gas stations or even
cars<00:01:31.280> why<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:32.850> gas<00:01:33.150> anyway<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.050> have

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
cars why do we need gas anyway you have

cars why do we need gas anyway you have
that<00:01:34.290> new<00:01:34.470> machine<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.890> makes<00:01:35.310> energy<00:01:35.610> out

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that new machine that makes energy out

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
that new machine that makes energy out
of<00:01:36.060> garbage<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:37.470> machine<00:01:37.890> only<00:01:38.070> powers<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
of garbage the machine only powers the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.270 
of garbage the machine only powers the

has there's not going to be a gas
station<00:01:46.230> around<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.860> until<00:01:46.980> sometime<00:01:47.520> in

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
station around here until sometime in

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.330 
station around here until sometime in
the<00:01:47.700> next<00:01:47.970> century<00:01:48.150> without<00:01:49.050> gasoline<00:01:49.340> we

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the next century without gasoline we

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.610 
the next century without gasoline we
can't<00:01:50.670> get<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> car<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.420> 88<00:01:52.050> miles<00:01:52.290> per

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
can't get the car up to 88 miles per

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.810 
can't get the car up to 88 miles per
hour<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.510> do<00:01:55.400> well<00:01:56.400> for<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.760> we

hour so what do we do well for now we

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.640 
hour so what do we do well for now we
can<00:01:57.150> hide<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.360> car<00:01:57.510> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.900> chaos<00:01:58.230> all<00:01:58.440> back

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
can hide the car in the chaos all back

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:09.600 
can hide the car in the chaos all back
there<00:01:58.950> then<00:01:59.820> we'll<00:01:59.970> walk<00:02:00.150> into<00:02:00.300> town

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.900

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that we're here to see the clock tower

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.560 
that we're here to see the clock tower
constructed<00:02:15.220> must<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.850> coincidence<00:02:16.180> that

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
constructed must be a coincidence that

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.900 
constructed must be a coincidence that
we<00:02:16.780> were<00:02:16.930> sent<00:02:17.200> back<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.440> this<00:02:17.740> year<00:02:18.100> or<00:02:18.670> maybe

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
what if we invented gas no good Marty I

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.150 
what if we invented gas no good Marty I
would<00:03:00.300> need<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.540> lab<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.050> create<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:01.980> it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
would need a lab to create it in and it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.490 
would need a lab to create it in and it
could<00:03:02.340> take<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> while<00:03:03.020> maybe<00:03:04.020> we<00:03:04.200> could<00:03:04.380> roll

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
could take a while maybe we could roll

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.370 
could take a while maybe we could roll
it<00:03:04.620> down<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.800> steep<00:03:05.069> hill<00:03:05.330> no<00:03:06.330> we'd<00:03:06.840> never<00:03:06.989> find

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
it down a steep hill no we'd never find

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.140 
it down a steep hill no we'd never find
a<00:03:07.440> smoother<00:03:07.830> surface<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:09.920> know<00:03:10.920> we<00:03:11.700> could<00:03:11.850> pull

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
a smoother surface I know we could pull

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.430 
a smoother surface I know we could pull
with<00:03:12.360> horses<00:03:13.700> no<00:03:14.840> horses<00:03:15.840> can't<00:03:16.080> pull<00:03:16.290> that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
with horses no horses can't pull that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.180 
with horses no horses can't pull that
much<00:03:16.620> weight<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.950> fast<00:03:17.989> but<00:03:18.989> if<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:20.010> could

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
much weight that fast but if we could

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.070 
much weight that fast but if we could
somehow<00:03:20.520> push<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.390> up<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.600> 88<00:03:22.470> miles<00:03:22.709> per<00:03:23.010> hour

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
somehow push it up to 88 miles per hour

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.640 
somehow push it up to 88 miles per hour
