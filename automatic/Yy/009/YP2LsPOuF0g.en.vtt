00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
how do you see it well first off gold

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
how do you see it well first off gold
has<00:01:51.720> come<00:01:51.960> back<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.500> bit<00:01:52.950> from<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.369> we

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
has come back a little bit from what we

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.060 
has come back a little bit from what we
call<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> little<00:01:55.530> bump<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.950> we've

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
call a you know a little bump that we've

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.310 
call a you know a little bump that we've
seen<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> price<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.049> again

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
seen in the in the price and that again

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
seen in the in the price and that again
is<00:01:58.350> related<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.159> Ukraine<00:01:59.759> as<00:01:59.939> well<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.240> to

is related to the Ukraine as well as to
Greece<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.899> think<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.890> impact<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.000> out<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
Greece I think that impact is now out of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.649 
Greece I think that impact is now out of
the<00:02:03.390> market<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.700> ceasefire<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.540> know

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
the market the ceasefire you know

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
the market the ceasefire you know
touchwood<00:02:07.170> seems<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.740> holding<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
touchwood seems to be holding in in the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.470 
touchwood seems to be holding in in the
Ukraine<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:10.370> Greece<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.580> EU<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.030> made<00:02:12.239> peace

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
Ukraine and Greece and EU of made peace

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.119 
Ukraine and Greece and EU of made peace
so<00:02:12.660> gold<00:02:12.870> has<00:02:13.020> kind<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.319> come<00:02:13.500> back<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.920> around

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
so gold has kind of come back to around

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.449 
so gold has kind of come back to around
this<00:02:14.540> 1212<00:02:15.540> 10<00:02:15.870> level<00:02:16.170> which<00:02:16.560> our<00:02:16.800> models<00:02:17.220> tell

with<00:02:20.129> respect<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.670> looking<00:02:20.970> forward<00:02:21.510> we

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
with respect to looking forward we

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.619 
with respect to looking forward we
personally<00:02:22.560> think<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:24.060> gold<00:02:24.330> market

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
personally think that the gold market

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.339 
personally think that the gold market
basically<00:02:25.349> got<00:02:26.010> ahead<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.310> itself<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.140> 2013<00:02:28.140> in

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
basically got ahead of itself in 2013 in

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.790 
basically got ahead of itself in 2013 in
the<00:02:28.890> taper<00:02:29.250> tantrum<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.569> we<00:02:30.780> saw<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> real

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
the taper tantrum and we saw the real

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the moment so all of that I put together

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.729 
the moment so all of that I put together
and<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.180> say<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.659> what<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.050> think<00:03:04.110> people

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
have more or less discounted not nobody

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.790 
have more or less discounted not nobody
at<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.310> point<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:09.120> be<00:03:09.180> surprised<00:03:09.750> when<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
at this point can be surprised when the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.699 
at this point can be surprised when the
Fed<00:03:11.010> raises<00:03:11.280> rates<00:03:11.489> 25<00:03:12.300> basis<00:03:12.780> point<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.290> by

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
Fed raises rates 25 basis point and by

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.059 
Fed raises rates 25 basis point and by
the<00:03:13.769> way<00:03:14.010> what<00:03:14.879> is<00:03:14.909> 25<00:03:15.450> basis<00:03:15.959> points<00:03:16.319> I<00:03:16.500> mean

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
the way what is 25 basis points I mean

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.360 
the way what is 25 basis points I mean
it's<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.400> an<00:03:17.640> absolute<00:03:18.450> nothing<00:03:19.370> with

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
it's like an absolute nothing with

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.030 
it's like an absolute nothing with
respect<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.909> impact<00:03:21.330> on<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.690> US<00:03:21.840> economy<00:03:22.110> so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
respect to impact on the US economy so

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.750 
respect to impact on the US economy so
it's<00:03:23.159> really<00:03:23.340> an<00:03:23.550> announcement<00:03:24.269> effect<00:03:24.629> and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
it's really an announcement effect and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.430 
it's really an announcement effect and
we<00:03:26.760> think<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.330> market<00:03:27.720> has<00:03:27.750> discounted

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
we think that the market has discounted

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.910 
we think that the market has discounted
it<00:03:28.849> and<00:03:29.849> how<00:03:30.780> about<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:31.019> we<00:03:31.080> look<00:03:31.349> at<00:03:31.470> central

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
it and how about if we look at central

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.699 
it and how about if we look at central
bank<00:03:32.159> policies<00:03:32.909> globally<00:03:33.540> now<00:03:33.720> doesn't<00:03:34.500> seem

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
bank policies globally now doesn't seem

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.920 
bank policies globally now doesn't seem

by the Swiss which really caught

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.030 
seen as well we've seen gold go up
against<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.570> euro<00:04:18.780> gold<00:04:19.290> was<00:04:19.470> gone<00:04:19.500> up<00:04:19.680> a

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
against the euro gold was gone up a

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.860 
against the euro gold was gone up a
little<00:04:20.430> bit<00:04:20.549> against<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.880> R&amp;B<00:04:21.269> gold<00:04:21.690> has<00:04:21.840> gone

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
little bit against the R&amp;B gold has gone

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.189 
little bit against the R&amp;B gold has gone
up<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.290> lot<00:04:22.320> against<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.889> ruble<00:04:23.220> etc<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:25.110> now

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
up a lot against the ruble etc so now

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.480 
up a lot against the ruble etc so now
the<00:04:25.320> question<00:04:25.350> really<00:04:25.979> is<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:27.690> Fed<00:04:27.949> okay<00:04:28.949> now

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
the question really is the Fed okay now

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.969 
the question really is the Fed okay now
it's<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.940> thesis<00:04:30.419> of<00:04:30.449> ours<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.169> gold<00:04:31.620> could

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
it's a thesis of ours that gold could

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.029 
it's a thesis of ours that gold could
actually<00:04:32.220> rise<00:04:32.850> against<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.720> dollar<00:04:34.039> even

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
actually rise against the dollar even

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.210 
actually rise against the dollar even
though<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:36.690> dollar<00:04:36.960> rises<00:04:37.320> against<00:04:38.010> other

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
though the dollar rises against other

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.830 
though the dollar rises against other
currencies<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.180> way<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.479> would<00:04:39.630> come

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
currencies and the way that would come

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.550 
currencies and the way that would come
about<00:04:40.110> is<00:04:40.350> if<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.979> Fed<00:04:41.250> stays<00:04:41.639> loose<00:04:42.289> but<00:04:43.289> just

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
about is if the Fed stays loose but just

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.730 
about is if the Fed stays loose but just
not<00:04:43.740> as<00:04:43.949> loose<00:04:44.190> as<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.970> other<00:04:45.150> central<00:04:45.630> banks

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
not as loose as the other central banks

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.320 
not as loose as the other central banks
okay<00:04:46.740> that's<00:04:46.949> kind<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.460> actually<00:04:47.610> what<00:04:47.970> we<00:04:48.120> saw

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
okay that's kind of actually what we saw

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.300 
okay that's kind of actually what we saw
last<00:04:48.360> year<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> little<00:04:49.229> bit<00:04:49.470> we<00:04:49.770> saw<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.010> gold

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
last year a little bit we saw a gold

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.400 
last year a little bit we saw a gold
pretty<00:04:50.610> flat<00:04:51.000> against<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.539> dollar<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:52.110> mean<00:04:52.260> on

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
pretty flat against the dollar I mean on

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.680 
pretty flat against the dollar I mean on
an<00:04:52.560> exact<00:04:52.949> year<00:04:53.250> end<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.580> year-end<00:04:53.789> basis<00:04:54.330> it

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
an exact year end to year-end basis it

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.390 
an exact year end to year-end basis it
declined<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:55.289> over<00:04:55.530> one<00:04:55.710> percent<00:04:56.100> against

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
declined just over one percent against

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.070 
declined just over one percent against
the<00:04:56.490> US<00:04:56.729> dollar<00:04:56.760> but<00:04:57.449> it<00:04:57.510> went<00:04:57.660> up<00:04:57.750> against

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
the US dollar but it went up against

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.710 
the US dollar but it went up against
every<00:04:58.350> other<00:04:58.470> currency<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.729> our<00:04:59.910> forecast<00:05:00.539> is

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
every other currency so our forecast is

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.719 
every other currency so our forecast is
actually<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.320> gold<00:05:01.500> will<00:05:01.800> go<00:05:01.979> up<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.280> little

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
actually the gold will go up a little

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.909 
actually the gold will go up a little
bit<00:05:02.910> against<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.570> US<00:05:03.870> dollar<00:05:03.900> because<00:05:04.650> the

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
bit against the US dollar because the

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.310 
bit against the US dollar because the
Fed<00:05:05.100> isn't<00:05:05.490> really<00:05:05.880> going<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.330> tighten<00:05:06.780> in<00:05:06.960> any

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
Fed isn't really going to tighten in any

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.060 
Fed isn't really going to tighten in any
significant<00:05:08.130> manner<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:09.530> it's<00:05:10.530> going<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.860> go

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
significant manner and it's going to go

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.250 
significant manner and it's going to go
up<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.700> much<00:05:11.940> more<00:05:12.240> against<00:05:13.110> other

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
up that much more against other

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.400 
up that much more against other
currencies<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:14.220> guess<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.419> wrap<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.930> mentioned

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410

think about so to the retail investor I
say<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.940> know<00:05:51.060> start<00:05:51.510> thinking<00:05:51.870> about<00:05:51.990> dollar

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.730 
stay with it I was out of the resource
sector<00:06:00.419> for<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:00.780> number<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.110> years<00:06:01.229> and<00:06:01.650> I'm

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.370 
sector for a number of years and I'm
myself<00:06:02.360> averaging<00:06:03.360> back<00:06:03.510> into<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:03.990> readings

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
myself averaging back into the readings

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.200 
myself averaging back into the readings
we're<00:06:04.710> at<00:06:04.770> a<00:06:04.800> bottom<00:06:05.280> I<00:06:05.490> think<00:06:05.910> we're<00:06:06.060> at<00:06:06.180> a

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
we're at a bottom I think we're at a

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.839 
we're at a bottom I think we're at a
bottom<00:06:06.599> now<00:06:06.750> that<00:06:06.930> doesn't<00:06:07.139> mean<00:06:07.440> that<00:06:08.130> we're

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
bottom now that doesn't mean that we're

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.420 
bottom now that doesn't mean that we're
at<00:06:09.000> a<00:06:09.030> bottom<00:06:09.479> like<00:06:09.830> nothing<00:06:10.830> will<00:06:11.010> go<00:06:11.159> lower

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
at a bottom like nothing will go lower

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.850 
at a bottom like nothing will go lower
than<00:06:11.580> right<00:06:12.000> here

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
than right here

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.980 
than right here
but<00:06:13.099> you<00:06:13.520> know<00:06:13.639> when<00:06:14.120> we<00:06:14.240> when<00:06:14.509> we<00:06:14.539> look<00:06:14.840> at

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
but you know when we when we look at

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.499 
but you know when we when we look at
backwards<00:06:15.770> two<00:06:16.039> years<00:06:16.310> from<00:06:16.520> now<00:06:16.759> I<00:06:17.000> think

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
backwards two years from now I think

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.399 
backwards two years from now I think
we'll<00:06:17.689> say<00:06:17.870> hey<00:06:18.080> the<00:06:18.409> bottom<00:06:18.800> was<00:06:19.780> 2015<00:06:20.780> there

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
we'll say hey the bottom was 2015 there

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:23.439 
we'll say hey the bottom was 2015 there
