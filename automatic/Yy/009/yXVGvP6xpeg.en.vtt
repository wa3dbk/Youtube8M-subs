more often place to find answers some
churches<00:00:25.990> are<00:00:26.380> not<00:00:26.770> relevant<00:00:27.100> to<00:00:27.310> today's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
churches are not relevant to today's

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.310 
churches are not relevant to today's
society<00:00:28.029> like<00:00:28.570> it's<00:00:28.690> not<00:00:28.720> really<00:00:28.869> updated

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
society like it's not really updated

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.570 
society like it's not really updated
with<00:00:29.529> nowaday<00:00:29.860> time<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.310> stuff<00:00:30.430> like<00:00:30.520> that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
with nowaday time and stuff like that

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.880 
with nowaday time and stuff like that
everybody's<00:00:31.210> too<00:00:31.420> worried<00:00:31.720> about<00:00:31.890> skipping

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
everybody's too worried about skipping

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.860 
everybody's too worried about skipping
on<00:00:33.070> somebody<00:00:33.370> else's<00:00:33.760> toes<00:00:34.030> it's<00:00:34.510> the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
on somebody else's toes it's the

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.570 
on somebody else's toes it's the
declining<00:00:35.290> role<00:00:35.590> or<00:00:35.770> a<00:00:35.800> negative<00:00:35.980> role<00:00:36.340> now

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
declining role or a negative role now

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.369 
declining role or a negative role now
and<00:00:36.910> that's<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.420> guess<00:00:37.480> is<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.870> church<00:00:38.140> leader

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
and that's I guess is a church leader

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.530 
and that's I guess is a church leader
that's<00:00:38.680> partly<00:00:39.220> my<00:00:39.309> fault<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.970> church<00:00:40.210> plays

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
that's partly my fault the church plays

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.960 
that's partly my fault the church plays
a<00:00:40.570> huge<00:00:41.110> role<00:00:41.290> in<00:00:41.530> our<00:00:41.770> culture<00:00:42.040> it<00:00:42.579> impacts

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
a huge role in our culture it impacts

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.810 
a huge role in our culture it impacts
everything<00:00:43.600> on<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.079> economy<00:00:44.380> on<00:00:44.800> politics<00:00:45.610> on

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
everything on the economy on politics on

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.729 
everything on the economy on politics on
everything<00:00:46.239> i<00:00:46.480> think<00:00:46.989> that<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.320> churches<00:00:47.620> are

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
everything i think that the churches are

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.770 
everything i think that the churches are
too<00:00:47.890> much<00:00:48.420> separated<00:00:49.420> by<00:00:49.600> their

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
too much separated by their

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.479 
too much separated by their
denominations<00:00:50.410> it<00:00:50.590> is<00:00:50.680> relevant<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.130> culture

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
denominations it is relevant to culture

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.090 
denominations it is relevant to culture
but<00:00:51.670> not<00:00:52.300> particularly<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:53.020> mine<00:00:53.200> all<00:00:53.710> people

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
but not particularly to mine all people

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.260 
but not particularly to mine all people
whether<00:00:54.219> they<00:00:54.460> had<00:00:54.550> been<00:00:54.730> is<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.879> lot<00:00:55.120> of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
whether they had been is a lot of

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.910 
whether they had been is a lot of
reaching<00:00:55.570> out<00:00:55.690> for<00:00:55.899> religion<00:00:56.320> at<00:00:56.410> one<00:00:56.559> form<00:00:56.800> or

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
reaching out for religion at one form or

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.910 
reaching out for religion at one form or
another<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.460> think<00:00:57.879> that<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.120> Bible<00:00:58.920> they've

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
another I think that the Bible they've

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.619 
another I think that the Bible they've
got<00:01:00.100> some<00:01:00.250> good<00:01:00.280> editors<00:01:00.760> in<00:01:00.940> there<00:01:01.090> I<00:01:01.210> grew<00:01:01.570> up

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
got some good editors in there I grew up

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.619 
got some good editors in there I grew up
and<00:01:01.899> I<00:01:02.020> still<00:01:02.289> believe<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:03.039> Bible<00:01:03.219> is<00:01:03.640> a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
and I still believe that the Bible is a

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.080 
and I still believe that the Bible is a
very<00:01:05.170> important<00:01:05.770> written<00:01:06.460> historical

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
very important written historical

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.529 
very important written historical
document<00:01:07.630> I<00:01:07.780> don't<00:01:08.020> think<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:09.300> word<00:01:10.300> for

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
document I don't think that word for

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.690 
document I don't think that word for
word<00:01:10.690> its<00:01:10.960> truth<00:01:11.289> the<00:01:11.700> interpretation

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
word its truth the interpretation

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.270 
word its truth the interpretation
changes<00:01:13.330> as<00:01:13.569> you're<00:01:13.780> ready<00:01:13.959> to<00:01:14.229> accept<00:01:14.619> that<00:01:14.920> a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
changes as you're ready to accept that a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.020 
changes as you're ready to accept that a
lot<00:01:15.789> of<00:01:15.910> it<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.209> not<00:01:17.039> geared<00:01:18.039> to<00:01:18.340> today's<00:01:18.640> world

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
lot of it is not geared to today's world

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.850 
lot of it is not geared to today's world
because<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.780> like<00:01:19.929> stories<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.470> told<00:01:20.679> down

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
because it's like stories just told down

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.990 
because it's like stories just told down
until<00:01:21.130> down<00:01:21.250> till<00:01:21.399> somebody<00:01:21.670> started<00:01:21.940> to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
until down till somebody started to

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.580 
until down till somebody started to
write<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.209> down<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.630> think<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.229> Bible<00:01:23.560> is

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
write it down I think the Bible is

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.320 
write it down I think the Bible is
relevant<00:01:24.009> and<00:01:24.130> not<00:01:24.670> only<00:01:24.819> the<00:01:24.910> American<00:01:25.179> coast

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
relevant and not only the American coast

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.820 
relevant and not only the American coast
with<00:01:25.479> all<00:01:25.569> other<00:01:25.750> cultures<00:01:26.140> still<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.649> number

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
with all other cultures still the number

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.499 
with all other cultures still the number
one<00:01:26.950> best-selling<00:01:27.459> book<00:01:27.970> in<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.179> world<00:01:28.330> I

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
one best-selling book in the world I

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.900 
one best-selling book in the world I
think<00:01:28.690> it<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:28.990> over<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:29.740> sometimes<00:01:30.580> i<00:01:30.849> think

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
think it so over so sometimes i think

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.790 
think it so over so sometimes i think
it's<00:01:31.270> being<00:01:31.660> challenged<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.319> lot<00:01:32.500> more<00:01:32.740> of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
it's being challenged a lot more of

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.390 
it's being challenged a lot more of
these<00:01:32.950> days<00:01:33.220> i<00:01:33.520> cannot<00:01:34.119> say<00:01:34.990> that

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.640 

being<00:01:38.090> lost<00:01:38.300> in<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.660> wilderness<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.290> eating

being lost in the wilderness and eating

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.090 
being lost in the wilderness and eating
bugs<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.390> relevant<00:01:41.390> for<00:01:41.450> me<00:01:41.690> when<00:01:42.620> people<00:01:42.950> say

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
bugs is relevant for me when people say

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.470 
bugs is relevant for me when people say
it's<00:01:43.280> not<00:01:43.460> relevant<00:01:43.700> because<00:01:44.060> they<00:01:44.300> don't

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
it's not relevant because they don't

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.360 
it's not relevant because they don't
read<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.870> whatever<00:01:45.290> situation<00:01:45.800> you<00:01:45.920> fall<00:01:46.130> into

read it whatever situation you fall into

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.220 
read it whatever situation you fall into
you<00:01:47.000> can<00:01:47.150> find<00:01:47.360> one<00:01:47.540> just<00:01:47.750> like<00:01:47.870> it<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.110> the

you can find one just like it in the
