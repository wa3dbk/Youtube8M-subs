00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.490 

must<00:02:24.820> be<00:02:24.970> something<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.600> museum<00:02:25.960> then<00:02:26.320> its

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
must be something in a museum then its

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.820 
must be something in a museum then its
arc<00:02:27.450> yeah<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.720> can<00:02:28.900> be<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.200> scribbles<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.800> a

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
arc yeah it can be like scribbles on a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.850 
arc yeah it can be like scribbles on a
paper<00:02:30.210> have<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.390> pictures<00:02:31.900> don't<00:02:32.650> think

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
paper have you pictures don't think

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.560 
paper have you pictures don't think
there's<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.100> line<00:02:33.280> people<00:02:34.090> take<00:02:34.420> away

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
there's a line people take away

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.650 
there's a line people take away
different<00:02:35.080> things<00:02:35.290> than<00:02:35.650> other<00:02:35.860> people<00:02:36.220> would

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
different things than other people would

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
different things than other people would
there<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.840> a<00:02:37.870> line<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.320> separates<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:40.680> it's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
there is a line that separates that it's

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.420 
there is a line that separates that it's
a<00:02:41.860> realistic<00:02:42.580> painting<00:02:44.250> anything<00:02:45.250> that's

a realistic painting anything that's

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.990 
a realistic painting anything that's

undefined is not classified as art no

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.630 
undefined is not classified as art no
sense<00:02:49.330> there<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> line<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:51.160> line<00:02:51.310> isn't

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
sense there is a line the line isn't

if<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.060> take<00:02:58.240> into<00:02:58.390> consideration<00:02:59.110> reason

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680

but in turn determines what is

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
considered art and what is it and

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.390 
considered art and what is it and

there could not be a universal line also
language<00:03:17.709> creates<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.250> confusion<00:03:18.670> about<00:03:19.180> what

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040

photography triggers emotion and is an

photography triggers emotion and is an

trigger emotions but not necessarily in
an<00:03:40.780> autistic<00:03:41.080> way<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.900> if<00:03:43.989> you<00:03:44.110> say<00:03:44.380> art

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
an autistic way but if you say art

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.729 
an autistic way but if you say art
triggers<00:03:45.130> emotion<00:03:45.930> then<00:03:46.930> how<00:03:47.140> could<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.500> say

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
triggers emotion then how could you say

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.940 
triggers emotion then how could you say
that<00:03:48.150> photography<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.420> any<00:03:49.690> less<00:03:49.989> than<00:03:50.350> than

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
that photography is any less than than

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.820 
that photography is any less than than
the<00:03:51.040> other<00:03:51.190> forms<00:03:51.580> I<00:03:52.320> guess<00:03:53.320> that's<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:53.620> my

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
the other forms I guess that's just my

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.710 
the other forms I guess that's just my
personal<00:03:54.250> opinion

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.760 

art<00:03:59.720> people<00:04:00.580> yeah<00:04:01.580> our<00:04:02.210> judges<00:04:04.240> anyone<00:04:05.240> I

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
art people yeah our judges anyone I

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.280 
art people yeah our judges anyone I
would<00:04:06.770> say<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.040> artist<00:04:07.400> decides<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:08.290> art

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
would say the artist decides the art

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.200 
would say the artist decides the art
critics<00:04:09.830> have<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.160> right<00:04:10.340> to<00:04:10.490> determine<00:04:10.640> what

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
critics have the right to determine what

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.410 
critics have the right to determine what
art<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:12.220> could<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.340> tell<00:04:13.610> me<00:04:13.640> what<00:04:13.880> qualifies

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
art is could you tell me what qualifies

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.220 
art is could you tell me what qualifies
you<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.780> judge<00:04:15.200> art<00:04:15.530> rather<00:04:15.920> than<00:04:16.070> me<00:04:17.230> well

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
you to judge art rather than me well

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.740 
you to judge art rather than me well
it's<00:04:18.410> simple<00:04:18.799> really<00:04:18.980> I've<00:04:19.730> got<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.420> proper

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
it's simple really I've got the proper

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.770 
it's simple really I've got the proper
training<00:04:24.250> what<00:04:25.250> does<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:25.430> mean<00:04:25.790> what<00:04:26.630> is

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
training what does that mean what is

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.590 
training what does that mean what is
proper<00:04:27.050> training<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:28.760> means<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.330> can

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
proper training it means that I can

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.240 
proper training it means that I can
decide<00:04:29.900> whether<00:04:30.140> artists<00:04:30.590> make<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:31.040> or<00:04:31.190> break

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
decide whether artists make it or break

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.530 
decide whether artists make it or break
it<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:32.060> have<00:04:32.990> an<00:04:33.080> understanding<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.920> art<00:04:34.160> that

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
it I have an understanding of art that

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.440 
it I have an understanding of art that
is<00:04:35.540> far<00:04:35.990> deeper<00:04:36.230> than<00:04:36.500> others<00:04:37.450> proper

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
is far deeper than others proper

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.420 
is far deeper than others proper
training<00:04:38.660> simply<00:04:39.170> means<00:04:39.380> I've<00:04:39.620> studied<00:04:40.130> art

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
training simply means I've studied art

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.460 
training simply means I've studied art
for<00:04:40.610> many<00:04:40.760> years<00:04:41.120> they<00:04:41.690> understand<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.320> on<00:04:42.440> a

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
for many years they understand it on a

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.670 
for many years they understand it on a
deeper<00:04:42.800> level<00:04:43.780> don't<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.900> think<00:04:45.080> that<00:04:45.200> anyone

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
deeper level don't you think that anyone

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.879 
deeper level don't you think that anyone
is<00:04:45.800> capable<00:04:45.980> of<00:04:46.670> deciding<00:04:47.300> what<00:04:47.540> art<00:04:47.720> is<00:04:47.870> nope

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.550 

so<00:04:52.490> what<00:04:52.759> are<00:04:52.909> the<00:04:53.030> knowledge<00:04:53.360> issues<00:04:53.719> if<00:04:54.409> we

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
