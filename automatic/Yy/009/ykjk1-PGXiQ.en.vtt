Gundam collection as he spins around
here<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.439> he's<00:00:28.590> looking<00:00:28.800> pretty

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
here and I think he's looking pretty

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.679 
here and I think he's looking pretty
cool<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:29.849> problem<00:00:30.119> being<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.510> it

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
cool the only problem being is that it

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.690 
cool the only problem being is that it
cost<00:00:30.869> 1200<00:00:31.439> yen<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> guy<00:00:32.189> who<00:00:32.250> looks

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
cost 1200 yen to get a guy who looks

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.479 
cost 1200 yen to get a guy who looks
like<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.620> compared<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> h1<00:00:35.100> normal<00:00:35.399> in

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
like this compared to the h1 normal in

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
like this compared to the h1 normal in
the<00:00:35.579> h1<00:00:35.730> Titus<00:00:36.300> were<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.809> same<00:00:37.020> price

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the h1 Titus were for the same price

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
the h1 Titus were for the same price
you're<00:00:37.530> getting<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.800> lot<00:00:38.010> more<00:00:38.040> parts<00:00:38.579> I'm

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
you're getting a lot more parts I'm

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.610 
you're getting a lot more parts I'm
talking<00:00:39.030> shields<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.629> beam<00:00:39.780> ripe<00:00:40.079> weapons

talking shields and beam ripe weapons
and<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.190> whole<00:00:41.399> plate<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.670> effect<00:00:42.030> parts<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> the

and a whole plate of effect parts in the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.479 
and a whole plate of effect parts in the
case<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> Titus<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.890> guy<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.340> seems

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
case of the Titus this guy just seems

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
case of the Titus this guy just seems
like<00:00:44.670> he's<00:00:44.910> lacking<00:00:45.239> weapons<00:00:45.930> accessories

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
like he's lacking weapons accessories

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
like he's lacking weapons accessories
and<00:00:46.860> effect<00:00:47.190> parts<00:00:47.670> now<00:00:48.239> part<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and effect parts now part of that is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
and effect parts now part of that is
just<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.110> MS<00:00:49.410> design<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> seems<00:00:50.309> like

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
just the MS design but it seems like

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.069 
just the MS design but it seems like
there<00:00:50.670> could<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.000> smaller<00:00:51.390> price

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
there could be a smaller price

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
there could be a smaller price
difference<00:00:52.620> for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> plastic<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:54.000> you've<00:00:54.210> got

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
difference for the plastic if you've got

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.790 
difference for the plastic if you've got
an<00:00:54.449> extra<00:00:54.660> plate<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> Titus<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.559> see<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
an extra plate on the Titus I can see it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
an extra plate on the Titus I can see it
costing<00:00:56.129> more<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.270> doesn't

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
costing more but this one it doesn't

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.110 
costing more but this one it doesn't
seem<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.260> there's<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.500> reason<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.219> now

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
seem like there's a reason for it now

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
seem like there's a reason for it now
this<00:01:00.390> being<00:01:00.629> similar<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> other<00:01:01.410> age<00:01:01.770> ones

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
this being similar to the other age ones

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.170 
this being similar to the other age ones
of<00:01:02.489> course<00:01:02.520> you're<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.059> getting

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
of course you're going to be getting

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
of course you're going to be getting
some<00:01:03.329> repeats<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.019> head<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.350> should<00:01:04.559> expect

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
some repeats the head you should expect

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620 
some repeats the head you should expect
a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.700> bit<00:01:05.820> disappointed<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> chest

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
a little bit disappointed that the chest

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.450 
a little bit disappointed that the chest
is<00:01:06.780> exactly<00:01:07.260> identical<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.890> got<00:01:08.040> used<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is exactly identical I got used to the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.070 
is exactly identical I got used to the
Titus<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:08.820> having<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.659> bit<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
Titus just having that little bit of a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.859 
Titus just having that little bit of a
change<00:01:10.409> which<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.549> made<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.150> boring<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
change which just made it not boring to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.690 
change which just made it not boring to
put<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> together<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> get<00:01:14.580> into

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
put it together but when you get into

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
put it together but when you get into
things<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.090> poseability<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.200> why

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
things like poseability I don't see why

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.929 
things like poseability I don't see why
you'd<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.770> an<00:01:17.009> elbow<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.549> only<00:01:17.670> Bend

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939

a<00:01:27.360> lot<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.570> cool<00:01:28.229> poses<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.860> look<00:01:29.100> makes<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a lot of cool poses that look makes it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280 
a lot of cool poses that look makes it
look<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.150> elbows<00:01:30.450> being<00:01:30.750> broken

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
look like your elbows being broken

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
look like your elbows being broken
another<00:01:32.159> small<00:01:32.460> problem<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
another small problem was just if you

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.999 
another small problem was just if you
look<00:01:33.479> down<00:01:33.630> below<00:01:33.750> these<00:01:34.049> white<00:01:34.320> ankles<00:01:34.770> they

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
look down below these white ankles they

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
look down below these white ankles they
can<00:01:35.220> fall<00:01:35.490> off<00:01:35.520> pretty<00:01:36.000> easily<00:01:36.180> they<00:01:36.540> just

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
can fall off pretty easily they just

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
can fall off pretty easily they just
will<00:01:36.960> fall<00:01:37.229> down<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:38.159> you're<00:01:38.310> moving<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
will fall down when you're moving the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.399 
will fall down when you're moving the
ankles<00:01:39.000> around<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.960> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
ankles around and when they do that it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.230 
ankles around and when they do that it
just<00:01:40.890> seems<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.310> they're<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.490> attached<00:01:41.970> on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
just seems like they're not attached on

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240 
just seems like they're not attached on
as<00:01:42.479> well<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.290> should<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.649> no<00:01:43.890> problems

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
as well as they should be no problems

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.800 
as well as they should be no problems
though<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.850> wrists<00:01:45.180> or<00:01:45.299> those<00:01:45.450> extra

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
though with the wrists or those extra

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.050

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
color apps up there just down on the

feet<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.590> needle<00:01:49.860> guns<00:01:50.009> are<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> great<00:01:50.460> idea<00:01:50.759> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
feet the needle guns are a great idea I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
feet the needle guns are a great idea I
like<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.270> idea<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> Titus<00:01:52.110> being<00:01:52.320> able<00:01:52.409> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
like the idea of the Titus being able to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
like the idea of the Titus being able to
bash<00:01:52.799> people<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.490> effect<00:01:53.790> parts<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.180> his

Man 3 ish the only problem being is that
you're<00:02:00.780> hardly<00:02:01.049> ever<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> see<00:02:01.590> them

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you're hardly ever going to see them

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.170 
you're hardly ever going to see them
because<00:02:02.040> they're<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.430> small<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.030> have

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
because they're very small and you have

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.840 
because they're very small and you have
to<00:02:03.299> get<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> legs<00:02:03.780> at<00:02:04.079> such<00:02:04.710> an<00:02:04.860> angle<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.369> they

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
something like that or if they had been

something like that or if they had been

that you're more inclined to show off
when<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:15.930> brings<00:02:16.200> us<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.860> weapon<00:02:17.190> itself

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
when that brings us to the weapon itself

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.280 
when that brings us to the weapon itself
this<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> advanced<00:02:18.360> grade<00:02:18.630> sigil<00:02:19.080> blade

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
this is the advanced grade sigil blade

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.170 
this is the advanced grade sigil blade
I'm<00:02:19.710> still<00:02:20.190> calling<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.520> shingle<00:02:20.850> blade<00:02:21.000> not

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
I'm still calling the shingle blade not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.740 
I'm still calling the shingle blade not
the<00:02:21.300> sigil

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the sigil

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.320 
the sigil
but<00:02:22.320> anyway<00:02:22.620> you've<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.550> white<00:02:24.000> blade

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
but anyway you've got this white blade

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.970 
but anyway you've got this white blade
which<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.630> okay<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.290> get<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.800> color

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
which is okay you get the color

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.560 
which is okay you get the color
differentiation<00:02:26.790> because<00:02:26.910> you've<00:02:27.180> got<00:02:27.330> gray

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
differentiation because you've got gray

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.720 
differentiation because you've got gray
hands<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.140> it's<00:02:28.260> got<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> gray<00:02:28.680> handle<00:02:29.100> the

hands and it's got a gray handle the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.640 
hands and it's got a gray handle the
only<00:02:29.910> problem<00:02:30.210> being<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.930> get<00:02:31.110> used<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.500> some

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
only problem being you get used to some

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.410 
only problem being you get used to some
nice<00:02:31.830> clear<00:02:32.130> green<00:02:32.340> parts<00:02:32.790> or<00:02:32.940> if<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.300> had

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
nice clear green parts or if they had

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.210 
nice clear green parts or if they had
just<00:02:33.660> gone<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> plate<00:02:34.680> already<00:02:34.920> has<00:02:35.070> the

just gone the a plate already has the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.800 
just gone the a plate already has the
four<00:02:35.400> color<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.150> understand<00:02:36.540> them<00:02:36.660> not

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
four color so I can understand them not

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.750 
four color so I can understand them not
doing<00:02:36.990> something<00:02:37.440> else<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:38.250> even<00:02:38.520> with<00:02:38.640> the

for the blade as well that would have

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180 
for the blade as well that would have
bumped<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.600> price<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.260> me<00:02:49.380> up<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.680> 1200

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
I was a little bit worried about all

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.550 
I was a little bit worried about all
this<00:04:06.120> extra<00:04:06.390> white<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.080> arms<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.440> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
this extra white on the arms and the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.900 
this extra white on the arms and the
ankles<00:04:07.890> only<00:04:08.250> because<00:04:08.520> I<00:04:08.610> thought<00:04:08.790> the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
ankles only because I thought the

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.340 
ankles only because I thought the
advanced<00:04:09.209> grade<00:04:09.480> looked<00:04:09.720> good<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.080> gray

that's<00:04:11.040> completely<00:04:11.520> been<00:04:11.730> dispelled<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.390> think

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
that's completely been dispelled I think

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.240

talking about putting these legs

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.690 
talking about putting these legs
together<00:04:25.740> there's<00:04:26.160> tons<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.550> unique

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
together there's tons of unique

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.130 
together there's tons of unique
engineering<00:04:27.240> as<00:04:27.450> you<00:04:27.540> may<00:04:27.660> have<00:04:27.690> seen<00:04:27.900> in<00:04:28.050> the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
engineering as you may have seen in the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.990 
engineering as you may have seen in the
parts<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.950> way<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.130> put<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.520> together<00:04:29.700> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
parts the way you put that together the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.370 
parts the way you put that together the
shoulders<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.690> fact<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:30.960> these<00:04:31.170> white

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
shoulders and the fact that these white

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.470 
shoulders and the fact that these white
parts<00:04:31.680> can<00:04:31.860> open<00:04:32.190> up<00:04:32.280> everything<00:04:33.120> about<00:04:33.240> it

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
parts can open up everything about it

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.900 
parts can open up everything about it
combined<00:04:33.840> with<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:34.080> thrusters<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.910> little

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
combined with the thrusters and little

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.460 
combined with the thrusters and little
things<00:04:36.090> like<00:04:36.300> seam<00:04:36.720> lines<00:04:36.990> being<00:04:37.200> well

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
things like seam lines being well

things like seam lines being well
covered<00:04:38.010> up<00:04:38.160> by<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.400> fact<00:04:38.670> that<00:04:38.760> they've<00:04:38.940> got

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970

things on here when you put those little

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.530 
things on here when you put those little
tiny<00:04:41.250> thrusters<00:04:41.760> on<00:04:41.880> you'd<00:04:42.030> expect<00:04:42.390> there<00:04:42.510> to

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
tiny thrusters on you'd expect there to

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.810 
tiny thrusters on you'd expect there to
be<00:04:42.630> three<00:04:42.990> ugly<00:04:43.200> marks<00:04:43.710> but<00:04:44.310> Bandai<00:04:44.640> did<00:04:44.760> a
