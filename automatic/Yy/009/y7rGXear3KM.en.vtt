 have two types of motorcycle suits 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.310

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.510
 free your used and two-part 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.300
 combi's here more on the street 9 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.349
 out of 10 times we sell one 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.970
 two-part combination 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.980
 This is easy because he has a two out 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.510
 two parts exists so you stand you stand 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.270
 really at restaurants 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 do you have piece of grea you can get off at 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.610
 a family 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610
 easy 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.450
 jacket loose from the pants zippers 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.790
 in fact you are in this situation 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.950
 a loose jacket and loose pants that you 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.060
 over the entire width to each other 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.780
 all the way around 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.780
 anka zippers 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.500
 note that a motor combi or one 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.330
 engine pretty tight everywhere in the beginning 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.740
 must sit 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.030
 it must be assumed that he did 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.900
 certainly a quarter to a half measure 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.730
 will stretch 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.600
 you have the pants on you put on the jacket 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.310
 and a zipper around me 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.160
 fixed is in the beginning what it is to do 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.580
 getting used to but eventually it goes 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.580
 just not right 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.400
 combi are made everywhere for yes 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.190
 sport engines for sporty riders 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.619
 You already see made of leather of course 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.630
 different types of motorcycle suits you 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.820
 suits of 400 euros but also 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.110
 suits, almost 2000 euro 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.300
 The biggest difference is in the 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.640
 quality of it more quality of it 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.560
 stretch and the protection it contains 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.530
 This is already pista drove him off his suit 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.660
 900 euros made from premium leather and pu 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.289
 leather means that it is 1.3 mm thick leather 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.570
 is cow 's best leather and fitted with 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.920
 the track protection that is the pro texts 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.119
 which is also in the expensive circuit tackle 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 use 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.950
 sees a projector from the top 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.380
 knee to education had no legs 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.539
 they always train on suits 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.940
 and at the bottom you see a yes here 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.500
 a knife material whatever in your boot 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.960
 is less crammed by you 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.660
 materials in your march get one 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.920
 back also see a lot of stretch here 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.610
 Keep in mind that it is really whole 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.110
 to sit tight in the beginning to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.060
 the same for dali 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.620
 the this book also stress and what you see 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.390
 the more expensive suit is that they are external 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.920
 make sliders 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.230
 sees those six suffering on the shoulder on the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.100
 elbow comes out from the of the circuit 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.270
 off 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.470
 It is made for when you are on high 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.350
 speed goes down that you stay 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.270
 sliding and not that you hold bad 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.760
 bites making you want it because you can 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.000
 incur bone fractures 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.950
 easy for the state a combi 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.600
 and as I said, 9 out of 10 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.220
 opted for a combination 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.840
 The disadvantage of the motor combi is that you 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.960
 so you can him in a size so choose 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.970
 50 means 50 jacket 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.770
 50 pants what you can do is 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.020
 For example, purchase this jacket separately from 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.910
 already has gun oxen etam jacket and then 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.140
 You could possibly have a pair of loose pants with it 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.400
 can purchase that you can also purchase 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.480
 fasten each other 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.010
 it also looks just like one 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.880
 two-part combi only you buy it as 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.880
 two separate items 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.130
 required on the circuit is one 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.110
 one-piece overall that's actually because 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.090
 you're not breaking year ian middle 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.340
 so less vulnerable this suit exists 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.810
 the only job and is a second one 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.830
 rigpa I still have you feeding you 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.640
 or anything else in this is just one 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.360
 net lining stepped in with undergarments 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.400
 and you can see so subtly with overalls 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.290
 these are often better protection 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.240
 equipped with titanium cutters 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.500
 also provided with the elbows here 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.210
 knee sliders 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.070
 much stretch and harmonica past 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.030
 giving you yes much freedom of movement 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.030
 also in the cross 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.670
