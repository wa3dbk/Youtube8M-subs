 archaeologists even more interesting raised 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.570
 and although archaeologists themselves protest about 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.940
 that the tomb raider game creates perfectly 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.869
 misconception about their 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.390
 I think the profession is not nice all the same 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.150
 I think that not everyone loves his circle

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.560

 own trained body in 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.260
 the last series of the game was added also 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.590
 magnetic harpoon is very convenient 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.220
 device with which you can 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.900
 collect mushrooms lying their artifacts 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.090
 if in life they were stuck here and so on 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.770
 diet 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.870
 but to get the most valuable of them 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.290
 will have to work hard and only extra 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.240
 riddles puzzle to me 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.640
 everything is fine them a lot of interesting and 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.470
 tries as much as possible 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.280
 use the physics engine 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.770
 although perhaps not as well as us 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.880
 like we are still enviable 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.660
 Constantly push heavy 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.330
 blocks on the buttons in the floor but these blocks move 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 now more believable 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830
 mechanical puzzles 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.180
 interspersed with traditional 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.030
 physical tasks to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.920
 get to the next artifact 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.380
 the chamber is easy to move 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.740
 Sydykova cornices on the cornice jump 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.820
 improvised horizontal bars performance 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.850
 exercise is somewhat difficult to camera 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.930
 often changing the viewing angle but in general 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.130
 we can say that the mysterious part of the game 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.090
 succeeded very well and it should 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.130
 expect from the team engaged 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.870
 developing a series since 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.220
 battle mode though not quite a failure 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.200
 boring 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.570
 enemies do not shine with intelligence and wit 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.680
 for a change is no different at all 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.490
 Fatherland locations for you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.520
 There are two kinds of menagerie apart from 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.590
 bosses and here people are mercenaries of one of 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.979
 your opponents metrosexual bid 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.990
 in Frankfurt on a motorcycle possible 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.399
 someone watching the price is actually the most 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.310
 the weak part of the game is the first 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.319
 first generation 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.060
 this time smooth turns 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.409
 im about it 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.859
 Here are just Russian railway where 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:16.870
 most i 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.179
 not just does not see direct orphans 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.389
 quite spoils the overall impression seems 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.339
 that this scene fgi don't look for a commercial 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.339
 jeep motorcycle ducati cars 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.049
 parts of the project as a whole can not be said 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.230
 some may scold her for small 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.909
 duration but if you want 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.299
 open all bonuses treat can take 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.659
 posts are not yet for one day of physical culture 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.040
 archeology is back in fashion
