00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:09.170
A group of Budapest cyclists is fed up with bicycle theft.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.094
Using a bait bike equipped with a hidden GPS tracker

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:14.034
we are setting a trap for the criminals.

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:16.111
Follow us week by week!

00:00:16.459 --> 00:00:19.115
This is the web series of the Thiefbusters.

00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:24.187
Episode 1.:
The beginnings

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:38.034
People commuting by bicycle in Budapest surely know the awful feeling

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.699
when you only find the cold place of your faithful vehicle.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:48.884
- Four bikes were stolen from our garden in two years.

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:51.095
- Has your bicycle ever been stolen?

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.955
- Yes. It was chained in front of the university and they cut it.

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:56.044
- Did you call the police?
- No.

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:57.568
- No? Why didn't you call them?

00:00:57.603 --> 00:01:01.834
- Because I don't think they could have done anything.

00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:04.720
- Three times last year.

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.335
- Did you call the police?

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:10.002
- Well, first I did but then I didn't any more.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.474
I found it useless.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.118
- They couldn't do a thing?

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:14.030
- Not really.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:17.299
Thieves are growing incredibly sassy.

00:01:17.383 --> 00:01:20.666
At some places it's not wise to leave a bicycle even locked.

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.950
Although they are generally baffled by the newest locks,

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:26.541
but they can still steal the wheels or the seat,

00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:28.321
or plunder the toolbox.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.738
And these wonderlocks aren't invincible either.

00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:32.916
Although they are almost impossible to cut,

00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:35.024
it is much easier to pick the lock mechanism.

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:40.446
Not mentioning that a reliable lock can cost as much as half of the bicycle itself.

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:45.849
A bunch of Budapest cyclists got fed up with the situation.

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:47.654
Why would we pay a lot of money

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.730
and carry heavy pieces of steel around

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:50.792
when we want to commute?

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.161
Better catch the thieves and give them a lesson!

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.006
We have hidden a GPS tracker on this bicycle.

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.998
The idea is simple:

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:01.703
Leave it at a place frequented by thieves,

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:03.692
then follow the signal

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:07.145
and ask the thief if he wishes to reevaluate his life.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.563
By luck we can even discover the hideout of a pro gang

00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:12.999
hiding hundreds of stolen bicycles.

00:02:13.203 --> 00:02:16.625
This is one of the testing days of the GPS bait bicycle.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.424
One of us will be the "thief" now.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.667
We'll see if we can trace and catch him,

00:02:22.702 --> 00:02:25.502
and maybe get him around to a better conscience.

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.036
- He is heading towards the Danube on Arany Janos street.

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:35.386
Turning to Nador street now.

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:44.720
- So how much did it take?

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.857
- Seven minutes!

00:02:48.224 --> 00:02:51.067
But the idea was harder to realize than we thought.

00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:53.911
Chinese trackers, which you can order from the Internet

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:56.554
and send their position in SMS on a call

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.247
are very unreliable.

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:00.303
They can miss their position with even a few blocks.

00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:02.258
During simulated chases

00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:04.944
we could barely find the bait bike on a few occassions.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.052
And if the "thief" took it inside a building,

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.784
we practically didn't stand a chance.

00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:13.034
We could pinpoint the block for the best,

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.478
but not the apartment where the bicycle is hidden.

00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:19.846
Even the police can't search all the apartments.

00:03:21.288 --> 00:03:24.623
We needed a radio beacon for the last critical 100 meters.

00:03:24.823 --> 00:03:27.088
We tried to contact radio amateur clubs,

00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:30.166
but they all tried to convince us that it is impossible.

00:03:30.334 --> 00:03:33.902
We needed a huge transmitter and heavy batteries for that.

00:03:34.102 --> 00:03:37.251
Finally the solution was provided by Örvangyal Kft.

00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:43.455
- Örvangyal Kft. is a vendor of security products.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.741
We are aiming to provide active security systems for our clients and partners.

00:03:48.776 --> 00:03:53.244
Our main products are GPS trackers and other beacons,

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:57.712
among them what you are using for busting thieves.

00:03:57.912 --> 00:04:01.430
Our primary product is a GPS tracker

00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:04.914
that enables us to pinpoint the location

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.588
of a person or an object which we wish to follow.

00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:10.509
It sends the exact coordinates in SMS.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.463
Another product is a set of short range radio detectors.

00:04:14.498 --> 00:04:22.016
They can be used to locate lost pets or valuables in a smaller area

00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.666
by radio signals.

00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:27.030
And yes!

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:32.447
After many weeks of practicing we found that Örvangyal's radio beacon

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:36.244
can actually find the hidden bicycle with 100% accuracy.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:40.028
It doesn't matter if it's hidden in a cellar or a concrete building, even a metro station.

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:41.754
We finally had the technical background,

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.298
so we could start rallying a team.

00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:47.822
But we soon found that human stupidity

00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:50.760
can be as much as an obstacle as technical difficulties.

00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:53.721
We tried to contact cyclist organizations,

00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:56.570
but they didn't even reply.

00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:59.318
On the forum on criticalmass. hu

00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:01.996
we were called "violent criminals"

00:05:02.031 --> 00:05:04.242
and some said they should organize a rally against us

00:05:04.277 --> 00:05:08.082
because we are ruining the reputation of peaceful cyclists.

00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:11.286
Some smart ass kids even told us that bicycle theft

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.087
is actually insignificantly rare in Budapest.

00:05:14.122 --> 00:05:16.754
Finally we were banned from the forum.

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.387
Let us congratulate on the decision.

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:22.954
Fortunately we didn't only meet retards.

00:05:23.313 --> 00:05:27.042
The big thiefbusting raid started in September 2011.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.835
You can see the results in our web series.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.261
