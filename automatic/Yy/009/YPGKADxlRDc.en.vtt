00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.450 
of grass then the other deer the other
three<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:32.680> give<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.710> little<00:01:34.010> special<00:01:34.220> attention

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
three I give a little special attention

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.330 
three I give a little special attention
though<00:01:34.910> he<00:01:35.450> needs<00:01:35.660> it<00:01:39.070> he's<00:01:40.070> putting<00:01:40.280> on

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
though he needs it he's putting on

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.920 
though he needs it he's putting on
weight<00:01:40.550> as<00:01:40.820> much<00:01:41.000> as<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.270> other<00:01:41.390> three

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
weight as much as the other three

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:51.399 
weight as much as the other three
is<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.259> is<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.500> other<00:01:42.619> seven

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.359 

how<00:01:52.409> long<00:01:52.619> it'll<00:01:52.770> take<00:01:52.829> them<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.159> weed<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
how long it'll take them to weed a

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.919 
how long it'll take them to weed a
little<00:01:53.460> section<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.270> down<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.659> nothing

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
little section like this down to nothing

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.550 
little section like this down to nothing
but<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.780> definitely<00:01:57.929> hear<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.289> grass

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
but you can definitely hear the grass

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.039 
but you can definitely hear the grass
crunching<00:01:58.920> away<00:01:59.130> I<00:02:02.750> should<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.840> made<00:02:03.929> this

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
crunching away I should have made this

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
crunching away I should have made this
out<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.319> chicken<00:02:04.590> wire<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.039> they<00:02:05.280> could

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
out of chicken wire so that they could

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940 
out of chicken wire so that they could
so<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> could<00:02:06.329> leave<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.780> leave<00:02:07.590> moat<00:02:07.799> here

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
so I could leave them leave moat here

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.859 
so I could leave them leave moat here
fill<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> while

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
fill in a while

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:18.020 
fill in a while
unattended<00:02:16.370> when<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.519> when<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:17.879> get<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
unattended when this when they get a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.570 
unattended when this when they get a
little<00:02:18.150> bigger<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.569> fence<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:18.989> work<00:02:19.140> good

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
little bigger this fence will work good

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.850 
little bigger this fence will work good
that's<00:02:20.580> what<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> usually<00:02:21.090> use<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:22.140> actually<00:02:22.410> is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that's what I usually use it actually is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.080 
that's what I usually use it actually is
from<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.349> had<00:02:25.349> some<00:02:25.530> stone<00:02:25.829> some<00:02:26.819> stone

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
from a I had some stone some stone

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.420 
from a I had some stone some stone
delivered<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.720> could<00:02:27.959> do<00:02:28.110> my<00:02:28.230> fireplace<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
delivered so I could do my fireplace and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
delivered so I could do my fireplace and
this<00:02:29.700> came<00:02:30.030> on<00:02:30.060> top<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.660> pallet<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.230> this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
this came on top of the pallet that this

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.710 
this came on top of the pallet that this
how<00:02:31.739> they<00:02:31.890> bundled<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> stone<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.090> took<00:02:33.630> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
how they bundled the stone so I took it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
how they bundled the stone so I took it
off<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.959> one<00:02:34.019> piece<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:35.610> works<00:02:35.849> pretty

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
off in one piece and it works pretty

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.250 
off in one piece and it works pretty
good<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.299> area<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.810> they're<00:02:39.989> weeding

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
good so this area that they're weeding

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.280 
good so this area that they're weeding
is<00:02:40.530> just<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:41.010> walkway<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.150> have<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
is just the walkway that I have in the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.589 
is just the walkway that I have in the
middle<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.680> God<00:02:43.829> I<00:02:44.160> don't<00:02:45.000> usually<00:02:45.180> let<00:02:45.450> my

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
middle of God I don't usually let my
