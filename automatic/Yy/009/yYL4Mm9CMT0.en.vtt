00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.069
 I want to show you my 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.349
 recent favorites for several months 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.290
 for a long time did not take off for you is 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.240
 video immediately apologize for my such 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.699
 a little nasal voice I have a week 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.760
 over all I can not get over it in 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.340
 us on the street 51 degrees fat 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.500
 ira is sick in general everything is super all class 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
 so let's probably not I much 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 talk a lot because not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.989
 I want to delay the video start of course 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.149
 same with favorites cosmetics for face 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.420
 the first thing I'll show you is this very me 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.940
 I use it almost every day 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.360
 powder from pupa baked powder i you her 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.719
 more than once already showed me the most 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.300
 light shade 01 here puff 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.149
 I always cover the protective film 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.109
 for me it's so much nicer here a mirror and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.020
 actually shade itself already told 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.590
 already showed a million times I praised this 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 powder 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.560
 I love her very much she suits me and 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.260
 in the summer I like this powder 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.680
 It does not give some vigorous matte 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 finish because who watches me that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 knows that I donâ€™t really like a face 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.549
 completely completely matt me on 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.770
 it seems somehow inanimate therefore to me 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.119
 always want 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 Basically, I always look for products that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.340
 give such a slight glow and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.920
 the effect of healthy skin here with this powder 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.900
 copes just to cheer this powder to me 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.490
 replaced all my tonal basis you 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.100
 today you will not see any more 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.310
 tonal foundations it perfectly covers 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.180
 all the flaws it perfectly aligns 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.950
 skin tone does not clog pores does not dry skin 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.869
 in general it is 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.320
 it is now my favorite and with pleasure 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.260
 I use this powder following what I 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.830
 I want to show it to you 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.680
 guaranteeing unit from slick somehow here it is 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.840
 I have for a long time and is not to have 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.750
 me and him could not be formed in 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.330
 my face was too pale and even 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 the lightest shade of light seemed to me 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.730
 dark mirror here and here's the actual 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.320
 This block looks like this , but now 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.670
 in the summer when I have a little skin 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.890
 tanned super option fine i don't 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 I use separately each 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.480
 shade i just take a brush i 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.270
 mix all shades and i don't 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.070
 some kind of serious 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.770
 face sculpting i'm just here in 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.020
 cheekbone area apply this bronzer 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.250
 and i like the way it is lightly slightly 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.710
 highlight cheekbones 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.320
 this creates the effect of natural 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.010
 my natural natural cheekbones and 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.780
 one of my favorite blush 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.260
 I use too lately 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.870
 quite often it is a blush cardo 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 hd now i have applied to me too 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.209
 hardly surely you see them because 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.230
 what they look like this is very, very 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.600
 light on and with captivity on pink blush but 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.550
 they go with this right now I don't know 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.890
 handed you a camera or not that's where 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.470
 I spent a finger I will give should stay 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.980
 the trace is not matte blush 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.790
 they come with such a light golden one 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.480
 low tide 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.980
 very natural looking natural 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.200
 nice but here's the principle you can see 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.620
 all by itself the way the shade is called 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.170
 pink shimmer so what else will i show you 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.380
 let's move a little bit from decorative 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.410
 cosmetics in the summer I'm always with me in 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.350
 here is our handbag 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.870
 antiseptic hand gel they have 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.000
 greens here there is no blue 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.560
 fragrances with vitamin e 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.769
 yes let him smell alcohol but I'm in summer 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.050
 I just do not know maybe 34 napkins 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.180
 per hour wet wipes required 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.150
 use because firstly we sweat 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.269
 don't care about bacteria anyway 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.790
 breed in the summer just to cheer and me 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.889
 I always want to have a feeling 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.430
 purity has always been present with me by 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:14.700
 this sanni goal is called a gel that's it 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.430
 don't always use now let me get you 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.049
 show for eyebrows new thing which i 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.950
 you still did not show but I 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.840
 I use it now very very often who 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.050
 don't know i got a job and 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.270
 so now in the morning I have no such 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.350
 the amount of time it used to be for 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.280
 eyebrows to make it all 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.700
 to draw everything to be at all 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.520
 just perfect but as far as i know 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.590
 now we have a trend 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.920
 natural natural and lightly such 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.870
 careless brows here now you see u 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.090
 my eyebrows are decorated with that product 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.850
 which I'll show you here now 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.050
 such a famous gel from anastasia 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:02.310
 I have beverly hills called 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:07.200
 chocolat this tint brow gel 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:10.710
 this is such a brush 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.710
 gives shade this fixing gel for 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.900
 eyebrows but he comes with a touch that I 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.540
 very much in this matter yes that 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.970
 it fixes eyebrows well and also 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.520
 considering that I have eyebrows on my own 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.400
 very problematic they are rare for me 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.460
 they are symmetrical in general than with me 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.880
 on the eyebrows not and nature is not rewarded 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.600
 this gel 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.870
 he paints them so beautifully on 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.290
 face brows become more pronounced 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.330
 pronounced but it looks 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.700
 naturally it looks natural 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.010
 plus do not like the fact that with me this 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.650
 brush you can already calculate the edge 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.410
 and put them here in any chaotic 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.960
 okay, how do you want it now 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.360
 I personally like the way my are decorated 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.510
 eyebrows valley as clear as possible 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.669
 you used to see earlier but that's it 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.780
 this negligence effect 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.699
 I am very natural 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.820
 I like it now I use this gel 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.050
 constantly all the more in the morning i need 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.000
 stand up quickly I have to get myself together 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.979
 I need to bring the child to the kindergarten 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.270
 I need to come to work in her garden 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:22.990
 and already look beautiful i'm not one of those 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.030
 people who painted at work I do not know here 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.099
 I can't better get up at home earlier 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:32.490
 by the floor I will put myself in order and I 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.490
 I'll come already so candy off
