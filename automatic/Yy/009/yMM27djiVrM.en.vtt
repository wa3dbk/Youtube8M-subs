it's<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.099> great<00:02:10.280> lens<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.549> 24<00:02:11.000> 2.8<00:02:11.569> some<00:02:11.930> people

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it's a great lens of 24 2.8 some people

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.830 
it's a great lens of 24 2.8 some people
say<00:02:12.409> oh<00:02:12.439> why<00:02:12.739> don't<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.920> get<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.129> 28<00:02:13.489> 1.8<00:02:14.090> at

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
say oh why don't you get the 28 1.8 at

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.210 
say oh why don't you get the 28 1.8 at
the<00:02:14.989> time<00:02:15.200> when<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:15.470> was<00:02:15.500> think<00:02:15.739> about<00:02:15.829> getting

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
the time when I was think about getting

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.000 
the time when I was think about getting
a<00:02:16.459> wide<00:02:16.670> angle<00:02:16.849> all<00:02:17.629> right<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.049> 28<00:02:18.470> 1.8

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
a wide angle all right that the 28 1.8

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.690 
a wide angle all right that the 28 1.8
it<00:02:19.519> wasn't<00:02:19.819> as<00:02:19.879> sharp<00:02:20.120> as<00:02:20.329> 24<00:02:21.079> 2.8<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.459> I<00:02:22.519> just

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
it wasn't as sharp as 24 2.8 so I just

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.580 
it wasn't as sharp as 24 2.8 so I just
got<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:22.970> but<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.629> it's<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:24.049> fantastic

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
got it but you know it's a fantastic

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.920 
got it but you know it's a fantastic
lens<00:02:24.799> works<00:02:25.340> well<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.000> also<00:02:26.180> oh<00:02:26.329> man<00:02:26.720> one

thing<00:02:27.079> I<00:02:27.140> love<00:02:27.349> is<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.799> custom<00:02:28.489> metal<00:02:28.760> are

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
thing I love is the custom metal are

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.270 
thing I love is the custom metal are
strapped<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:30.170> makes<00:02:30.650> life<00:02:30.799> so<00:02:31.250> easy

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
strapped it just makes life so easy

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.880 
strapped it just makes life so easy
because<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.819> could<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.439> strap<00:02:33.439> it<00:02:33.470> around<00:02:33.650> my

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
because I could just strap it around my

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.690 
because I could just strap it around my
shoulder<00:02:34.370> walk<00:02:35.359> around<00:02:35.689> with<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.700> just

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
shoulder walk around with it and just

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.030 
shoulder walk around with it and just
think<00:02:38.629> about<00:02:38.720> my<00:02:38.989> side<00:02:39.260> every<00:02:39.560> time<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.769> want<00:02:39.980> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
think about my side every time I want to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.089 
think about my side every time I want to
take<00:02:40.129> a<00:02:40.159> photo<00:02:40.400> i<00:02:40.549> just<00:02:40.760> sing<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.720> up<00:02:41.989> in<00:02:42.290> one<00:02:43.040> of

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
take a photo i just sing it up in one of

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.800 
take a photo i just sing it up in one of
the<00:02:43.190> reasons<00:02:43.519> i<00:02:43.579> don't<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:43.879> using<00:02:44.060> my<00:02:44.329> SLR

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the reasons i don't like using my SLR

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.899 
the reasons i don't like using my SLR
four<00:02:45.049> walls<00:02:45.349> because<00:02:45.769> it's<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.010> kind<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:46.819> a

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
four walls because it's just kind of a

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.910 
four walls because it's just kind of a
pain<00:02:47.090> that<00:02:47.120> has<00:02:47.329> to<00:02:47.510> carry<00:02:47.750> around<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:48.319> versus

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
pain that has to carry around but versus

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.589 
pain that has to carry around but versus
using<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.250> strip<00:02:49.519> lights<00:02:50.239> been<00:02:50.389> a<00:02:50.420> lot<00:02:50.569> easier

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
using the strip lights been a lot easier

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:57.339 
using the strip lights been a lot easier
and<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.409> course<00:02:53.319> using<00:02:54.319> my<00:02:54.409> flash<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:56.349> we're

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
and of course using my flash so we're

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.929 
and of course using my flash so we're
cool<00:02:57.530> because<00:02:57.709> i<00:02:57.920> had<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.159> combination<00:02:58.790> of

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
cool because i had this combination of

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.530 
cool because i had this combination of
using<00:02:59.269> my<00:02:59.359> flash<00:02:59.689> my<00:03:00.439> canon<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.639> the<00:03:02.090> 24

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
using my flash my canon in the 24

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.660 
using my flash my canon in the 24
millimeter<00:03:02.930> which<00:03:03.260> I'm<00:03:04.040> gonna<00:03:04.189> start<00:03:04.370> using<00:03:04.549> a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
millimeter which I'm gonna start using a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.550 
millimeter which I'm gonna start using a
lot<00:03:04.819> more<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.870> really<00:03:06.019> cool<00:03:06.260> thing<00:03:06.439> about

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
lot more and the really cool thing about

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.360 
lot more and the really cool thing about
