is<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.239> high-pressure<00:04:09.689> Ridge<00:04:09.870> we've<00:04:10.229> been

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
is that high-pressure Ridge we've been

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.050 
is that high-pressure Ridge we've been
talking<00:04:10.680> about<00:04:10.769> all<00:04:10.859> week<00:04:11.189> continuing<00:04:11.939> to

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
is going to do that as we head into the

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.749

week in the trough off towards the north

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.839 
week in the trough off towards the north
not<00:04:18.150> as<00:04:18.419> impactful<00:04:19.349> as<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:19.709> were<00:04:19.889> hoping<00:04:20.370> the

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
not as impactful as we were hoping the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.190 
not as impactful as we were hoping the
other<00:04:21.060> big<00:04:21.299> thing<00:04:21.539> though<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:21.959> going<00:04:22.139> to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200
