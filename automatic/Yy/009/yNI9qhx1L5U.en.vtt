00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 hey people you had already times 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.540
 his moment in which you are aware 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.450
 it has become that some things even her 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.639
 you might not have thought so well or that 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 I had become aware of others 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.270
 is that some things maybe here 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.270
 not as good as you thought 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.130
 by improving you 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.090
 by hearing things and then 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.870
 you became aware that the weapons the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.240
 you thought you are mature 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.020
 [Music] 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.970
 somehow such moments are total 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.470
 demotivating I'll think mine 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.020
 his whole life that you something 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.850
 right that you can do something really good 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.060
 and then it's called trash, it just means 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.980
 so from now on no was even 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:05.530
 was not as good as now not 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 bad but i think so i hope 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.360
 at least that not alone 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.860
 am 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.180
 This has happened to me quite often 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.440
 I believe it first time 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.830
 this happens consciously from the ninth 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.400
 class as me in English actually 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.410
 was relatively good and then somehow meant 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.860
 someone to me that I am the English one 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.320
 honor if I can really pronounce 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 and then I asked myself I am 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.490
 in English at all as well or 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.150
 when you're on stage and 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.970
 plays a role and then 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.230
 I am unsolicited 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.460
 Anyway better than the people I am 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.460
 want to take me as a role model 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.540
 [Music] 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.360
 I think we had all been so 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.979
 a moment that became aware of us 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.990
 is that some simply said 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.159
 not so good 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.659
 but I think the problem is something 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.819
 that's just my problem 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.270
 that we influence ourselves too much 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.140
 to let 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.140
 and in the end, nothing is bad 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.220
 I mean we have right now a 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.140
 For example, I am just about to become matte 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.970
 learn and I thought who actually 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.410
 always good in math i had in math 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.080
 always 12 to 13 points and then 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.190
 can you have it- and since then I am 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.320
 confused and all years are normal 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.230
 every kind of good dull person 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.640
 I do not have that good anymore but say 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.840
 that there is not that in that in the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.900
 I actually always as good as even 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.370
 nothing is so good but i think so 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.700
 we should not get over it 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.020
 leave because the only way 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.000
 sure to improve it 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.970
 ultimately the problem in the eyes 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.300
 look and therefore do better and 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.640
 then has again be the same again in 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.770
 to be well again 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.750
 You can learn that he speaks 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.819
 to be able to or just stochastics me 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.510
 I think I do that too now 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.860
 Learn a bit now 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.860
 stochastics I wanted you in there
