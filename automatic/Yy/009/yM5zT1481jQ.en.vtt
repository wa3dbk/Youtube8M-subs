the digitizer from it the easiest way to

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.860 
the digitizer from it the easiest way to
get<00:02:39.310> out<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.730> remove<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.209> front<00:02:40.390> facing

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
get out it is remove the front facing

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.920 
get out it is remove the front facing
camera<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:41.880> push<00:02:42.880> something<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.510> inside

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
camera and push something right inside

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.440 
camera and push something right inside
that<00:02:43.959> hole<00:02:44.430> it'll<00:02:45.430> actually<00:02:45.640> push<00:02:46.090> up<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
that hole it'll actually push up the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.150 
that hole it'll actually push up the
corner<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.989> digitizer<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:47.890> can<00:02:47.980> get<00:02:48.100> a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
corner of the digitizer so you can get a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.430 
corner of the digitizer so you can get a
pic<00:02:48.400> underneath<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.209> pull<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.420> up<00:02:52.440> that's

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
pic underneath it and pull it up that's

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.830
