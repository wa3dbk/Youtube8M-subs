take the bottom corner closest to the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.090 
take the bottom corner closest to the
filling<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.460> roll<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.230> over<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
around the filling so that I create a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.280 
around the filling so that I create a
cone<00:01:31.620> shape<00:01:32.090> then<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.450> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.690> press<00:01:34.050> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
cone shape then I just want to press the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.790 
cone shape then I just want to press the
seaweed<00:01:34.650> down<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.250> seal<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:36.380> then<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.560> have

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
seaweed down to seal and then you have

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.640 
seaweed down to seal and then you have
your<00:01:37.830> hand<00:01:38.340> roll<00:01:38.580> now<00:01:39.480> these<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.990> perfect<00:01:40.290> to
