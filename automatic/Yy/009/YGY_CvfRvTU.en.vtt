00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
be smoke come out so they are kind of

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.650 
be smoke come out so they are kind of
cool<00:04:23.650> but<00:04:23.920> not<00:04:24.100> really<00:04:24.550> they<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:25.270> give<00:04:25.630> you

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
cool but not really they just give you

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.840 
cool but not really they just give you
like<00:04:25.900> one<00:04:26.170> little<00:04:26.530> animation<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.400> barely

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
like one little animation you can barely

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.660 
like one little animation you can barely
even<00:04:28.090> hear<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.690> gun<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:30.070> can<00:04:30.220> see<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.520> smoke

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
even hear the gun you can see the smoke

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.880 
even hear the gun you can see the smoke
and<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.240> animation<00:04:31.930> barely<00:04:32.320> we<00:04:32.440> plays<00:04:32.650> off

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
and the animation barely we plays off

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.700 
and the animation barely we plays off
you'd<00:04:33.160> hoped<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:34.630> they<00:04:34.990> can<00:04:35.140> make<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.470> so<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
you'd hoped that they can make it so the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.240 
you'd hoped that they can make it so the
animation<00:04:36.220> plays<00:04:36.490> out<00:04:36.700> more<00:04:37.650> than<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.890> now<00:04:39.220> I

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
animation plays out more than that now I

00:04:39.250 --> 00:05:01.350 
animation plays out more than that now I
mean<00:04:47.910> oh<00:04:58.860> my<00:04:59.860> god<00:05:00.130> you<00:05:00.640> can<00:05:00.850> never<00:05:01.000> get<00:05:01.270> the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360

guards on you when you want them on you

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.390 
guards on you when you want them on you
and<00:05:04.060> you<00:05:04.240> can<00:05:04.360> never<00:05:04.450> get<00:05:04.690> a<00:05:04.720> load<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:04.930> girls

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
and you can never get a load of girls

and you can never get a load of girls
all<00:05:06.400> right<00:05:08.070> tackle<00:05:09.070> enums<00:05:09.370> good<00:05:09.640> idea<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.030> get

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
all right tackle enums good idea to get

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:30.100 
all right tackle enums good idea to get
one<00:05:10.300> year<00:05:12.090> they<00:05:13.090> go<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.810> shot<00:05:14.050> again

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.490 

so<00:05:31.110> they<00:05:31.770> are<00:05:31.920> kind<00:05:31.950> of<00:05:32.340> cool<00:05:33.260> they're<00:05:34.260> not

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
so they are kind of cool they're not

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.280 
so they are kind of cool they're not
that<00:05:35.430> it's<00:05:35.760> been<00:05:35.970> sitting<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.720> assassination

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
that it's been sitting the assassination

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.690 
that it's been sitting the assassination
contracts<00:05:37.740> there<00:05:37.950> are<00:05:38.040> a<00:05:38.070> lot<00:05:38.280> of<00:05:38.310> them<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.670> it

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
contracts there are a lot of them and it

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.580 
contracts there are a lot of them and it
doesn't<00:05:38.970> take<00:05:39.150> a<00:05:39.450> little<00:05:39.810> while<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.350> do<00:05:40.440> it

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
doesn't take a little while to do it

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.680 
doesn't take a little while to do it
don't<00:05:40.680> take<00:05:40.950> it<00:05:41.130> takes<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.460> few<00:05:41.640> hours<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:42.570> do

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
don't take it takes a few hours to do

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.890 
don't take it takes a few hours to do
all<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:42.870> them<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:44.660> they<00:05:45.660> kind<00:05:45.810> of

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
all of them and they kind of

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.960 
all of them and they kind of
disappointing<00:05:46.440> because<00:05:46.710> I'd<00:05:47.370> like<00:05:47.610> them<00:05:47.880> to

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
disappointing because I'd like them to

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.480 
disappointing because I'd like them to
be<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.180> bit<00:05:48.330> louder<00:05:48.570> and<00:05:49.040> I'd<00:05:50.040> like<00:05:50.160> that<00:05:50.220> to<00:05:50.370> be

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
be a bit louder and I'd like that to be

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.310 
be a bit louder and I'd like that to be
I<00:05:50.970> like<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.300> animation<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.720> play<00:05:51.960> out<00:05:52.080> more

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
I like the animation to play out more

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.700 
I like the animation to play out more
than<00:05:52.530> just<00:05:52.770> like<00:05:52.920> once<00:05:53.450> 111<00:05:54.450> 10<00:05:54.810> times<00:05:55.110> no<00:05:55.680> I

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
than just like once 111 10 times no I

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.960 
than just like once 111 10 times no I
mean<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.910> those<00:05:57.120> are<00:05:58.100> sword<00:05:59.100> guns<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.640> can<00:05:59.670> see

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
mean so those are sword guns you can see

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.810 
mean so those are sword guns you can see
it<00:06:00.150> a<00:06:00.180> bit<00:06:00.360> better<00:06:00.600> there<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:02.220> mechanism<00:06:02.580> is

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
it a bit better there the mechanism is

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.900 
it a bit better there the mechanism is
right<00:06:03.030> there<00:06:03.240> you<00:06:03.390> see<00:06:03.630> it<00:06:05.690> mechanisms<00:06:06.690> there
