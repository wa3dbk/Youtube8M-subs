00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.839
 plenary made an account of the life of a 'teacher' in the Great Northern River 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.190
 questions of the reality that goes 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.510
 and outside the classroom in a simple way 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.500

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.789
 in favor of education 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.700

 as people get with presents many numbers 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.950
 and as always puts the numbers are irrefutable 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.210
 I would also like to present a number to start my room 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.890
 which is a three-digit number that is very different from the numbers 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.380
 other numbers that are presented that with so many digits 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.380
 what's my salary number 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.850
 now you would imagine that when you 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 this afternoon the bench talk of those deputies talk to people too 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.030
 we were all over the great northern river 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.040
 the intention would be 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.420
 so big 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.630
 in the afternoon it's the animals I imagined 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 even because he committed as I have spoken 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.950
 always harry if my routine routine are not mine but then ours 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.690
 category 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.400
 I never imagined that from this date until repercussion 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.700
 one thing that until the time when it gets what has been relevant 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.970

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.000
 of these considerations were made in that space that remained 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.560

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.460
 talked about the quality of teaching about the difficulties you have since 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.170
 basic infrastructure inside the classroom, but there was much talk 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.130
 personnel from which the process also went in order to reach the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.440
 school within the classroom 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.040
 in the absence of this search for another job because only you can not 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.819
 live today 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.370
