00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 greet all friends with you you are faithful 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.379
 and finally I took the time to write 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.110
 fresh video this time this video will be 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.019
 by a tank in t21 american light 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.980
 tank level 6 and the battle will take place on 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.130
 monastery map 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.430
 We drove a platoon tanker on a perch 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.590
 and to-t on su-101 but I, as I said 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 on t21 map monastery we are mine 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.740
 sovzvodny precisely located in the top list 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 well, I'm closer to the bottom as usual and now 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.360
 let's see what will happen here 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.070
 I'm going to the gut first there 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.910
 wonderful bush from which you can 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.629
 enlighten 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.430
 tyazh which will go on guts with the enemy 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.840
 parties 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.329
 I'll take this bush and I will stand 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.149
 shine your weight well what can I say 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.550
 about t21 pretty specific 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.890
 Tanchik for light tank he has 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.309
 too large in size almost as 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.739
 american t20 medium tank dynamics 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.890
 not in principle a good maxim allochka 56 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.760
 kilometers per hour but because of its large 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.360
 sizes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.110
 shine actively on t21 but it's not the best 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 idea of ​​course you can shine but it is very 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.860
 it's dangerous to just get you all 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.720
 who wants to shine because of it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.090
 not another option possible 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.920
 shine passively can be used 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.040
 I telescope in this case stands 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.900
 optics can be used to get tired 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.320
 any trifle and highlight 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.600
 some time and then proceeding from 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.579
 situations on the minimap can either 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.659
 stay shine or change position 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.820
 Well, there are already options may be different 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.509
 I usually start the wallpaper on this tank 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.259
 pursuing any position of the mouth or 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.520
 in this key position on the center of the map and 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.399
 I’m already highlighting from there 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.380
 decide what to do next can be well and the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.869
 time in combat the situation is not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.020
 the very best of our tops 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.030
 the gut drove only one t-34 but also 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.899
 the rest there are all sorts of small tanchiki 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.879
 Class is 20 lei Churchill and enemies to 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.680
 Unfortunately in the gut we went pretty 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.760
 serious forces then three top 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.359
 two heavy tanks and a chinese one and from more books 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.769
 catch up but on the other hand on 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:26.299
 the opposite flank of our kind of like 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.010
 allies rashid this can not but rejoice 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.439
 but in the meantime I decided to occupy the center 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.939
 cards and I decided to do it for good reason 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:38.760
 because t-34 enemy is another top and 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.889
 just decided to drive through the center and nobody 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.609
 not to be afraid 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:46.799
 now we will invent something 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.819
 roll over to him from the stern and start 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.500
 you shoot him on the sly 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.230
 punching function to break through the edge 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.739
 quite enough to punch corr 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.329
 lightning aboard the T-34 is not about that and about 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.719
 one hundred thirty eight millimeters penetration 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:11.400
 I have a little brazen act forgot that 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:14.159
 Tanchik quite high in the tower in 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.590
 the tower punches me t-34 without much 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.329
 of problems 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.549
 lost a family only a couple of times not all 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.540
 now be sure to hide 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.250
 Then I will not survive the second shot 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.769
 let's wait rolls out of 4 let's start 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.019
 movements and then continue it 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.319
 shoot this with clean 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:37.979
 distracted by my sovzvodnogo and I him 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.780
 already karma calmly again punch 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:44.340
 somehow so jointly 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.150
 we parse the enemy top stays on 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.109
 center yet 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.379
 our t29 and enemy t29 in which there is little 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.430
 hp 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.329
 I wanted to pick him up but then still 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.319
 thought that 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.180
 crawl on his forehead is not worth it and 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.349
 roll back 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.509
 the more we still kind of like 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.229
 the artillery that is moving is given 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:12.720
 I did not take a chance and wait 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:13.620
 how come think what to do next see 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.169
 what's in the gut 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.509
 our comrades are already ending as 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.120
 should have been expected there we didn't have 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:25.300
 serious resistance 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:29.289
 I think a little, decide to drive closer 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.680
 by the hourglass stay there and wait 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.810
 bye here is this enemy rush group 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.389
 will travel to our base 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.150
 hoped to find here some 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.819
 bushes so that one can 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.419
 devote enemy tanks but bushes 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:49.750
 I did not find it and therefore I just want 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:54.069
 hide behind the house wait bye again 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:57.310
 same enemy tanks will stop up will become 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:00.789
 to capture our base and I'll come to 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.520
 him from the stern and I will try to shoot down 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.639
 capture and 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.430
 In general, in the cards to win this fight in order 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.550
 time my sovzvodnye 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.250
 pulled back and stood on the shelf 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.729
 Now we will highlight them 129 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.370
 they will try to do damage and 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.759
 shoot down grip and so roll up 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.979
 little by little we must not see what 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.680
 Chinese enemy took a big mistake he 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:33.490
 drove ahead of all his other tanks 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.310
 and now they will quickly merge there and I 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.849
 noticed for himself that led here too 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.639
 strayed from the pack quietly in the stern 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.770
 we throw u shoot me there 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.500
 some time yet to podamazhit 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.669
 and you can roll back pretty 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.639
 The situation is ambiguous because I 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.699
 now can go to me and finish 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.600
 I calmly switch to gold 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:01.370
 or waiting for him 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.320
 it seems to me such good news 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.919
 shot i will leave it on the caterpillar and 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.970
 his gun does not fall from the second 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.970
 a shot I finish it in the meantime 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.199
 our allies from the shelves ask whether all 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.410
 one tiger 2 remained in a circle 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.410
 capture 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:29.330
 IS-3 is also over finish him Valdai 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:32.120
 quart and stayed tegra 2 insert 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.070
 worried to probably already apply 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.550
 Done because it is better suited to his 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.699
 the end 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:42.430
 In principle, the board can be in the mouse 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.430
 breaking through it 128 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:50.510
 Well, I decided to have a little more experience for sure 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.970
 pour all we finish the royal tiger and 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.639
 the pain is almost over now our 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:07:00.289
 take the base 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:03.410
 Here is such a fight turned out how to say 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:07.330
 what about 21 in principle tanchik not 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:10.000
 to good very good taxi but also 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.820
 I will not say that it is very terrible 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.690
 certainly more often much better but what is 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:19.430
 that is, in general, such are the guys 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.760
 download it 21 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:26.240
 feel it and everything will be fine 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.280
 Well, now let's see the results so 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.560
 the results of the battle you can see on your 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.380
 screens and I thank you for your attention 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.949

 new meetings
