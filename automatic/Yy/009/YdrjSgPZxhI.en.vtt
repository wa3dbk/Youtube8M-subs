 in the night and kind around 3 4 o'clock 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.950
 in the morning we went to sleep after 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.690
 we had everything prepared I thought I 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.009

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.850

 it's not the top 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.350
 then I was tired of which I told myself 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.940

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.000

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.579
 and suddenly we put the alarm clock in the morning 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.799
 I believe for 6 hours and in fact we have 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.659
 completely zapped ass on eve 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.189
 woke up late I hit 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.829
 did not have time to make the video 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.540
 you will come to warn you when 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.640
 I had planned a unfortunately I am 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.170
 excuse by the way I have little plan on 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.520
 the video 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.590
 here I hope you will not but 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.319
 good knowing you will maintain 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.700
 not really rigor so we left 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.560
 just did not know at all 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 how long is not at all 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 so I 'll do the summary of my 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.890
 vacation but we left then we went 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.330
 rolled we rolled we landed we 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.470
 was going on journalist beaches and 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.930
 other beaches of really what 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.680
 beautiful I took a lot of pictures I 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.270
 you will make a video or just 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.520
 which summarizes all my holidays and I 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.900
 went we got up valves so at 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.640
 end of Brittany Brittany is a 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.980
 really beautiful area and I would love 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.970
 a lot of fun in what and for 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.019
 all those who have a small budget 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.489
 frankly I advise you to do 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.319
 that you take your car you go 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.760
 you have that gas to pay or 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.049
 eat fast do you go to the crossroads 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.080
 you buy a little sandwich or a 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.630
 stuff like that and you eat that fast 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.700
 done and frankly we left eight 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.440
 days for in all 160 euros is that 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.569
 of gasoline I feel that knowing forgiveness 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.760
 we did 2000 km 1 which is huge 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.799
 but really cheap holidays and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.209
 if you have the opportunity you will leave 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.739
 with friends and your girlfriend everything 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.680
 that frankly slept in the car 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.120
 I mean it's not at all 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.660
 to extend your driver's chair 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.950
 is and the other and you are quiet 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.410
 and the good day we slept in 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.480
 sudan tranquillou grass in the forest 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.359
 or what are you really nice I will do 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.840
 a summary in more detail in what then 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.420
 I came back from holidays 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.970

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.780
 pc does not start surprise here it is 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.340
 return from vacation 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.349
 first thing I want to do 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.930
 it's going to youtube you redo 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:34.370
 videos just join all that all 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.230
 it's super hot and unfortunately it does not 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.739
 not walk that's all simple author I 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.489
 will go fishing at the same time my pc 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.950
 did not restart 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.860
 so he went off 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.110
 repair he went to repair in 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.799
 Czech republic 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.720
 it is the program asus the guarantee therefore 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.180
 I hope he will come back and that no 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.970
 of all my data will be lost 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.709
 because there I do not even know if I'm going 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.150
 get to be able to recover the intro for 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.610
 this video I do not know if we will have a 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.349
 but I do not think in any case 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.660
 I will try opposite Gaulle has dropped 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.099
 on the pc of my girlfriend who is not the 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.209
 all powerful to make lay of 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.590
 I can not do you any more pupils 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.269
 immediately red and up our pc 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.310
 and can resume doing you some 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.380
 videos unfortunately just my 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.419
 count 1 do not have a big taste 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.479
 videos people close firm cros case where a 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:29.090
 train since already we have a pc for 2 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:30.470
 so judged more at these times and in addition to 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.830
 I have not 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.720
 all the appropriate materials dyed I 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.220
 not my editing software that I have 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.780
 usual and and stops it's a little 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.340
 the galley but I'm still going to 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.750
 take out videos I'll try to 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.790
 do the best I can we go 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.250
 continue almost exclusively 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.180
 I have no choice on the series of 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.710
 mount the trades of the coup we go 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.810
 really go up the trades en masse 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.450
 so we all have a video for you 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.770
 tell a little about all this but care 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.590
 put in the sub region will be yours 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.640
 to release videos on the series 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.010
 to increase the trades we will continue 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.240
 as I said the lumberjack had 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.630
 started I said we would start 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.950
 fishermen and then continue lumberjack in 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.210
 same time that we will all do 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.580
 almost at the same time like that we 're going 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.990
 well advanced in the series the prefect I 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.610
 you might do two or three 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.620
 videos like this a day a penny it's 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.390
 sure for those that trades do not 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.680
 not interested I understand that you 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.380
 will have the bulls do not have other 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.210
 videos but here I technically I do not 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.120
 can not do otherwise I play like 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.610
 we do not count what I could 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.600
 do other 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.919
 so we even have the thumbnails a 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.810
 video it will be difficult to 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.240
 work hard in the morning that that 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.750
 the old ones can all my 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.430
 work tools are on 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.870
 my old pc finally my former accomplice 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.430
 and that did not bother him access to 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.110
 the moment in a loop I hope it will be 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.900
 repair very quickly 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.630
 so I'm back I'm not 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.370
 dead I did not quit dofus or other 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.340
 something that I agree I thank those 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.200
 who are acquitted so I am beautiful and 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.110
 well back videos almost all 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.120

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.440

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.210
 live twenty thousand subscribers of course when 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.490

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.800
 that I get my pc I hope especially 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.360
 that they will not be dead that I have not 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.010

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.070
 little we take quickly once I 'm not
