00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.009
 in the applause switch circuit 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.530
 with applause 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.180
 I'm going to light and with two and when I go to 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:19.630
 pay being and with two turned off and 12 with a 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:23.150
 I turn on and with two turned off I have 2 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.490
 this circuit can be for at home 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.380
 where it arrives lights with a with him with 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.380
 one with 100 t switches 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.130
 and you can place our house not for 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.720
 how many arrive tired from work 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.800
 can on the part circuit with another one 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.480
 light a lamp together 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.840
 it can also be for example to do 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.890
 Start of motors of 220 motors 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.540
 course they do their stage of electronics and 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.470
 this stage of power that is with the 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.659
 relay with 5 volt root for two 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.769
 hundreds 20 volts where the lamp goes 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.769
 the engine goes 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.640
 very interesting 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.420
 with 2 Aug 12 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.250
 and turned off with 212 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:26.500
 being with 12 hours and want to do it 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.640
 to pay with three applause applause I 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.640
 I explain in the next good in the 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.850
 next part 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.380
 this is the cd47 integrator if you do not want 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.880
 turn it off with two applause that's great 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.909
 stick with three with four with five 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.090
 applause just connect on pin 15 to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:47.670
 stop it with 13 applause to 4 from pin 15 to 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.979
 4 the index will turn off with 3 applause if 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.640
 they want but with 4 products to put 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.420
 channel 5 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.110
 good 5 if they want it off with 5 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.350
 Applause connects you to q6 thinking 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.350
 cross you will be paid with 5 approx 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.480
 and these other materials here we have the 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:23.469
 relay 220 volts alternating by 5 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:28.069
 volts in DC 5 volts continuous 5 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:31.719
 potentiometer 220 volts 100k 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.719
 a potentiometer of 5 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.200
 a potentiometer of 5 we have the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.739
 integrated CD 40 17 we have here 40 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.739
 17 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.070
 we also have its base in case it is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.080
 burn us the integrated that we replace 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.880
 surplus product we take out what 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.880
 we replace with your base also 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.620
 the micro the micro we realize that here 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.460
 have the positive or negative here we have 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.860
 some slots 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.650
 the orange wire there are two slots that go 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.550
 to the housing is the negative and the white 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.890
 Is the device not 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.390
 and you can see that there are some slots that 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.050
 they go to the positive because in the in the west 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.460
 of Orange 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:29.290
 to the housing is the negative of the micro 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.800
 we have the timer the 555 two transistors 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.780
 2222 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.780
 the transistors 22 22 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.770
 a condenser of 47 micro farewell goodbye 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.910
 by 16 volts 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.910
 a led 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:54.350
 four resistors and only 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.350
 four residences of a dog 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.930
 one withstands a resistance of 10k 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.019
 a resistance of 100 k 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.700
 and a resistance of 330 ohms for the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.859
 other 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.959
 are the tracks downloaded mega down 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.000
 they can download it is also 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.510
 there the mask of components and 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.510
 downloading 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:05:00.240
 they both understand 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.910
 feeling lucky
