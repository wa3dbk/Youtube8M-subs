00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.150
 to assemble a computer is required 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.940
 about 90 minutes 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.219
 hard disk first 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.010
 read head reads information 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 this is a very accurate device 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.859
 the distance between it and the disk is not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.859
 exceed the thickness of a human hair 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.240
 hard disk is installed on 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.750
 intended for him in the computer 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.759
 storage space 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.590
 are two more components removable 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.530
 disk storage device and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.910
 CD reader 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 allowing to read and execute programs 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.969
 recorded on CD-ROM, the two 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.930
 devices are installed in place 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.579
 computer motherboard can 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 compare with the spine because 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.469
 everyone joins her 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.149
 other components 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.480
 this fan cools the heat she is 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129
 a chip some sound cards 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.519
 set right on the mother 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.799
 fee these nests in sequence 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.619
 are sound input sound 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.330
 outlet and socket 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.100
 the microphone is a fixing ring 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.080
 secures the video card when 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 transport and this heat sensor 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.229
 measures the temperature between the processor and 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.229
 motherboard 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.310
 the processor is the brain of the system 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.050
 it decrypts counts and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.050
 carry out the instructions received 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 the processor is installed a special socket 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.920
 the processor fan cools it when 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.900
 strong heat 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.310
 its effectiveness depends on 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.780
 material used 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.290
 and the conductive material provides 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.270
 better cooling ram 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.570
 saves short-term information and 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.520
 erases it when power is turned off 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.430
 memory has less access time 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.490
 compared hard drive or 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.070
 CD is now all the components 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.750
 installed in the case it protects 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.940
 internal components from external 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.830
 impacts at this stage in the hull 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.830
 electronic components are installed 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.380
 several housing connectors from different 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.250
 light indicators connects to 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.250
 motherboard 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.750
 This is the output of the video card through which 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.610
 the monitor connects to the computer and this 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.250
 video chip creating two-dimensional and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.710
 three-dimensional image is video memory 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.580
 the greater its volume the better 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.910
 image on the monitor video card 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.530
 set in place the modem does 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.810
 possible interaction between the two 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.490
 computers generating a clear signal 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.740
 transmitted by telephone line in 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.270
 modem control information sharing 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.690
 between two computers then 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.460
 fax modem set in place 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.690
 power supply convert electrical 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.550
 voltage according to 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.550
 needs of various components 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.400
 then internal wiring is connected 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.960
 it makes it possible 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.090
 information circulate between 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.010
 various devices and maternal 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.900
 fees 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.350
 cd joins ip 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.350
 cable 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.350
 the remaining wiring is connected to 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.350
 various computer components 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.110
 Now build 30 computer components 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.970
 completed before closing the case 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.260
 every computer is tested to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.200
 check how reliable 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.970
 all its components function then 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.100
 close it and start packing 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.390
 this company collects about 300 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.390
 computers every day
