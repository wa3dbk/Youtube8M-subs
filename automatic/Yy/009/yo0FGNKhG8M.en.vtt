00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everyone how are you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.430
 Well, I'm fine after this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.890
 apple keynote that took place yesterday 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.510
 Tuesday, September 10 from 19 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.679
 hours I invite you to see her again I 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.059
 would put a small link of course in the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.530
 description if you have not seen it 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.759
 what is the keynote 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.410
 simply the conference 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.609
 that organizes apple every year for 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.140
 present his new products and 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.189
 today we meet to talk 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.189
 iphone 5 s 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.330
 this iphone what is he going to bring us from 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.860
 more for me not much of the 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.360
 surprises was not that great 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.310
 at the conference since all 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.750
 rumors were true so we did not 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.100
 had great surprise apple did not 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.150
 changed at the last minute for example 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.830
 the name of his smartphone 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.510
 you will tell me that for simple 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.250
 rumors there is no reason in any 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.050
 case we were presented a new 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.460
 processor which is the 7 which would be 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.890
 40 times faster than the first 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.750
 iphone that had been proposed by apple 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.180
 remember and yes what a huge 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.100
 honor to discover this first iphone 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.320
 years ago now we have 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.059
 already the iphone 5 s ii available and 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.430
 then we were of course present and 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.650
 rehashed all night the news 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.250
 colors that this iphone of course can 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.090
 own who is a little pink and gold 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.890
 it's not really pink is actually 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.720
 it's more gold color they could not 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.760
 call it champagne this color 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.610
 since of course the word champagne is 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.050
 used and to a trademark so one 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.100
 can not use it as we wish 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.110
 by the way, I'm going to maybe 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.000
 to yell at it if I say it and 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.370
 then of course the footprints 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.110
 digital and yes you will be able to 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.640
 present secure your smartphone your 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.440
 device thanks to your thumb everything 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.730
 simply on the home button so the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.710
 button that you talk about coming back to 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.390
 menu you have the opportunity now 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.280
 to position your finger on it and to 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.140
 inside of it is a 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.910
 fingerprint scanner you 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.380
 of course you can secure your 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.370
 online shopping with your smartphone 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 thanks to this one 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.610
 on the other hand I find this innovation 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.050
 really nice because they 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.490
 did not exist yet on others 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.410
 smartphones or in any case was not 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.540
 really put forward and I think 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.580
 it is for me the only one where is the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.230
 only specifications that will be able to me 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.730
 to buy maybe or not this 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.230
 iphone 5 is what you will be of course 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.790
 if you have the right to an unpacking of 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.930
 this one but honestly that 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.509
 would surprise me in any case not for all 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.649
 immediately considering the price well yes next 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.769
 prices as you can imagine 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.180
 since the 16 giga is proposed to 699 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.000
 euros which is not nothing 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.280
 the 32 gigas is offered at 799 and well 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 sure we're still crazier the 64 giga 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.090
 is offered at 899 euros 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.379
 I find that I find that these prices are 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.330
 a bit exorbitant for a simple 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.190
 smartphone excuse me really i love 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.629
 apple i love samsung i dont want 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.489
 absolutely not make war between the 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.260
 two words clearly seen the price of 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.000
 smartphones today knowing that the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 low cost which we will talk about soon in 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.750
 a 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.370
 a video I will present it well 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.060
 sure do not worry as well as the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.890
 bone 7 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.390
 as soon as it is released and if my memories 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.720
 are good it's the 18th of September the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.430
 exit 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.379
 so I look forward to it for 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.030
 present you all that we spent the 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.590
 half of the conference or a little bit more 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.450
 from half of the conference to us 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.549
 talk about the camera that would be 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 of course a lot better a lot more 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.909
 nice for night photos a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.159
 little advantage these cases present you have 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.659
 two flash on the iphone 5 is this it's going 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.609
 allow you to just simply sleep 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.879
 more brightness in the photos of 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.650
 night 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.390
 but I remember that it's a little 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.530
 message to the photographers but that the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.090
 do not know because we have a flash that the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.500
 photo goes head better 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.569
 we will simply have a better 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.280
 brightness if I get into the 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.019
 specifications of the photograph on 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.489
 will not need to have an iso what 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.409
 is the sensitivity to very light 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.090
 high so that will allow us to have 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.260
 still good pictures but know 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.359
 one thing is that whatever happens 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.730
 the iphone 5 aces does not embark a very 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.709
 good sensitivity to light and that his 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.750
 rival will never be there with a reflex by 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.340
 example the video and well yes they have 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.989
 once again improved since this 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.079
 it will be possible to film in 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.310
 hd movie and 120 frames per second I 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.470
 believe if my memories are good that 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.090
 it was 60 frames / second or 30th 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.199
 do not know anymore I do not know how they 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.000
 have done to make such an improvement 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:48.150
 since the habit of it is really going 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.980
 crescendo and there we had really not a 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.389
 great surprise since the 120 images 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.849
 by seconds it's going to be very nice 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.010
 for the slow motion option which is at 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.139
 present accessible on the iphone 5 is 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.180
 so it's thanks to link to the 7 that 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.750
 will also be released on the 18th 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.220
 September 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.389
 what is the slow motion and well 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.549
 it's just when you go 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.379
 film a scene and you go the 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.459
 position in slow motion hold on I look 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.459
 will you do a little live example 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.769
 this is the small scene that come 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.810
 unrolled well was not in pictures 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.000
 real and well no I had it all 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.410
 simply slowed down at editing this is a 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.579
 very simple little thing to do 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.729
 why do not you propose it in 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.770
 a tutorial on Magic video I will think the 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.080
 marketing the iphone 5s and 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.180
 well will be available on September 20th on 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.550
 will be able to get it that day but 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.960
 waiting knowing that bones 7 comes out two 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.669
 days before we can of course 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.770
 enjoy and enjoy this new 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.990
 operating system on our iphone 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.400
 current talk about the battery no 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.110
 great novelty this year since 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.520
 it's a battery really similar to 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.300
 the previous one found on 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.669
 the iphone 5 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.350
 on the other hand the s7 we suppose they 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.630
 Bejart has a lot better this news 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.610
 battery so will increase a bit our 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.010
 lifetime on our smartphone 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.510
 according to tests done by apple is 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.450
 confirmed yesterday at the keynote 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.070
 we will have ten hours of autonomy in 4g 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.270
 so this is the new connection that 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.860
 allows us to have a connection 10 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.900
 times faster than 3g to access 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.300
 to internet from his smartphone and one 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.160
 will have 40 hours of autonomy to listen 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.900
 music on his smartphone which 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.760
 is good very practical and very correct 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.260
 in any case but for this battery not 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.940
 new official batteries 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
 advertised in my opinion it's more of a 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.720
 improvement of the operating system 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.190
 of the iowa state that will handle a little better 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.570
 this one is all passionate 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.789
 of apple I will advise you of a 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.530
 pitch your tent right in front 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.300
 the apple store since the iphone 5 and will be 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.900
 available for pre-order on the 13th 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.240
 September 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.800
 attention it's in two days I 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.510
 will finish the video by giving you a little 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.430
 my impressions about this iphone 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.979
 5 pieces for me no big 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.210
 novelty if not that the whole idea 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.880
 it's called like that so the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.200
 fingerprint security 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.789
 it will be very convenient for 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.830
 unlock his smartphone without having 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.570
 of code or without getting stung 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.650
 phone if we are in the evening there will be 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.630
 no more interest in applying your 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.130
 phone if 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.200
 and apart so if you cut back 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.910
 with this will be possible iphone 5 and get 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.740
 will of course always sell as well 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.510
 since being passionate about apple and 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.770
 all users being chapel 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.450
 will continue to buy the product 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.860
 apple 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.440
 yet I think that given the prices 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.820
 exorbitant at 64 giga be at 900 euros 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.720
 for the price of a smartphone I find 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.550
 it's really huge 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.750
 I hope in any case that nobody will 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.160
 really pay that price since you 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.080
 know that now with the operators 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.420
 we really have big discounts when 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.650
 we take a new package but 900 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.340
 euros entry into a smartphone I 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.200
 find it a little expensive 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.670
 I will end up recalling the news 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.710
 more important ones that have marked us 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.810
 This iPhone for 5 s and the arrival of the 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.280
 secure by fingerprint that 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.140
 going to be very convenient is in my opinion 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.390
 very seller especially for the type of 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.470
 professional clients then there are the 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.790
 two flash led which are now 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.860
 available on the back of the device 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.800
 photo which will allow us to have a 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.210
 photo really more correct and of course 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.830
 I forgot to specify but the home 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.900
 button has changed as you can 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.030
 see now in picture here 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.830
 that's not the same at all 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.450
 has only one ring just since it 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.340
 there is the fingerprint to insert at 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.110
 inside I hope this little 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.790
 video you will have liked I will try to 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.860
 do pretty much the same type of videos 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.510
 for iphone 5 that's how the usaid 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.040
 to give you my impressions before 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.480
 to be able to test all that on this 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.800
