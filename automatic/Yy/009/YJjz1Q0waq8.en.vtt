not very well known here but on the
label<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.550> biofuels<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.500> big

alone from food and this is already
affecting<00:00:47.159> a<00:00:48.170> many<00:00:49.170> countries<00:00:49.710> especially

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
affecting a many countries especially

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.549 
affecting a many countries especially
the<00:00:50.640> food<00:00:50.850> security<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> prices<00:00:52.140> are

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the food security because the prices are

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.610 
the food security because the prices are
other<00:00:53.100> fully<00:00:53.479> it's<00:00:54.479> going<00:00:54.780> off<00:00:54.930> basic<00:00:55.409> foods

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
other fully it's going off basic foods

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.530 
other fully it's going off basic foods
like<00:00:55.800> corn<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.580> Central<00:00:56.909> America<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.390> Mexico

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
like corn in Central America and Mexico

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.380 
like corn in Central America and Mexico
are<00:00:58.400> really<00:00:59.400> really<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.269> I<00:01:00.330> think

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
are really really going up and I think

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.189 
are really really going up and I think
that<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.049> one<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.680> main<00:01:02.690> threats<00:01:03.690> as

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
that this is one of the main threats as

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
that this is one of the main threats as

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
well to work food security and global

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.990 
well to work food security and global
security<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> idea<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.430> bio<00:01:08.700> field

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
security the idea of the bio field

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.889 
security the idea of the bio field
itself<00:01:10.070> it's<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> bad<00:01:11.549> idea<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.659> sense

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
itself it's not a bad idea in the sense

that a bio field is something that is is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330 
that a bio field is something that is is
renewable<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.829> something<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.219> you're

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
renewable so it's something that you're

global climate change and things like
that<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.759> an<00:01:47.909> old<00:01:48.000> trick<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.649> these<00:01:50.399> ideas

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that it's an old trick and these ideas

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.239 
that it's an old trick and these ideas
visually<00:01:51.210> came<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:53.929> maybe<00:01:54.929> a<00:01:55.079> year<00:01:55.469> ago<00:01:55.590> by<00:01:55.979> by

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
visually came a maybe a year ago by by

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.990 
visually came a maybe a year ago by by
george<00:01:56.700> bush<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.990> know

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
george bush you know

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.200 
george bush you know
it's<00:02:01.000> totally<00:02:01.659> crazy<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.280> mind<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.820> to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
it's totally crazy just in mind that to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.410 
it's totally crazy just in mind that to
produce<00:02:05.070> ethanol<00:02:06.630> from<00:02:07.630> corn<00:02:07.719> it<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:10.000> more

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
produce ethanol from corn it is more

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.530 
produce ethanol from corn it is more
energy<00:02:11.019> than<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.530> ethanol<00:02:11.980> will<00:02:12.310> give<00:02:12.580> so

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
energy than this ethanol will give so

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.009 
energy than this ethanol will give so
it's<00:02:13.690> totally<00:02:13.920> unsustainable<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.870> but<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
it's totally unsustainable and but the

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's totally unsustainable and but the
idea<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:19.180> have<00:02:19.360> another<00:02:19.660> way<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.620> have

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
idea is like to have another way to have

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.570 
idea is like to have another way to have
more<00:02:21.580> market<00:02:22.379> labels<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.709> ideas<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.459> to

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
more market labels and ideas and to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.650 
more market labels and ideas and to
