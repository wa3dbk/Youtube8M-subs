00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to 400 megabytes because daisy is not

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.170 
to 400 megabytes because daisy is not
going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.340> much<00:00:56.399> bigger<00:00:56.640> than<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.850> and

see<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.350> Sam<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.520> disks<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.000> everything<00:01:45.450> will

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
see it Sam the disks I everything will

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
see it Sam the disks I everything will
be<00:01:45.750> kind<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.049> grayed<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.619> way<00:01:46.770> it'll

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
be kind of grayed out in that way it'll

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.560 
be kind of grayed out in that way it'll
be<00:01:47.100> back<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.280> unformatted<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.360> fine

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
be back to unformatted but that's fine

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.410 
be back to unformatted but that's fine
that's<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.420> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that's the way you want it to be and so

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it this is the hard drive it is created

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.010 
it this is the hard drive it is created
it's<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.710> made<00:01:59.070> windows<00:01:59.759> think<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.180> it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it's it's made windows think it's it's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's it's made windows think it's it's
made<00:02:01.229> my<00:02:01.380> computer<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.130> has<00:02:02.250> another

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
made my computer think it has another

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
made my computer think it has another
hard<00:02:02.700> drive<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.270> Sony<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.899> 400

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
hard drive on it with Sony got like 400

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
hard drive on it with Sony got like 400
megabytes<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.090> trying<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
megabytes and that's what it's trying to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.570 
megabytes and that's what it's trying to
do<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.960> come<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.350> f<00:02:07.530> on<00:02:07.710> mine<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.220> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
do and it's come up as f on mine but it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.160 
do and it's come up as f on mine but it
could<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.940> any<00:02:09.119> other<00:02:09.270> later<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.660> yours<00:02:09.869> just

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
quickly how much better it is in speed

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.199 
quickly how much better it is in speed
like<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.400> speed<00:02:23.670> stuff<00:02:23.939> what<00:02:24.180> I

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
like in all that speed stuff what I

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.910 
like in all that speed stuff what I
don't<00:02:24.480> know<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.989> technical<00:02:25.140> term<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.890> is

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
don't know the technical term for it is

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.949 
don't know the technical term for it is
but<00:02:26.329> it's<00:02:27.329> just<00:02:27.569> showing<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.810> how<00:02:27.930> much

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
but it's just showing you how much

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.080 
but it's just showing you how much
better<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.469> what<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.769> get<00:02:28.920> for<00:02:29.370> normally<00:02:29.879> on

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
better is what I get for normally on

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.960 
better is what I get for normally on
when<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.140> write<00:02:31.439> to<00:02:31.799> my<00:02:32.129> external<00:02:32.489> hard<00:02:32.700> drive

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
when I write to my external hard drive

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.759 
when I write to my external hard drive
is<00:02:33.120> what<00:02:33.269> I'd<00:02:33.390> usually<00:02:33.689> do<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.140> record<00:02:34.470> i<00:02:34.590> only

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
is what I'd usually do to record i only

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.899 
is what I'd usually do to record i only
get<00:02:34.890> 20<00:02:35.930> mb<00:02:36.930> per<00:02:37.769> second<00:02:38.159> kind<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.549> thing<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
get 20 mb per second kind of thing and

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.800 
get 20 mb per second kind of thing and
this<00:02:39.389> gets<00:02:39.829> 2800<00:02:40.829> which<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.970> absolutely

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
this gets 2800 which is a absolutely

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.440 
this gets 2800 which is a absolutely
insane<00:02:43.290> increase<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.099> that's<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.760> how

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
insane increase so this that's just how

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.770 
insane increase so this that's just how
it<00:02:45.840> should<00:02:46.170> make<00:02:46.620> your<00:02:47.090> daisy<00:02:48.090> run<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> whole

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
it should make your daisy run a whole

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.690 
it should make your daisy run a whole
lot<00:02:48.959> smoother<00:02:49.319> because<00:02:49.439> that's<00:02:50.280> how<00:02:50.519> it's

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
lot smoother because that's how it's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.129 
lot smoother because that's how it's
gonna<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.359> how<00:02:51.510> it's<00:02:51.629> going<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> do<00:02:51.959> it's

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
gonna that's how it's going to do it's

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.750 
gonna that's how it's going to do it's
just<00:02:52.290> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.560> running<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:52.919> such<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.129> fast

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
just going to be running on such a fast

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.349 
just going to be running on such a fast
system<00:02:54.329> so<00:02:55.109> then<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.549> for<00:02:56.579> steam<00:02:56.939> users

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
system so then this is for steam users

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.929 
system so then this is for steam users
now<00:02:57.480> because<00:02:57.780> I've<00:02:57.989> actually<00:02:58.669> gotten<00:02:59.669> it

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
now because I've actually gotten it

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.569 
now because I've actually gotten it
through<00:03:00.299> steam<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:01.069> he<00:03:02.069> had<00:03:02.220> done<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.519> a

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
through steam and he had done it a

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.479 
through steam and he had done it a
different<00:03:02.700> way<00:03:02.939> he<00:03:03.239> went<00:03:03.450> through<00:03:04.069> like<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.129> say
