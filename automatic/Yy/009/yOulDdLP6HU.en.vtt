00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
together this escape plan but the point

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.789 
together this escape plan but the point
is<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.270> get<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.509> parts<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.109> assemble<00:01:50.709> this

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
is to get the parts and assemble this

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.999 
is to get the parts and assemble this
plane<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.399> they<00:01:51.520> can<00:01:51.700> get<00:01:51.789> off<00:01:52.060> whoa<00:01:52.450> whoa<00:01:53.009> we
