00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.929
 he said glad he had to do the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.160
 World fortunate as she is 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.439
 making Portuguese as the language of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 work did not count on the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.539
 flood in which he also consented 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 talk to each of the characters 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.980
 history of the world can maintain this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.129
 regime is sinking as it is legal 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 because all the things I've done 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.719
 from the first moment building paulo 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:52.170
 the blame mission trust project is 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:55.680
 bring to Brazil and for the accounts to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.149
 we made stronger or our yes 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.399
 game or talk 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.460
 we know that our players are 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.990
 the first requirement to receive a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.990
 legal product is one of 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.670
 such project of its characters 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.080
 I think the characters that orders 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 are from the book because we show magic with 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.460
 technology old and simple but very 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:27.030
 interesting but I think more than that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:34.710
 they have a strong group that has a whole 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.509
 story of one to one 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.380
 but still managed to stand out 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.380
 Flamengo 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.730
 but as the team reach difficult from the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:54.570
 which is called us but the two agents already 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:56.610
 more than ten years, so it's up to every 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:04.200
 one of them 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:07.560
 the people chosen to function 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.480
 I was happy for trusting me, right? 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:24.780
 to do continuous work 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:29.760
 first the egg and the comics 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.650
 gold in sodium GINA them and sense oo 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.510
 character of the other character after 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:51.480
 fÃ¡bio passed easily in the world is a great 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:03:03.620
 game character game history 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:03.620
 the fans of history people want to see 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:23.010
 They're always gta who were 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.049
 understand the game so who is 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.470
 the goal can take advantage of the history of a 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.330
 way that gets negative the most so 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.340
 tell 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.140
 Who is also coming in now and going? 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.240
 starting with the side that story before 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.060
 of the game to understand who the people are 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:46.440
 who was there and become your 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.940
 law is to make an initial effort to 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.940
 elevation of the vagina 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.760
 The girls do not really like you. 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.920
 draw and explain you do not have a 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:10.170
 I chose to like to do these 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:13.200
 characters in instructing people not to 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.170
 it's months at last slowly 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.090
 we will come to a little more often will I 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.700
 I'm learning to deal with them. 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:30.530
 were real people less defects 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:34.650
 them today will be used one 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:39.150
 writing much what to invent 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:44.250
 people here before the game that game 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:53.370
 did not explain the beginning of the game 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:59.490
 no longer waiting for us 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:09.000
 since the Brazilian and monitors and or the 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:11.810
 history and certainly the name of the game and 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.810
 with the characters 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.060
 very cool
