00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
pixels that heather play around and see

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.670 
pixels that heather play around and see
what<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.439> like

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
what you like

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
what you like
somewhere<00:02:05.610> around<00:02:05.700> those<00:02:06.090> numbers<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:07.110> good

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
somewhere around those numbers is a good

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.169 
somewhere around those numbers is a good
place<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.530> start

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
place to start

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.930 
place to start
so<00:02:09.179> then<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> very<00:02:11.430> large<00:02:11.580> photo

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so then if you have a very large photo

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.390 
so then if you have a very large photo
you<00:02:12.330> can<00:02:12.510> actually<00:02:12.660> dress

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
you can actually dress

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.729 
you can actually dress
and<00:02:13.519> drop<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.180> selection<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.379> choose<00:02:15.409> a

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
and drop the selection to choose a

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.070 
and drop the selection to choose a
certain<00:02:16.220> part<00:02:16.459> of<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.420> I'm<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:17.840> going<00:02:17.989> to

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
certain part of it so I'm just going to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.320 
certain part of it so I'm just going to
go<00:02:18.200> ahead<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.680> choose<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.220> selection<00:02:19.819> and

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
go ahead and choose that selection and

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.410 
go ahead and choose that selection and
hit<00:02:20.599> apply<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.920> will<00:02:22.040> cut<00:02:22.310> my<00:02:22.610> header<00:02:22.879> down

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
hit apply and it will cut my header down

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.619 
hit apply and it will cut my header down
to<00:02:23.750> size<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.549> good<00:02:25.700> idea<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:26.120> change<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
to size it's a good idea to change the

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.660 
to size it's a good idea to change the
exposure<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.590> lot<00:02:28.069> of<00:02:28.190> your<00:02:28.310> photos
