Sweets Tales

00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:11.133
Today is the story of wagashi tied together by destiny: Ichigo Daifuku.

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:24.233
The king of wagashi: Mame Daifuku
(mochi stuffed with red bean paste)
The idol of the fruit world: Strawberry

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:31.199
These two first met on February 6, 1985.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.267
Akebonobashi, Tokyo.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:45.500
Ichigo Daifuku was invented by the third owner of wagashi shop Oosumi-tamaya.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.966
You can call him cupid.

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:53.733
The shop was originally known for its mame daifuku.

00:00:55.466 --> 00:01:02.133
The saltiness and texture of beans in the mochi made it a longtime favorite. 

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:11.000
Even still, the owner repeated the process of trial and error
in hopes of creating something new.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:22.266
Then, when he was 33, he thought of Strawberry Daifuku. 

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:32.466
The idea of putting a whole raw strawberry in wagashi gave the public a shock.

00:01:33.932 --> 00:01:41.699
Most people were startled. I was overwhelmed with people asking,
Is this edible?; Is this okay?

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:48.699
Putting a whole strawberry directly inside
was something people found unique and interesting.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.699
Ichigo Daifuku became an instant hit,
and in the blink of an eye was selling thousands per day.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.233
This popularity spread across the country,
and now Ichigo Daifuku has become a staple wagashi.

00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:14.899
The origin of this success can be traced to the ownerâ€™s younger years
when he would spend all his time playing make-believe shop owner.

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:22.500
Since I was young, I loved creating something that people enjoyed, 
and making money from it.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.500
I learned by watching others.
I would nearly skip class to make things like pudding.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.650
I wanted to make anything and everything.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.233
His dream as a young boy lead him to Ichigo Daifuku;

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:44.699
the dawn of a new wagashi.
