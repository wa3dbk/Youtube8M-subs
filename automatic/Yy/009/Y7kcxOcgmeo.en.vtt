00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay I'm gonna show you how to make a

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.030 
okay I'm gonna show you how to make a
great<00:00:02.909> paper<00:00:03.480> plane<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:04.560> we<00:00:04.650> start<00:00:04.890> off<00:00:04.980> with

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
great paper plane so we start off with

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.860 
great paper plane so we start off with
an<00:00:05.460> a4<00:00:06.180> piece<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.839> paper<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:08.330> we<00:00:09.330> just<00:00:09.510> turn<00:00:09.750> it

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
an a4 piece of paper and we just turn it

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.509 
an a4 piece of paper and we just turn it
over<00:00:10.019> like<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:11.360> till<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.509> about<00:00:13.519> you

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
over like that and till it's about you

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.300 
over like that and till it's about you
know<00:00:14.639> fifty<00:00:15.320> millimeters<00:00:16.320> or<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:17.130> two

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
know fifty millimeters or about two

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.960 
know fifty millimeters or about two
inches<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:18.510> edge<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.080> from<00:00:19.820> from<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
inches this edge here from from the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.470 
inches this edge here from from the
internet<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.199> edge<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:23.269> the<00:00:24.269> end

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
internet but from that edge to the end

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.839 
internet but from that edge to the end
of<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.260> other<00:00:25.380> sheet<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.010> paper<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.670> about

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
of the other sheet of paper it's about

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.320 
of the other sheet of paper it's about
two<00:00:27.060> inches<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.810> 50<00:00:28.500> millimeters<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.970> fold<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
two inches or 50 millimeters so fold it

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.119 
two inches or 50 millimeters so fold it
down<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:32.809> spin<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.930> over<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:36.920> fold<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
down like that spin it over and fold it

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.069 
down like that spin it over and fold it
down<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.700> crease<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> middle<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
down a crease down the middle like that

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.819 
down a crease down the middle like that
and<00:00:41.480> then<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.750> each<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.050> these<00:00:43.170> corners<00:00:43.710> this

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and then from each of these corners this

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
and then from each of these corners this
corner<00:00:48.050> fold<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.520> like<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.059> same

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
corner fold that in like that and same

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.740 
corner fold that in like that and same
for<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.899> other<00:00:52.050> side

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
for the other side

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
for the other side
certainiy<00:00:54.750> planes<00:00:55.079> sort<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> started<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> take

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
certainiy planes sort of started to take

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
certainiy planes sort of started to take
take<00:00:57.000> shape<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.350> should<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.680> this

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
take shape and you should have this

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
take shape and you should have this
little<00:00:59.100> lip<00:00:59.309> down<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.420> bottom<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.809> you've

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
little lip down the bottom if you've

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.859 
little lip down the bottom if you've
done<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.140> correctly<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.850> little<00:01:03.270> lip

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.320 

just<00:01:06.869> folds<00:01:07.320> over<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.490> top<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.850> those<00:01:08.970> two

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
just folds over the top of those two

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.719 
just folds over the top of those two
triangular<00:01:09.810> pieces<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.530> holds<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.369> all<00:01:11.490> into

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
triangular pieces and holds it all into

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.170 
triangular pieces and holds it all into
place<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> once<00:01:13.439> you've<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.920> done<00:01:14.180> what

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
place so once you've got that done what

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.850 
place so once you've got that done what
you<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> flip<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.110> over<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:18.860> just

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
you want to do is flip it over and just

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
you want to do is flip it over and just
a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.490> felt<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.729> edge<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
a little I felt this edge there like

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
a little I felt this edge there like
that<00:01:26.360> not<00:01:27.360> terribly<00:01:27.750> big<00:01:28.049> edge<00:01:28.229> was<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> great

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that not terribly big edge was a great

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.710 
that not terribly big edge was a great
book<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:30.680> it's<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:32.509> eight<00:01:33.509> or<00:01:33.689> nine

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
book there it's about eight or nine

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.770 
book there it's about eight or nine
millimeters<00:01:34.759> in<00:01:35.759> about<00:01:36.210> quarter<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> an<00:01:36.689> inch

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
millimeters in about quarter of an inch

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.710 
millimeters in about quarter of an inch
of<00:01:37.020> space<00:01:37.939> like<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> edge<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.720> fold

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
of space like that on that edge and fold

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.280 
of space like that on that edge and fold
down<00:01:43.310> same<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> other<00:01:44.790> side<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.329> so

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
down same on the other side like that so

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.920 
down same on the other side like that so
we've<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.770> little<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.600> edge

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
we've got that little that little edge

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.030 
we've got that little that little edge
they<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:49.619> what's<00:01:49.860> gonna

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
they like that and that's what's gonna

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.130 
they like that and that's what's gonna
help<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.700> plane<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.570> fly<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.020> well

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
help this plane to fly really well

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:03.420 
help this plane to fly really well
okay<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.200> folded<00:01:58.159> fold<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.399> that<00:02:01.490> yep

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
okay so folded fold it up like that yep

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.359 
okay so folded fold it up like that yep
and<00:02:05.670> yep<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.180> I'm<00:02:07.270> gonna<00:02:07.390> leave<00:02:08.220> what's<00:02:09.220> that

and yep so I'm gonna leave what's that
about<00:02:09.520> 20<00:02:09.910> mil<00:02:11.490> almost<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.640> each<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:14.080> should

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
about 20 mil almost in each you should

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.570 
about 20 mil almost in each you should
piece<00:02:14.440> out<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.830> that's<00:02:14.950> sort<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
piece out that that's sort of the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.910 
piece out that that's sort of the
fuselage<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.540> your<00:02:16.840> plane<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.410> there's<00:02:17.710> your

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
fuselage of your plane and there's your

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.250 
fuselage of your plane and there's your
wings<00:02:18.480> taking<00:02:19.480> shape<00:02:19.780> there<00:02:21.960> turn<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.080> over

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
wings taking shape there turn it over

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.060 
wings taking shape there turn it over
and<00:02:24.960> do<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.110> same<00:02:26.140> on<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> other<00:02:26.620> side<00:02:29.070> and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
and do the same on the other side and

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.040 
and do the same on the other side and
just<00:02:31.030> turn<00:02:31.300> up<00:02:31.450> these<00:02:33.510> little<00:02:34.510> pieces<00:02:34.630> at<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
just turn up these little pieces at the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.210 
just turn up these little pieces at the
end<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.320> hell<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> floor<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.010> that's<00:02:36.130> a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
end to hell the floor and that's a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.310 
end to hell the floor and that's a
properly<00:02:36.550> about<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.720> know<00:02:37.840> three<00:02:38.080> quarters

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
properly about you know three quarters

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.350 
properly about you know three quarters
of<00:02:38.530> an<00:02:38.620> inch<00:02:38.710> or<00:02:39.400> around<00:02:39.670> about<00:02:39.910> 20<00:02:40.300> mils<00:02:42.360> lines

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
of an inch or around about 20 mils lines

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:52.310 
of an inch or around about 20 mils lines
both<00:02:44.230> sides<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.250> slide<00:02:45.520> flaps<00:02:48.570> okay

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.360 

and<00:02:53.320> there<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:53.740> have<00:02:53.980> it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
and there we have it
