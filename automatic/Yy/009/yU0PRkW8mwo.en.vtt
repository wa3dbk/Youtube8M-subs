00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.620
 at 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.620
 at 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.270
 hello friends here is a friend brought me here 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.340
 such tank frame without sang and without 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.759
 nuts for milling machine for for 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.259
 clamping small cuts for small 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.890
 milling machine apparently type 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.900
 school-to-one side spindle with 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.820
 one side they it has a morse cone 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.879
 number two on the other hand is internal 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.330
 cone steeper angle well according to my 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.250
 approximate calculation am7 24 complexity 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.030
 it's hard to believe this one 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.970
 small cone and labor and make 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.150
 sanga so she came back immediately 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.400
 same without a fit and so first the first 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.199
 the collet option didn't work because 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.500
 that cone simply did not agree i did 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.890
 Sangu with proportions 7 24 what a pair of what 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.510
 it turned out there but did not agree therefore 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.240
 it was decided to do a little differently 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.900
 rock the female herself with this one 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.990
 fit and without turning the sled already 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.899
 not me their state of affairs is fair 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.140
 groove already at the same angle itself 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.060
 actually collet and for starters you can 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.140
 see and I tried to do it on such 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.490
 here is the console mandrel this sangu to 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.170
 minimize radial runout 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.329
 holes relative to the outer 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.670
 the conical part but it did not give much 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.249
 result and so later i'm here and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.590
 put in centro well preloaded that 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:49.009
 purely due to frictional forces it rotated and 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.600
 I cut a small shavings I processed it 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.049
 On fair but this and the right gift 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 centers beating is minimal 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.920
 already characterized by this error 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.880
 the centers themselves for us seemingly nothing 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 ok it turned out now 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.829
 mandrel this is her native cone 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.840
 which was a factory how would finish off at 7 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.209
 sotok is almost ten so he us it 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.060
 not sorry and even more so 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.600
 so that the cones have accuracy already 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.370
 my tallest gate on the same 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.980
 sled with the same angle 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.490
 without changing the protaras then what you are already on 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.230
 new corner 7 24 live us by 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.560
 theoretical in our theoretical 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.990
 calculation means here was the old corner 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.930
 cooler so we have there like 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.460
 there is a stock of metal outside we are at the exit 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.390
 practically do not remove chips 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.420
 touch rice 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.060
 and further into the depths and he does not cut depth 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.890
 increases and we do in general without 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.160
 damage and without doing a new cone 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.860
 and we will have the right proportion 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.850
 held at the maximum correct 7 7 7 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.890
 24 as here is how milling standard 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.890
 cone cabinet in the spindles of large machines 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.240
 summer will not happen itself 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.910
 jamming the bar itself will be removed 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.890
 easy due to the fact that the angle of the cone 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.640
 pretty big well, that's natural but 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.500
 we checked 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.600
 after boring of course no heartbeat 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.040
 No, but you can be different 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.920
 material hardness can 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.390
 some kind of hardening so you checked 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.370
 whether roundness and so on well, all 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.810
 ok well here we are in advance 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.980
 put the sangu not cut yet 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.780
 just stuck to climb so 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.200
 offhand check checked before 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.330
 beating well like or two hundred for us 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.120
 it seems to be in 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.240
 normal result and now cut 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.370
 her into four parts neatly 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.410
 thin frezoy hetera thickness she has one 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.690
 millimeter probably well, now we 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.580
 put the ready sangu very beat 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.780
 friezes are different happens as she 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.080
 there will be some errors 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.960
 installation somewhere between three and could for 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.820
 almost zero position here's how 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.650
 here for example we have here somewhere 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.630
 literally one hundred point even less 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:12.410
 beats well in general, the result seems to be for 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.910
 The beginnings turned out to be normal. 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.910
 goodbye
