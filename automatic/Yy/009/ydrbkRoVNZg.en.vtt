I've<00:03:16.760> got<00:03:17.090> bored<00:03:17.360> around<00:03:17.840> februari<00:03:18.440> march

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
I've got bored around februari march

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.640 
I've got bored around februari march
after<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> first<00:03:20.150> map<00:03:20.390> pack<00:03:20.660> it<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.440> hasn't

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
after the first map pack it just hasn't

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.470 
after the first map pack it just hasn't
kept<00:03:21.980> me<00:03:22.100> excited<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:23.090> they're<00:03:23.300> just

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
kept me excited it's like they're just

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.270 
kept me excited it's like they're just
throwing<00:03:23.900> out<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.380> same<00:03:24.590> map<00:03:24.800> pack<00:03:25.040> four

throwing out the same map pack four
times<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.890> think<00:03:27.890> it<00:03:28.130> deals<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.730> can<00:03:28.790> help

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
times and I think it deals you can help

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.480 
times and I think it deals you can help
keep<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.050> game<00:03:30.260> going<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.860> that's<00:03:31.010> what<00:03:31.310> black

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
keep a game going and that's what black

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.540 
some people didn't like it when it came
out<00:03:35.840> because<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.260> was<00:03:36.350> too<00:03:36.470> futuristic<00:03:36.890> but

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
out because it was too futuristic but

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.030 
out because it was too futuristic but

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
first but you know if it comes down to

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.659

to stink I really

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.950 
to stink I really
and<00:04:21.579> it's<00:04:22.030> sledgehammer<00:04:22.300> they<00:04:22.689> might

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
and it's sledgehammer they might

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.360 
and it's sledgehammer they might
approach<00:04:23.319> in<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.650> different<00:04:23.979> way<00:04:24.099> with<00:04:24.340> a

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
approach in a different way with a

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.629 
approach in a different way with a
different<00:04:24.819> schedule<00:04:26.400> different<00:04:27.400> things

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
different schedule different things

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.700 
different schedule different things
maybe<00:04:28.030> more<00:04:28.330> weapons<00:04:28.780> maybe<00:04:29.050> killstreaks

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
maybe more weapons maybe killstreaks

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.920 
maybe more weapons maybe killstreaks
maybe<00:04:29.919> equipment<00:04:30.520> could<00:04:31.029> bring<00:04:31.240> dlc<00:04:31.689> and<00:04:31.719> they

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
maybe equipment could bring dlc and they

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.950 
maybe equipment could bring dlc and they
might<00:04:32.080> even<00:04:32.199> do<00:04:32.379> monthly<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.949> never<00:04:33.129> know<00:04:33.960> but

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
might even do monthly you never know but

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.809 
might even do monthly you never know but
i'm<00:04:35.229> hoping<00:04:35.439> they<00:04:35.740> keep<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.189> format<00:04:36.430> pack

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
i'm hoping they keep it the format pack

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.239 
i'm hoping they keep it the format pack
just<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.389> doesn't<00:04:37.419> cause<00:04:37.810> hate<00:04:38.110> i'm<00:04:38.409> hoping

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:39.249 
just so it doesn't cause hate i'm hoping

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:41.309 
just so it doesn't cause hate i'm hoping
the<00:04:39.430> maps<00:04:39.759> they<00:04:39.999> bring<00:04:40.270> they<00:04:40.419> really<00:04:40.990> really

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
the maps they bring they really really

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.559 
the maps they bring they really really
concentrate<00:04:42.009> on<00:04:42.069> the<00:04:42.129> maps<00:04:42.430> because<00:04:43.150> we<00:04:43.449> know

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 
concentrate on the maps because we know

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.269 
concentrate on the maps because we know
it's<00:04:43.749> going<00:04:43.779> to<00:04:43.900> be<00:04:43.960> mapped<00:04:44.259> in<00:04:44.499> the<00:04:44.710> LCM<00:04:45.099> map

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:45.279 
it's going to be mapped in the LCM map

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.300 
it's going to be mapped in the LCM map
pack<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.870> i<00:04:46.900> really<00:04:47.379> hope<00:04:47.560> they<00:04:47.710> concentrate

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
pack but i really hope they concentrate

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.489 
pack but i really hope they concentrate
on<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:48.580> simply<00:04:49.029> because<00:04:49.389> maps<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.319> past

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:50.499 
on that simply because maps in the past

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:51.749 
on that simply because maps in the past
haven't<00:04:50.710> been<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.949> best<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.310> really<00:04:51.610> like

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.550 
haven't been the best I really like
black<00:04:52.029> ops<00:04:52.210> 1<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.689> packs<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.259> thought<00:04:53.469> they

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
black ops 1 that packs I thought they

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.589 
black ops 1 that packs I thought they
were<00:04:53.620> really<00:04:53.949> good<00:04:54.099> really<00:04:54.550> solid<00:04:55.029> and<00:04:55.210> that

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
were really good really solid and that

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.540 
were really good really solid and that
was<00:04:55.750> me<00:04:55.990> not<00:04:56.229> because<00:04:56.379> they<00:04:57.009> didn't<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.520> was

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
was me not because they didn't it was

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.939 
was me not because they didn't it was
the<00:04:57.849> same<00:04:58.029> thing<00:04:58.330> four<00:04:58.569> times<00:04:58.599> but<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.740> maps

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
the same thing four times but the maps

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.950 
the same thing four times but the maps
they<00:05:00.159> brang<00:05:00.400> were<00:05:00.580> really<00:05:01.090> really<00:05:01.389> solid<00:05:01.689> I

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
they brang were really really solid I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.610 
they brang were really really solid I
liked<00:05:02.349> a<00:05:02.590> lot<00:05:02.889> of<00:05:03.069> the<00:05:03.159> dlc<00:05:03.550> map<00:05:03.759> stadium
