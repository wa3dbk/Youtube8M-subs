00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.840
 one of the greatest tragedies that can 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.610
 to exist is to have a spinal cord injury 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.070
 it's not just a disease for one's own 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.939
 patient if not a disease that 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.640
 it also affects the family nucleus 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.430
 patients who are unable to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.290
 mobilize walking patients 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.390
 they have problems controlling so much 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.989
 of the urinary sphincter like that of the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.010
 anal disinterest patients who have 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:49.620
 problems to feed yourself dressing and 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.620
 be independent the current therapies 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.890
 supported by physical therapy and 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.309
 rehabilitation have allowed some 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.600
 advances in the improvement of these patients 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.550
 at the end of time they are staying 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.300
 short and the patient stays 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.260
 stationary 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.980
 We believe that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.250
 treatments with stem cells 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:17.520
 they can regenerate part of the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.120
 nervous tissue lost there is already a 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.120
 great experience worldwide and 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.880
 also at the local level where patients 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.150
 with spinal cord injuries have obtained 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.420
 different degrees of improvement for 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.810
 our patients spinal conditions 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 we have two treatment options one 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.320
 is to use cells from your own body 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.690
 and that the patient is his own donor 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.910
 and the other option that we have is to use 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.610
 stem cells from cord 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.290
 umbilical we believe that the cells of 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.800
 umbilical cord have a greater 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.340
 regenerative capacity as opposed 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.679
 to the cells of the body itself 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.039
 in both situations the patients 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:07.250
 can achieve improvements the most important thing 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.009
 in spinal cord injuries is to have goals 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.630
 clear and realistic of what the patient 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.340
 can achieve 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.340
 there is no doubt that the cells 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.340
 mother can improve the sensitivity that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.130
 can decrease the level of the level 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.460
 sensorial of the patient that can 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.440
 improve the motor function of the legs 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.230
 that can improve in many cases the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.230
 toilet training many of these 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.080
 benefits have to be supported by 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.020
 an adequate program of physical therapy and 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.290
 rehabilitation if you are a patient 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:45.260
 who lives outside of guatemala we need 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.630
 that is in the country for at least 72 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.750
 hours the transplant is done in a 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.520
 hospitable environment for your comfort 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.770
 and if you are a patient who lives in 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.980
 our country the procedure can 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.190
 be done in a period of 24 hours in a 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.140
 hospital environment we believe that if 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.570
 you are currently in a program 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.220
 physical therapy and rehabilitation the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.620
 treatment with stem cells can 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.230
 Give it a push enough 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.550
 important to achieve changes in your 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.840
 quality of life 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.840
 we will be in contact
