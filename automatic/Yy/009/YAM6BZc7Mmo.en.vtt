00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
happens with boot camp well I locked up

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.240 
happens with boot camp well I locked up
your<00:02:57.000> camp<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:58.409> don't<00:02:58.620> know<00:02:58.739> much<00:02:58.920> about<00:02:59.099> it

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.830 
but basically they're gonna weed out
like<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.090> guess<00:03:04.050> with<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.830> process<00:03:05.459> right<00:03:05.940> it's

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
like I guess with a process right it's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.930 
like I guess with a process right it's
basically<00:03:07.319> slimming<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:07.920> down<00:03:08.129> so<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:08.849> going

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
basically slimming it down so it's going

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.660 
basically slimming it down so it's going
to<00:03:09.030> get<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> lot<00:03:09.209> harder<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:10.530> ND<00:03:10.950> budges<00:03:11.400> each
