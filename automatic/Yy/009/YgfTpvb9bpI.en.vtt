major completion the first thing is the
steps<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.460> done<00:00:18.109> I've<00:00:19.109> got<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> steps<00:00:19.680> all

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
steps are done I've got the steps all

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.250 
steps are done I've got the steps all
back<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.699> rebuilt<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> box<00:00:21.539> got<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> box

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
back in I rebuilt the box got the box

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.099 
back in I rebuilt the box got the box
back<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.910> while<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> steps<00:00:24.359> were<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.750> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
back in while the steps were out I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.320 
back in while the steps were out I
lubricated<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> don't<00:00:27.150> know<00:00:27.240> if

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
lubricated them all so I don't know if

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450 
lubricated them all so I don't know if
any<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> know<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.289> most<00:00:28.619> motorhomes<00:00:29.250> up

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
any of you know but most motorhomes up

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.840 
any of you know but most motorhomes up
underneath<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.560> light<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.590> shines<00:00:32.579> on

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
underneath have a light that shines on

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.410 
underneath have a light that shines on
the<00:00:32.969> step<00:00:33.870> outside<00:00:34.770> light<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> I've

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the step outside light is on and I've

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.270 
the step outside light is on and I've
fixed<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.320> working<00:00:37.739> steps<00:00:38.070> are

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
fixed that so it's working steps are

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
fixed that so it's working steps are
going<00:00:38.460> back<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.670> forth<00:00:39.090> nice<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.110> smooth

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680

going back and forth nice and smooth
we've<00:00:41.520> built<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> steps<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.930> built<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
we've built the steps and I built it I

we've built the steps and I built it I
went<00:00:44.219> ahead<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> box<00:00:44.879> back<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.739> you

higher<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.070> higher<00:01:05.309> than<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
higher just a little bit higher than the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
higher just a little bit higher than the
bulkheads<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:07.140> our<00:01:07.260> hardwood<00:01:07.740> laminate

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
bulkheads and then our hardwood laminate

bulkheads and then our hardwood laminate
floor<00:01:08.549> we'll<00:01:08.760> go<00:01:08.909> over<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.600> would<00:01:09.750> be

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
floor we'll go over this this would be

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.170 
back end is painted I went ahead and
started<00:01:49.140> working<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.649> our<00:01:49.710> dinette<00:01:50.220> now<00:01:50.700> Jody

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
started working on our dinette now Jody

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.319 
started working on our dinette now Jody
and<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> dinette<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.890> don't<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:54.119> just

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and I like a dinette we don't we just

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.840 
and I like a dinette we don't we just
think<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:55.110> storage<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.759> bit

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
think it's more storage and a little bit

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
think it's more storage and a little bit
more<00:01:57.030> comfortable<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> road

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
more comfortable for going down the road

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.310 
more comfortable for going down the road
and<00:01:58.890> working<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.430> stuff<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.509> our

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and working and stuff like that so our

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840 
and working and stuff like that so our
old<00:02:01.469> dinette<00:02:01.920> came<00:02:02.130> out<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.430> here

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
old dinette came out to here

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.270 
old dinette came out to here
so<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.509> thought<00:02:03.719> well<00:02:03.899> let's<00:02:03.930> cut<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> back<00:02:04.590> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
so we thought well let's cut it back and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.920 
so we thought well let's cut it back and
I<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.520> give<00:02:05.670> us<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:06.000> room<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> kitchen

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
I would give us more room in the kitchen

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.109 
I would give us more room in the kitchen
area<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.009> cut<00:02:08.369> everything<00:02:08.640> back

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
area so I cut everything back

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.460 
area so I cut everything back
rebuilt<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> dinette<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.770> just<00:02:11.069> got

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.920 
rebuilt the dinette I just got
I'm<00:02:11.710> puttin<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.970> what<00:02:13.240> I'm<00:02:13.360> going<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.570> do<00:02:13.750> now

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.590 
I'm puttin and what I'm going to do now
is<00:02:14.380> up<00:02:14.920> underneath<00:02:15.400> here<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.790> all<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.090> wiring

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
is up underneath here is all the wiring

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.990 
is up underneath here is all the wiring
and<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.960> plumbing<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.920> I'm<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.820> build

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
and the plumbing and I'm going to build

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.720 
and the plumbing and I'm going to build
a<00:02:19.120> storage<00:02:19.540> box<00:02:19.840> over<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.500> for<00:02:20.860> cover<00:02:21.310> over

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
a storage box over that for cover over

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.630 
a storage box over that for cover over
that<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.530> don't<00:02:23.740> see<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.280> when

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
that and so you don't see all that when

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.410 
that and so you don't see all that when
you<00:02:24.730> open<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.120> up<00:02:25.270> also<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:27.220> old<00:02:27.490> box<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:28.270> was

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
you open it up also the old box that was

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.690 
you open it up also the old box that was
between<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.840> two<00:02:28.990> dinettes<00:02:29.590> was<00:02:30.250> about<00:02:30.520> this

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
between the two dinettes was about this

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.200 
between the two dinettes was about this
tall<00:02:30.970> about<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.630> wide<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.820> when<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:33.850> took<00:02:33.940> it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
tall about that wide so when I took it

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.750 
tall about that wide so when I took it
all<00:02:34.330> out<00:02:34.360> I'm<00:02:34.870> gonna<00:02:35.050> make<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.470> real<00:02:36.130> small<00:02:36.490> so

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
all out I'm gonna make it real small so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.670 
all out I'm gonna make it real small so
it<00:02:36.820> doesn't<00:02:37.090> take<00:02:37.180> up<00:02:37.240> as<00:02:37.510> much<00:02:37.540> room<00:02:37.750> so

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
it doesn't take up as much room so

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.290 
it doesn't take up as much room so
that's<00:02:39.070> what<00:02:39.280> we're<00:02:39.610> gonna<00:02:39.700> be<00:02:39.850> working<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.240> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
that's what we're gonna be working on a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.990 
that's what we're gonna be working on a
little<00:02:40.540> bit<00:02:40.690> today<00:02:41.160> back<00:02:42.160> here<00:02:44.730> Jody's<00:02:45.730> got

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
little bit today back here Jody's got

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.030 
little bit today back here Jody's got
most<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.600> this<00:02:46.720> all<00:02:46.990> painted<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.560> walls<00:02:47.800> are

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
most of this all painted the walls are

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.310 
most of this all painted the walls are
all<00:02:48.190> crying<00:02:48.580> she's<00:02:49.300> working<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.750> cabinets

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
all crying she's working on the cabinets

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.730 
all crying she's working on the cabinets
priming<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.160> cabinets<00:02:51.760> and<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.990> bed<00:02:53.560> has

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
priming the cabinets and the bed has

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.240 
priming the cabinets and the bed has
been<00:02:53.770> primed<00:02:54.250> there<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.760> area<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:56.170> we'll<00:02:56.560> get

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
been primed there that area so we'll get

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.340 
been primed there that area so we'll get
a<00:02:57.310> good<00:02:57.490> cut<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.760> prime<00:02:57.970> kills<00:02:58.600> on<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.110> and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
a good cut of prime kills on this and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.930 
a good cut of prime kills on this and
then<00:02:59.440> we<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.560> start<00:02:59.950> painting<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.490> here<00:03:00.790> but

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
then we can start painting in here but

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.000 
then we can start painting in here but
everything's<00:03:01.270> been<00:03:01.480> cocked<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.740> seams

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
everything's been cocked all the seams

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.330 
everything's been cocked all the seams
have<00:03:03.160> been<00:03:03.370> caught<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.560> looks<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.040> hundred

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
have been caught so it looks a hundred

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.620 
have been caught so it looks a hundred
percent<00:03:06.400> brighter<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.209> here<00:03:07.240> which<00:03:07.600> just

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
percent brighter in here which just

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.980 
percent brighter in here which just
kills<00:03:08.530> on<00:03:08.770> them<00:03:09.240> I<00:03:10.240> know<00:03:10.540> you've<00:03:10.780> probably

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990
