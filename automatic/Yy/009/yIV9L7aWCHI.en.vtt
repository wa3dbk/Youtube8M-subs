like<00:05:59.169> a<00:05:59.259> hard<00:05:59.440> word<00:05:59.620> for<00:05:59.650> me<00:05:59.860> to<00:05:59.979> say<00:06:00.130> but<00:06:01.030> it

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
like a hard word for me to say but it

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.760 
like a hard word for me to say but it
looks<00:06:01.300> like<00:06:01.449> matches<00:06:02.080> and<00:06:02.259> when<00:06:02.349> you<00:06:02.409> open<00:06:02.710> it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
looks like matches and when you open it

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.320 
looks like matches and when you open it
up<00:06:02.919> it<00:06:03.099> actually<00:06:03.370> has<00:06:03.520> like<00:06:03.699> threads<00:06:04.090> and
