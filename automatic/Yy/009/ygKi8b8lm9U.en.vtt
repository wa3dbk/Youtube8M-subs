his high spots so you know some of his

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.809 
his high spots so you know some of his
signature<00:01:02.090> moves<00:01:02.470> but<00:01:03.470> it<00:01:03.860> just<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.369> drives<00:01:04.609> me

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:04.819 
signature moves but it just it drives me

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.190

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.679 
overall I thought let's probably want to
wade<00:01:12.890> barrett<00:01:13.280> Wade<00:01:13.460> Barrett's<00:01:13.880> best<00:01:14.179> matches

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
honest man I I think RVD still got a

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.580 
honest man I I think RVD still got a
couple<00:01:28.609> good<00:01:28.789> matches<00:01:29.539> left<00:01:29.749> in<00:01:29.959> him<00:01:30.139> at<00:01:30.409> that

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
couple good matches left in him at that

couple good matches left in him at that
last<00:01:30.829> week<00:01:31.130> was<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> good<00:01:31.579> match<00:01:31.819> um<00:01:33.249> this<00:01:34.249> week

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
last week was a good match um this week

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.739 
last week was a good match um this week
was<00:01:35.719> just<00:01:35.899> an<00:01:36.020> RVD<00:01:36.469> showcase<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:38.420> know<00:01:38.539> I<00:01:38.569> do

was just an RVD showcase you know I do

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:41.459 
was just an RVD showcase you know I do
think<00:01:39.139> the<00:01:39.289> WWE<00:01:40.009> style<00:01:40.340> fits<00:01:40.819> him<00:01:41.119> better

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
think the WWE style fits him better

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.319 
think the WWE style fits him better
whereas<00:01:42.469> over<00:01:42.709> in<00:01:42.920> TNA<00:01:43.429> he<00:01:43.609> was<00:01:43.729> wrestling<00:01:44.179> in

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
whereas over in TNA he was wrestling in

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:45.999 
whereas over in TNA he was wrestling in
these<00:01:44.450> X<00:01:44.689> Division<00:01:44.959> matches<00:01:45.499> and<00:01:45.649> trying<00:01:45.889> to

pull<00:01:46.219> off<00:01:46.429> a<00:01:46.789> hell<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.659> a<00:01:47.929> lot<00:01:48.109> more<00:01:48.139> intricate

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
pull off a hell of a lot more intricate

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.809 
pull off a hell of a lot more intricate
moves<00:01:49.359> guys<00:01:50.359> like<00:01:50.569> Kenny<00:01:50.840> king<00:01:51.139> so<00:01:51.439> forth<00:01:51.819> but

moves guys like Kenny king so forth but

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:59.499 
moves guys like Kenny king so forth but
um<00:01:53.149> I<00:01:54.429> don't<00:01:55.429> know<00:01:55.819> man<00:01:57.189> it's<00:01:58.189> nice<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.549> see<00:01:58.939> RVD

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
um I don't know man it's nice to see RVD

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.449 
um I don't know man it's nice to see RVD
back<00:01:59.749> he<00:02:00.049> is<00:02:00.079> my<00:02:00.319> favorite<00:02:00.649> rest<00:02:00.859> of<00:02:01.009> our<00:02:01.159> time

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
back he is my favorite rest of our time

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.999 
back he is my favorite rest of our time
but<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.179> just<00:02:03.020> get<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.349> feeling<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.770> they

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
but I just get the feeling that they

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.889 
but I just get the feeling that they
ultimately<00:02:04.159> feed<00:02:04.939> him<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.329> some<00:02:05.569> of<00:02:05.689> their

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
ultimately feed him to some of their

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.499 
ultimately feed him to some of their
company<00:02:06.859> bitch<00:02:07.340> boys<00:02:07.700> some<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.149> their<00:02:08.240> fuck

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
company bitch boys some of their fuck

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.870 
company bitch boys some of their fuck
boys<00:02:08.780> in<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.170> long<00:02:09.350> run<00:02:09.380> so<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.490> hard<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.700> be

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
boys in the long run so it's hard to be

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.640 
boys in the long run so it's hard to be
