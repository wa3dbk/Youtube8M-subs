00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 in front of him everyone today I 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 will teach you a little video 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.010
 to make a bomb awa paper so 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:14.040
 it's very simple for those you have 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:19.400
 need low of a normal leaf and a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.150
 scissor so to start it takes 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 cut the edges where there are 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:37.219
 trunks here is cut off from the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.219
 Red line 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:46.770
 here we do it give you that you have 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.440
 lived out that fold is this way that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:57.239
 it makes a right angle 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 so we fold like that there 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:11.820
 gives you cut minutes this part 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:14.040
 whose side track to sail to his wife 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.490
 did not do well we can interpret it too 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.180
 of you get a square like this 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.939
 then you fold in two pieces of paper 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.240
 that's how it looks like 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.090
 exactly then you fold back as 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 this to do a trek 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.350
 so now you open you 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 tap the corner here so 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:46.259
 that it gives that and you press that's it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.770
 five devices on the other side so I 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.549
 repeat the rain here and it will do it 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.060
 automatically 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060
 look 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.660
 Be sure to check that leila 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.710
 be well on board then you to opt in 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:10.320
 triangle here you have only 1 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:18.660
 cast off this side here and do it everywhere 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:24.440
 on all four sides so here here and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:29.400
 finally here you finally get that 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.430
 so now you take like that and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 you fold up to the edge this little 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.570
 part of which like that like this and 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.140
 we do that everywhere like that 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.690
 side like that and that's it 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.230
 now you get his daughter and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.700
 it's also ok now you'll see 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.650
 in what we just did there will be 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.040
 small slits like in this 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.260
 sale 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 you put this paper so but must 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:17.040
 to return well then we fold it 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:26.470
 on this side, here on this side 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:33.270
 also so day I missed 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.270
 ah here we are we are 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:43.840
 then but there like that, then 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.230
 we get here and there the turn is played 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.250
 a book like that here there is a hole 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.720
 you just have to blow in 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.190
 wait and you opt for other bombs to 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.250
