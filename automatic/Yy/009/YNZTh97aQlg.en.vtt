00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
right here in London so let's do this um

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
right here in London so let's do this um
there's<00:00:26.400> been<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:26.730> reports<00:00:27.090> reported<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
there's been some reports reported in

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.919 
there's been some reports reported in
the<00:00:28.320> days<00:00:28.650> star<00:00:29.070> regarding<00:00:29.609> Pedro<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.210> Pedro

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the days star regarding Pedro and Pedro

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.080 
the days star regarding Pedro and Pedro
has<00:00:31.050> said<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.349> Barcelona<00:00:32.009> have<00:00:32.700> received

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
has said that Barcelona have received

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.450 
has said that Barcelona have received
offers<00:00:33.450> from<00:00:33.480> him<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.350> him<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> think<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
offers from him for him so I think this

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.190 
offers from him for him so I think this
the<00:00:35.850> exciting<00:00:36.270> thing<00:00:36.450> here<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> Pedro

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the exciting thing here is that Pedro

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
the exciting thing here is that Pedro
has<00:00:37.350> essentially<00:00:37.680> open<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> door<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.969> he

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
has essentially open the door if he

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.250 
has essentially open the door if he
didn't<00:00:39.360> want<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> leave<00:00:39.719> he<00:00:39.870> certainly<00:00:40.110> won't

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
didn't want to leave he certainly won't

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.660 
didn't want to leave he certainly won't
be<00:00:40.379> coming<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> press<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.160> reporting

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
be coming to the press and reporting

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490 
be coming to the press and reporting
that<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.690> offers<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> table<00:00:43.170> for

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that there are offers on the table for

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.920 
that there are offers on the table for
him<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> Pedro<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.329> quite

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
him so I think that Pedro is quite

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.860 
him so I think that Pedro is quite
cleverly<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:47.219> push<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.940> push<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> door

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
cleverly here just push to push the door

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.959 
cleverly here just push to push the door
ajar<00:00:48.989> slightly<00:00:49.710> which<00:00:50.190> means<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> perhaps

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
ajar slightly which means that perhaps

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.990 
ajar slightly which means that perhaps
he<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.079> leave<00:00:52.230> um<00:00:52.440> he<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.100> said<00:00:53.399> in

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
he would like to leave um he had said in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.950 
he would like to leave um he had said in
the<00:00:54.090> past<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> he<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> finish

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
the past that he would like to finish

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.660 
the past that he would like to finish
his<00:00:55.170> career<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.680> Barcelona<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.309> nothing<00:00:56.579> he's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
his career at Barcelona and nothing he's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.029 
his career at Barcelona and nothing he's
bought<00:00:56.850> alone<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> boy<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.590> his<00:00:58.590> dream<00:00:58.890> would

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
bought alone a boy and his dream would

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
bought alone a boy and his dream would
have<00:00:59.129> been<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> play<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.609> barcelona<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.149> his

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
have been to play for barcelona for his

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.290 
have been to play for barcelona for his
entire<00:01:00.510> career<00:01:01.820> circumstance<00:01:02.820> often

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
entire career circumstance often

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
entire career circumstance often
dictates<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.989> can't<00:01:04.260> happen<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
dictates that that can't happen and it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
dictates that that can't happen and it
seems<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.119> case<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.920> barcelona

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
seems to be the case here barcelona

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
seems to be the case here barcelona
could<00:01:08.280> be<00:01:08.460> open<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:09.240> selling<00:01:09.450> him

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
could be open to selling him

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.550 
could be open to selling him
particularly<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.110> their<00:01:10.200> presidential

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
particularly if their presidential

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
particularly if their presidential
election<00:01:11.070> goes<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> way<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.000> hope<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330
