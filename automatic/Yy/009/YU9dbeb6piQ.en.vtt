00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.849 
hi my name is Brent Atwater and I'm an
animal<00:00:03.090> medium<00:00:03.389> yeah<00:00:03.629> that's<00:00:04.049> right<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.560> look

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
animal medium yeah that's right I look

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.089 
animal medium yeah that's right I look
at<00:00:05.040> see<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.580> talk<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.000> dead<00:00:06.210> pets<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.859> can

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
at see and talk to dead pets and you can

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.120 
at see and talk to dead pets and you can
too<00:00:08.309> because<00:00:08.730> we're<00:00:08.940> going<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:10.130> animal

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
too because we're going to have animal

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.129 
too because we're going to have animal
connection<00:00:11.639> techniques<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.570> will<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.750> inter

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
connection techniques that will be inter

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.799 
connection techniques that will be inter
dispersed<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.830> between<00:00:14.340> our<00:00:14.370> other<00:00:14.820> videos<00:00:15.269> so

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
dispersed in between our other videos so

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.540 
dispersed in between our other videos so
stay<00:00:15.870> tuned<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.470> subscribe<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:17.160> see<00:00:17.340> those

we're<00:00:18.060> also<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:19.020> animal

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
we're also going to do animal

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.189 
we're also going to do animal
communication<00:00:20.490> techniques<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.990> will

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
communication techniques and they will

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
communication techniques and they will
be<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.650> our<00:00:22.830> videos<00:00:23.250> also<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:24.330> today<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.840> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
feel like I can't rubs up against your

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
feel like I can't rubs up against your
leg<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.879> no<00:00:51.210> no<00:00:51.660> no<00:00:51.690> no<00:00:52.170> no<00:00:52.320> no<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.800> gotta<00:00:53.219> be

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
leg up no no no no no no I gotta be

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.470 
leg up no no no no no no I gotta be
crazy<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.789> isn't<00:00:54.090> true

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
crazy this isn't true

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
crazy this isn't true
it's<00:00:54.719> real<00:00:55.050> let<00:00:55.710> me<00:00:55.739> tell<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> why<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.309> real

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
it's real let me tell you why it's real

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.799 
it's real let me tell you why it's real
I<00:00:57.109> see<00:00:58.109> energy<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.789> means<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> pet<00:01:00.780> dies

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I see energy that means when a pet dies

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.490 
I see energy that means when a pet dies
i<00:01:01.350> watch<00:01:01.859> its<00:01:02.219> energy<00:01:02.760> leave<00:01:03.090> its<00:01:03.300> body<00:01:03.500> cross

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
i watch its energy leave its body cross

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.740 
i watch its energy leave its body cross
over<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> death<00:01:05.040> line<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> go<00:01:05.970> into<00:01:06.240> sparkler

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
over the death line and go into sparkler

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.140 
over the death line and go into sparkler
form<00:01:06.990> which<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.350> call<00:01:07.560> living<00:01:07.950> energy<00:01:08.369> that's

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
form which we call living energy that's

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.630 
form which we call living energy that's
an<00:01:09.560> electromagnetic<00:01:10.560> energy<00:01:10.799> form<00:01:11.280> but<00:01:11.520> they

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
an electromagnetic energy form but they

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.429 
an electromagnetic energy form but they
now<00:01:11.880> take<00:01:11.939> instead<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.630> their<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:12.990> suit<00:01:13.229> or

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
now take instead of their first suit or

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.429 
now take instead of their first suit or
the<00:01:13.860> cocoon<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.610> fin<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.210> feathers<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.110> they

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the cocoon of fin and feathers that they

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.090 
the cocoon of fin and feathers that they
left<00:01:16.619> behind<00:01:17.479> energy<00:01:18.479> never<00:01:18.689> changes<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.650> just

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
left behind energy never changes it just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.179 
left behind energy never changes it just
changes<00:01:20.820> form<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.080> pet<00:01:22.320> does<00:01:22.619> watch<00:01:22.950> over

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
changes form so your pet does watch over

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.399 
changes form so your pet does watch over
you<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.610> might<00:01:23.820> hear<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> bark<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.990> real

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
you you might hear the bark that's real

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.560 
you you might hear the bark that's real
that's<00:01:25.740> their<00:01:26.040> electromagnetic<00:01:26.580> sparkler

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that's their electromagnetic sparkler

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
that's their electromagnetic sparkler
form<00:01:27.840> giving<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> an<00:01:28.829> audible<00:01:29.159> sound<00:01:29.640> it's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
form giving you an audible sound it's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.499 
form giving you an audible sound it's
real<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.350> may<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.920> camper<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.090> real

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
real you may have your camper it's real

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
real you may have your camper it's real
