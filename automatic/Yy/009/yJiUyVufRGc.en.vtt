00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.640
 hello people today is one 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.420
 short version of a french metz 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.699
 from my first french knife that 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:37.790
 is a knife from the company ision it 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:41.480
 david from or more specifically 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.140
 Jean remy near animal of this 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.610
 fair held in france this company 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.600
 is one of the tradition last 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:58.900
 company in animal and that already since 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:03.650
 In 1810, there's the company China's David 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:07.250
 or at the ballet called the sign 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.380
 is just this crossbow as well as on the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.350
 to recognize the blade 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:20.020
 and I have a cultural year reason 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.020
 Of course, grain of the cdu means well 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.659
 So charge them once 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.579
 So that's a big mouth in the number 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:39.890
 bigger than these narrow fine ones 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:42.799
 half known long knife that it 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.950
 just more a hunt or automesse the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:55.810
 French night here with brass 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 bakker upholstery the typical wiener needs 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.670
 Here's this fourth back of the spring 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.460
 handle scales are made of c-durton anton c band 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.020
 is one 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.290
 Indian humps have to run these 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.870
 side is especially beautiful there has this 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:27.930
 lighter grain but also these dark ones 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:36.050
 is quite handsome then you see it 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:40.430
 just a slightly stronger folding knife 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:49.280
 to recognize again 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.280
 this jol with the crossbow david france 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.600
 there is definitely no fake going on 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.250
 Knife was made by the previous owner in 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:08.060
 France acquired 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:08.060
 Otherwise, this company has something to say 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:19.670
 biggest way lock system closed it 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:40.530
 scarce 12 11 5 centimeters open over 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:43.460
 good 21 cm long so the blade is 95 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.460
 centimeter 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:52.910
 So the weight is clear 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.680
 heavier than normal john knife lay 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:06.490
 So 90 to 100 grams, almost 200 I think 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:15.650
 times are 172 grams 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:20.290
 okay the blade as generally favorable 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:27.010
 brender johann knife from the 12 10 27 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:31.180

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:38.870
 French import then edited 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:48.020
 Sharpness the blade is not great yet 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:49.780
 times it tried to quite well so far 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.250
 use 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.660
 special just this typical 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.750
 French this curved grill 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.510

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.530
 stock nor for the sword the thumb well 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.110

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:14.410
 here at the bee exactly goes for 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.410
 a bigger stop my little bit smaller 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.169
 otherwise it was already 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.169
 a few pictures 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:36.620
