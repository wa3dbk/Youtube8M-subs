00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.090
 good evening hello to all and 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.370
 welcome on this new tutor is 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.150
 presented by happiness so says 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.450
 today we will see how to optimize 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.710
 your very processor are going to be crazy 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.710
 how could we say 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:31.540
 customize your operating system 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.059
 to support the l3 cache of 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.630
 his computer so exclusive to the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.510
 happiness says so we'll see how 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.089
 activate and create this this parameter 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.929
 personalized so for that in a 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:51.070
 first time we will go here and so 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:55.059
 some holes surely knows him from 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.970
 reputation so there are folders here 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.660
 so is exhausting help 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.260
 which are two test utilities for 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.730
 know what kind of processors you 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.380
 have and in particular they allow to 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.230
 details about your processor that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.440
 precisely to allow we will say for 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.980
 robert nail a little bit your system and 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.160
 so is to make the most of the 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.770
 power of your processor so that's 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.300
 what are we going to do today so that's 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 it really allows you to see a lot of 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.240
 things and so for that you go on 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.660
 google 1 and then you type cpu z and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.250
 you download it by following of course 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.650
 if you have a 32-bit system 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.290
 you take yourself 32 bits and if you a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.860
 64-bit system like me and see you 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.070
 take the 64 the hitch 64.1 okay so 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.890
 I'll doubleclick and that's up high 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.340
 and leave then we will take info 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.950
 cats at first here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.470
 here we see how my level 3 is at 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.550
 8 mega bit 8 mega bit 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:10.170
 so that's 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:12.610
 8 x 1024 okay so it's done to us 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.780
 8192 is the value we will put a 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.060
 other cache l3 okay we can 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.760
 do but put one's worth 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.320
 but now we will activate this 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.970
 value so for that we'll go into the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.960
 reggae says 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:33.320
 here we are and so we will go hop 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.320
 in 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.430
 here we are in the water 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.670
 local machine machine we see the teeth 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.230
 system of agreement of a sent system 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:51.610
 in the control stream 7 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.000
 check here we go get head 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.090
 attack session here's manager here on 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.299
 will go to memories here once 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.910
 that you are in memories here you 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.480
 go create this key the flower of the evel 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.989
 datacash of course beforehand I hope 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.480
 that you all set up your 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.560
 second of evel datacash to enjoy 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.370
 really at most 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.690
 so little reminder so we saw that me 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.379
 it was wet dwell therein 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.069
 if the vote is in 4 x 256 at the level of 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.799
 level l2 flip flops or made 256 x 4 so 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.220
 like me these effects 1024 so for 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.500
 rectify this these two there have done 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.500
 decimals and there you put 1024 on 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.250
 your second rushes datacash but here 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.019
 so besides I can delete it 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.540
 here I go chalk with you for 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.010
 show you how I'm doing so 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.990
 you do like those here and there you 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.250
 do ford 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:04:00.470
 green data 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:03.590
 cash hockey here and there you do so 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.450
 change you put on decimals is 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:14.570
 there then we take the value that is here 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.829
 8192 here and there you do hockey is 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.919
 so here 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.169
 we therefore set the cash level 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.680
 cash and cash levels 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:32.400
 so for two processor notes via 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.530
 our operating system because 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.900
 our operating system let's forget 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.689
 not that he did in a general way 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.080
 for several machines for several 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.050
 users 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.870
 there we are in the personalization of 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.620
 the optimization of his system 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.610
 operating 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.610
 here 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:55.299
 so that's so once you've got 

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:58.229
 changed it you restart your machine 

00:04:55.299 --> 00:05:01.149
 you start for example video games and 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.299
 where a big application or see you 

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.709
 start a video like this and you'll see 

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:08.079
 there will still be a better 

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:09.669
 management and especially in multitasking 

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.799
 so if you 're doing 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.479
 image processing after we risked 

00:05:11.799 --> 00:05:15.209
 on the internet claiming that you're doing 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.949
 a little more turning your bike 

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:18.659
 you will see in my opinion some 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.039
 improvement 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.349
 here is listen it was this new 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.569
 tutorial exclusively 20 that for you 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.860
 on the white says listen I you 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.749
 wish in the meantime full of good 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.029
 things and I tell you very soon on 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.409
 the chain so do not hesitate let go 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.739
 comms 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:38.610
 put like and go hi 

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.610
 See you soon on the bench
