00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:07.930
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.690
 a new episode www 15 and us 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.589
 Start here today with a ranger 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.140
 match, which is also tonight 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.480
 is discharged and that meets the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.370
 world heavyweight champion in the brock 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.580
 lesnar mumble james in one 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.200
 title match in the main network in front of a puzzle 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.120
 maine year 31 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.810
 and I thought like me 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.260
 I present it all here now 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.640
 and let's just look like that 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 now and I have to say now where 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.760
 I had the amount of water I play 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.670
 find it a pity 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.559
 frankly that the hall was too 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.179
 Small one would have been here for these 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.030
 maybe a little bit bigger 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.309
 can choose building but well what 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.859
 solls roman trains comes here through the 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.530
 spectator and not and we 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:03.479
 dwindling now and catch now 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.479
 time with the match 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.650
 now also before wrestlemania on so me 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.759
 can not give you any results now 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.400
 communicate and maybe I will 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.110
 my video because after million 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.430
 German post bring my impress 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 I'll look at maxdome 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.930
 Do you have the opportunity to do this? 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.570
 it would be only just a little 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.940
 later song no problem 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.280
 you can still grow up and 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:49.120
 then have the possibility you still 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:51.100
 Let's see, I say yes 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.690
 we do not even come at all 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.690
 to the train brock lesnar 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.170
 dominated 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.580
 the match to date, now we can times 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.750
 The first blow put the condor 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:11.980
 do not fly out the reverse flaps either 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.950
 now works on 1 and there we give 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.950
 the one of these high brock lesnar 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.590
 because I try that too 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.470
 what's the tag team matches again? 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.959
 four teams compete for the day team 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.170
 champion title 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.420
 I will try that too today 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.610
 I show but even that has all 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.690
 teams are online yes I say that 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.690
 all teams can choose 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.819
 and the mobile you will too 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.799
 sting versus tripolis show 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.129
 in my opinion one of the exciting 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.129
 matches 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.890
 in the evening I think there is hardly 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.890
 an improvement 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.340
 the great 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.380
 but should not come through now 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.940
 may come soon and you that 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.940
 They bleak for us from the 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.530
 there 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.830
 I will definitely be very well 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:08.560
 show too short a randy orton 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.700
 so that will not be missing and 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.900
 now we will try ours 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.330
 finisher against brock lesnar 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.080
 go through and there comes the player 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.720
 Here comes the beer and now try 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:25.150
 Of course we will give you the title 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:28.570
 and power are his manager of the perpetrators 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.280
 the ring and distracts ring judge went the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.170
 may not be true 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.100
 The ring judge should but now 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.100
 maybe sometime 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.889
 focus on us because otherwise will 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.889
 that very very difficult for us 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.120
 and there comes 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.340
 Metzingen out 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.290
 and he can 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.580
 a handsome and see when the 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.949
 Judge comes but I had the feeling 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.300
 that he came quite late and have now 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.300
 we have a very big problem 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.129
 up there 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.129
 ice cold off 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.350
 that was 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.030
 because hands of his would get that 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.460
 certainly very bitter for us 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.330
 become 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.890
 but now have to look maybe 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.970
 we can play the player again now 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.600
 show now once again on the 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.600
 legs comes 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.640
 we have him off 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.640
 lights on the ground 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.080
 and here comes the beer there it comes now 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:00.560
 comes the pin and power raymond is 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.560
 Paul is back again 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.720
 but now the rule 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.720
 open it can not intervene anymore 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.020
 so and then maybe the goal should be 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.160
 also the victory for us 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.160
 the judge counts 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.900
 and there we are new champion roman 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:27.580
 rains wins against brock lesnar 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.750
 this match and yes of course completely 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.630
 exciting to see how it is today 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.490
 evening bremen has developed a lot 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.210
 the match can be mixed in during 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.259
 also happen and sparkling wine 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.880
 communicates 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:46.259
 and that was the first match and me 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.669
 I hope you liked that 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.110
 I would be happy then just 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.819
 and if you might as well 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.240
 on the other videos of my channel 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.849
 looks 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.169
 maybe there is something for you and 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.160
 As I said, I would like to be human 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.960
 also still record in the same way 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.940
 Rouseff will repeat the john 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.620
 Cena I try the tag team 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.389
 championship match with four teams 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.889
 to become a sting ray player 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.750
 Randy Orton came one hundred percent against 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.470
 The blank is one hundred percent comes 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.860
 the bella twins against paige railey will 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.979
 I then try the undertaker versus 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.530
 braithwaite will come one hundred percent 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:21.900
 and that is supposed to amazon the internet 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.900
 intercontinental champion title 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.990
 Maybe the android app will come 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.639
 I will memorial battle royale 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.960
 may not work because I 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.490
 already looked and I believe that 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.389
 not working but i will do everything 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.310
 Do it for me and show me 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:41.509
 look forward to it the next time 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.509
 turn on again until then
