shifting<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.799> nationalism<00:02:02.549> now<00:02:02.700> which<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
shifting to nationalism now which is

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.139 
shifting to nationalism now which is
making<00:02:03.600> them<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.290> new<00:02:04.950> fascist<00:02:05.579> state

interesting now they are developing

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.580 
interesting now they are developing
drone<00:02:09.149> capabilities<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.989> fact<00:02:10.200> they<00:02:10.349> have

espionage that's been underway for over
a<00:02:38.490> decade<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> look<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:40.230> some<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
a decade but if you look at some of the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.080 
a decade but if you look at some of the
pictures<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:41.070> these<00:02:41.340> drones<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.910> they've

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
pictures of these drones that they've

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.670 
pictures of these drones that they've
developed<00:02:42.270> they're<00:02:42.720> almost<00:02:42.870> identical<00:02:43.650> to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
developed they're almost identical to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920 
developed they're almost identical to
u.s.<00:02:44.100> systems<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.880> course<00:02:45.120> even<00:02:45.810> their

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
u.s. systems and of course even their

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.720 
u.s. systems and of course even their
aircraft<00:02:46.410> their<00:02:46.590> military<00:02:46.980> aircraft<00:02:47.520> are

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
aircraft their military aircraft are

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.610 
aircraft their military aircraft are
similar<00:02:48.240> in<00:02:48.390> design<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:49.020> they<00:02:49.170> basically

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
similar in design so they basically

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.740 
similar in design so they basically
copied<00:02:50.070> designs<00:02:50.490> I've<00:02:50.970> gotten<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.330> lot<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.540> help

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
copied designs I've gotten a lot of help

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.690 
copied designs I've gotten a lot of help
from<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.110> Russians<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.710> well<00:02:52.740> but<00:02:53.490> they<00:02:53.670> have

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
from the Russians as well but they have

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.270 
from the Russians as well but they have
two<00:02:54.120> new<00:02:54.690> drones<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.290> particular<00:02:55.560> one<00:02:56.100> is

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
two new drones in particular one is

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.340 
two new drones in particular one is
called<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> Yi<00:02:56.910> long<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> other<00:02:58.080> is

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
called the Yi long and the other is

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.110 
called the Yi long and the other is
called<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.770> ch4<00:02:59.460> and<00:02:59.490> these<00:02:59.730> are<00:02:59.880> armed

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
called the ch4 and these are armed

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.760 
called the ch4 and these are armed
drones<00:03:00.570> or<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:00.960> predators<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.530> have

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
drones or like predators that have

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.920 
drones or like predators that have
missiles<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.700> addition<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.630> they're

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
missiles in addition to that they're

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.400 
missiles in addition to that they're
building<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.440> large<00:03:05.210> unmanned<00:03:06.210> jet<00:03:06.870> which<00:03:07.230> is

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
building a large unmanned jet which is

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.860 
building a large unmanned jet which is
kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.830> batwing<00:03:08.100> jet<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.180> very<00:03:09.540> similar

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
kind of a batwing jet it's very similar

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.310 
kind of a batwing jet it's very similar
to<00:03:10.230> what<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> US<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:10.920> doing<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.840> thinking

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
to what the US is doing and the thinking

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.200 
to what the US is doing and the thinking
is<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.800> has<00:03:14.070> enough<00:03:14.340> capability<00:03:14.550> to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
is that this has enough capability to

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.900 
is that this has enough capability to
reach<00:03:15.390> targets<00:03:15.990> in<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.950> far<00:03:17.220> away<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:17.460> Guam

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
reach targets in as far away as Guam

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.880 
reach targets in as far away as Guam
which<00:03:18.240> is<00:03:18.390> about<00:03:18.600> 2,000<00:03:19.260> miles<00:03:19.440> from<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
which is about 2,000 miles from the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.940 
which is about 2,000 miles from the
Chinese<00:03:20.400> coast<00:03:20.670> but<00:03:21.600> US<00:03:22.110> intelligence<00:03:22.290> is

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
Chinese coast but US intelligence is

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.550 
Chinese coast but US intelligence is
closely<00:03:23.550> watching<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.360> appears<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:25.200> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
closely watching this and appears to the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.230 
closely watching this and appears to the
people<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:25.950> talked<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.250> fairly<00:03:26.790> concerned

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
people I talked to fairly concerned

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.060 
people I talked to fairly concerned
about<00:03:27.600> this<00:03:27.810> kind<00:03:28.050> of<00:03:28.110> military<00:03:28.290> development

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
about this kind of military development

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.040

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.290 
yeah in Russia you mentioned earlier
they<00:03:31.320> also<00:03:31.530> have<00:03:31.890> drones<00:03:32.220> how<00:03:32.670> aggressive<00:03:33.180> are

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
they also have drones how aggressive are

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.400 
they also have drones how aggressive are
they<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.600> they're<00:03:33.750> pretty<00:03:33.900> antiquated

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
they and they're pretty antiquated
