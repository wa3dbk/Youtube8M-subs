one is going to handle all of these
moments<00:00:51.780> slightly<00:00:52.440> differently<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.370> the

started I do want to make one important
point<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.010> something<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> hope

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
point and it's something that I hope

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.250 
point and it's something that I hope
you'll<00:01:05.820> take<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> through<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.990> these

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
you'll take with you through all these

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
you'll take with you through all these
lessons<00:01:07.500> through<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.070> entire<00:01:08.310> career<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.850> a

lessons through your entire career as a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240 
lessons through your entire career as a
race<00:01:09.119> driver<00:01:09.390> when<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.560> tires<00:01:10.920> are

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
race driver when your tires are

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.850 
race driver when your tires are
squealing<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.510> they're<00:01:12.720> screaming<00:01:13.619> when

squealing when they're screaming when

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.359 
squealing when they're screaming when
you're<00:01:13.979> peeling<00:01:14.340> out<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> smoking<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.750> tires

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
you're peeling out and smoking the tires

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.920 
you're peeling out and smoking the tires
ultimately<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:18.030> getting<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> most

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
ultimately you are not getting the most

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
ultimately you are not getting the most

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
traction the most traction happens at

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.289 
traction the most traction happens at
that<00:01:21.900> moment<00:01:22.380> right<00:01:22.920> before<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.670> tires<00:01:23.880> start

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
that moment right before the tires start

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.210 
that moment right before the tires start
to<00:01:24.360> spin<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.680> hear<00:01:26.189> a

to spin you can actually hear a

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
and to further increase the breaking you

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.480 
and to further increase the breaking you
can<00:04:53.000> actually<00:04:53.360> down<00:04:53.660> shift<00:04:54.140> using<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.010> engine

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
can actually down shift using the engine

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.640 
can actually down shift using the engine
to<00:04:55.700> also<00:04:56.270> break<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.540> car<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.440> in<00:04:57.560> the

adjustments<00:05:39.350> to<00:05:39.470> brake<00:05:39.770> bias<00:05:40.070> or<00:05:40.490> other

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
adjustments to brake bias or other

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.760 
adjustments to brake bias or other
things<00:05:41.330> in<00:05:41.480> the<00:05:41.570> car<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:41.960> slow<00:05:42.260> down<00:05:42.470> or

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
things in the car to slow down or

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.580 
things in the car to slow down or
increase<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.700> speed<00:05:43.940> of<00:05:44.150> braking<00:05:44.660> or<00:05:44.810> balance

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
increase the speed of braking or balance

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.860 
increase the speed of braking or balance
of<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.890> car<00:05:46.100> but<00:05:46.670> none<00:05:46.940> of<00:05:47.090> that<00:05:47.150> comes<00:05:47.510> until

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
of the car but none of that comes until

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.840 
of the car but none of that comes until
you've<00:05:48.020> really<00:05:48.380> got<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:48.740> good<00:05:48.980> sensation<00:05:49.250> of

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
you've really got the good sensation of

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.420 
you've really got the good sensation of
wheel<00:05:50.150> lockup<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:50.960> can<00:05:51.470> keep<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:51.860> car<00:05:52.100> right

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
wheel lockup and can keep the car right

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.090 
wheel lockup and can keep the car right
at<00:05:52.580> that<00:05:52.760> point<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.510> lastly<00:05:54.380> is<00:05:54.710> from

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
at that point and lastly is from

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.770 
at that point and lastly is from
threshold<00:05:55.670> braking<00:05:55.880> that<00:05:56.270> we<00:05:56.420> would<00:05:56.570> move

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
threshold braking that we would move

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.870 
threshold braking that we would move
into<00:05:57.050> an<00:05:57.290> advanced<00:05:57.830> technique<00:05:58.220> called<00:05:58.520> trail

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
into an advanced technique called trail

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.940 
into an advanced technique called trail
braking<00:05:59.450> where<00:05:59.960> you'll<00:06:00.050> actually<00:06:00.320> use<00:06:00.530> the

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
braking where you'll actually use the

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.550 
braking where you'll actually use the
brake<00:06:00.980> going<00:06:01.640> into<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.360> corner<00:06:02.780> to<00:06:03.230> allow<00:06:03.500> the

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
brake going into the corner to allow the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.650 
brake going into the corner to allow the
rear-end<00:06:04.130> to<00:06:04.280> steer<00:06:04.610> a<00:06:04.640> little<00:06:04.790> more<00:06:05.240> but

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
rear-end to steer a little more but

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.910 
rear-end to steer a little more but
that's<00:06:05.840> something<00:06:06.260> we're<00:06:06.380> going<00:06:06.470> to<00:06:06.560> get<00:06:06.680> to

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
that's something we're going to get to

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.310 
that's something we're going to get to
in<00:06:07.070> a<00:06:07.160> later<00:06:07.370> lesson<00:06:07.700> now<00:06:08.660> regardless<00:06:09.050> of<00:06:09.200> your
