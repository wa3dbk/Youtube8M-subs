 having read to me that the trumpet judgment 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.019
 last one rings when she wants me 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.930
 will come by hand to introduce me 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.650
 before the sovereign judge I would say 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.950
 highly this is what I did what 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.090
 I thought what I said I said 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.640

 do not you have anything bad to add 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.590

 some indifferent ornaments that did not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 ever been only to fill a void 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.510
 caused by my memory defect 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.030
 I could assume true what I knew 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.840
 to have ever been what I knew 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 to be wrong I showed myself as 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 I was despicable and city â€‹â€‹when I 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.330
