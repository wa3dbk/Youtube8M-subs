00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 what are the disadvantages of the traditional 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.060
 computer it consumes a lot of big 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.519
 electricity and not everywhere it is convenient 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.500
 use intel feet small lungs 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.990
 consumes a minimum of energy and can 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.089
 do all that and ordinary computer what 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.220
 is nuke stands for name like 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.050
 next unit in computer in simple words 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.789
 this is a super compact computer 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.859
 having the same functionality as 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.090
 traditional yet and in some cases 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.310
 even more 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.990
 new intel feet compared to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 previous generation seriously 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.769
 reworked it remained the same 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.630
 compact as its predecessor also 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.760
 can be mounted on a weight mount or 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.440
 just put legs behind the monitor can 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.440
 set there where even maternal 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.760
 board ordinary computer does not fit if 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.219
 it's just a full-fledged computer 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 only reduced at times housing 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.670
 aluminum inside now 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.129
 is installed intel celeron or intel 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.809
 fourth generation core i3 and i5 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.680
 fast processors low 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.390
 power consumption 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 on model celeron they have their own 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.289
 a feature she has preloaded wifi 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.440
 and bluetooth modules unlike older ones 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.640
 models there need to buy them separately 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.080
 built-in video camera intel hd 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.900
 supports simultaneous connection 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.939
 Up to three monitors and ultra hd resolution 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.740
 the computer will be easy to play even 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.020
 Blues and films with such opportunities 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.680
 it can be easily turned into a home 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.080
 media center 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 another important innovation is the possibility 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.820
 install as ssd docs usual 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 hard drives 2 and a half bb due 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.869
 This cost but to can significantly 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.189
 to reduce 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.950
 the last major change was 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.299
 install ddr3 memory consuming 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.200
 less energy compared to conventional 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.060
 slats 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.909
 peripheral connectors 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.680
 quite a lot of hdmi port is somewhat in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.140
 depending on the model yusbi connector of 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 gigabit lan port headphone input 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.579
 and computers with intel processors 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 core mini hdmi and displayport 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.020
 Well, great for home 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.399
 office use is powerful enough 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 for daily work and for his 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.390
 installation need to find a place size 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.310
 themselves thanks to the support of the void 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.689
 and foot can easily transfer the image 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.000
 to any other device with this 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.049
 technology you want to watch a movie in 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.180
 bed on the tablet 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.560
 just send the images there for 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.080
 at home such opportunities will definitely come in handy 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.030
 but not only for this son created from 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.620
 it can be easily made a media center or 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.620
 home cinema base 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.970
 large port selection powerful stuffing 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.120
 infrared port it 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.440
 for example, install xbmc on it 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.959
 we connect the usual remote or keyboard 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.470
 and mouse and you're done watching movies and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.840
 TV series 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.670
 listen to music surfer on the internet with 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.750
 using well from any TV you can 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.180
 make with martini 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.590
 another sphere where small sizes and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.380
 great computer capabilities will 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.000
 by the way installation in vending machines 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.130
 CCTV systems or various 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.390
 digital signage and just like that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.370
 low power consumption cases 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.780
 computer and its performance and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.060
 compactness will play a role 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.709
 since legs works fine with windows and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.239
 linux can be installed on it 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.010
 almost any desired 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.540
 for example, it can be used as 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.160
 base of digital billboards 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.620
 here support of several is useful 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.750
 screens and ultra hd resolution 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.310
 intel feet this and home or office 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.440
 computer and media center 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.000
 and the basis for advertising boards or any 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.280
 other specialized system where 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.260
 need a powerful computer but at the same price 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.370
 on the device is not transcendental it 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.370
 everyone can afford
