00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
suggesting but also the the weight so we

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.040 
suggesting but also the the weight so we
really<00:02:16.980> recommend<00:02:17.400> that

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
really recommend that

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.000 
really recommend that
you<00:02:18.620> actually<00:02:18.800> source<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.910> purchase<00:02:20.330> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
you actually source and purchase a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.710 
you actually source and purchase a
adjustable<00:02:22.010> kettlebell<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.150> way<00:02:23.360> you

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
adjustable kettlebell and that way you

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960 
adjustable kettlebell and that way you
won't<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.990> continually<00:02:24.740> buying<00:02:25.010> various

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
won't be continually buying various

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.580 
won't be continually buying various
different<00:02:26.360> kettlebells<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:27.170> actually

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
different kettlebells it's actually

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.950 
different kettlebells it's actually
quite<00:02:28.130> cost-efficient<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:28.940> way<00:02:29.150> too<00:02:29.210> you

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
on so it will give you a really great

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.430 
on so it will give you a really great
baseline<00:03:44.180> that<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.570> can<00:03:44.750> then<00:03:44.930> compare<00:03:45.140> your

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
baseline that you can then compare your

baseline that you can then compare your
efforts<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.450> measure<00:03:47.750> again<00:03:48.080> over<00:03:48.290> time

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
efforts to and measure again over time

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.340 
efforts to and measure again over time
I<00:03:48.830> chose<00:03:49.760> either<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.390> bod<00:03:50.540> pod<00:03:50.780> or<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.080> DEXA

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
I chose either the bod pod or the DEXA

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.080 
I chose either the bod pod or the DEXA
scan<00:03:51.590> because<00:03:51.800> they<00:03:52.070> involve<00:03:52.670> minimal

scan because they involve minimal

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.320 
scan because they involve minimal
