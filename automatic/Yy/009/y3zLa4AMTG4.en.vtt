00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it now if all goes according to plan it

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.670 
it now if all goes according to plan it
should<00:01:03.710> reboot<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> device<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> moment<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
should reboot the device in a moment and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.750 
should reboot the device in a moment and
install<00:01:07.680> android<00:01:08.189> 4.1<00:01:08.670> point2<00:01:10.400> but<00:01:11.400> retain

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
install android 4.1 point2 but retain

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:56.910 
install android 4.1 point2 but retain
root<00:01:12.090> access

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.990 

and<00:01:57.369> looks<00:01:57.970> like<00:01:58.150> we<00:01:58.299> are<00:01:58.420> almost<00:01:58.720> done<00:01:59.549> it<00:02:00.549> may

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
and looks like we are almost done it may

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.140 
and looks like we are almost done it may
be<00:02:01.060> replacing<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.549> custom<00:02:03.549> recovery<00:02:03.909> though

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
be replacing the custom recovery though

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.700 
be replacing the custom recovery though
because<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.720> says<00:02:04.960> if<00:02:05.080> patching<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.560> boot

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
because it says if patching the boot

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.870 
because it says if patching the boot
image<00:02:06.009> we'll<00:02:06.189> see<00:02:06.310> how<00:02:06.399> that<00:02:06.520> works<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:06.850> a

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
image we'll see how that works in a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.720 
image we'll see how that works in a
moment

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.190 

and<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.599> looks<00:02:16.780> like<00:02:16.870> we're<00:02:16.989> about<00:02:17.080> to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
and that looks like we're about to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.050 
and that looks like we're about to
reboot<00:02:17.440> now<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.280> bootloader<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.760> still

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
reboot now the bootloader is still

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.180 
reboot now the bootloader is still
unlocked<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:22.989> here<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.799> that's<00:02:23.980> good

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
unlocked you can see here so that's good

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.920 
unlocked you can see here so that's good
news

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.750 

I<00:02:31.019> really<00:02:31.650> once<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.920> bootloader<00:02:32.280> is<00:02:32.400> unlocked

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
I really once the bootloader is unlocked

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.330 
I really once the bootloader is unlocked
I'm<00:02:32.939> not<00:02:33.030> aware<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.299> any<00:02:33.950> firmware<00:02:34.950> update

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
I'm not aware of any firmware update

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.220 
I'm not aware of any firmware update
that<00:02:35.489> would<00:02:35.579> lock<00:02:35.969> it<00:02:36.239> at<00:02:36.870> least<00:02:37.019> not<00:02:37.170> on

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
that would lock it at least not on

00:02:37.230 --> 00:03:46.790 
that would lock it at least not on
something<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.799> Nexus<00:02:38.129> 7

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.560 

okay<00:03:47.550> looks<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:48.180> are<00:03:48.300> rebooted<00:03:50.570> we're

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
okay looks like we are rebooted we're

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.090 
okay looks like we are rebooted we're
setting<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.440> finish<00:03:52.590> loading

so<00:04:21.709> let's<00:04:21.770> see<00:04:22.310> what<00:04:23.440> happens<00:04:24.440> if<00:04:24.620> we

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.170 

okay<00:04:31.680> supersu<00:04:32.070> still<00:04:32.580> seems<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.910> be<00:04:33.000> working

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
okay supersu still seems to be working

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.180 
okay supersu still seems to be working
let's<00:04:33.660> try<00:04:33.960> an<00:04:34.170> app<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.380> requires<00:04:34.890> root

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
let's try an app that requires root

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.460 
let's try an app that requires root
access<00:04:36.920> going<00:04:37.920> to<00:04:37.980> get<00:04:38.100> us<00:04:38.190> File<00:04:38.400> Explorer<00:04:39.470> has

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.320 
access going to get us File Explorer has

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
been granted group permissions settings

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.030 
been granted group permissions settings
root<00:04:48.330> settings<00:04:48.780> looks<00:04:49.560> like<00:04:49.740> we<00:04:49.830> should<00:04:49.980> be

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
root settings looks like we should be

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.540 
root settings looks like we should be
able<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.220> get<00:04:50.280> up<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.610> system<00:04:51.000> level<00:04:52.040> up<00:04:53.040> so

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
able to get up to the system level up so

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.570 
able to get up to the system level up so
now<00:04:53.760> we're<00:04:54.440> accessing<00:04:55.440> files<00:04:56.040> that<00:04:56.460> you

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
now we're accessing files that you

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.110 
now we're accessing files that you
wouldn't<00:04:56.790> be<00:04:56.850> able<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.060> access<00:04:57.330> without<00:04:57.480> root

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
wouldn't be able to access without root

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.560 
wouldn't be able to access without root
let's<00:05:00.120> go<00:05:00.750> ahead<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:00.930> try<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.110> rename<00:05:01.500> one

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.120 

okay<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:06.930> looks<00:05:06.990> like<00:05:07.140> we<00:05:07.320> still<00:05:07.380> have<00:05:07.800> root

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
okay so it looks like we still have root

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.860 
okay so it looks like we still have root
access<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:11.640> should<00:05:11.820> rename<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.120> back<00:05:12.600> so

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
access and I should rename that back so

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.330 
access and I should rename that back so
I<00:05:12.900> don't<00:05:12.990> mess<00:05:13.290> anything<00:05:13.410> up<00:05:16.070> so<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.190> means

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
I don't mess anything up so that means

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.830 
I don't mess anything up so that means
that<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.520> can<00:05:17.640> run<00:05:17.790> apps<00:05:18.000> like<00:05:18.270> titanium

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
that you can run apps like titanium

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.900 
that you can run apps like titanium
backup<00:05:19.230> or<00:05:19.710> any<00:05:20.280> other<00:05:20.430> application<00:05:20.700> that

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
backup or any other application that

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.840 
backup or any other application that
requires<00:05:20.970> root<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:24.470> if<00:05:25.470> you<00:05:25.800> do<00:05:26.310> lose<00:05:26.610> your
