00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it's all hollow inside I actually had

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.179 
it's all hollow inside I actually had
considered<00:01:12.119> building<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.840> new<00:01:13.229> arena<00:01:13.260> inside

considered building a new arena inside

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.670 
considered building a new arena inside
of<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.790> figured<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.360> uh<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.350> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
of this I figured that uh it would be I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.670 
of this I figured that uh it would be I
thought<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> would<00:01:17.130> look<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> cool<00:01:17.700> but

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
thought it would look kind of cool but

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.030 
thought it would look kind of cool but
yeah<00:01:20.659> this<00:01:21.659> one's<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.140> too<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:22.920> know
