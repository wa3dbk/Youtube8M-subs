00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.360
 Welcome to my head 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.990
 name is franziska lukas today that 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.789
 last video here from the cuxhaven 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.189
 Stadtpark and although it is today again 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.579
 around the hazelnut cake the five-piece cake 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.280
 series again dense in the head as can 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.410
 I mean control my thoughts 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.500
 thinks get in the clear in the handle 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.710
 pear will make me feel better and then 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.780
 also decide 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.699
 I would like to feel like that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.499
 to feel and probably want to 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.280
 Do not feel bad for yourself 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:53.890
 Lady with the hazelnut cake because she 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.109
 her life again and again 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.899
 has thought negatively by the media 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.210
 has been programmed by the parents 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.670
 through the drama in the world and it comes 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.680
 automatically catastrophes thought high 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.200
 my god what happens if i now 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.990
 get an allergic shock because 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.320
 I suddenly against 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.450
 hazelnuts allergy spiders and we 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.219
 have different possibilities this 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.530
 to interrupt thoughts, respectively 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.689
 to question that I repeat now 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.399
 not again but today this 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.460
 last video of the five-part series 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.159
 it's about no resistance 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.770
 Afford 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.039
 that means for you they take the 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.079
 thought was and does not fight them like 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:43.420
 Otherwise but the ones you can accept 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:49.719
 to say to oneself inside it is like that 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.859
 It is also a very nice thought it is 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.090
 is my gone 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:59.020
 oh my god i'm not 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.320
 allergic to hazelnuts it is only 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.320
 a thought that again and again 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.679
 internalize no resistance 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.770
 because we know that resistance is more 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.900
 cause a small resistance 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.170
 experiment take something you 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.720
 do not like and do not try 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.990
 now imagine whatever 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.970
 pink 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.490
 we found yes with a long green 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.170
 not imagine this elephant yes one 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.780
 ends in zoology thoughts 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.840
 suppression experiments that is not 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.180
 works is proven 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.070
 therefore sharing resistance is then 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.850
 because I do not do this thought 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.370
 drama from it and I let him and 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.070
 Allowing does not mean that they are on 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.620
 These thoughts are the focus 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.070
 focus on it and more and more 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.520
 to draw similar thoughts 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:01.370
 For example , none is none 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.660
 cap and then everything plays out 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.460
 and the nearest hospital and stops 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.000
 I do not mean that with thoughts 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.220
 let's say okay the thought 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.380
 I hope I do not get a shock 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.110
 since I accept I do not do any 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.200
 history from it no drama is let 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.840
 that's what everyone pulls from this 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.050
 five-part miniseries as they go public 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.120
 to become head and think so to wear 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.820
 more resistance you have all the more 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.800
 Resistance will show the life and 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.210
 the more thoughts of the same 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.660
 they will attract 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.370
 Furthermore associative thinks of 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.770
 Do not waste your number 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.860
 valuable life for less 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.230
 resistance or external build up and 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.110
 to fight against what is but 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.550
 take your thoughts as a kind 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.710
 the programming was 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.530
 Do not make any spotted out no 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.110
 Drama does not promote your thoughts 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.230
 By doing so, let your goal be good 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.110
 as it is 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.710
 That 's it, you practice a method first 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.260
 one lies where you think yes that is 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.080
 I 'm fine with that 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.440
 and somehow learn it up here 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.680
 a neural pathway has commanded 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.720
 until it sits and that she does with it 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.580
 dissolve kind of negative thoughts 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.710
 can 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.560
 Now I wish you still the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.020
 Endure the courage your usual comfort 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.750
 not only leaving the zone every day 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.660
 once 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.530
 not just twice but as often as possible 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.420
 and also look at www bÃ¶senkopf 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.480
 There you will find many more 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.000
 other videos of me like her before 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.040
 become head with psychological 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.980
 elements with elements from the 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.610
 cognitive behavioral therapy and 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.100
 other things 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.200
 There, they learn their thoughts 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.380
 to question and to recognize 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.250
 to find alternatives until the next 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.250
 have a nice time
