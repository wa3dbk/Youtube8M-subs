00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.030 
okay here's your Hotpoint tip for today
let's<00:00:06.000> build<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.480> handyman<00:00:07.259> with<00:00:07.620> appliance

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
let's build a handyman with appliance

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.759 
let's build a handyman with appliance
works<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.269> we're<00:00:09.389> gonna<00:00:09.530> check<00:00:10.530> out<00:00:10.740> a

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
works and so we're gonna check out a

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.350 
works and so we're gonna check out a
problem<00:00:11.130> with<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.490> GD<00:00:12.349> Hotpoint<00:00:13.349> machine

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
problem with this GD Hotpoint machine

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.519 
problem with this GD Hotpoint machine
and<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.609> it's<00:00:17.609> an<00:00:17.789> older<00:00:18.060> older<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:18.960> oldie<00:00:19.500> but

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and so it's an older older one oldie but

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
and so it's an older older one oldie but
a<00:00:19.680> goodie<00:00:22.640> they<00:00:23.640> made<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:24.090> sort<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.570> like

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
a goodie they made these sort of like

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.859 
a goodie they made these sort of like
the<00:00:25.560> rocket<00:00:26.010> scientists<00:00:26.820> designed<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the rocket scientists designed these so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.859 
the rocket scientists designed these so
that<00:00:29.060> they<00:00:30.060> could<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.750> design

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that they could go out and design

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.120 
that they could go out and design
rockets<00:00:31.650> well<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:32.510> is<00:00:33.510> about<00:00:33.840> them<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
rockets well there is about them and a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.959 
rockets well there is about them and a
little<00:00:35.910> laundry<00:00:36.270> without<00:00:36.390> any<00:00:36.809> problem<00:00:37.969> and

little laundry without any problem and

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
little laundry without any problem and
this<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:40.820> has<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> gap<00:00:42.239> right<00:00:42.629> here

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
this one has a gap right here

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.900 
this one has a gap right here
we're<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.860> socks<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.489> things<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
can float over and get plugged in the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.500 
can float over and get plugged in the
water<00:00:49.440> pump<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.969> not<00:00:51.120> spinning

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
water pump so this one was not spinning
