00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.840
 only sevok to 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.510
 heads that we land either 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.170
 in spring or autumn before winter but in this 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.420
 case, we will sow onions chernushku then 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.310
 there are little black seeds 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.560
 pay attention to this 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.739
 there are a lot of bows starting from 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.600

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.489
 golden yellow maroon light 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.069
 scales may sometimes tell which south 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.589
 it tastes like this is unlikely 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.239

 You see onions on greens 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.260
 the red colors of lukovic say that 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.870
 this bow is still more sweet than 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.640
 bitter and choosing their seeds 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.160
