game<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:47.590> definitely<00:00:47.980> very<00:00:48.010> fun<00:00:48.490> but<00:00:48.820> it's

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
game is definitely very fun but it's

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.270 
game is definitely very fun but it's
also<00:00:48.970> very<00:00:49.270> difficult<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:49.990> in<00:00:50.920> case<00:00:51.130> you're

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
also very difficult and in case you're

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.220 
also very difficult and in case you're
wondering<00:00:51.340> it<00:00:51.760> is<00:00:51.880> a<00:00:51.910> one<00:00:52.270> shot<00:00:52.510> one<00:00:52.780> kill<00:00:52.810> to

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
wondering it is a one shot one kill to

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.200 
wondering it is a one shot one kill to
the<00:00:53.320> head<00:00:53.500> but<00:00:54.400> if<00:00:54.490> you<00:00:54.550> go<00:00:54.640> for<00:00:54.790> a<00:00:54.820> body<00:00:55.000> shot

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
the head but if you go for a body shot

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.540 
the head but if you go for a body shot
it's<00:00:55.390> going<00:00:55.540> to<00:00:55.600> take<00:00:55.720> two<00:00:56.020> shots<00:00:56.290> but<00:00:56.800> so<00:00:57.370> far

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
it's going to take two shots but so far

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.800 
it's going to take two shots but so far
there's<00:00:57.790> what<00:00:57.880> we've<00:00:58.030> only<00:00:58.180> had<00:00:58.390> one<00:00:58.570> sniper

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
there's what we've only had one sniper

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.560 
there's what we've only had one sniper
rifle<00:00:59.310> so<00:01:00.310> there<00:01:00.520> might<00:01:00.790> be<00:01:00.850> more<00:01:01.360> powerful

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
rifle so there might be more powerful

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.380 
rifle so there might be more powerful
sniper<00:01:01.990> rifles<00:01:02.350> in<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.650> main<00:01:02.860> game<00:01:03.089> i'm<00:01:04.089> not

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
sniper rifles in the main game i'm not

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.969 
sniper rifles in the main game i'm not
sure<00:01:04.720> i'd<00:01:05.199> actually<00:01:05.350> could<00:01:05.650> be<00:01:05.680> kind<00:01:05.950> of

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
sure i'd actually could be kind of

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.410 
sure i'd actually could be kind of
surprised<00:01:06.340> by<00:01:06.490> this<00:01:06.549> because<00:01:06.700> i<00:01:07.060> don't<00:01:07.329> think

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
surprised by this because i don't think

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.910 
surprised by this because i don't think
they<00:01:07.689> wanted<00:01:07.960> quick<00:01:08.229> scope<00:01:08.470> into<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:08.710> game

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
they wanted quick scope into this game

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.440 
they wanted quick scope into this game
at<00:01:09.070> least<00:01:09.220> by<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.460> mechanics<00:01:09.940> I've<00:01:10.060> seen<00:01:10.270> so

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
at least by the mechanics I've seen so

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.870 
at least by the mechanics I've seen so
far<00:01:10.480> I<00:01:10.930> could<00:01:11.500> be<00:01:11.650> completely<00:01:11.770> wrong<00:01:12.070> but

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
far I could be completely wrong but

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.990 
far I could be completely wrong but
there's<00:01:13.330> some<00:01:13.570> things<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:13.930> are<00:01:14.050> kind<00:01:14.620> of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
there's some things that are kind of

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
there's some things that are kind of
kind<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.120> different<00:01:16.420> for<00:01:16.510> me<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:16.659> guess<00:01:16.870> it's

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
kind of different for me I guess it's

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.990 
kind of different for me I guess it's
not<00:01:17.140> completely<00:01:17.530> different<00:01:17.950> but<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.760> hit

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
not completely different but the hit

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.730 
not completely different but the hit
detection<00:01:19.120> in<00:01:19.510> this<00:01:19.630> game<00:01:19.810> is<00:01:19.990> very<00:01:20.230> precise

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
detection in this game is very precise

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.840 
detection in this game is very precise
so<00:01:21.010> if<00:01:21.070> you're<00:01:21.190> going<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.370> go<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.670> head<00:01:21.820> shot

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
so if you're going to go for a head shot

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.820 
so if you're going to go for a head shot
it's<00:01:22.270> it's<00:01:22.690> got<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.050> like<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.350> got<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.590> hit<00:01:23.680> his

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
it's it's got it like you got to hit his

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.710 
it's it's got it like you got to hit his
head<00:01:23.950> there<00:01:24.460> is<00:01:24.640> no<00:01:24.820> little<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.630> know

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
head there is no little you know

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.590 
head there is no little you know
hitmarker<00:01:26.290> box<00:01:26.530> or<00:01:26.770> anything<00:01:27.040> around<00:01:27.250> his<00:01:27.760> his

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
hitmarker box or anything around his his

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.690 
hitmarker box or anything around his his
body<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.200> if<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.560> want<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.860> get<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.490> headshot

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
body so if you want to get that headshot

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.920 
body so if you want to get that headshot
you're<00:01:31.060> going<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.240> have<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.450> really<00:01:31.659> hit<00:01:31.780> them

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
you're going to have to really hit them

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.800 
you're going to have to really hit them
in<00:01:32.020> in<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.530> face<00:01:32.740> basically<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.880> most<00:01:34.600> games

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
in in the face basically and most games

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.600 
in in the face basically and most games
do<00:01:35.020> have<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.200> little<00:01:35.440> leeway<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:36.220> this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
do have a little leeway in this

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.640 
do have a little leeway in this
department<00:01:37.090> but<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:37.540> have<00:01:37.780> noticed<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.500> it's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
department but I have noticed that it's

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.170 
department but I have noticed that it's
a<00:01:38.710> little<00:01:38.740> unforgiving<00:01:39.490> at<00:01:39.580> times<00:01:39.820> where<00:01:40.090> you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
a little unforgiving at times where you

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.969 
a little unforgiving at times where you
think<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.450> actually<00:01:40.600> got<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.900> head<00:01:41.020> shot<00:01:41.260> but

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
think you actually got the head shot but

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.649 
think you actually got the head shot but
if<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.340> like<00:01:42.610> look<00:01:42.880> at<00:01:42.970> your<00:01:43.120> game<00:01:43.210> play<00:01:43.450> later

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
if you like look at your game play later

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.180 
if you like look at your game play later
it's<00:01:43.900> like<00:01:44.049> yeah<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.229> was<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.620> couple<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.100> you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
it's like yeah I was a couple of you

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.399 
it's like yeah I was a couple of you
know<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.549> couple<00:01:46.150> inches<00:01:46.600> away<00:01:46.810> from<00:01:46.900> his<00:01:47.170> face

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
know a couple inches away from his face

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.740 
know a couple inches away from his face
which<00:01:48.369> is<00:01:48.520> not<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.729> problem<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:49.240> think<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.600> will

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
which is not a problem I think that will

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.510 
which is not a problem I think that will
just<00:01:49.810> make<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.500> sniping<00:01:50.950> requires<00:01:51.400> a

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
just make it so that sniping requires a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.550 
just make it so that sniping requires a
little<00:01:51.670> bit<00:01:51.790> more<00:01:51.940> skill<00:01:52.299> than<00:01:52.330> other<00:01:53.229> games

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
little bit more skill than other games

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.840 
little bit more skill than other games
and<00:01:53.799> I<00:01:53.860> do<00:01:53.920> not<00:01:54.130> have<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.310> problem<00:01:54.640> with<00:01:54.729> that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
and I do not have a problem with that

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.430 
and I do not have a problem with that
it's<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.810> something<00:01:55.900> that<00:01:56.080> I'm<00:01:56.229> going<00:01:56.350> to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
it's just something that I'm going to

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's just something that I'm going to
have<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.619> get<00:01:56.710> used<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.100> but<00:01:57.850> overall<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.540> would

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
have to get used to but overall I would

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.300 
have to get used to but overall I would
say<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.409> most<00:01:59.680> important<00:02:00.100> thing<00:02:00.130> about

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
say that the most important thing about

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.190 
say that the most important thing about
sniping<00:02:00.610> in<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:00.970> game<00:02:01.180> is<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.420> actually<00:02:01.720> stay

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
sniping in this game is to actually stay

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.980 
sniping in this game is to actually stay
patient<00:02:02.530> ah<00:02:03.150> there<00:02:04.150> are<00:02:04.299> some<00:02:04.510> times<00:02:04.750> where

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
patient ah there are some times where

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.090 
patient ah there are some times where
you're<00:02:05.080> going<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.260> see<00:02:05.409> that<00:02:05.560> I'm<00:02:05.680> just<00:02:05.890> far

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
you're going to see that I'm just far

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.469 
you're going to see that I'm just far
enough<00:02:06.220> shots<00:02:06.549> where<00:02:06.880> I'm<00:02:07.090> not<00:02:07.240> hitting

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
enough shots where I'm not hitting

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.119 
enough shots where I'm not hitting
anything<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.470> would<00:02:08.649> have<00:02:08.739> served<00:02:08.950> me

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
anything and it would have served me

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.490 
anything and it would have served me
better<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.459> i<00:02:09.549> actually<00:02:09.909> just<00:02:09.939> kind<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.500> took

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
better if i actually just kind of took

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.890 
better if i actually just kind of took
my<00:02:11.680> time<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.390> waited<00:02:13.390> for<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.630> enemy<00:02:13.870> to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
my time and waited for the enemy to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.160 
my time and waited for the enemy to
settle<00:02:14.260> down<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:15.360> took<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.480> shot<00:02:16.660> then<00:02:16.900> and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
settle down and took the shot then and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.430 
settle down and took the shot then and
then

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
then

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.170 
then
there's<00:02:17.980> also<00:02:18.130> going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.430> some<00:02:18.670> examples

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
there's also going to be some examples

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.930 
there's also going to be some examples
in<00:02:19.270> here<00:02:19.450> where<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.230> enemy<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.790> shooting<00:02:21.790> me<00:02:21.910> I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
in here where the enemy is shooting me I

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.030 
in here where the enemy is shooting me I
don't<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.600> don't<00:02:22.750> rush<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.770> kind<00:02:23.980> of

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
don't I don't rush it and I just kind of

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.980 
don't I don't rush it and I just kind of
take<00:02:24.910> my<00:02:25.060> time<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.450> then<00:02:25.570> I'm<00:02:25.660> able<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.870> get

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
take my time and then I'm able to get

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.270 
take my time and then I'm able to get
the<00:02:26.080> headshot<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.710> actually<00:02:26.860> didn't<00:02:27.220> do

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the headshot and if I actually didn't do

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.430 
the headshot and if I actually didn't do
that<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.460> wouldn't<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.820> gotten<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.090> kill<00:02:28.440> but

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
that I wouldn't have gotten the kill but

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.690 
that I wouldn't have gotten the kill but
if<00:02:29.530> you're<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.770> against<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.130> sniper<00:02:30.400> well

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
if you're going against the sniper well

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.940 
if you're going against the sniper well
I'm<00:02:30.760> talking<00:02:31.330> fast<00:02:31.510> guys<00:02:31.690> but<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:31.900> love<00:02:32.560> stuff<00:02:32.860> I

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
I'm talking fast guys but I love stuff I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.520 
I'm talking fast guys but I love stuff I
want<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.160> talk<00:02:33.280> about<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.290> you're<00:02:35.410> going

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
want to talk about but if you're going

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.200 
want to talk about but if you're going
against<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> sniper<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.430> best<00:02:36.670> thing<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.030> do

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
against the sniper the best thing to do

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.300 
against the sniper the best thing to do
is<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.960> crouched<00:02:38.380> like<00:02:38.620> that<00:02:38.860> guy<00:02:39.040> and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
is to not crouched like that guy and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.160 
is to not crouched like that guy and
also<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.060> move<00:02:40.330> around<00:02:40.450> as<00:02:40.750> much<00:02:40.870> as<00:02:41.020> possible

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
also to move around as much as possible

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.500 
also to move around as much as possible
because<00:02:41.970> they're<00:02:42.970> going<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.300> go<00:02:43.390> for

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
because they're going to have to go for

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.690 
because they're going to have to go for
a<00:02:43.570> head<00:02:43.690> shot<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.400> moving<00:02:45.610> around

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
a head shot and if you're moving around

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.120 
a head shot and if you're moving around
especially<00:02:46.120> with<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.630> Nanosuit<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:48.040> know

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
especially with the Nanosuit you know

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.040 
especially with the Nanosuit you know
you<00:02:48.220> can<00:02:48.430> move<00:02:48.520> pretty<00:02:48.730> quickly<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.420> it's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
you can move pretty quickly and it's

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.120 
you can move pretty quickly and it's
going<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.320> very<00:02:50.350> difficult<00:02:50.560> for<00:02:50.890> them<00:02:51.070> to

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
going to be very difficult for them to

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.400 
going to be very difficult for them to
actually<00:02:51.310> take<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.670> out<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:53.050> also<00:02:53.230> you

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
actually take you out so and also you

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.570 
actually take you out so and also you
know<00:02:53.620> what<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.830> want<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> close<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.310> gap<00:02:54.340> on

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
know what you want to close the gap on

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.210 
know what you want to close the gap on
them<00:02:54.730> as<00:02:54.850> well<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.680> that's<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.040> for<00:02:57.070> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
them as well so that's it for the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.920 
them as well so that's it for the
snipers<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.790> didn't<00:02:58.600> want<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.780> talk<00:02:58.870> about

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
snipers I didn't want to talk about

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.570 
snipers I didn't want to talk about
really<00:02:59.290> quickly<00:02:59.740> some<00:02:59.920> stuff<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.250> would<00:03:00.430> like

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
really quickly some stuff I would like

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.370 
really quickly some stuff I would like
to<00:03:00.610> see<00:03:00.850> polish<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.390> game<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.350> first

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
to see polish in the game and the first

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.460 
to see polish in the game and the first
thing<00:03:02.770> because<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.190> play<00:03:03.370> on<00:03:03.580> PC<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.780> I'd<00:03:05.290> like

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
thing because I play on PC is I'd like

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.560 
thing because I play on PC is I'd like
to<00:03:05.590> have<00:03:05.710> multiple<00:03:06.010> keybinds<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.790> where<00:03:06.940> you

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
to have multiple keybinds to where you

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.990 
to have multiple keybinds to where you
can<00:03:07.870> keep<00:03:08.170> bind<00:03:08.410> let's<00:03:09.220> say<00:03:09.340> crouch<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.910> do

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
can keep bind let's say crouch to do

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.970 
can keep bind let's say crouch to do
different<00:03:10.300> keys<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:11.410> reason<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.680> say<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:11.860> is

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
different keys the reason I say this is

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.730 
different keys the reason I say this is
because<00:03:12.340> Crouch<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.940> great<00:03:13.240> i<00:03:13.480> have<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.530> great

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
because Crouch is a great i have a great

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.010 
because Crouch is a great i have a great
key<00:03:14.920> for<00:03:15.100> couch<00:03:15.250> right<00:03:15.520> now<00:03:15.580> but<00:03:16.390> if<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.840> want

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
key for couch right now but if you want

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.200 
key for couch right now but if you want
to<00:03:17.050> do<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> power<00:03:17.590> slide<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.820> have<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.060> both

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
to do the power slide you have to both

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.150 
to do the power slide you have to both
sprint<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.960> then<00:03:20.200> hit<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.470> Crouch<00:03:20.620> button<00:03:20.830> at

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
sprint and then hit the Crouch button at

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.970 
sprint and then hit the Crouch button at
the<00:03:21.220> same<00:03:21.280> time<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.290> my<00:03:23.290> fingers<00:03:23.620> aren't<00:03:23.830> that

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
the same time and my fingers aren't that

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.860 
the same time and my fingers aren't that
nimble<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.430> guess<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.940> for<00:03:25.570> whatever<00:03:25.720> reason

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
nimble I guess and for whatever reason

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.390 
nimble I guess and for whatever reason
hitting<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.470> sprint<00:03:26.709> button<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.160> crouched

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
hitting the sprint button and crouched

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.610 
hitting the sprint button and crouched
at<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.550> same<00:03:27.730> time<00:03:27.880> just<00:03:28.150> doesn't<00:03:28.360> work<00:03:28.620> so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
at the same time just doesn't work so

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.510 
at the same time just doesn't work so
basically<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.130> just<00:03:30.370> want<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.700> have<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:30.910> key<00:03:31.360> or<00:03:31.630> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
basically I just want to have a key or a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.890 
basically I just want to have a key or a
way<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:33.580> make<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.180> two<00:03:34.510> different

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
way to make it so that two different

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.720 
way to make it so that two different
keybinds<00:03:35.230> can<00:03:35.560> do<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.739> same<00:03:35.920> thing<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.370> I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
keybinds can do the same thing and I

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.530 
keybinds can do the same thing and I
think<00:03:36.910> they<00:03:36.970> would<00:03:37.060> just<00:03:37.120> make<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.450> little

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
think they would just make it a little

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.900 
think they would just make it a little
bit<00:03:37.690> more<00:03:37.870> enjoyable<00:03:38.340> another<00:03:39.340> thing<00:03:39.520> that<00:03:39.670> I

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
bit more enjoyable another thing that I

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.610 
bit more enjoyable another thing that I
would<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.480> change<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.200> maybe<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
would like to see change is maybe the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.220 
would like to see change is maybe the
sensitivity<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.580> jumping<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.209> find<00:03:44.080> that<00:03:44.140> a

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
sensitivity for jumping I find that a

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.750 
sensitivity for jumping I find that a
lot<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.500> times<00:03:44.680> when<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:44.890> go<00:03:45.010> for<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.220> normal<00:03:45.550> jump

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
lot of times when I go for a normal jump

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.610 
lot of times when I go for a normal jump
I<00:03:46.000> actually<00:03:46.390> go<00:03:46.660> for<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.900> super<00:03:47.200> jump<00:03:47.440> and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
I actually go for the super jump and

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.199 
I actually go for the super jump and
this<00:03:48.100> can<00:03:48.250> get<00:03:48.340> annoying<00:03:48.580> especially<00:03:48.790> if

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
this can get annoying especially if

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.220 
this can get annoying especially if
you're<00:03:49.330> running<00:03:49.390> out<00:03:49.570> of<00:03:49.630> energy<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.140> you

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
you're running out of energy and you

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.460 
you're running out of energy and you
need<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.620> add<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.100> energy<00:03:51.550> for<00:03:52.140> for<00:03:53.140> armor

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
need to add the energy for for armor

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.130 
need to add the energy for for armor
mode<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.940> definitely<00:03:55.480> got<00:03:55.690> me<00:03:55.840> killed<00:03:56.050> a

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
mode and it definitely got me killed a

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.900 
mode and it definitely got me killed a
couple<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.440> times<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.830> also<00:03:57.220> there's<00:03:57.730> been

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
couple of times and also there's been

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.020 
couple of times and also there's been
some<00:03:58.090> times<00:03:58.330> where<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:58.690> will<00:03:59.260> go<00:03:59.500> for<00:03:59.800> a<00:04:00.430> normal

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
some times where I will go for a normal

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.940 
some times where I will go for a normal
jump<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.390> then<00:04:01.480> I'll<00:04:01.630> super<00:04:01.989> jump<00:04:02.170> into<00:04:02.350> our

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
jump and then I'll super jump into our

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.070 
jump and then I'll super jump into our
off<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.730> building<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:04.900> pretty

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
off the building and it's pretty

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.240 
off the building and it's pretty
frustrating<00:04:05.290> when<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.709> happens<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.130> doesn't

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
frustrating when it happens it doesn't

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.070 
frustrating when it happens it doesn't
happen<00:04:06.400> very<00:04:06.519> often<00:04:06.820> but<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.600> just<00:04:07.810> think<00:04:08.019> that

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
happen very often but I just think that

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.630 
happen very often but I just think that
if<00:04:08.260> they<00:04:08.350> may<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.620> lowered<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.070> sensitivity

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
if they may be lowered the sensitivity

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.940 
if they may be lowered the sensitivity
for<00:04:09.850> super<00:04:10.180> jump<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:11.320> would<00:04:11.440> just<00:04:11.530> make<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.800> a

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
for super jump it would just make it a

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.460 
for super jump it would just make it a
little<00:04:12.220> less<00:04:12.370> frustrating<00:04:12.940> at<00:04:13.060> times<00:04:13.470> that's

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
little less frustrating at times that's

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.590 
little less frustrating at times that's
just<00:04:14.590> my<00:04:14.680> opinion<00:04:14.820> now<00:04:15.820> another<00:04:16.090> thing<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.510> i

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
just my opinion now another thing that i

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.000 
just my opinion now another thing that i
think<00:04:16.660> i<00:04:16.840> would<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.200> see<00:04:17.350> changed<00:04:17.799> is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
think i would like to see changed is

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.890 
think i would like to see changed is
when<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.340> pick<00:04:18.459> up<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:18.669> dog<00:04:18.850> tag<00:04:19.090> after<00:04:19.419> you've

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
when you pick up a dog tag after you've

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.659 
when you pick up a dog tag after you've
killed<00:04:20.109> someone<00:04:20.320> i<00:04:20.739> would<00:04:20.950> like<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.459> that

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
killed someone i would like it so that

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.240 
killed someone i would like it so that
you<00:04:22.450> would<00:04:22.780> consent<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.230> continuously<00:04:23.950> see

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
you would consent to continuously see

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.000 
you would consent to continuously see
how<00:04:24.490> many<00:04:25.050> how<00:04:26.050> many<00:04:26.110> times<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.860> actually

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
how many how many times you actually

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.969 
how many how many times you actually
have<00:04:27.370> accumulated<00:04:28.440> because<00:04:29.440> right<00:04:29.590> now<00:04:29.620> they

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
have accumulated because right now they

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.110 
have accumulated because right now they
disappear<00:04:30.490> really<00:04:30.760> quickly

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
disappear really quickly

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.150 
disappear really quickly
and<00:04:31.330> i<00:04:31.540> find<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.870> for<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.500> most<00:04:32.650> part<00:04:32.770> i<00:04:33.010> will

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
and i find that for the most part i will

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.890 
and i find that for the most part i will
actually<00:04:33.490> forget<00:04:33.760> how<00:04:33.910> many<00:04:34.120> dog<00:04:34.630> tags

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
actually forget how many dog tags

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.750 
actually forget how many dog tags
actually<00:04:35.260> have<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.770> there's<00:04:36.280> bet<00:04:36.430> definitely

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
actually have and there's bet definitely

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.550 
actually have and there's bet definitely
been<00:04:36.880> some<00:04:36.910> cases<00:04:37.150> where<00:04:37.389> i<00:04:37.570> think<00:04:38.020> i<00:04:38.139> have

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
been some cases where i think i have

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.010 
been some cases where i think i have
only<00:04:39.340> need<00:04:39.669> one<00:04:40.000> more<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.540> actually<00:04:40.780> get<00:04:40.900> my

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
only need one more to actually get my

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.150 
only need one more to actually get my
next<00:04:41.229> kill<00:04:41.440> streak<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.910> i<00:04:42.910> will<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.479> no<00:04:43.600> rush

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
next kill streak and i will you no rush

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.230 
next kill streak and i will you no rush
to<00:04:45.160> go<00:04:45.370> get<00:04:45.580> it<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.760> then<00:04:45.880> I'll<00:04:46.000> get<00:04:46.090> myself

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
to go get it and then I'll get myself

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.969 
to go get it and then I'll get myself
killed<00:04:46.600> because<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.290> while<00:04:47.860> this

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
killed because of it and while this

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.740 
killed because of it and while this
isn't<00:04:48.160> really<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.460> bad<00:04:48.669> thing<00:04:48.880> and<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.570> just

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
isn't really a bad thing and I just

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.360 
isn't really a bad thing and I just
think<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.260> if<00:04:50.410> they<00:04:50.560> made<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.860> or<00:04:51.040> made<00:04:51.250> an

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
think that if they made it or made an

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.400 
think that if they made it or made an
option<00:04:51.850> so<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:52.449> you<00:04:52.720> could<00:04:52.870> continuously

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
option so that you could continuously

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.439 
option so that you could continuously
see<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.949> dog<00:04:54.100> tags<00:04:54.430> or<00:04:54.610> how<00:04:54.729> many<00:04:54.790> you<00:04:55.030> had<00:04:55.210> at

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
see the dog tags or how many you had at

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.450 
see the dog tags or how many you had at
all<00:04:55.570> times<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:56.199> think<00:04:56.979> would<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.190> be<00:04:57.310> a<00:04:57.340> little

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
all times I think would just be a little

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.670 
all times I think would just be a little
bit<00:04:57.639> more<00:04:57.729> enjoyable<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.330> make<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:59.440> user

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
bit more enjoyable and make the user

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.110 
bit more enjoyable and make the user
interface<00:04:59.949> may<00:05:00.310> be<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.460> little<00:05:00.550> bit<00:05:00.729> more<00:05:00.820> a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
interface may be a little bit more a

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.830 
interface may be a little bit more a
little<00:05:01.180> bit<00:05:01.750> more<00:05:01.900> friendly<00:05:02.520> unless<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.850> don't

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
little bit more friendly unless I don't

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.210 
little bit more friendly unless I don't
know<00:05:05.020> you<00:05:05.199> guys<00:05:05.320> maybe<00:05:05.680> I'm<00:05:05.830> just<00:05:05.919> completely

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
know you guys maybe I'm just completely

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.159 
know you guys maybe I'm just completely
stupid<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:06.940> just<00:05:07.150> need<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.330> be<00:05:07.449> need<00:05:08.050> to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
stupid and I just need to be need to

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.500 
stupid and I just need to be need to
remember<00:05:08.380> how<00:05:08.650> many<00:05:08.860> actually<00:05:09.220> have<00:05:09.400> oh<00:05:09.669> yeah

remember how many actually have oh yeah

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.629 
remember how many actually have oh yeah
another<00:05:11.350> thing<00:05:11.560> is<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.770> melee<00:05:12.039> system<00:05:12.430> can<00:05:12.610> be

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
another thing is the melee system can be

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.520 
another thing is the melee system can be
little<00:05:12.880> wonky<00:05:13.150> I<00:05:13.510> find<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.080> there's<00:05:14.380> some

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
little wonky I find that there's some

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.170 
little wonky I find that there's some
times<00:05:14.740> where<00:05:14.919> I<00:05:14.949> think<00:05:15.280> I've<00:05:15.460> won<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.820> Neely

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
times where I think I've won the Neely

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.700 
times where I think I've won the Neely
battle<00:05:16.600> but<00:05:16.750> all<00:05:16.840> of<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.960> sudden<00:05:17.229> he<00:05:17.350> just<00:05:17.500> takes

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
battle but all of a sudden he just takes

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.070 
battle but all of a sudden he just takes
me<00:05:17.860> out<00:05:17.949> and<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:19.030> don't<00:05:19.270> know<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:19.360> it's

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
me out and I don't know I it's

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.540 
me out and I don't know I it's
definitely<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.919> definitely<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.520> very

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
definitely a definitely a very

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.969 
definitely a definitely a very
interesting<00:05:22.210> system<00:05:22.590> I'm<00:05:23.590> not<00:05:23.740> really<00:05:23.889> sure

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
interesting system I'm not really sure

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.219 
interesting system I'm not really sure
how<00:05:24.220> they<00:05:24.340> could<00:05:24.490> improve<00:05:24.520> upon<00:05:24.850> it<00:05:25.169> but<00:05:26.169> I

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
how they could improve upon it but I

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.960 
how they could improve upon it but I
just<00:05:26.380> kind<00:05:26.590> of<00:05:26.650> wanted<00:05:26.889> to<00:05:27.039> get<00:05:27.729> your<00:05:27.850> guys

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
just kind of wanted to get your guys

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.189 
just kind of wanted to get your guys

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
opinion what do you guys think about the

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.439 
opinion what do you guys think about the
melee<00:05:29.380> system<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:29.919> find<00:05:30.160> it's<00:05:30.340> it's<00:05:31.060> kind<00:05:31.360> of

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
melee system I find it's it's kind of

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.640 
melee system I find it's it's kind of
strange<00:05:31.919> it's<00:05:32.919> it's<00:05:33.460> definitely<00:05:33.850> interesting

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
strange it's it's definitely interesting

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.360 
strange it's it's definitely interesting
but<00:05:35.650> let<00:05:35.740> me<00:05:35.770> know<00:05:35.830> down<00:05:36.010> in<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.160> comments

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
but let me know down in the comments

section<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.970> lastly<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:37.990> figured<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.650> should

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
section and lastly I figured I should

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.110 
section and lastly I figured I should
just<00:05:39.010> mention<00:05:39.190> this<00:05:39.370> really<00:05:39.580> quickly<00:05:39.760> you

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
just mention this really quickly you

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.460 
just mention this really quickly you
guys<00:05:40.270> probably<00:05:40.450> notice<00:05:40.810> that<00:05:40.930> I<00:05:40.960> haven't<00:05:41.169> used

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
guys probably notice that I haven't used

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.040 
guys probably notice that I haven't used
the<00:05:41.590> nanosuit<00:05:42.340> vision<00:05:43.150> or<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.360> nano<00:05:43.570> vision

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
the nanosuit vision or the nano vision

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.320 
the nanosuit vision or the nano vision
and<00:05:44.229> all<00:05:44.460> throughout<00:05:45.460> this<00:05:45.610> entire<00:05:45.760> gameplay

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
and all throughout this entire gameplay

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.000 
and all throughout this entire gameplay
but<00:05:46.479> that's<00:05:46.720> because<00:05:46.870> this<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> little<00:05:47.919> bit

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
but that's because this is a little bit

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.120 
but that's because this is a little bit
older<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.970> I<00:05:49.870> just<00:05:50.139> never<00:05:50.320> really<00:05:50.770> got<00:05:50.919> into

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
older and I I just never really got into

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.190 
older and I I just never really got into
using<00:05:51.580> it<00:05:51.700> it<00:05:51.880> I<00:05:52.180> didn't<00:05:52.479> keep<00:05:52.720> mine<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.169> a

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
using it it I didn't keep mine it to a

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.029 
using it it I didn't keep mine it to a
more<00:05:53.410> appropriate<00:05:54.330> position<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:56.560> just<00:05:56.830> I

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
more appropriate position and I just I

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:58.500 
more appropriate position and I just I
just<00:05:57.160> never<00:05:57.460> used<00:05:57.760> it<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.210> lot<00:05:58.330> of<00:05:58.360> people

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
just never used it and a lot of people

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.330 
just never used it and a lot of people
