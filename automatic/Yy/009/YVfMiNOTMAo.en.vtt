you<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.099> sit<00:00:14.280> through<00:00:14.309> them<00:00:14.610> just<00:00:15.120> for

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
you have to sit through them just for

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.390 
you have to sit through them just for
the<00:00:15.360> sake<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.859> you<00:00:16.859> know<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> be

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the sake of it you know it's going to be

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.070 
the sake of it you know it's going to be
more<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> same<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.510> again<00:00:18.900> another

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
more of the same this is again another

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.500 
more of the same this is again another
military<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.789> case<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.359> those

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
military one just in case for those

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240 
military one just in case for those
people<00:00:21.689> who<00:00:21.869> didn't<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> first<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:22.830> or

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
people who didn't get the first time or

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.210 
people who didn't get the first time or
just<00:00:23.310> wanted<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.960> know<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.859> how<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
just wanted to you know see how it

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.589 
just wanted to you know see how it
turned<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.910> think<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.570> probably

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
turned out I think you can probably

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.500 
turned out I think you can probably
guess<00:00:28.230> how<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.830> turn<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.189> I

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
guess how it's going to turn out I

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
guess how it's going to turn out I
wouldn't<00:00:30.510> put<00:00:30.570> these<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.199> I'd<00:00:31.520> completely

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
wouldn't put these up if I'd completely

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.170 
wouldn't put these up if I'd completely
got<00:00:32.700> my<00:00:32.850> ass<00:00:33.059> kicked<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:34.100> you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.219> well<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
got my ass kicked so you know well I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.090 
got my ass kicked so you know well I
might<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.559> probably<00:00:37.559> wouldn't<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
might have probably wouldn't know that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.880 
might have probably wouldn't know that
and<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.090> yeah<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> mean<00:00:39.930> controlling<00:00:40.320> armies<00:00:40.800> is

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and so yeah I mean controlling armies is

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
and so yeah I mean controlling armies is
pretty<00:00:41.129> simple<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.640> game<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.969> I'm<00:00:42.840> going

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
pretty simple in this game and I'm going

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.510 
pretty simple in this game and I'm going
to<00:00:43.200> try<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> repeat<00:00:43.920> too<00:00:44.070> many<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.340> my

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to try not to repeat too many of my

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
to try not to repeat too many of my
points<00:00:44.850> though<00:00:44.969> let's<00:00:45.690> let's<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.649> about

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
points though let's let's think about

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.660 
points though let's let's think about
some<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> things<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.399> i<00:00:47.520> haven't

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
some of the things that i haven't

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.360 
some of the things that i haven't
mentioned<00:00:47.850> about<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.600> game<00:00:49.250> where'd<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
mentioned about this game where'd it

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.979 
mentioned about this game where'd it
wedge<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.700> soldiers<00:00:51.030> come<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.360> well<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
wedge your soldiers come from well you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.510 
wedge your soldiers come from well you
know<00:00:52.110> there's<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> mobilisation<00:00:52.920> pull<00:00:53.250> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

you<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.170> mobilize<00:00:55.730> demobilize<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.940> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you can mobilize demobilize if you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.779

standing<00:02:29.140> army<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.910> for<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.150> need

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
standing army and you for that you need

standing army and you for that you need
manpower<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.900> need<00:02:31.930> those<00:02:32.260> resources<00:02:32.590> you

manpower you need those resources you

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.620 
manpower you need those resources you
gather<00:02:33.280> resources<00:02:33.520> by<00:02:33.910> importing<00:02:34.270> them<00:02:34.450> or

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
gather resources by importing them or

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.580 
gather resources by importing them or
creating<00:02:35.020> them<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.230> factories<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:37.590> if

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
creating them in factories and if if

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.440 
creating them in factories and if if
you're<00:02:39.340> wondering<00:02:39.490> where<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.180> get<00:02:40.270> your

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
you're wondering where do you get your

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.390 
you're wondering where do you get your
manpower<00:02:40.810> from<00:02:41.050> you<00:02:41.380> gotta<00:02:41.590> increase<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
manpower from you gotta increase the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.850 
manpower from you gotta increase the
defense<00:02:42.700> budget<00:02:43.290> alternatively<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.470> can

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
defense budget alternatively you can

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.760 
defense budget alternatively you can
manually<00:02:45.820> go<00:02:46.570> into<00:02:46.840> provinces<00:02:47.170> like<00:02:47.350> we<00:02:47.710> were

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
manually go into provinces like we were

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.860 
manually go into provinces like we were
doing<00:02:47.980> with<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.220> pops<00:02:48.660> earlier<00:02:49.660> with<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
doing with the pops earlier with the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.500 
doing with the pops earlier with the
factories<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.650> instead<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.670> changing<00:02:52.270> them

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
factories and instead of changing them

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.930 
factories and instead of changing them
into<00:02:52.810> craftsmen<00:02:53.320> change<00:02:53.920> them<00:02:54.100> into<00:02:54.220> soldiers

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
into craftsmen change them into soldiers

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.450 
into craftsmen change them into soldiers
and<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:56.580> increases<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:58.570> manpower<00:02:59.340> that<00:03:00.340> you

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
and that increases the manpower that you

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.260 
and that increases the manpower that you
see<00:03:00.670> on<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.090> top<00:03:01.450> left<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:03.490> screen<00:03:03.700> it's

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
see on the top left of the screen it's

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.600 
see on the top left of the screen it's
like<00:03:04.510> it's<00:03:05.470> not<00:03:05.620> quite<00:03:05.950> where<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> crown<00:03:06.580> or

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
like it's not quite where the crown or

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.960 
like it's not quite where the crown or
the<00:03:07.000> military<00:03:07.930> icon<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:09.460> just<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.760> little

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the military icon is it's just a little

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.390 
the military icon is it's just a little
bit<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.300> right<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:11.130> that's<00:03:12.130> where<00:03:12.370> you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
bit to the right and that's where you

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.420 
bit to the right and that's where you
get<00:03:12.610> your<00:03:12.790> your<00:03:13.390> manpower<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:15.280> one

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
get your your manpower and that's one

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.830 
get your your manpower and that's one
way<00:03:15.580> of<00:03:15.610> doing<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.030> then<00:03:16.210> you<00:03:16.420> know<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.600> go

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
way of doing it and then you know you go

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.510 
way of doing it and then you know you go
into<00:03:16.960> that<00:03:17.050> military<00:03:17.590> screen<00:03:18.280> with<00:03:18.490> the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
into that military screen with the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.030 
into that military screen with the
cannon<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.260> right<00:03:20.410> hand<00:03:20.560> side<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
cannon on the right hand side of the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.450 
cannon on the right hand side of the
crown<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:23.260> go<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.440> create<00:03:23.770> army<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.280> then

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
crown and you go to create army and then

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.670 
crown and you go to create army and then
you<00:03:25.030> create<00:03:25.270> however<00:03:25.840> many<00:03:26.050> divisions<00:03:26.530> you

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
you create however many divisions you

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.680 
you create however many divisions you
want<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.100> each<00:03:27.310> division<00:03:27.580> is<00:03:27.850> worth<00:03:28.000> 10,000

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
want and each division is worth 10,000

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.220 
want and each division is worth 10,000
you<00:03:28.990> can<00:03:29.140> get<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.320> special<00:03:29.620> type<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:29.860> infantry

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
you can get a special type of infantry

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.870 
you can get a special type of infantry
but<00:03:32.230> really<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:32.920> don't<00:03:33.070> see<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.400> point<00:03:33.670> it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
but really I don't see the point it

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.540 
but really I don't see the point it
costs<00:03:34.240> sort<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.080> extra<00:03:35.410> resources<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.100> for<00:03:36.430> me

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
costs sort of extra resources and for me

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.190 
costs sort of extra resources and for me
it's<00:03:36.700> a<00:03:36.820> little<00:03:37.030> bit<00:03:37.150> too<00:03:37.330> complicated<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:38.050> like

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
it's a little bit too complicated I like

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.020 
it's a little bit too complicated I like
just<00:03:38.440> keeping<00:03:38.770> sticking<00:03:39.490> with<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.730> normal

almost<00:05:41.920> never<00:05:42.280> ending<00:05:42.700> process<00:05:43.480> of<00:05:43.870> everyone

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
almost never ending process of everyone

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.080 
almost never ending process of everyone
invading<00:05:45.160> you<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.520> know<00:05:45.640> it's<00:05:45.880> ridiculous

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
invading you you know it's ridiculous

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.020

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
but so here I was kind of getting rid of

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.450 
but so here I was kind of getting rid of
the<00:05:52.090> defensive<00:05:52.930> alliance<00:05:53.200> only<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.160> replace

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
the defensive alliance only to replace

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.400 
the defensive alliance only to replace
it<00:05:54.610> with<00:05:54.700> the<00:05:54.760> normal<00:05:55.060> alliance<00:05:55.450> I<00:05:55.900> kind<00:05:56.350> of

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
it with the normal alliance I kind of

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.860 
it with the normal alliance I kind of
spoken<00:05:56.620> about<00:05:56.770> that<00:05:57.040> already<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:57.640> was<00:05:57.790> just<00:05:57.940> so

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
spoken about that already it was just so

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.540 
spoken about that already it was just so
that<00:05:59.050> when<00:05:59.230> I<00:05:59.260> attack<00:05:59.710> someone<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.100> can<00:06:00.400> call

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
that when I attack someone I can call

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.090 
that when I attack someone I can call
upon<00:06:00.730> Prussia<00:06:01.540> I<00:06:01.780> can<00:06:01.990> call<00:06:02.170> upon<00:06:02.320> the<00:06:02.860> Ottoman

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
upon Prussia I can call upon the Ottoman

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.550

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
you guys will find and they will is like

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.950 
you guys will find and they will is like
one<00:06:08.620> hundred<00:06:08.860> percent<00:06:08.890> certainty<00:06:09.810> which<00:06:10.810> is

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
one hundred percent certainty which is

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.080 
one hundred percent certainty which is
important<00:06:11.400> so<00:06:12.400> it's<00:06:12.490> not<00:06:12.610> just<00:06:12.670> like<00:06:12.940> it

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
important so it's not just like it

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.220 
important so it's not just like it
because<00:06:13.300> if<00:06:13.480> you<00:06:13.570> have<00:06:13.690> an<00:06:13.780> alliance<00:06:14.020> with

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
because if you have an alliance with

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.100 
because if you have an alliance with
another<00:06:14.500> country<00:06:14.890> in<00:06:15.010> this<00:06:15.130> game<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:17.020> know

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
another country in this game you know

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.340 
another country in this game you know
they<00:06:17.260> can<00:06:17.290> back<00:06:17.620> out<00:06:17.800> when<00:06:18.610> their<00:06:18.790> satellite

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
they can back out when their satellite

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.140 
they can back out when their satellite
they<00:06:20.350> can't<00:06:20.650> really<00:06:20.920> unless<00:06:21.430> they<00:06:21.670> actually

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
they can't really unless they actually

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.050 
they can't really unless they actually
attack<00:06:22.990> you<00:06:23.260> and<00:06:23.500> declare<00:06:24.310> war<00:06:24.520> on<00:06:24.580> you<00:06:24.850> which

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
attack you and declare war on you which

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.250 
attack you and declare war on you which
is<00:06:25.240> almost<00:06:25.810> never<00:06:27.480> so<00:06:28.480> I'm<00:06:28.570> pretty<00:06:28.720> certain<00:06:28.990> on

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
is almost never so I'm pretty certain on

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.740 
is almost never so I'm pretty certain on
that<00:06:29.470> on<00:06:29.680> that<00:06:29.740> note<00:06:30.730> and<00:06:30.850> so<00:06:31.360> would<00:06:31.480> you<00:06:31.600> do

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
that on that note and so would you do

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.300 
that on that note and so would you do
once<00:06:31.960> you've<00:06:32.110> done<00:06:32.230> a<00:06:32.290> war<00:06:32.530> you<00:06:32.980> get<00:06:33.190> your

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
once you've done a war you get your

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.980 
once you've done a war you get your
country<00:06:33.640> to<00:06:33.790> have<00:06:33.940> prestige<00:06:34.390> you<00:06:34.630> get<00:06:34.840> your

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
country to have prestige you get your

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.610 
country to have prestige you get your
country<00:06:35.320> to<00:06:35.470> be<00:06:36.010> industrially<00:06:36.840> mighty<00:06:37.840> by

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
country to be industrially mighty by

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.000 
country to be industrially mighty by
creating<00:06:39.070> railroads<00:06:39.580> and<00:06:40.320> factories<00:06:41.320> so<00:06:41.980> I

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
creating railroads and factories so I

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.470 
creating railroads and factories so I
probably<00:06:42.340> won't<00:06:42.490> do<00:06:42.730> too<00:06:42.910> many<00:06:43.120> more<00:06:43.300> of<00:06:43.330> these

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
probably won't do too many more of these

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.780 
probably won't do too many more of these
videos<00:06:44.050> hopefully<00:06:45.040> you<00:06:45.400> get<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.610> idea<00:06:45.760> by<00:06:46.210> now

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
videos hopefully you get the idea by now

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.970 
videos hopefully you get the idea by now
it's<00:06:48.790> not<00:06:48.910> a<00:06:48.970> simple<00:06:49.210> game<00:06:49.360> is<00:06:49.540> pretty<00:06:50.500> complex

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980 
it's not a simple game is pretty complex

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.970 
it's not a simple game is pretty complex
but<00:06:51.220> you<00:06:52.120> know<00:06:52.270> it's<00:06:52.630> it's<00:06:53.080> also<00:06:53.680> very

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
but you know it's it's also very

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.150 
but you know it's it's also very
rewarding<00:06:54.120> it's<00:06:55.120> a<00:06:55.210> lot<00:06:55.390> of<00:06:55.450> depth<00:06:55.660> to<00:06:55.860> so<00:06:56.860> for

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
rewarding it's a lot of depth to so for

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.450 
rewarding it's a lot of depth to so for
now<00:06:57.190> that's<00:06:57.730> me

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.520 

you
