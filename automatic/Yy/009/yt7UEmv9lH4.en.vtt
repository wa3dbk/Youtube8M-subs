00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.700
 that is worthy that the embassy recorded was 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.440
 well known but it is in the public domain that 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.300
 music that song then several people

 seventh pedal is the site itself as 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 you write to a single cipher you go 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.129
 see complete the seventh most under the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:12.030

 put aline references as a reference 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.040
 How do you write cipher numbers? 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.690
 find it there full sales 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.080
