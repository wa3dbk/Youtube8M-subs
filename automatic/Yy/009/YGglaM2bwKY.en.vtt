00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
overlap map as we come right round on to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
overlap map as we come right round on to

and<00:02:29.860> up<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:31.410> looks<00:02:32.410> like<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> mr.<00:02:32.920> whippy

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and up you go looks like a mr. whippy

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.800 
and up you go looks like a mr. whippy
right<00:02:34.690> let's<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.260> one<00:02:35.470> again<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.450> put<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
right let's do this one again so I put a

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.530 
right let's do this one again so I put a
little<00:02:37.960> star<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.710> middle<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:40.330> to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
little star in the middle just to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.390 
little star in the middle just to
balance<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:41.140> out<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.290> little<00:02:41.620> bit<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.280> know

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
balance it out a little bit so I know

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.870 
balance it out a little bit so I know
which<00:02:42.930> exactly<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.170> circle<00:02:44.710> I'm<00:02:44.830> doing<00:02:45.220> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
which exactly the circle I'm doing and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.090 
which exactly the circle I'm doing and
also<00:02:46.330> as<00:02:46.600> I'm<00:02:46.870> building<00:02:47.050> up<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:47.860> got<00:02:48.070> a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
also as I'm building up it's got a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.180 
also as I'm building up it's got a
little<00:02:48.280> bit<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:49.300> foundation<00:02:50.230> there<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.950> we

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
little bit of foundation there so we

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.330 
little bit of foundation there so we
start<00:02:51.460> here<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:53.140> light<00:02:53.380> pressure<00:02:53.770> not

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
start here it's light pressure not

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.850 
start here it's light pressure not
pressing<00:02:54.640> too<00:02:54.970> far<00:02:55.630> down<00:02:55.900> onto<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.350> cupcakes

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
pressing too far down onto the cupcakes

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.640 
pressing too far down onto the cupcakes
we<00:02:57.100> want<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.370> build<00:02:57.550> height<00:02:58.200> coming<00:02:59.200> towards

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
we want to build height coming towards

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.590 
we want to build height coming towards
the<00:02:59.770> middle<00:03:00.190> slightly<00:03:00.700> overlap<00:03:01.210> in<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
the middle slightly overlap in the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.680 
the middle slightly overlap in the
outside<00:03:02.050> circle<00:03:02.880> repeating<00:03:03.880> till<00:03:04.270> we<00:03:04.330> get<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
outside circle repeating till we get to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.690 
outside circle repeating till we get to
the<00:03:04.780> top<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.820> blue-ray<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.920> that's<00:03:09.220> using<00:03:09.460> the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
the top and blue-ray so that's using the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.220 
the top and blue-ray so that's using the
1m<00:03:10.150> piping<00:03:11.110> tip<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.760> that's<00:03:12.880> we've<00:03:13.390> got<00:03:13.630> two

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
1m piping tip so that's we've got two

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.150 
1m piping tip so that's we've got two
examples<00:03:14.590> there<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.850> third<00:03:16.120> one<00:03:17.160> I'm

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
examples there and the third one I'm

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.479 
examples there and the third one I'm
using<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:18.790> piping<00:03:19.510> tip<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.110> is<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.340> the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
using this piping tip and is this is the

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.650 
using this piping tip and is this is the
1<00:03:21.670> 2<00:03:21.940> 3<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.630> actually<00:03:23.020> what<00:03:23.170> I've<00:03:23.290> got<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:24.660> the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
1 2 3 but actually what I've got in the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.510 
1 2 3 but actually what I've got in the
piping<00:03:25.989> bag<00:03:26.050> is<00:03:26.410> 1<00:03:26.650> 2<00:03:26.860> 1<00:03:27.070> it's<00:03:27.250> slightly

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
piping bag is 1 2 1 it's slightly

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.250 
piping bag is 1 2 1 it's slightly
smaller<00:03:27.700> because<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.270> don't<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.810> exactly

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
smaller because I don't have to exactly

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.180 
smaller because I don't have to exactly
the<00:03:29.470> same<00:03:29.610> size<00:03:30.610> but<00:03:31.420> they<00:03:31.780> do<00:03:31.840> exactly<00:03:32.830> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
the same size but they do exactly the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.699 
the same size but they do exactly the
same<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.670> those<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.720> can<00:03:34.870> get<00:03:35.020> it<00:03:35.200> ice<00:03:35.320> gems

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
same and those you can get it ice gems

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.600 
same and those you can get it ice gems
and<00:03:36.330> they're<00:03:37.330> online<00:03:37.900> or<00:03:38.310> if<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.430> live

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
what I've done here is I've just put a

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.210 
what I've done here is I've just put a
little<00:03:47.230> bit<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:49.050> buttercream<00:03:50.050> on<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.650> cupcake

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
little bit of buttercream on the cupcake

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.840 
little bit of buttercream on the cupcake
a<00:03:51.520> little<00:03:52.510> bit<00:03:52.600> of<00:03:52.690> foundation<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:54.610> when

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
a little bit of foundation and when

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.729 
a little bit of foundation and when
we're<00:03:55.030> holding<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.660> we're<00:03:56.140> going<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.380> hold

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
we're holding this we're going to hold

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.610 
we're holding this we're going to hold
yes<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.670> know<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.820> can<00:03:58.060> see<00:03:58.209> you<00:03:58.239> pussycat<00:03:58.630> when

yes I know I can see you pussycat when
we're<00:03:59.770> holding<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:00.190> we're<00:04:00.400> going<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.640> get

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
we're holding this we're going to get

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.000 
we're holding this we're going to get
the<00:04:01.290> large<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:04.230> that's<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.500> end<00:04:05.650> we're<00:04:05.830> going

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
the large and that's the end we're going

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.370 
the large and that's the end we're going
to<00:04:06.390> hold<00:04:07.390> down<00:04:08.130> onto<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.250> cupcake<00:04:10.170> with<00:04:11.170> this

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
to hold down onto the cupcake with this

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.320 
to hold down onto the cupcake with this
smaller<00:04:12.070> end<00:04:12.340> at<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.760> top

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
smaller end at the top

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.600 
smaller end at the top
so<00:04:14.050> you're<00:04:14.230> going<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.500> apply<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:15.070> slight

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
so you're going to apply a slight

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.970 
so you're going to apply a slight
pressure<00:04:16.860> let's<00:04:17.860> hold<00:04:18.070> it<00:04:18.220> here<00:04:19.860> from<00:04:20.860> the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
pressure let's hold it here from the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.610 
pressure let's hold it here from the
middle<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.600> outside<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.760> back<00:04:24.760> in<00:04:25.000> again

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
middle to the outside and back in again

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.270 
middle to the outside and back in again
so<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.680> can<00:04:26.860> do<00:04:27.010> this<00:04:27.160> one-handed<00:04:28.080> or<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:30.100> can

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
so you can do this one-handed or you can

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.570 
so you can do this one-handed or you can
put<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.520> down<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.910> table<00:04:31.390> and<00:04:32.520> apply<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
put it down the table and apply the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.910 
put it down the table and apply the
pressure<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:34.990> see<00:04:35.230> how<00:04:35.410> you're<00:04:35.590> getting

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
pressure and you see how you're getting

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.150 
pressure and you see how you're getting
little<00:04:36.070> petals<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.820> start<00:04:40.120> at<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> middle

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
little petals so start at the middle

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.870 
little petals so start at the middle
outside<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.820> around<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:45.670> keep

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
outside and around and in and you keep

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.570 
outside and around and in and you keep
going<00:04:46.330> all<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:47.560> way<00:04:47.590> around<00:04:50.100> keep<00:04:51.100> going<00:04:51.430> all

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
going all the way around keep going all

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.990 
going all the way around keep going all
the<00:04:51.610> way<00:04:52.090> around<00:04:53.340> till<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.400> meet<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.730> other

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
the way around till you meet the other

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.140 
the way around till you meet the other
side
