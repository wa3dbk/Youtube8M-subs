00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.430
 I'm really happy to be able to celebrate. 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.630
 this Christmas with my family and with 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.700
 you too 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.500
 This is a very special time of year and 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.199
 I want to use it to talk about two 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.260
 things that are very important in life 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.230
 to family and hope 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.830
 Did you ever notice and because of work? 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.990
 of studies or any other activity 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.149
 we often stop dedicating 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.920
 time for the people you love that 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.139
 They are so close to us. 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.499
 This is a challenge these days. 

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:43.059
 hasty where the most important ends 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.579
 placing second 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.579
 That's why I want to invite you to this end. 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.429
 to prioritize your family 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.019
 building his house on the rock as 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:56.559
 recommends the bible and mateus 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.780
 in chapter 7 but you really know the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.619
 what it means to build your house on 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.199
 the rock 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:05.170
 means that our home actually 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.530
 Our family needs attention from 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.920
 affection but especially of connection with 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.110
 jesus christ every day he rocks 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.870
 if the family is based on the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.300
 God's Word we're going to have true 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.760
 hope to meet Christ 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.690
 who is no longer a child in the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.370
 manger is dead but lives and goes 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.880
 come back for us 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.730
 very soon this is my wish 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.010
 This Christmas and this year's end 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.370
 You decide to stay in your house on the 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.920
 rock and have a much happier family. 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.650
 and hope not because of the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.380
 gifts you can give or receive 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.020
 nor of the celebrations that you can realize 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.810
 But because Christ will be living 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.939
 within your family life as well. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.880
 of my family and the Adventist church 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:02.000
 on the seventh day I want to wish for a Christmas 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.490
 very happy and a 2013 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.490
 full of hope and faith
