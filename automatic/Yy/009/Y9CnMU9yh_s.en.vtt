very<00:01:14.090> well<00:01:14.210> they<00:01:14.690> are<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.230> predominant

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
very well they are the predominant

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.280 
very well they are the predominant
planting<00:01:16.970> here<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.570> would<00:01:18.050> challenge

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
planting here and I would challenge

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.710 
planting here and I would challenge
anybody<00:01:18.650> to<00:01:19.040> say<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.030> know<00:01:20.150> Oregon

those<00:01:22.670> wines<00:01:22.910> but<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.660> said<00:01:24.010> why<00:01:25.010> why<00:01:25.670> stop

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
those wines but that said why why stop

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.920 
those wines but that said why why stop
you<00:01:26.330> know<00:01:26.420> why<00:01:26.600> stop<00:01:26.990> why<00:01:27.710> stop<00:01:28.010> finding<00:01:28.930> just

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
you know why stop why stop finding just

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.780 
you know why stop why stop finding just
because<00:01:30.290> we<00:01:30.470> know<00:01:30.590> those<00:01:30.830> grow<00:01:31.100> here<00:01:31.340> grow

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
because we know those grow here grow

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.180 
because we know those grow here grow
well<00:01:31.970> here<00:01:32.000> it<00:01:32.560> doesn't<00:01:33.560> mean<00:01:33.830> that<00:01:33.980> there's

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
well here it doesn't mean that there's

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.830 
well here it doesn't mean that there's
not<00:01:34.340> a<00:01:34.370> lot<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.640> possibility<00:01:35.630> for<00:01:35.750> other

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
not a lot of possibility for other

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.360 
not a lot of possibility for other
things<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.350> grow<00:01:36.500> very<00:01:36.710> well<00:01:36.950> here<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.160> think

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
things to grow very well here I think

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.030 
things to grow very well here I think
the<00:01:37.490> lagron<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.180> I<00:01:38.210> work<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:38.480> is<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:39.260> great

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
the lagron that I work with is a great

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.850 
the lagron that I work with is a great
example<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:42.170> was<00:01:42.320> planted

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
example of that and it was planted

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.160 
example of that and it was planted
experimentally<00:01:43.280> by<00:01:43.910> a<00:01:44.330> man<00:01:44.720> named<00:01:44.960> Bryce

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
experimentally by a man named Bryce

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.840 
experimentally by a man named Bryce
Bagnall<00:01:45.650> or<00:01:45.830> he<00:01:45.980> asked<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.550> only<00:01:46.700> he

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
Bagnall or he asked the only he

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.650 
Bagnall or he asked the only he
vineyards<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.330> plant<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.720> for<00:01:47.750> him<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:49.480> it<00:01:50.480> is

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
vineyards to plant it for him and it is

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.570 
vineyards to plant it for him and it is
done<00:01:50.900> beautifully<00:01:53.740> that's<00:01:54.740> my<00:01:54.890> goal<00:01:55.100> is<00:01:55.370> to

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
done beautifully that's my goal is to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.760 
done beautifully that's my goal is to
make<00:01:55.700> good<00:01:55.880> wine<00:01:56.200> figure<00:01:57.200> if<00:01:57.350> you<00:01:57.470> don't<00:01:57.650> make

good<00:01:57.890> wine<00:01:58.130> what's<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:58.490> point<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.790> doing<00:01:58.880> it

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
good wine what's the point of doing it
