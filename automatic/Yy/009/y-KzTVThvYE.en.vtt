00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.230
 Hello everyone 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 Today we introduce to you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.690
 Many netizens reacted with us. 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.010
 When I last tested the Luxgen 5 Sedan 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.040
 For the part of Think+Touch 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.250
 Because the function of Think+Touch is too much 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 So we have not fully introduced 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.020
 Today, especially in the showroom of Luxgen Riverside Street 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.540
 Introducing Think+Touch to everyone 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.950
 Why do you want to introduce 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.270
 The first point is of course the needs of netizens. 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.400
 The second point is the Think+Touch system. 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.730
 There are actually a lot of features that you can't imagine. 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.760
 These features are not completely used by the driver. 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.520
 The opportunity for passengers to use is also very high 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.540
 Especially children! 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.570
 If you have this Think+Touch system 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 I won’t be bored when driving long distances. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.210
 Think+Touch is divided into 5 major functions 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.240
 The first is audio and video entertainment. 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 Includes radio, USB connection 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.050
 And can read USB music, movies and photos 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.860
 Especially the part of the film 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.910
 You can download videos that kids love. 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.950
 Because Think+Touch can be used on mobile phones 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.870
 3G wireless Internet access 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.480
 So in the audio and video entertainment section 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.220
 More digital radio reception 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.440
 The second is telephone communication. 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.580
 Many consumers still talk about mobile phones while driving. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.430
 Think+Touch has a hands-free function 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.770
 If the driver is driving 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.010
 Must be very focused on the road conditions 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.720
 There is a newsletter button on the screen 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.550
 Automatically send a text message whenever you press a button 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.470
 The caller will see the newsletter 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.600
 Notifying the caller that it is currently inconvenient to pick up the car 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.910
 The third is driving safety. 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.400
 In fact, it is almost the same as Luxgen SUV and MPV. 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.520
 Whether it is Eagle View or Side View 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.540
 Even including Night Vision+ 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.770
 All are Luxgen 5 Sedan 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.610
 Standard equipment for 1.8 and 2.0 high-end models 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.750
 Driving safety also includes vehicle detection 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.260
 As long as it is a car computer 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.880
 Regardless of the engine, the gearbox computer 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.700
 Detecting abnormal conditions of the vehicle 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.940
 Will have a fault code in the driving diagnosis 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.870
 At this point, the vehicle must be returned to the factory for maintenance. 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.600
 The fourth is system setting 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.320
 Maybe a lot of people will think that the system settings are nothing. 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.870
 But today through professional business commentary 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.900
 I really like the display settings of Think+Touch. 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.020
 The clock is divided into 7 menus 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.740
 No matter which clock display you choose 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.970
 There will be very beautiful animations 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.110
 Maybe you don't care 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.950
 But modern consumers are getting longer in the car. 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.400
 Especially when it comes to traffic jams. 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.530
 It’s like you will update your computer tablecloth 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.770
 You will update your mobile phone tablecloth 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.280
 This system is the same 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.500
 If you look tired of the traditional digital clock 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.640
 Switch your favorite watch display 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.306
 Will jump out of a beautiful animation 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.520
 The last important point is the HTC mode. 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.150
 HTC mode is subdivided into 6 major items 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.770
 The first is HTC mobile phone image 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.520
 When Think+Touch is connected to HTC phone 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.580
 Think+Touch will display the current screen on the HTC screen 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.620
 Synchronize the display of the HTC phone 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.470
 The second is Luxgen Navi+ 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.110
 Because you can connect to your mobile phone 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.840
 So satellite navigation is no longer just a way to go. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.590
 An image that can pass through the highway 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.940
 Even TMC instant traffic text 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.150
 Before the driver gets on the road 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.090
 You can read the information you want first. 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.300
 For example, driving from Taipei to Taichung 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.530
 If there are some traffic conditions in Hsinchu 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.870
 Or the traffic is crowded 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.380
 At this time, you can pass Navi+ 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.640
 Instantly learn the latest traffic information along the road 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.220
 Including live images such as traffic jams and accidents 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.340
 The third is the Internet function. 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.550
 When using this feature is recommended 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.670
 The vehicle must be stopped at the roadside 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.510
 In addition to general web browsing 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.850
 Including Twitter, Facebook 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.200
 Even including sending and receiving e-mail 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.920
 The fourth is Aqua+APP 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.040
 Last time we introduced Aqua+APP 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.070
 Not only 6 small fish but only 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.790
 If the driver does not wear a seat belt 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.640
 Or the air volume and temperature of the air conditioning system 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.660
 6 small fish in Aqua+APP will change 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.190
 For example, the driver does not wear a seat belt. 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.820
 6 small fish eyes will stare at you! 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.240
 Remind the driver to wear a seat belt 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.450
 If the air conditioner adjusts the temperature higher 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.680
 The color of the sea is clear purple 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.010
 If the temperature adjustment is low 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.360
 The color of the sea is blue 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.400
 The fourth function is very easy to use 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.340
 Information including food and clothing 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.170
 Life Go+ system 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:47.420
 In addition to road imagery and information 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.550
 If traveling to an unfamiliar city or attraction 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.700
 Learn all the food, drink and fun messages through Life+Go 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.240
 As well as life information, travel information, and real-time traffic conditions 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.150
 The last point is e-mail 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.710
 Mobile phone connected to Think+Touch 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.520
 As long as the phone receives an e-mail 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.650
 Email will be displayed 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.590
 Prevent drivers from operating the phone directly 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.200
 Danger 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.450
 E-mail that can be displayed on the screen 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.100
 The vehicle is parked on the side of the road to read e-mail 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.720
 Maybe you will think 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.240
 Think+Touch is not just a screen. 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.950
 Just more features of the phone connection 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.290
 But when you operate Think+Touch 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.300
 You will find many programs 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.240
 Even some simple pictures 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.660
 Or a lot of humanized operations 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.750
 Luxgen spent a lot of effort designing Think+Touch 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.570
 At least this is developed for Chinese people. 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:57.160
 Instead of a simple screen plus satellite navigation 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.570
 Think+Touch all the features 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.600
 Both are developed by Luxgen. 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.620
 Can see the heart of Luxgen 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.750
 Currently Luxgen 5 Sedan is either 1.8 or 2.0 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.800
 Have already delivered the car one after another. 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.820
 Our last test drive was the 2.0 model. 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.820
 In October we will test drive 1.8 models
