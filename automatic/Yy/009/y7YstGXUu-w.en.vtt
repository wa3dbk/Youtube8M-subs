I'm<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.960> hero<00:01:50.260> and<00:01:50.410> Chris<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.830> my<00:01:50.950> sidekick

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
I'm the hero and Chris is my sidekick

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.990 
I'm the hero and Chris is my sidekick
why<00:01:53.560> do<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.800> get<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.040> be<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.250> hero

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.340 

maybe<00:01:58.000> if<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.330> got<00:01:58.479> up<00:01:58.630> academic<00:01:59.140> probation

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
maybe if you got up academic probation

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.130 
maybe if you got up academic probation
then<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.220> could<00:02:00.369> be<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.640> hero<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.479> was<00:02:01.899> me

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
then you could be the hero that was me

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.050 
then you could be the hero that was me
so<00:02:02.800> I'm<00:02:02.950> guessing<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.399> didn't<00:02:03.729> read<00:02:03.940> the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
so I'm guessing you didn't read the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.240 
so I'm guessing you didn't read the
warning<00:02:04.390> on<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.630> website

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.160 

well<00:02:09.820> TV<00:02:10.600> Tropes<00:02:10.960> will<00:02:11.440> ruin<00:02:11.740> your<00:02:12.100> life
