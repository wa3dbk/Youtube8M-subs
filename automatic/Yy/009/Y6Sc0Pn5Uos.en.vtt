activities where we bond it's really a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.229 
activities where we bond it's really a
community-based<00:03:06.800> thing<00:03:07.250> that's<00:03:07.730> one<00:03:08.060> thing

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
community-based thing that's one thing

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.550 
community-based thing that's one thing
that<00:03:08.270> they<00:03:08.480> really<00:03:08.510> teach<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:08.870> your<00:03:09.080> freshman

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that they really teach you your freshman

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.290 
that they really teach you your freshman
year<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.980> think<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.459> but<00:03:10.640> because<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.270> a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
year I think that but because it is a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.080 
year I think that but because it is a
smaller<00:03:11.660> school<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:13.010> think<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.550> girls<00:03:13.850> have<00:03:14.060> a

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
smaller school I think the girls have a

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.940 
smaller school I think the girls have a
sense<00:03:14.330> of<00:03:14.450> community<00:03:14.630> with<00:03:15.050> one<00:03:15.350> another<00:03:15.620> I

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
sense of community with one another I

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.920 
sense of community with one another I
think<00:03:16.220> also<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.150> opportunities<00:03:17.660> for<00:03:17.780> them

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
think also to the opportunities for them

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.600 
think also to the opportunities for them
to<00:03:18.019> go<00:03:18.140> out<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.440> do<00:03:18.530> service<00:03:18.860> works<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.459> the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
to go out and do service works in the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.640 
to go out and do service works in the
community<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.989> all<00:03:21.140> works

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
community I think that it all works

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.740 
community I think that it all works
together<00:03:21.860> beautifully<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.880> think<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.570> they

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
together beautifully I think that they

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.540 
together beautifully I think that they
look<00:03:23.959> out<00:03:24.080> for<00:03:24.260> each<00:03:24.320> other<00:03:24.500> a<00:03:24.860> lot<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.310> people

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
look out for each other a lot of people

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.759 
look out for each other a lot of people
are<00:03:25.640> really<00:03:25.730> close<00:03:26.030> with<00:03:26.269> teachers<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:27.140> you

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
are really close with teachers and you

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.070 
are really close with teachers and you

just get to know them like it's a lot of
care<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:30.950> they<00:03:31.100> go<00:03:31.250> through<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.760> make<00:03:31.910> sure

they're all for it

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.580 
they're all for it
you<00:03:41.660> know<00:03:41.750> there's<00:03:41.959> nobody's<00:03:42.319> gonna<00:03:42.440> be

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
you know there's nobody's gonna be

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.559 
you know there's nobody's gonna be
telling<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:42.890> no<00:03:43.069> you<00:03:43.130> shouldn't<00:03:43.489> do<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.790> and
