00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.820
 the universe is a pretty big place 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:07.860
 the funny thing is that each one of those who 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.519
 we live here we occupy our little 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:14.040
 world for example of a common girl and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.650
 current with a mom who loves her and a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.289
 cat called pig 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.449
 she never imagined that a million 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.500
 kilometers there was a lonely guy 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.610
 called a low-ranking member of 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 a nomadic race called the owls 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.510
 from some love to dad 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.580
 that he was looking for a safe place to be his 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.580
 home that planted is delicious 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.290
 it was likely that they two never 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.290
 knew but the universe is very 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.290
 unpredictable 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:58.860
 if you do not get me out of here shoot the laser 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.860
 it's details of my eyes you can do that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.680
 dreamworks animation 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 I'm ready to bring one of your 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.120
 traditional gestures of human gratitude 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.380
 our tradition is to hit on the nose 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:22.110
 still your gratitude is evident 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.770
 the creators of the courses is now 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.600
 freeing to exploit how to train 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.289
 your dragon 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.049

 how many errors 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.100
 are unpredictable what is happening to 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.259
 my body this is called dancing 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.729
