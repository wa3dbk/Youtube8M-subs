where they have an age limit now and on

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.980 
where they have an age limit now and on
the<00:02:17.690> 250<00:02:18.530> class<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.100> be<00:02:19.220> under<00:02:19.400> 23<00:02:19.990> so

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
the 250 class you have to be under 23 so

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.160 
the 250 class you have to be under 23 so
that<00:02:21.650> forces<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.670> write<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.850> 450<00:02:23.420> but<00:02:23.660> you

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that forces you to write a 450 but you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.620 
that forces you to write a 450 but you
know<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.640> there<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.730> pretty<00:02:25.970> much<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.210> next

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
know I there is pretty much the next

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.150 
know I there is pretty much the next
step<00:02:27.170> anyway

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
step anyway

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400 
step anyway
and<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.730> know<00:02:29.880> i<00:02:30.210> would<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:31.050> course<00:02:31.380> a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
and you know i would like to of course a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.830 
and you know i would like to of course a
lot<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.650> 450<00:02:32.190> here<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.460> America<00:02:32.880> but<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.330> think

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
lot of 450 here in America but I think

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.290 
lot of 450 here in America but I think
to<00:02:33.960> learn<00:02:34.110> Supercross<00:02:34.790> 250<00:02:35.790> class<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.210> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
to learn Supercross 250 class of the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.340 
to learn Supercross 250 class of the
best<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:38.280> know<00:02:38.400> best<00:02:38.670> place<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.120> learn

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
best you know best place to learn

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.870 
best you know best place to learn
Supercross<00:02:40.350> so<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.100> wouldn't<00:02:41.550> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> just

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
Supercross so I wouldn't want to just

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.970 
Supercross so I wouldn't want to just
jump<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.390> deep<00:02:42.570> end<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.960> Y<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.410> for<00:02:43.770> four

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
jump in the deep end in Y there for four

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.250 
jump in the deep end in Y there for four
food<00:02:44.160> groups<00:02:44.190> yet<00:02:44.790> Supercross<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.630> that's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
food groups yet Supercross so that's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260 
food groups yet Supercross so that's
obviously<00:02:46.410> why<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:47.310> makes<00:02:47.490> sense<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.880> drive

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
obviously why it makes sense to drive

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.450 
obviously why it makes sense to drive

I suppose I don't know if I don't know
how<00:04:38.750> it's<00:04:38.870> going<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.050> work<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.380> think<00:04:39.889> all<00:04:40.190> of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
how it's going to work it I think all of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.890 
how it's going to work it I think all of
us<00:04:40.310> work<00:04:40.729> it<00:04:40.910> so<00:04:41.030> I<00:04:41.060> thought<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.330> know<00:04:41.510> this

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
us work it so I thought you know this

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.170 
us work it so I thought you know this
could<00:04:42.169> be<00:04:42.620> really<00:04:42.770> interesting<00:04:42.889> if<00:04:43.490> it's<00:04:43.940> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
could be really interesting if it's the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.700 
could be really interesting if it's the
championships<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:44.780> us<00:04:44.930> coming<00:04:45.199> down<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.590> the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
championships of us coming down to the

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.950 
championships of us coming down to the
wire<00:04:45.740> now<00:04:46.160> maybe<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.000> having<00:04:47.270> an<00:04:47.479> East<00:04:47.690> Coast

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
wire now maybe you having an East Coast

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.689 
wire now maybe you having an East Coast
Guard<00:04:48.229> taking<00:04:48.590> out<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.710> West<00:04:48.979> Coast<00:04:49.070> guy<00:04:49.490> or

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
Guard taking out a West Coast guy or

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.180 
Guard taking out a West Coast guy or
something<00:04:49.910> like<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.210> but<00:04:50.570> i<00:04:51.260> think<00:04:52.100> it's

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
something like that but i think it's

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.890 
something like that but i think it's
interesting<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:52.940> it's<00:04:53.210> definitely<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.690> mini

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
interesting so it's definitely a mini

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.050 
interesting so it's definitely a mini
