00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.490
 do not 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.110
 and it can change being so old 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.710
 one and not one 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.210
 so deeply one with so many 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.480
 commitments one 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.899
 with so many mistakes and successes one 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.899
 You can change 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.680
 I was like that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:54.790
 at the beginning of my life then I was like that 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.460
 So, guys, I kept being like that 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.770
 now with a tie in the communion of my 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.420
 brother notice that I even became 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:09.960
 well in the marriage of my cousin and now 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 I'm this big 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.370
 I have changed, I could do it 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.730
 thank you very much 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.970
 my own architecture has changed opens 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.550
 It is much kinder to curved shapes and 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.580
 soft more rounded more feminine 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.660
 linked with nature and man 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.630
 ally 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.670
 with the landscape and nature not 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.300
 predatory of it an architecture 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.010
 celebrate life that is an exponent of 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.200
 that party that is life is a 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.110
 architecture that existed long before 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.360
 that I was born and called the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.190
 organic architecture 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.410
 formulated by the architect more 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.750
 important of the 20th century frank lloyd 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.930
 wright a man-friendly architecture 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.590
 and the planet whose works seem to emerge 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.229
 from the very bottom of the earth daughters of the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.390
 land that is not polian the landscape that 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.319
 they do not destroy it but they complement it 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.510
 that exalt it natural non-artificial 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.120
 then it was practiced by many others 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.450
 architects around the world each 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.219
 with his vision each one with his own 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.730
 nature each with its own 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.890
 problems 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.690
 but there is little of that architecture in 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.140
 rosario and in general in all 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.080
 cities of argentina us 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.830
 we continue to grow with a high model 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.960
 density 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.310
 very high exploitation of resources 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.170
 human and natural energy 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.470
 in a very artificial way 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.530
 very exclusive very arid 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.050
 with high energy consumption with 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.380
 a coast that is for few and not for 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.740
 everyone 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.460
 I could change can rosary change in 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.050
 general our cities will be able to change 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.480
 these are Spanish cities the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.850
 cold cities a city where the 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.030
 landscape is part of the city where the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.180
 Coast is for everyone and not for some 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.610
 there is the city of cefalo in cecilia lo 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.490
 same the city of all 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.590
 the coast also the landscape is part of 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.970
 the city and the city does not destroy the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.400
 landscape 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.760
 a community on the titicaca lake in 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.700
 Bolivia again and the coast is 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.910
 everyone 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.550
 what do you need to change I could 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.750
 to say that I need to change 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:53.180
 could formulate a general method 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.870
 being alone for a while was necessary 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.409
 learn to know me learn to see me 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.409
 an introspective look 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.570
 take away the social mandate of being a 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.120
 man of this or that or car or have 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.650
 economic success make architecture 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.319
 commercial to be able to sell it easily 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.870
 none of that is important for life 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.989
 Nothing of that 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.170
 and secondly live in a context 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.230
 of affection love of acceptance 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.830
 the acceptance of my children that I have 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.210
 three and the acceptance of my mother 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:36.169
 they made this change natural 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:40.069
 possible and not too painful 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.680
 only he who loves is able to feel the 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:46.750
 ability to love and only the one who has 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.060
 received love can love himself 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.520
 that you need a city and a 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.860
 architecture to change just like a 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.560
 person can change for the 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.970
 architecture be a mother that welcomes 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.020
 all your children and does not exclude some 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.020
 for the benefit of others 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.610
 possibly the same as you need me 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.190
 be alone for a while do not look 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.530
 examples of other cities of others 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.980
 countries of other ways of producing the 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.720
 architecture 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:25.350
 not to look at the exteriority is that they generate 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:27.999
 business luxury excess 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.009
 landscape predation 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:34.300
 get away from the exploitation models 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.300
 growing resources and human beings 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.009
 look at yourself this is 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:44.180
 approximately the natural landscape of 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:48.169
 payment of streams ie rosary 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.930
 a place where many streams flow 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:55.039
 in the parana river and the pampa gringa la 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.650
 wet pampa of fresh wet clay 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:06:00.949
 merges into the parana river this is the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.199
 almost natural landscape that we had 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.610
 us before we have built everything 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.060
 this 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:13.060
 the pity is not very inspiring the 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:15.970
 southern regional park is still that way 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:19.889
 and secondly also achieve a 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:23.009
 context of love a context 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.259
 where public spaces exceed what 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.599
 private where people can 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:32.310
 Enjoy the landscape where the 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:34.590
 nature intermingle in the city 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.560
 interweave in the nature of the pampa 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.249
 wet this drawing of mine is an idea of 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:45.240
 how to exploit rationally lovingly 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:47.909
 more than rationally it is a way of 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.710
 use this payment from streams that 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.379
 buildings are lower than the trees 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.230
 that surround them that building celebrate 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:56.660
 in the life 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.330
 use the cheapest materials from the 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.940
 region for example the brick use it 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.720
 wisely 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:08.740
 and create between nature and not against 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:11.320
 nature suffers when changing and if 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.120
 it suffers a lot will suffer the city to 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.450
 change I think the city is 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.910
 suffering a lot is alien and violent is 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.340
 distant and excluding I do not speak of 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.610
 rosary or almost all cities suffer 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.419
 similar processes 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:30.090
 nevertheless thank you however the 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:32.490
 future of a society that lives in the 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.110
 organic architecture is inevitable 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.620
 we would all have to do a little 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:39.449
 every day to get it to know that 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.460
 you can change know that you can 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:44.699
 live better and know what can be done 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:48.860
 an architecture that has a future in the 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.860
 planet thank you very much 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.200
 rafal
