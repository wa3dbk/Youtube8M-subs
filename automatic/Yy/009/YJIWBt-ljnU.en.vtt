Hello and Welcome to Lovinpix TV

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
My name is Merwen and today I am going to test for you the 40mm 2,8 Canon lens

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Perfect, it was right here on this window display, not too expensive
and it looks delicious

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.000
This is probably the smallest lens ever created
by Canon

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.300
2,2cm / 0.9 inches, 130g / 4.6 ounces

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:43.000
It is a very light lens, that is perfect for portraits, 
travel or street photography

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.300
Why STM ? STM stands for Stepping Motor Technology

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:57.030
This new motor technology conceived by Canon
for this lens, and for the new 18-135 lens,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.160
allows precise, smooth, fluid motored movement control,
for photography as well as video

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.019
So let's try and have fun in the streets of
Paris with this new lens

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:13.030
So the video recording autofocus does not
work with the 5D Mark III we are using today,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.430
As of today, it only works with Canon 650D

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.550
For your information, our 5D Mark III today has been updated with the latest firmware 1.1.3

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:35.150
Since, the video recording autofocus does not work with the 5D Mark III we are using today,  we will focus mainly on photography

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.000
I am going to start by trying out the precision and the speed of the autofocus

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I am going to start by trying out the precision and the speed of the autofocus

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.800
The perspective the barrier is giving us allows us 
to determine whether or not

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.000
the lens autofocus will be able to catch all the subtleties of the image

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.500
Yes, the autofocus focuses very quickly

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.900
It focuses a little bit faster than the 50mm 1,2 lens

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.100
The motor is also very, very quiet

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.200
In this urban scenery, I was not able to hear anything at all

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.500
It is a real pleasure to use it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.600
Very smooth

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.600
In terms of autofocus, I think this is the best among all of my lenses

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.900
We are now going to test the quality of the bokeh

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.700
The minimum focus distance is 30cm / 11.8 inches

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You can see I can get rather close to the subject, which is quite surprising for this kind of lenses,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.800
Here is a picture taken at f/2.8

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.800
at f/4

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.000
at f/5,6

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.600
at f/8

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.500
As you can see, the bokeh is quite creamy,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.200
the lens has 7 blades, which allows a smooth depth of field,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.600
nice for the eyes,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.000
Good fabrication

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.200
Now let's try our autofocus on moving subjects,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.700
here are some professional tennis table players !

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.400
I put my camera on AI-Servo mode

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
You can see how the lens follows the target

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.300
My success rate on this series is quite high

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.400
I would not go as far as sayong this is a sport lens,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.900
But for everyday life and street photography, it's great

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.000
Perfect ! Thanks guys !

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.500
Now we are going to compare the 40mm lens, with the Canon 35mm and the Canon 50mm

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.000
which are all widely used for street photography

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I am going to start with the 35mm

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.500
Then I am going to try with the 40mm,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.400
which to me is very good for street pictures,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.000
because it is quite close to human sight

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.000
(varies between 35mm and 55mm)

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.700
And now the 50mm

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.200
Clearly, you can see a difference

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.800
At 50mm, I feel like we are a little bit too zoomed in,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.500
while at 40mm, I have a pretty accurate view of

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.000
what I am actually seeing with my eyes right now

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.400
You just saw with Merwen how the 40mm 
looked on a full frame sensor camera,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.700
Now we are going to take a glimpse at the 
way it looks on an APS-C sensor

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.300
The 40mm is more accurate than the 50mm in terms
of how close it gets to the human sight

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It is very enjoyable for street photography

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Depth of field looks good

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.400
High quality look

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Resolution is very clear

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.600
And I like the minimum focus distance (30cm/11,8 inches)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
This pancake lens is very small, so you can take it anywhere with you

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And you can keep a low profile with it,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.500
which makes it great for street pictures
(or in places where taking pictures is prohibited)

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
To conclude, I would say this lens has many qualities

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.300
The silent autofocus,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Its size : it's light, small and you can take it anywhere.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.000
You could even fit it in your pocket !

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.100
I would advise it to travelers, or street photograhers,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.800
For portraits, it might be a bit too short of
 a focal length, but you can make it work,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.000
in particular with editorial portraits, in which you have 
to include a little bit more details about the environment

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.000
For this type of focal length, we are usually
used to bigger apertures, such as f/1.2 or f/1.4,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.700
But I think that 2.8 can be a good 
compromise for many travelers

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I hope you enjoyed this test

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.800
We hope to see you soon for other 
tests products on Lovinpix TV !
