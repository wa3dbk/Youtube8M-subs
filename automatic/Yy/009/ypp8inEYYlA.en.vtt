people try of course we always want to
see<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.359> know<00:00:19.140> people<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.770> come<00:00:20.640> up<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
see you know people have come up to the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.240 
see you know people have come up to the
plate<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:21.570> they've<00:00:21.810> got<00:00:21.990> an<00:00:22.140> idea<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.769> say<00:00:23.010> hey

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
plate if they've got an idea and say hey

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.550 
plate if they've got an idea and say hey
but<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.240> one's<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.810> hard<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but this one's going to be hard so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
but this one's going to be hard so
really<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> test<00:00:26.400> them<00:00:26.580> out<00:00:26.720> he<00:00:27.720> said<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
really going to test them out he said it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.740 
really going to test them out he said it
was<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> globe<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.279> boats<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.179> world<00:00:30.480> would

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
was a globe all boats in the world would

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.229 
was a globe all boats in the world would
always<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> go<00:00:31.619> downhill<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.640> times

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
always have to go downhill at all times

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.680 
always have to go downhill at all times
just<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.410> true<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.670> best<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.149> rivers

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
just so true and the best one rivers

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
just so true and the best one rivers
would<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.380> flow<00:00:37.680> upwards<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.579> get<00:00:38.730> over

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
would have to flow upwards to get over

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.049 
would have to flow upwards to get over
the<00:00:39.120> curve<00:00:39.440> maybe<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> short<00:00:41.010> river<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the curve maybe not a short river but a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.240 
the curve maybe not a short river but a
long<00:00:42.300> river<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.140> know<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.890> true

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
long river and you know that's so true

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.450 
long river and you know that's so true
how<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> long<00:00:45.539> river<00:00:45.840> flow<00:00:46.800> against<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
how can a long river flow against the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.560 
how can a long river flow against the
curve<00:00:48.230> really<00:00:49.230> want<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
curve really want to know that one and

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.060 
curve really want to know that one and
every<00:00:51.570> plane<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> dip<00:00:52.649> their<00:00:52.860> nose

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
every plane will have to dip their nose

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.160 
every plane will have to dip their nose
at<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.550> times<00:00:53.879> otherwise<00:00:54.390> they'll<00:00:54.840> find

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
at all times otherwise they'll find

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
at all times otherwise they'll find
themselves<00:00:56.899> 166<00:00:57.899> 666<00:00:58.770> feet<00:00:59.579> higher<00:00:59.850> than

themselves 166 666 feet higher than

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
themselves 166 666 feet higher than
expected<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.230> choose<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
expected i think it's just choose that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.149 
expected i think it's just choose that

lighthouses in the world prove the earth

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.780 
lighthouses in the world prove the earth
is<00:01:08.549> flat<00:01:09.530> because<00:01:10.530> how<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.799> both<00:01:11.340> see<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
is flat because how can both see the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.450 
is flat because how can both see the
light<00:01:12.210> over<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.720> curve<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.920> he<00:01:14.010> goes<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
light over the curve and he goes on to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
light over the curve and he goes on to
say<00:01:14.580> debunk<00:01:15.180> these<00:01:15.390> arguments<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
say debunk these arguments you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
say debunk these arguments you
worshippers<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> science<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> Satan<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:19.049> i

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
worshippers of science and Satan now i

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.929 
worshippers of science and Satan now i
can't<00:01:19.500> really<00:01:19.650> agree<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.189> science<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
can't really agree that science and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.050 
can't really agree that science and
Satan<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.259> hand<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.650> hand<00:01:22.710> yes<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
Satan really go hand in hand yes the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.719 
Satan really go hand in hand yes the
fake<00:01:24.840> science<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.710> they've<00:01:25.920> been<00:01:26.130> presented

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fake science that they've been presented

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.200 
fake science that they've been presented
is<00:01:26.850> certainly<00:01:27.299> evil<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:29.159> mean<00:01:29.700> science

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
is certainly evil but I mean science

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.330 
is certainly evil but I mean science
itself<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.350> knowledge<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
itself it's just knowledge it's just a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.940 
itself it's just knowledge it's just a
word<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.700> knowledge<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.259> words<00:01:34.680> can

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
word for knowledge so you know words can

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.069 
word for knowledge so you know words can
mean<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> lot<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.460> things<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.450> certainly<00:01:36.869> we've

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
mean a lot of things but certainly we've

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.810 
mean a lot of things but certainly we've
got<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.439> pseudoscience<00:01:38.369> around<00:01:38.700> this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
got some pseudoscience around this

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.359 
got some pseudoscience around this
planet<00:01:39.290> especially<00:01:40.290> when<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.560> comes<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.950> NASA

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
planet especially when it comes to NASA

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.319 
planet especially when it comes to NASA
and<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.540> nuclear<00:01:42.990> bomb<00:01:43.259> business<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and a nuclear bomb business so it's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.740 
and a nuclear bomb business so it's
really<00:01:45.890> something<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.720> should<00:01:48.720> be

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
really something it really should be

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.600 
really something it really should be
brought<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> public's<00:01:49.829> attention<00:01:50.040> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
brought up to the public's attention I

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.810 
brought up to the public's attention I
told<00:01:51.329> Lee<00:01:51.720> around<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.100> do<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> rivers

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
told Lee around but how do the rivers

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.319 
told Lee around but how do the rivers
flow<00:01:54.479> upwards<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.409> over<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.799> curve<00:01:56.329> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
flow upwards to get over the curve and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
flow upwards to get over the curve and
look<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:57.990> these<00:01:58.079> have<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> great<00:01:58.619> comments<00:01:59.130> here

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
look at these have a great comments here
