00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.269
 the safe a refrigeration technology 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.509
 in Portuguese, this name wants 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.900
 say without ice or without the ice sheet 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:31.410
 in fact is that the seal is to control the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:34.559
 circulating system or ambient air 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.620
 characteristic refrigerator internal 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.719
 have a cooling range and a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.920
 normally 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:55.620
 ice range is less 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:59.489
 the devices that are only positive 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.539
 between 1 and 10 degrees in this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.370
 appliance 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:16.909
 the defrosting occurs only when the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:36.979
 purchases works as a positive tray 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:36.979
 of a controller an extra time beyond the 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.439
 your 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.160
 a ball of the apparatus part of a 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.800
 centimeter of thickness and starts to act 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.069
 as thermal insulation prevents the exchange of 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.459
 ambient heat that the fortifier 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.920
 maximizes the yield to both our 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.940
 precisely this period, which proportion in the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.170
 maximum yield due to the exchange of the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:36.519
 ambient air the ambient warm air 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:54.060
 passes quickly through the heat and also 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:03:04.079
 second type of resistance to make 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:04.079
 function with the aid of resistance 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.540
 a bit with an even the appliances that 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.540
 use flammable gases 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:28.079
 usually in the commercial line does not 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:30.670
 uses domestic resistance with 90 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:43.359
 usually do not have resistance as is 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:45.130
 made the waiter charge directly to 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:51.819
 inside the evaporator or with 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:53.609
 pressed to run which opens 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.620
 the passage of the gas going to 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:01.269
 superheat from the evaporator and 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.030
 apple systems like a few people 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:07.629
 still saw but already was already something that the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.260
 reality that is there in the market itself 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:15.780
 will not attract by the way will not leave 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.780
 precisely because of ecological viability
