 an animated image point which 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.320
 we can use to stand out in 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.760
 sites like in messenger or twitter forums 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.080
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.580
 download and install the application 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.820

 browser we open it we go to google and 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.950
 we look for photoscape 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.870

 once the extraction has been completed 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.000
 of photos that should look like a 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.619
 shortcut on the desktop as 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.789
 second thing we're going to do is create the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.710
 images that will compose our 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.700
 wifi point image this step serves to 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.289
 all those people who still do not 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.850
 have the images prepared for 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.170
 create these images we can use 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.490
 any image editor as per 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.929

 for this I will go to start and I click 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.619
 on paint to create square images 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.090
 that are equal in height and width to 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.380
 modify the resolution in paint what 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.610

 here we choose the resolution that we want 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.869
 I for example already put 200 x 200 and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.940
 we decided to translate the resolution that 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.140
 we want OK to 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.819

 let's go to the home tab and proceed to 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.980
 create the image that we want and I will 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.819
 create a text with a background of different 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 colors for 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.060

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.210
 different tool like for example 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.980
 the pencil next thing I'm going to do is 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.510

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.950
 our image 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.360
 well as you can see I have already adjusted the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.920
 resolution of the text with the resolution 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.120
 of the image once this is done we can 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.690
 proceed to change the background color of 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.920
 our image 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.480
 for this we select the color that 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.099
 We want to give our fund myself

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.620
 once we have selected the color 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.569
 we select the filling tool from 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.069
 color and when we have the color 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.720

 our text and has been changed now 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.930
 what we have to do is save this 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.970
 image for them we click here up 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.680
 on the left we put the pointer of the 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.730
 mouse over save as and we choose the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.760
 format that we want to give to our 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.080
 picture me for example and choose jpg 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.519
 now we introduce a man who wants 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.950
 show to our image that by 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.500
 example and name it as gif jona 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.909
 tutorials 1 and we also select 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 where we want this image to be saved 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.810
 I for example I'm going to keep the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.769
 folder here I went a tutorial once 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.329
 we have chosen the folder where 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.409
 we want to see this picture and we 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.269
 chosen the name for this image 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.859
 we click on save and now 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.479
 we will have our first image created 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.100
 now I will proceed to create the 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.720
 next for it I'm going to undo the 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.000
 changes of that image by pressing control 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.979
 more z and once this is done I will put 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.270
 a different background color we repeat 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.930
 the previous steps but selecting 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.050
 a different color 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.460
 I'm going to select for example red and 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.009
 we repeat the previous steps to 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.569
 save the image 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.879
 and this time we're going to put the name 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.559
 different for example and put diffusion 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.689
 or tutorials 2 once this is done 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:46.129
 we click on save now I'm going to 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.539
 create a third image but this one 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.550
 optional since we can create an image 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.749
 animated from two images but 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.490
 that I'm going to use more than two images 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:54.289
 so I'm going to change the color again 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.479
 to do this, undo another of the 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.069
 changes by pressing control plus z and I'm going to 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.080
 select a different color as per 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:02.469
 example the lilac and we repeat the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.469
 previous steps 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.759
 and it was the name this image is going to be 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.770
 script or tutorials 3 and we click 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.969
 about saving once we have the 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.340
 prepared images 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.920
 let's open our photoscape we do 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.820
 double click on it 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.320
 and we chose the animated gif tool 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.180
 once the window has been opened 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.650
 we click on add or drag 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.680
 the images here I'm going to click on 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.850
 add and click on add photo 1 we are 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.900
 has opened this window we selected the 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.270
 image in the images that we want 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.320
 import and we click on open and 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.060
 once we have added our 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.830
 images we will see a preview 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.300
 of the animated image dot wifi what 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.770
 next thing we're going to do is order 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.120
 the images if they are not already sorted 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.680
 for this we do that only in the image 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.910
 we want to move and we drag it 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.010
 where we want 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.000
 after sorting the images we are going to 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.590
 choose the duration time that 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.330
 We want you to have every image for it 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.800
 we do that on this arrow and click 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.470
 about changing display time 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.000
 by default I should put 50 which is 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.200
 half a second and if we want it to 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.880
 example last a second we should 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.470
 enter 100 since you have equal to one 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.700
 second the duration time that I'm going to 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.260
 put to each image will be less than 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.060
 half a second in this way the 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.280
 gif point animation will be faster I'll 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.300
 to put for example 35 and if we want that 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.980
 this change applies to all 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.840
 images check the box change 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.160
 time of all the frames and if 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.810
 we only want to apply the change 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.490
 this picture we check the box change 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.660
 selected time frame but 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.400
