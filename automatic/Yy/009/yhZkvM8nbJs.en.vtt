have I've got it I made a few copies of

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.740 
have I've got it I made a few copies of
the<00:05:25.860> B<00:05:27.380> just<00:05:28.380> because<00:05:28.680> they're<00:05:29.750> randomly

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
the B just because they're randomly

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.870
