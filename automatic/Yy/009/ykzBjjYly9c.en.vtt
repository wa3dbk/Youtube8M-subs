00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.460
 simple workhorse for every day 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 just so you can briefly describe the hero 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.320
 of today's review 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.320
 Chinese copy of the well-known nokia 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.320
 6303 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.410
 Except for external similarity, this phone is not 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 has nothing to do with the original 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 the body is almost entirely made of metal 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.430
 on the front of the phone 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.570
 see the speaker display and 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.579
 phone control keys on the right 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.360
 faces are located on the left player buttons 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.160
 the face is empty 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 there is a lamp of two LEDs 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.070
 charging port mini usb connector for 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.810
 computer connections are also two 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.600
 half millimeter jackpot 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.300
 headphones on the back we see the camera 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.570
 by 0 3 megapixel flash and 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.430
 multimedia speaker 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.420
 speaker very big loud code 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.580
 he cannot boast of quality 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.940
 the lid here are two SIM card slots 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.940
 as well as a slot for micro sd memory card 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.950
 the display has a resolution of 240 by 320 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.680
 pixels 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.070
 it is enough to display information about 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.800
 incoming call or text in the sun 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.810
 make out the information is difficult but still 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.149
 perhaps the quality of conversational dynamics 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.360
 not bad, but sometimes you also want to add 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.920
 slightly turn up microphone turn 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.990
 censure 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.020
 interlocutors on voice quality not 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.080
 complain about the camera here except for 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.690
 tick the quality of the images nor 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.060
 what is not good 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.560
 communication phone keeps confidently gap 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.890
 or interfere with the conversation 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 discovered sky while working from 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.560
 battery life varies from 2 to 5 days 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.910
 depending on the activity of use 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.160
 the phone is definitely pleased with the flashlight from 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.190
 two LEDs in the dark 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.730
 can I light you the way well or 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.300
 keyhole main minus 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.100
 the device is its firmware 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.560
 some places there is a curve 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.960
 translation and for doing some 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.400
 actions need to be done not at all 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.400
 logical and manipulations 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.129
 otherwise it's a great phone for 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.180
 calls and myself 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.180
 but not anymore
