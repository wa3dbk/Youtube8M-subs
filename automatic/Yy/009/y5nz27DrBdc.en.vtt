Tidewater<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.370> tempting<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
Tidewater and we're tempting to do is

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
Tidewater and we're tempting to do is
intercept<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.680> Pink's<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.340> swim<00:00:47.579> up

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
intercept the the Pink's is they swim up

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
intercept the the Pink's is they swim up
really<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> tides<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.350> these<00:00:49.469> fish<00:00:49.680> pretty

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
really on the tides so these fish pretty

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.340 
really on the tides so these fish pretty
