00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.420
 "The main thing about the tanks" 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.820
 "Chassis" 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.057
 Chassis. 

00:00:06.457 --> 00:00:09.228
 It is known that the tanks are not afraid of dirt. 

00:00:09.228 --> 00:00:12.685
 And yet - potholes, potholes and other road. 

00:00:13.085 --> 00:00:17.380
 Good flotation tank provides trakavy ruhach. 

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:21.828
 As a general he was chosen in the early XX century. 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.600
 An example of how the best of wheeled equipment flotation equipment has to trakavyh zones 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.828
 Tractors are like the famous "Holt» ( «Holt»), 

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:34.740
 which was created on the basis of the chassis of the first British tanks. 

00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:39.200
 In the English-tank rhombus chassis consisted of rollers, 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.340
 firmly attached to the body, and trakavyh passes, which went around the perimeter of the body. 

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:48.085
 Patency of the diamond-shaped tanks were excellent, 

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:51.028
 but this design did not provide for suspension, 

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:54.057
 so the machine mercilessly shaking on potholes. 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.428
 After the First World War 

00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:59.980
 for some time we tried to build tanks on tractor chassis. 

00:01:00.514 --> 00:01:05.114
 But in the 20 years the designers realized that the possibility of such a chassis is very limited. 

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:09.400
 Engineers began to develop special tank suspension. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.628
 They can be divided into three groups: 

00:01:12.628 --> 00:01:16.200
 blocked, independent and mixed. 

00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:20.628
 Blocked chassis consisted of carts, 

00:01:20.628 --> 00:01:22.971
 to which was attached a few ice rinks. 

00:01:23.114 --> 00:01:25.657
 Suspension could relate only or in a wheelchair, 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.657
 or on a trolley and rollers together. 

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.857
 Blocked chassis 

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:36.000
 had tanks «Vickers 6-ton», «Sherman», T-28, and others. 

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:40.485
 The advantage of the blocked gear - a mild stroke at low speed, 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.714
 simple operation and ease of manufacture. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.571
 There were also shortcomings: 

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.771
 e.g., poor security chassis elements 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.180
 and the inability to develop a high speed. 

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:56.980
 On an independent chassis each rink has separate springs. 

00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:59.380
 Used leaf springs, 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 coil springs, and later - tarsiony. 

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:05.628
 With early versions independent suspension 

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:09.114
 it is worth recalling the suspension of the American Christie engineer 

00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:12.285
 which he invented in 20-30s. 

00:02:12.657 --> 00:02:16.685
 Tank it could move on the path, and RV. 

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:21.857
 For example, wheel-trakavymi were Soviet light tanks BT. 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.580
 Later, from the wheel turn refused. 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.980
 In trakavym variant Christie suspension was applied to the whole family of British tanks, 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.828
 including tanks «Cromwell» and «Comet», 

00:02:32.828 --> 00:02:38.600
 as well as the very well-known Soviet tank from the Second World War - the T-34. 

00:02:39.514 --> 00:02:44.020
 The Christie chassis springs are coil springs. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.780
 Independent suspension with leaf springs was a German tank Pz II. 

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:53.428
 This tank had five road wheels on each side, 

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:56.428
 and each of them had a separate springs. 

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:00.914
 Torsion bar suspension appeared in the late thirties. 

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:05.114
 As the springs used therein tarsion - 

00:03:05.114 --> 00:03:08.485
 rod, working on twisting. 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.457
 Benefits torsion chassis - 

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:14.140
 low vulnerability on the battlefield, 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.380
 relatively small size, smoothness. 

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:22.657
 Currently, it is torsion bar suspension is used on most tanks. 

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:25.000
 Perspective views of the suspension - 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.942
 pneumatic and gidrapnevmatychnaya: 

00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:32.742
 in their suspension occurs due to gas compression. 

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:37.885
 In the 30 years of "pneumatics" I was first put on the English "Tetrarch». 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.685
 She is still used in some tanks - 

00:03:40.685 --> 00:03:43.342
 for example, in English the tank «Challenger». 

00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:47.380
 But in general widespread it has not received. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.180
 In the next issue we will talk about the engine and transmission - 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.114
 units, through which the tank can move.
