00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
will help us level up which is always

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.960 
will help us level up which is always
important<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.430> your<00:02:26.459> RPG<00:02:28.700> because<00:02:29.700> then<00:02:29.880> we

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
important in your RPG because then we

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.010 
important in your RPG because then we
make<00:02:30.150> things<00:02:30.390> die<00:02:30.630> more<00:02:30.990> efficiently<00:02:33.020> just

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
make things die more efficiently just

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.510 
make things die more efficiently just
like<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:37.740> course<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.100> invincibility

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
like this of course the invincibility

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.880 
like this of course the invincibility
also<00:02:39.030> helps<00:02:39.360> crap<00:02:40.350> at<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> give<00:02:40.740> up<00:02:40.860> my

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
also helps crap at to give up my

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:50.540 
also helps crap at to give up my
invincibility<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.640> fly<00:02:47.510> hiking<00:02:48.510> guy<00:02:49.550> that's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
invincibility to fly hiking guy that's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.190 
invincibility to fly hiking guy that's

until we still get hurt really bad by
most<00:03:13.319> things<00:03:13.680> which<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.250> problem<00:03:14.730> that

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
yes I can use some more invincibility

yes I can use some more invincibility
thank<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:26.670> because<00:03:27.670> i'm<00:03:27.790> running<00:03:28.030> out<00:03:28.090> of

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.240 
let's go get the red artifact and this
probably<00:03:42.250> herbs<00:03:42.490> under<00:03:42.820> these<00:03:42.940> rocks<00:03:43.210> so<00:03:44.250> it's

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
probably herbs under these rocks so it's

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:53.130 
probably herbs under these rocks so it's
not<00:03:45.370> too<00:03:45.550> bad<00:03:49.440> hey<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.470> didn't<00:03:50.830> see<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.870> freezer

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
not too bad hey I didn't see the freezer

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.560 
not too bad hey I didn't see the freezer
soldiers<00:03:53.620> die<00:03:53.830> easier<00:03:54.490> than<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.910> dinosaurs

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
soldiers die easier than the dinosaurs

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.360 
soldiers die easier than the dinosaurs
and<00:03:55.810> give<00:03:55.930> more<00:03:56.140> experience<00:03:56.650> for<00:03:56.860> some<00:03:57.010> reason

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
and give more experience for some reason

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.720 
and give more experience for some reason
so<00:03:58.740> usually<00:03:59.740> you<00:03:59.770> want<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.160> ignore<00:04:00.460> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
so usually you want to ignore the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.080 
so usually you want to ignore the
dinosaurs<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.660> just<00:04:01.840> kill<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.230> soldiers<00:04:03.090> but

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
dinosaurs and just kill the soldiers but

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.280 
dinosaurs and just kill the soldiers but
because<00:04:04.300> I'm<00:04:04.420> invincible<00:04:04.690> I'm<00:04:04.960> going<00:04:05.110> to<00:04:05.170> just

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
because I'm invincible I'm going to just

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.060 
because I'm invincible I'm going to just
kill<00:04:05.440> whatever<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.740> feel<00:04:05.920> like<00:04:06.010> killing<00:04:08.070> it's

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
kill whatever I feel like killing it's

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.230 
kill whatever I feel like killing it's
going<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> take<00:04:09.340> me<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.490> bit<00:04:09.520> longer<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:10.030> gather

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
going to take me a bit longer to gather

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.400 
going to take me a bit longer to gather
these<00:04:10.420> things<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.750> thought<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.020> probably<00:04:11.260> won't

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
these things I thought I probably won't

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.780 
these things I thought I probably won't
get<00:04:11.530> very<00:04:11.590> far<00:04:11.740> into<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.100> maze<00:04:12.310> for<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.610> have<00:04:12.730> to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
get very far into a maze for I have to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:21.780 
get very far into a maze for I have to
stop<00:04:16.950> but<00:04:17.950> whatever<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:21.400> means<00:04:21.489> made<00:04:21.700> the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
stop but whatever it means made the

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.250 
stop but whatever it means made the
other<00:04:21.850> artifact<00:04:22.330> i'm<00:04:22.450> pretty<00:04:22.780> sure<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.110> up

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
other artifact i'm pretty sure it's up

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.490 
other artifact i'm pretty sure it's up
here

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:40.970 

so<00:04:30.500> let's<00:04:30.770> find<00:04:30.950> out

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.530 

so<00:04:41.670> notice<00:04:41.880> of<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.030> guy's<00:04:42.240> paying

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
so notice of this guy's paying

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.500 
so notice of this guy's paying
absolutely<00:04:42.900> no<00:04:43.080> attention<00:04:43.560> as<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.800> kill<00:04:44.010> him

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
absolutely no attention as I kill him

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.200 
absolutely no attention as I kill him
how

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.279 

yeah<00:04:52.870> there's<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.229> artifact<00:04:55.560> whoo<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.860> was

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
yeah there's the artifact whoo that was

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.650 
yeah there's the artifact whoo that was
lucky<00:04:59.289> and<00:04:59.800> there's<00:05:00.699> a<00:05:00.789> senzu<00:05:01.150> bean<00:05:01.360> that's

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
lucky and there's a senzu bean that's

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.300 
lucky and there's a senzu bean that's
helpful<00:05:02.849> that<00:05:03.849> will<00:05:04.060> keep<00:05:04.210> us<00:05:04.360> alive<00:05:05.310> much

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
helpful that will keep us alive much

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.240 
helpful that will keep us alive much
better<00:05:06.580> than<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.849> herbs<00:05:07.150> will<00:05:08.069> now<00:05:09.069> we<00:05:09.130> have

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
better than the herbs will now we have

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:17.189 
better than the herbs will now we have
to<00:05:09.310> fly<00:05:09.639> back<00:05:09.669> down<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:15.720> walk<00:05:16.720> all<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.169> way

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
to fly back down and walk all the way

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.900 
to fly back down and walk all the way
around<00:05:17.380> because<00:05:17.919> you<00:05:18.130> can't<00:05:18.310> fly<00:05:18.520> where<00:05:18.819> you

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
around because you can't fly where you

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:29.610 
around because you can't fly where you
can't<00:05:19.150> see<00:05:22.710> as<00:05:23.710> annoying<00:05:24.009> as<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.370> use<00:05:28.620> but

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
can't see as annoying as I use but

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.080 
can't see as annoying as I use but
everything's<00:05:29.919> already<00:05:30.070> dead<00:05:30.400> at<00:05:30.550> least<00:05:30.699> so

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
everything's already dead at least so

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.999 
everything's already dead at least so
that<00:05:31.120> helps<00:05:33.660> and<00:05:34.660> then<00:05:34.810> we<00:05:34.960> go<00:05:35.080> inside<00:05:35.259> to<00:05:35.800> find

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
that helps and then we go inside to find

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:42.290 
that helps and then we go inside to find
the<00:05:36.280> final<00:05:36.759> artifact

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.420 

but<00:05:43.199> that<00:05:43.349> will<00:05:43.470> probably<00:05:43.620> be<00:05:43.979> a<00:05:44.009> separate

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
but that will probably be a separate

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.700 
but that will probably be a separate
video<00:05:44.780> because<00:05:45.780> this<00:05:45.990> is<00:05:46.110> taking<00:05:46.500> way<00:05:46.530> too

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
video because this is taking way too

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.820 
video because this is taking way too
long<00:05:47.330> like<00:05:48.330> you're<00:05:48.539> not<00:05:48.659> dead<00:05:51.409> and<00:05:52.409> I<00:05:52.680> don't

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
long like you're not dead and I don't

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.020 
long like you're not dead and I don't
particularly<00:05:53.099> care<00:05:53.370> that<00:05:53.550> you're<00:05:53.669> not<00:05:53.819> dead

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
particularly care that you're not dead

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.390 
particularly care that you're not dead
I'm<00:05:54.180> going<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.389> just<00:05:54.509> walk<00:05:54.720> around<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:55.400> I'm

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
I'm going to just walk around you I'm

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.860 
I'm going to just walk around you I'm
also<00:05:56.580> going<00:05:56.759> to<00:05:56.849> take<00:05:56.970> these<00:05:57.150> herbs<00:05:59.870> but

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
also going to take these herbs but

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.409 
also going to take these herbs but
