00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.770
 hi craft since we started with these 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.410
 projects of the day of the mothers and today 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.240
 let's make this mini album card the 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.280
 truth is that these women deserve this 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.309
 and much more so let's see how 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:19.300
 to do it we need this 12 x 12 sheet 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.990
 that we are going to cut at 11 inches x 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.550
 11 inches is going to be a box and you're 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.769
 seeing that I'm using this paper it 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.890
 called sojo card in the collection is 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.650
 american kraft and it's a very collection 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.590
 good very cute and for a very mom 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.450
 very cool modern you know now let's go 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.010
 to fold it this way that you see that 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.010
 I am teaching you and 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.329
 Now we turn the page and we mark 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.170
 how many folds more this is going to be to 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.030
 four and a half inches you see the mark 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.750
 It is very strong because the blade is double and 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 then this one that goes to 3 inches 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.750
 right away 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.559
 this one that is at five and a half inches 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.200
 this at a quarter past ten and we turn around 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.180
 the sheet and this at three inches 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.300
 now you will have some small ones 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.460
 they have pretty we're going to cut those 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.860
 they are leftovers that finally announce 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.150
 serve for nothing and we will discard them 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.010
 of our project 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.640
 now we fold the marks that we already made 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.860
 they will go in just as you see 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.290
 what I do here and the one on the other side of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.080
 the same way now these little ones 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.680
 we are going to open them and we are going to make 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.060
 form a triangle like this is very easy since 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.590
 You know that I do not like to walk me 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.180
 complicating life or that all the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.369
 complicated is this is that these projects 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.040
 They are super easy but apart they look 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.470
 very cute and we are going to do the same thing 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.810
 another side and now we're both going to 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.640
 bring them to the center super well since 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.430
 there is almost the base of our card 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.520
 mini album is getting pretty solid 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.890
