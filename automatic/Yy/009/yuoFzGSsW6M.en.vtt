00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.730
 now good morning everyone and welcome 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.680
 as I am tomÃ¡s and today we are going to talk 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.680
 of clothes and accessories for 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:24.720
 let's start with the shoes I wear 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 some shoes that are very comfortable 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.510
 shoes that waiting 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.050
 at the level of the outside 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.960
 and in that part the sides and then I am 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.960
 very practical because when when they go 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.320
 to skate because a friction is the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.150
 road the ground and the old one because 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.829
 course the plates are going 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.289
 and so 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.890
 cooking would not stay every other day 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.890
 well in 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.130
 and that can sometimes be scary 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.280
 it is so if you practice many 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.129
 flights shoes 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.530
 here I have a few other types uncovered 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.670
 those are mine too but I wanted it 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.210
 teach because 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.220
 that's why for efe 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.220
 you can skate 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.100
 because the sole is very soft 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.409
 the shoe say love and with those 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.329
 parts 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.860
 making a couple of gifts and our 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.060
 mistakes 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 then I do not recommend 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.539
 I do not say that it is essential to use 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.220
 shoes if he's gay but a Saturday like 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.360
 to strengthen your English 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.360
 I do not know well 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.980
 then the pants are very basic 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.980
 also some strong cotton payments 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.700
 if you look for noise they hurt and besides way 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.940
 you have 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.200
 I do not know 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.200
 We did 20 15 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.810
 then the protections what led to 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.960
 which is a very basic helmet also 20 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.350
 euros and not any 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.330
 It is imperative that children be 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.890
 students who are beginners and who 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.200
 they have 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.300
 the helmet because you always have to be able 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.300
 adjust and make it our average 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.280
 the helmet is essential to have 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.910
 we would have the knee pads 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.459
 to see that of people who say I do not 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.380
 I want to take that I feel uncomfortable is 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.530
 true that it is a little uncomfortable to 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.840
 you will see many times you go to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.890
 end up on the ground I think it can be 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.890
 important to carry
