 As we want you to have our 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.440
 necklace with the chain and we will cut it 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.010
 it will stay like this we will take one of the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.540
 pins and we will pass one of the pearls 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.280
 these rentals have a cap on one 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.530
 from the sides that will help us sustain 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.210
 the piece then we will cut a bit of 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 wire with the tweezers and we will double the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.860
 tip without closing it completely 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.470
 we will remain like this we will double the chain to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.930
 half and we will place the pin 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.490
 marking one of the sides we will use the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.920
 tongs to bend the wire and that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.560
 stay fixed from here we'll start 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.540
 decorate the chain 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.880
 then we will mark at the same height as 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.090
 other side 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.550
 this will be the space that we will decorate 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.960
 We will place the pearls in the chain 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.119
 and little by little it will take shape 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.170
 You can use pieces of different sizes 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.170
 and combine colors 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.490
 Take all the time you need 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.490
 until it is as saturated as you have 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 when it is already placed in one of the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.590
 sides of the chain a ring and the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.080
 On the other side, a ring and a hook for 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.080
 can close it and it will be ready 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.880
