00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 in about 95 percent of German 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.170
 households is at least one 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.610
 TV TV is always on 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.889
 one more of the most important media 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.269
 our time 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.099
 Panasonic has in the newest generation 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 his smart tvs set a new standard 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.850
 integrated 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.949
 the seed over ip technology you 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.990
 allows greater flexibility if 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.310
 it is the reception variant via satellite 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.199
 going 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.859
 It is currently of about 18 million 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.599
 Households in Germany used 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.090
 the advantage of the satellite is very clear 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.460
 that he has a great variety of programs 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 offers in very good amount and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.420
 reception quality and it costs 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.390
 basically no connection fees 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 So zero euros month, a large part of the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.489
 Satellite users have this reception 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.969
 Variant already planned in the house building 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.280
 Accordingly, the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.020
 connections attached an afterthought 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.050
 expansion of the system is therefore only possible with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.879
 much effort possible this troupe ip 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 technology now allows the connection 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.829
 more terminals completely without dirt and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.899
 construction site noise the system is a 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 manufacturer-independent new standard 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.740
 for florian willow bunny it is the ideal 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.740
 home-based solution 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.189
 I have planned the house before the child 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.570
 The child is planning to sleep here 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.590
 behind me in the evening when we are here 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.140
 TV is too loud 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.020
 So just do not watch TV 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.820
 or watch TV somewhere else 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.130
 the heart of sat over ip technology 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.229
 the server is a small installation 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.740
 silver box success in trouble 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.740
 their own steam 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:38.159
 the satellite signals arrive via the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.719
 antenna cable directly into the box there 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.579
 they are transformed and over 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:45.859
 network cable into the domestic network 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.859
 fed, for example, in the wifi 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.429
 the installation is really easy 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.740
 as long as you have access to his 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.810
 satellite signals is true it is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.179
 no problem just following this 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.849
 everyone can do it in five minutes 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.039
 by wlan, the television signal is immediately 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.369
 from all internet-enabled terminals 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.369
 transfer 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.799
 but the signal can also be from already 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.239
 existing receiving devices such as the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.979
 TV can be read 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.510
 we need wherever again the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.160
 televisions have then positioned one 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.870
 counterpart what this language satrapi 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.459
 understand and then what with 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.959
 connected to the television is so 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.330
 actually a set top box 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.220
 the disadvantage of this variant is the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.110
 set-top-box needs additional space 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.450
 you always have two remote controls in the 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.060
 use for many tv friends 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.709
 annoying circumstance if you anyway 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.930
 maybe before has a second device 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.630
 to buy what you put in a room 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.310
 would like to stop where to connect 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.630
 disposal is available then i can 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.980
 meanwhile also a device 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.049
 Buy where this set top box already 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.760
 So only one free one is integrated 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.920
 socket a tv one 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.810
 remote control and already I can club 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.950
 watch 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.959
 Panasonic is so far the worldwide 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.090
 only manufacturer of smart tvs with 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.790
 integrated sabor ip technology 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.989
 offers advantage the technology 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.760
 not only works with the 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.370
 satellite signal but also with the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.440
 cable or via the terrestrial signal 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.670
 the device automatically connects with 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.160
 the server and after a few 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.170
 minutes the TV is ready for use 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.250
 I have full circumference here 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.769
 I have my station list 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.930
 digital supplement offers where he is under 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.010
 The media libraries are also running 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.819
 from the broadcasters my program guide 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.380
 could now what disk 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.000
 also recording is everything 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.350
 as if I really have a whole here 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.870
 normal satellite connection has though 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.760
 i can do the transfer of 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.459
 tv signals can be both over the wlan 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.200
 over the power circuit a lan network and 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.540
 even via fiber optics 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.220
 the international standard as well as power 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.609
 watching TV in your own four walls 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.230
 mobile the signal simply over that 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.609
 home network further distributed 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.750
 any terminal devices can do more 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.190
 his television 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.319
 this can also be a tablet or a 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.050
 Smartphone is the new standard 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.510
 ip suitable 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.450
 From now on, family weidhase can also be found in the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.680
 bedroom television 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.510
 and if the program tastes 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.130
 once everyone is different then everyone can 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.360
 be the most diverse devices 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.130
 favorite program look 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:13.970
 for florian willow bunny the 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:15.830
 investment worth not turn on 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.350
 certainly no new lines laid 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.120
 No new sockets set and can 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.590
 I also watch a TV I can 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.310
 Watch TV in the bedroom where it was before 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.950
 just do not go 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.690
 No matter where I am I do not watch TV that 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.730
 also pleases the slumbering offspring 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.010
 sat over ip technology does that 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.400
 satellite television mobile in its own 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.400
 House
