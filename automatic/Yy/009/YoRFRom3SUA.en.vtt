00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.180
 strengthening oil prices 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.290
 the phenomenon is temporary scares experts very 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 soon they will quickly go down again 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.189
 oil quotes for the last year 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.820
 Generally strongly resemble American 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.750
 slides in june 2014 peak price per 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.580
 a barrel of brand brent gave almost 110 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.680
 dollars but by January he fell 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.769
 more than twice and close 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.260
 getting close to $ 50 for 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.570
 a barrel but the scenes seem to have reached 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.360
 its bottom and pushing from it 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.089
 again went up as a result of today 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.549
 the moment they reached the mark of 65 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.559
 dollars what explains such 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.170
 sharp price drops in the opinion 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.019
 Expert reason for last year's collapse 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.780
 simple and subject to the basic law 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.790
 market supply has exceeded demand then 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.400
 there is more simply oil on the market has become 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.700
 too many buyers did not increase 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.790
 in 2014, three countries started 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.820
 actively increase the production of the United 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.100
 the states began to boom shale oil 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.490
 this is visible here on this graph green 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.710
 line aero clivia yellow and red line 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.450
 official authorities in these countries have been able 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.940
 finally take control 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.340
 main port deposits and started 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.070
 active trading in the end oil 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.740
 flooded the world market and prices cool 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.080
 gone down it became clear that their 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.400
 stop you need to either look for new 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.950
 Buyers in the conditions 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.630
 the economic downturn is very 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.210
 problematic or reduce the volume 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.670
 goods on the market but first reduce 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.370
 No producer wants to mine 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.010
 everyone is afraid to stay out in the cold when they 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.440
 remove goods from the market and other countries 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.110
 manufacturers will not follow their example 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.720
 all with hope the steel began to wait for November 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.710
 it was this month that was planned 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.190
 Ward Summit 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.780
 organizations of oil exporting countries in its 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 The composition includes 12 states among them 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.900
 saudi arabia qatar olivia venezuela 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.870
 Iran Iraq precisely Opec provides 40 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.030
 percent of world oil supply level 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.740
 its production so-called quota 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.390
 organizations keenly harry 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.670
 supervises just in the course of such 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.360
 summits before the November meeting all 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.180
 hoped 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.030
 wanting to keep the country's profit 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.750
 will be the first to lower their quotas 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.180
 booty but the miracle did not happen cartel 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.410
 decided not to change anything and it became 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.360
 shock for the global oil market 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.070
 Of course opek favorable high prices but 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.190
 saudi arabia one of the leaders 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.500
 cartel chose long-term strategy 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.780
 playing on the price reduction she hopes 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.910
 remove from the market competitors because far 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.550
 not all oil countries can long 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.910
 trade cheap for example texas 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.250
 or north dakota mining cost-effective 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.880
 only at a price of $ 65 a 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.730
 colorado or wyoming only at 75 a 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.250
 here are the Saudis, though not before making a profit 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.830
 on can still still a long time to reduce 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.800
 price and thereby force out manufacturers 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.040
 expensive oil from the market and it seems that 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.400
 quite now it is possible since the end of the past 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.080
 year number of drilling rigs in the USA 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.780
 reduced by half that is to mine 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.940
 oil and in the world has become less besides 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.770
 middle east first and foremost time 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.040
 unrest began that put under 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.070
 the threat of oil supply from there eventually 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.350
 prices have crept up so what 's basically 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.900
 now saudi arabia can 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.900
 loosen grip and reduce a 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.180
 mining and even inside the cartel itself is ripening 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.720
 a split in saudi arabia with its 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.660
 low production costs can also 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.240
 continue to pursue their price games 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.910
 and after all other members of guardianship for example 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.340
 Venezuela wounds nigiri barely them 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.010
 stand and have long insisted on 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.410
 reduction of whom you are prey but another 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.630
 side of thought the cartel decided to win 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.460
 imagine the largest possible market share 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.010
 playing low prices 

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.810
 it is unlikely to come in halfway so that 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.450
 most experts believe that after 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.710
 June summit someone for prey trick 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.710
 will remain at the same level
