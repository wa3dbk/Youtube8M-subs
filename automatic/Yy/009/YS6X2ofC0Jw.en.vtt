00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.650
 I just saw your baby that goes with 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.300
 abbey lincoln is helping her but 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.029
 they are going to spoil the move 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 and now final is how we are going to send the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.410
 message with geometry everywhere what 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.140
 I see complicated the best thing is to use a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.740
 mail service that is safe from the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.740
 school like this 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.150
 do not compare the security of the service 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.089
 mail is guaranteed as long as they are 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.100
 services with https enabled with the 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.600
 known messaging services this 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.070
 Connection type guarantees greater 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.469
 protection for the privacy of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 users information to sign up for 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.520
 a website through https is more 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.000
 sure that if you do it through a 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 Connection 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 http always typing directly into the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.170
 browser to the elections and never by 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.670
 foreign line or ads because there are also 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.500
 false page that seek our data 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 of the user to be responsible with the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 information from one that we introduce the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 digital media makes the difference in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.690
 about important matters like that nobody 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 he finds out about your things or they take you outside 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.050
 of base and then you do not have to be 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.760
 crying 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.170
 If we had not done all that, 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.170
 You said I was going to party 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.750
 to 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.899
 I'm tired now so I 'm going to go out 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.049
 look for it and that the monologues you were 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.060
 no need I have how to locate it 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.590
 look for some mistake will have made anyone 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.360
 It deals so much with digital security 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:58.390
 somehow here in insurance and has 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:02:02.429
 to be the frame of your message now what 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.429
 this is not how it goes
