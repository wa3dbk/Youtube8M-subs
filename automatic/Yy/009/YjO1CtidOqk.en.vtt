 it takes a lot of time 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.710
 repetitions because the fabric it is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 very very dense are a lot of fiber 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.869
 in muscle tissue time for the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 stimulate 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 a lot a lot of reptiles years is

 a lot of time to bring my calves 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.970
 when I was competing with that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.850
 look at this picture at that ok so the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.040
 tips I learned about 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.500
 professional people who taught me 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.850
 to do workouts like that so 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.560
 today we will take three 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.500
 exercises the first exercise was 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.540
 molded standing I do not know how you 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.990
 call on 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.100
 in french the machine calf 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.840
 today to use this myth how 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.750
 it's already been validated by 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.980
 video per guide is therefore the first of 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.950
 what kind do you put on the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.460
 machine vasiliev these passages and opt to 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.640
 lavish 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.910
 so he gets on the ok bar triggered 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.780
 the thing the bar for the tour all that 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.890
 we keep his position zoo moniseur caps 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.300
 his calves first things to do 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.000
 what you train moliets and people 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.790
 who do that being people people 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.700
 being people like that goran a man who 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.350
 and sheds that are disappointed like this here 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.930
 the first high pressures and 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.000
 tensions on the back of the legs we at 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.320
 born not have big calves and that's 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.209
 still you have you are in the process of 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.950
 make entry exercise very very 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.920
 hard to beat what you need to do is 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.630
 bend your knees it bends your knees 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.950
 and you contract and you 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.060
 start making your calves why 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.700
 because when you do that you 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.120
 work the soil us and the gourmet 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.280
 stop the muscle below the ground and use 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.290
 that's how we do the calves 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:17.030
 with a bar but something else 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.160
 look parallel to the house on the floor 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.680
 is quite so have the contraction 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.970
 the and europe and you come back to the 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.590
 initial position 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.870
 so there are people who are going 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.180
 completely down goes completely bombshell 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.920
 down there and she now renders when 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.019
 you can do that but me them 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.519
 results that I had the most it was in 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.810
 doing that and keeping the focus on 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.700
 calves it's like that you're going to have 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.739
 big calves quickly that's it 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.990
 especially thanks especially the 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.440
 Algerian 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.760
 People of African countries we have pd 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.230
 words take place at the time look at his muscles 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.510
 like me who are they to a muscle of 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.780
 the year he can afford to do that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.100
 but people who have words the courses 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.300
 soon to course muscles like that in 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.670
 the currencies so we have to keep 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.530
 the attention that's why you go 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.270
 have a lot of results between them 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.130
 before being in we entered your 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.320
 calf the other thing to do is 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.380
 when you work the word the teeth 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.330
 but when you think about it 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.170
 knee there you will work the 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.240
 figures on unemployment 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.780
 you will work the soil and us bank 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.640
 it will grow in thickness in width 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.560
 forgiveness women all in width 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.590
 so our one works even more 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.460
 so the width of your calves she is going 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.500
 to be even more apparent than when 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.050
 you work on the length you 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.070
 can not change the look of a muscle 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.650
 because that's genetic 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.670
 ok so that's the first exercise 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.570
 second exercise that comes after his 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.290
 second calf exercise so the same 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.600
 concept 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.600
 there you work the soil us more than the 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.880
 Gutierre France Garaud news go the same 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.930
 thing you when you focus yourself is 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.220
 focused on contraction 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.720
 completely it serves you and the most 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:15.720
 possible the number of repetitions 15 to 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:20.470
 20 repetitions that's how it sticks to 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.290
 big calves your calf if you do not 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.880
 do not work at a young age 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.000
 if you do not work a young age 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.970
 when you start it's going to take some 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.680
 time to arrive specially mismanaged 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.290
 people do not eat much there by 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.690
 three hours to 4 of sound from now back 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.400
 to be penneteau so if you see her 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.630
 big words twice a week 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.090
 they dragged 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.130
 four to five days tickets 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.590
 to train and recover well is like 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.550
 we're going to have big calves ok the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.130
 third exercise 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.110
 this is an exercise that is great 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.240
 case on the press legs 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.240
 I had a lot of results doing 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.210
 this exercise when I was young the 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.940
 good god good ok look how it is 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.860
 does he'll show you his technique 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:11.560
 extended legs people do it like 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:15.250
 that but if will focus on the 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.630
 contraction but me how I have 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.390
 succeeded before even more results 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.990
 it's still the same thing flexing the 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.820
 knees is closed and you focus on 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.910
 a contract that this look of the skis 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.290
 look at the bear that when it does 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.390
 years exercise with people being 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.590

 appears and there you are in the process of 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.370
 working freinet guard solutions 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.260
 mus at the same time the two very muscles 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.360
 very important you do these tips 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.370
 his workouts from 12 to 15 years but 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.980
 repetition the calves it takes time 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:55.900
 three gentle exercises to do at what 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:07:00.790
 series for example by sitting but not 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:02.140
 more than half an hour to train and 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.580
 you do it twice a week
