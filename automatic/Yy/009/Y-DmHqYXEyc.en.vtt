00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 yes brooksu timer my name is x2 not 7 of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.500
 I will not tell you as a means of mobs without 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 mats such words a generally a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.400
 move into zombies we have to shove 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.359
 snowball or in captivity next to him we 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.699
 we will become a zombie, that is, we throw somewhere here 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:27.150
 there were not here now, we 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.310
 zombies we look like zombies we have 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.170
 same effect as zombies so we are zombies 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.680
 at the zombie does not hit no matter how we tried 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.570
 even if we hit him he thinks it is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.719
 friends shake me not know there 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.700
 the squads are blind to me in general we beat 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.860
 there will be and now we can even 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.690
 incarnated skeleton he too if 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.590
 shoot because we will turn to him 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.199
 how can we be named barchenko in 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.110
 general and throw a snowball next to him somewhere 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.420
 here and now we have a skeleton now 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.250
 have a bow can shoot 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.079
 the skeleton doesn't shoot us too but if 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.850
 there will be a day we can die 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.180
 because the day could die giving 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.200
 We put through the team and the day and see that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.990
 what are we burning from fire but when we 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.540
 get here and the surface we stop 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.759
 let us burn only wait 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.470
 until the fire is over 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.200
 we see that the zombie is also burning but we 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 under the surface, therefore, do not smoke here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.700
 so this concerns us carina fire but 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.390
 when he put the night back again 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.710
 night night then we stop burning because 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.290
 that night might not burn but it seems to be but 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.590
 like he was there a creeper then stayed because 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.970
 that he does not burn during the day but the skeleton died 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.310
 such a loss well in general we can also 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.040
 become and creeper that is we throw side by side 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.549
 with him somewhere a snowball somewhere here and 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.200
 now we are the creeper that doo doo doo doo and 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.630
 when we feed a vacuum to a man we 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.240
 let's blow it up with him and that's it 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.159
 how to do Well Well mechanism 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.409
 It looks like this if we say short 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.399
 it all depends on what could be 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.009
 near the bag 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.750
 from we are looking for and this can be easier commands 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.000
 xakep 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.770
 that is, and we are looking for a snowball and if next to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 it we find Scaletta in radius 2 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.400
 and therefore it is necessary to throw between the cells 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.790
 detective is just a command cf sending 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.250
 quickly to see a snowball on radius 0 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.320
 and 1 so yes leave more and then 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.650
 and using this for a p command 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.090
 signal on it came block which 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.040
 to clean a person so that for example 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.650
 if we become for example after the skeleton 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.280
 Zombies, then we would find ourselves onions and armor 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.250
 so that there are no misunderstandings 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.310
 then using the replace a command 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.860
 we are given skeleton armor and head 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.830
 armor gives us an arrow bow 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.700
 also we added a team one 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.250
 somewhere five block commands this is what to be 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.290
 such a tax here we add to the team 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.380
 which is both the skeleton itself and the zombies 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.280
 thanks to the candy bar where where where 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.790
 Tekana blocks 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.580
 they generally add our mobs to 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.500
 the team so that they do not see us that is 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.630
 when we are in their commands not holmes and we are not 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.760
 bit also happens and zombies from the creeper 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.530
 further so that we burn 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.650
 in the afternoon we use the solar battery 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.459
 when the day goes the signal that gives us 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.680
 april scoreboard 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.340
 and if this man has this oscar 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.000
 the board there our along with the fire will appear and 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.060
 then we burn and when us the signal goes 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.480
 on the scoreboard this one is taken away and then we 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.310
 not grief but also if it is above us 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.290
 how this building will evaporate 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.590
 thanks to such a thing that is 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.239
 blogs tap we are human if by us 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.480
 there is such a big line of air 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.120
 we can sports fire if we are already above 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.880
 there is some area that is no longer 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.390
 the air above us will evaporate 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.860
 then thanks to this to the signal unit 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.590
 leaves us again this scoreboard 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.630
 cleans the food we do not burn fire 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.540
 and the creeper I just reporter him to myself and 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.519
 All Well now you can comment 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.600
 write some your new idea this 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.850
 there must be something interesting 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.470
 simple and cool and i hope this video 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.950
 you liked it and thanks for watching and 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.950
