 pasta and snacks 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.540

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.080
 Star products splash any ventura 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.970
 a petit as circus and our new brand 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.670

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.090
 Perez 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.050
 as I said earlier one of our 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.810
 main products is circus and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.630
 we had a nec bot on the machine 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.030
 that is to say, it had capacity 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.959
 of oven but the packing machine 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.989
 I was not going to the same oven speed 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.830
 before making a high investment 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.569
 we wanted to use the technologies 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.180
 electronic or electrical 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.290
 lately has the market as it is 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.030
 this team of plane who helps us 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.030
 obtain efficiencies and returns 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.130
 online that is to say I should not wait for a 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.410
 a month to know how I get the 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.370
 flour then this guy has given me 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.760
 that facility to raise the output of the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.760
 ambient 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.700
 If the machine has helped us improve 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.960
 the efficiencies the speeds in the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.610
 productions that we have had 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.760
 ah 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.460
 to evaluate and know how many times 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.430
 we have had and in itself is a 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.090
 a machine that has helped us a lot in 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.340
 the productions 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.550
 we have had percentages of improvements 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.080
 from 10 to 15 percent in all 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.090
 productions in different formats that 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.180
 we have had the parameters that most 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.849
 we use are the times for 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.790
 production times we also have 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.000
 parents for mechanical problems and 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.569
 electric are the times others more 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.569
 used 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.879
 in quantifiable numbers we have gone up 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.680
 15% in the boom of the line with 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.170
 the same amount of people with the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.620
 same resources as previously 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.629
 we handle 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:16.320
 the ease or the advantages that it offers 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.410
 the equipment is that when operating the operator 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.410
 with a simple look at the team you can 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.340
 know how is your speed how is 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.199
 its efficiency how is the production and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.180
 what is an online feedback 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.300
 for him to take the different 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.690
 alternatives to always be in the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.690
 standard
