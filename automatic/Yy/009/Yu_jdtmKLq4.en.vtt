00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
just basic build up instructions steps

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.270 
just basic build up instructions steps
tips<00:02:20.730> how<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.760> build<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.269> up<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:23.129> what<00:02:24.129> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
tips how to build it up and what the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.399 
tips how to build it up and what the
parts<00:02:24.580> basically<00:02:24.849> should<00:02:25.299> look<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.049> I

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
parts basically should look like and I

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.440 
parts basically should look like and I
think<00:02:26.769> over<00:02:27.069> covering<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.879> completing<00:02:28.330> a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
think over covering and completing a

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.270 
think over covering and completing a
model<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.670> then<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.920> power<00:02:32.920> system

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
model and then this is a power system

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.250 
model and then this is a power system
thing<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.120> came<00:02:34.360> up<00:02:34.599> with<00:02:34.629> it's<00:02:35.049> rather

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
thing that they came up with it's rather

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
thing that they came up with it's rather
old<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.829> dated<00:02:36.040> we're<00:02:36.430> not<00:02:36.579> going<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.790> use

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
old and dated we're not going to use

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.680 
old and dated we're not going to use
their<00:02:37.329> power<00:02:37.690> system<00:02:38.440> recommendations<00:02:39.690> so

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
their power system recommendations so

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.839 
their power system recommendations so
that's<00:02:40.840> basically<00:02:41.200> trash<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.579> is<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
that's basically trash but this is the

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.490 
that's basically trash but this is the
piece<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> gold<00:02:43.390> right<00:02:43.629> here<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.079> everybody

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
piece of gold right here that everybody

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.250 
piece of gold right here that everybody
kinda<00:02:44.920> would<00:02:45.069> like<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:46.629> that's<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.989> actual

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
kinda would like and that's the actual

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.280 
kinda would like and that's the actual

laser-cut<00:03:48.250> frames<00:03:49.060> these<00:03:49.690> are<00:03:49.870> die<00:03:50.049> cut

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
laser-cut frames these are die cut

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.220 
laser-cut frames these are die cut
stringers<00:03:54.720> everything<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.810> need<00:03:55.959> there's

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
stringers everything you need there's

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.069 
stringers everything you need there's
die<00:03:56.859> cuts<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.459> can<00:03:57.609> build<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:58.030> some<00:03:58.930> more

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
die cuts so you can build it some more

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.439 
die cuts so you can build it some more
sparse<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.949> some<00:04:00.220> my<00:04:00.400> tissue<00:04:00.730> paper<00:04:00.849> I'm<00:04:01.299> not

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
sparse and some my tissue paper I'm not

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.150 
sparse and some my tissue paper I'm not
going<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.720> use<00:04:01.840> them<00:04:01.989> we<00:04:02.049> use<00:04:02.169> monocoat<00:04:02.739> as<00:04:02.949> I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
going to use them we use monocoat as I

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.759 
going to use them we use monocoat as I
mentioned<00:04:03.959> it's<00:04:04.959> important<00:04:05.530> when<00:04:05.620> you're

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
mentioned it's important when you're

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.470 
mentioned it's important when you're
storing<00:04:06.040> this<00:04:06.340> stuff<00:04:06.609> is<00:04:06.760> to<00:04:06.910> store<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:07.269> flat

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
storing this stuff is to store it flat

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.159 
storing this stuff is to store it flat
so<00:04:07.840> your<00:04:08.019> sticks<00:04:08.650> don't<00:04:08.889> work

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
so your sticks don't work

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.939 
so your sticks don't work
you're<00:04:11.169> not<00:04:11.290> gonna<00:04:11.440> be<00:04:11.530> able<00:04:11.590> use<00:04:11.769> the

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
you're not gonna be able use the

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.659 
you're not gonna be able use the
propeller<00:04:12.340> either<00:04:13.889> so<00:04:14.889> that's<00:04:15.250> what<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.549> can

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
propeller either so that's what you can

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.479 
propeller either so that's what you can
expect<00:04:16.030> when<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.359> get<00:04:16.539> your<00:04:16.780> box<00:04:17.310> I'm<00:04:18.310> gonna

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489
