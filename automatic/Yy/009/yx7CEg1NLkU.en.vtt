so<00:00:00.450> now<00:00:00.570> that<00:00:00.690> you<00:00:00.780> have<00:00:00.810> your<00:00:00.989> components

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
so now that you have your components

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.409 
so now that you have your components
you're<00:00:02.100> at<00:00:02.190> your<00:00:02.340> first<00:00:02.520> major<00:00:02.760> crossroads

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
you're at your first major crossroads

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.970 
you're at your first major crossroads
once<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.870> get<00:00:04.020> all<00:00:04.140> your<00:00:04.259> components<00:00:04.560> out<00:00:04.859> of

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
once you get all your components out of

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.249 
once you get all your components out of
the<00:00:05.069> box<00:00:05.279> you're<00:00:06.089> tempted<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.690> either<00:00:06.810> do<00:00:07.109> one

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
the box you're tempted to either do one

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.259 
the box you're tempted to either do one
of<00:00:07.290> two<00:00:07.379> things<00:00:07.670> start<00:00:08.670> installing<00:00:09.030> things

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
of two things start installing things

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
of two things start installing things
onto<00:00:09.510> your<00:00:09.719> motherboard<00:00:10.170> or<00:00:10.320> put<00:00:10.860> your

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
onto your motherboard or put your

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.650 
onto your motherboard or put your
motherboard<00:00:11.370> directly<00:00:11.759> into<00:00:12.000> your<00:00:12.030> case<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
motherboard directly into your case and

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.900 
motherboard directly into your case and
then<00:00:13.049> install<00:00:13.380> things<00:00:13.650> from<00:00:13.830> there<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.820> are

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
then install things from there there are

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.180 
then install things from there there are
pros<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.179> cons<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.599> each<00:00:15.809> people<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.890> doing

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
pros and cons to each people like doing

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.460 
pros and cons to each people like doing
things<00:00:17.460> one<00:00:17.760> way<00:00:17.940> or<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.150> other<00:00:18.270> way<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:19.080> this

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
things one way or the other way in this

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
things one way or the other way in this
case<00:00:19.710> I'm<00:00:20.010> going<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.340> start<00:00:20.609> by<00:00:20.730> installing

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
case I'm going to start by installing

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.400 
case I'm going to start by installing
some<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> small<00:00:21.630> components<00:00:22.080> onto<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
some of the small components onto the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.650 
some of the small components onto the
motherboard<00:00:22.500> first<00:00:23.100> such<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.789> my<00:00:23.939> ram<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.510> my

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
motherboard first such as my ram and my

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.320 
motherboard first such as my ram and my
cpu<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.680> after<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.039> open<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> socket<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.180> by

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
cpu so after you open the socket just by

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.880 
cpu so after you open the socket just by
using<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.720> little<00:00:28.019> thing<00:00:28.260> you're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.830> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
using this little thing you're going to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.070 
using this little thing you're going to
want<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.130> take<00:00:29.310> your<00:00:29.429> CPU<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> little<00:00:30.869> box

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
want to take your CPU at a little box

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.139 
want to take your CPU at a little box
that<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> came<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.489> big<00:00:32.700> CPU

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that it came in so I have that big CPU

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.220 
that it came in so I have that big CPU
box<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.540> looked<00:00:33.780> at<00:00:33.930> before<00:00:34.399> everything<00:00:36.230> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
box we looked at before everything the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.750 
box we looked at before everything the
fan<00:00:37.500> took<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.860> most<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> space<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:40.760> we're

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
fan took up most of the space so we're

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
fan took up most of the space so we're
just<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.030> want<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> gently<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:43.020> that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
just going to want to gently get that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.850 
just going to want to gently get that
out<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:44.030> as<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.329> see<00:00:45.559> one<00:00:46.559> side

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
out of there now as you can see one side

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.310 
out of there now as you can see one side
is<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.280> sort<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> brushed<00:00:47.940> finish<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
is just sort of a brushed finish the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.939 
is just sort of a brushed finish the
other<00:00:49.440> side<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> black<00:00:50.960> obviously<00:00:51.960> how

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
other side is this black obviously how

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170 
other side is this black obviously how
is<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> connect<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.910> black

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is it going to connect with that black

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
is it going to connect with that black
there<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> black<00:00:55.829> isn't

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
there that's because the black isn't

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
there that's because the black isn't
it's<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.449> uh<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.899> guess<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.320> could<00:00:58.469> say<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's just uh I guess you could say a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.150 
it's just uh I guess you could say a
safety<00:00:59.460> mechanism<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.170> want<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.379> easily

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
safety mechanism you just want to easily

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
safety mechanism you just want to easily
take<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.049> your

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
take that off and you can see all your

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.620 
take that off and you can see all your
pins<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:05.309> before<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.760> install<00:01:06.210> anything

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
pins now before you install anything

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
pins now before you install anything
onto<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.320> motherboard<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> make

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
onto this motherboard you want to make

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.380 
onto this motherboard you want to make
sure<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.549> you're<00:01:08.580> not<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> break<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
sure that you're not going to break it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
sure that you're not going to break it
particularly<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.320> CPU<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.220> be

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
particularly with the CPU you need to be

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
particularly with the CPU you need to be
very<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.700> careful<00:01:12.590> if<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.740> look<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
very very careful if you look at the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
very very careful if you look at the
core<00:01:14.310> i7<00:01:14.880> chip<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.450> corner<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.110> all

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
core i7 chip on the corner there all

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.700 
core i7 chip on the corner there all
right<00:01:17.340> focus<00:01:17.960> talk<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.110> folks<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.500> there's<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
right focus talk to folks but there's a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.590 
right focus talk to folks but there's a
little<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.189> triangle<00:01:20.520> there's<00:01:21.390> also

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
little bit of a triangle there's also

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
little bit of a triangle there's also
two<00:01:22.729> little<00:01:23.729> Nick's<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.229> CPU<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.860> match

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
two little Nick's in the CPU that match

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370 
two little Nick's in the CPU that match
up<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.490> nicks<00:01:26.729> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.750> socket<00:01:28.170> where<00:01:28.290> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
up to nicks on the socket where you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
up to nicks on the socket where you
going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> be<00:01:28.740> dropping<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.220> in<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.850> make

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
going to be dropping it in so just make

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
going to be dropping it in so just make
sure<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> Knicks<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.990> everything<00:01:31.320> line

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
sure that the Knicks and everything line

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
sure that the Knicks and everything line
up<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.670> want<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> slowly<00:01:33.240> put<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
up and you just want to slowly put it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
up and you just want to slowly put it
down<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:38.150> drop<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> CPU<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.040> should<00:01:41.040> fit

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
down and drop the CPU in should fit

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.149 
down and drop the CPU in should fit
nicely<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.710> want<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> close

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
nicely and then you just want to close

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.440 
nicely and then you just want to close
the<00:01:44.430> lid<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.280> click<00:01:47.670> make<00:01:48.299> sure

that's<00:01:48.600> right<00:01:50.060> now<00:01:51.060> once<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> CPUs<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.049> nice

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
that's right now once the CPUs in nice

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
that's right now once the CPUs in nice
and<00:01:52.259> tight<00:01:52.500> you'll<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:52.950> four<00:01:53.189> holes<00:01:53.520> around

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and tight you'll see four holes around

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.840 
and tight you'll see four holes around
the<00:01:54.659> motherboard<00:01:55.259> around<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> CPU<00:01:56.070> socket<00:01:56.549> as

you can see on the included fan you have
four<00:02:01.290> legs<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.390> wanna<00:02:03.770> put<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.950> in

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
four legs so you just wanna put it in

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.389 
four legs so you just wanna put it in
nice<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:06.930> carefully<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.829> sure<00:02:08.009> everything

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
nice and carefully make sure everything

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.199 
nice and carefully make sure everything
lines<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:10.129> safe<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.459> side<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.819> didn't

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
lines up safe on this side that didn't

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.100 
lines up safe on this side that didn't
line<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.390> correctly

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
line up correctly

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.790 
line up correctly
and<00:02:14.150> now<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.450> lined<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:15.810> correctly<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:16.620> once

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and now it's lined up correctly now once

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.170 
and now it's lined up correctly now once
it's<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.100> correctly<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> push

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
it's in correctly you just want to push

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.150 
it's in correctly you just want to push
until<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.510> four<00:02:24.810> fins<00:02:25.170> are<00:02:25.470> all<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> way<00:02:25.890> push

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
until the four fins are all the way push

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:37.380 
until the four fins are all the way push
into<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.520> motherboard

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.320 

and<00:02:37.740> there<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.830> go<00:02:38.950> now<00:02:39.610> consulting<00:02:40.180> your

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
and there you go now consulting your

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.090 
and there you go now consulting your
motherboard<00:02:40.870> manual<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.530> want<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.770> locate

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
motherboard manual you want to locate

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.720 
motherboard manual you want to locate
the<00:02:42.370> correct<00:02:42.880> power<00:02:43.330> location<00:02:44.430> for<00:02:47.610> for<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
the correct power location for for the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.949 
the correct power location for for the
fan<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.569> for<00:02:50.410> me<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.800> should<00:02:51.250> fit<00:02:51.730> right<00:02:52.030> here

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
fan so for me it should fit right here

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.430 
fan so for me it should fit right here
it's<00:02:53.080> behind<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.590> RAM<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:59.020> never<00:02:59.200> want

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
it's behind the RAM and you never want

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.160 
it's behind the RAM and you never want
to<00:02:59.470> push<00:02:59.709> hard<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.510> you're<00:03:01.660> pushing<00:03:02.110> a

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
to push hard so if you're pushing a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.720 
to push hard so if you're pushing a
little<00:03:02.260> bit<00:03:02.500> hard<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.950> want<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.220> just<00:03:03.400> double

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
little bit hard you want to just double

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.830 
little bit hard you want to just double
check<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.120> make<00:03:04.150> sure<00:03:04.300> that<00:03:04.570> it's<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.780> the

give you a green light and it will pop
right<00:03:11.650> into<00:03:11.830> place<00:03:12.130> now<00:03:12.670> for<00:03:12.700> RAM<00:03:13.180> according

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
right into place now for RAM according

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.390 
right into place now for RAM according
to<00:03:13.780> my<00:03:13.870> motherboard<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.500> wants<00:03:14.739> me<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.980> install

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
to my motherboard it wants me to install

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.810 
to my motherboard it wants me to install
in<00:03:15.700> a<00:03:15.940> 0<00:03:16.330> first<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.019> then<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:18.040> since<00:03:18.489> I'm<00:03:18.580> doing

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
in a 0 first and then if since I'm doing

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.759 
in a 0 first and then if since I'm doing
triple<00:03:19.120> channel<00:03:19.360> memory<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:20.080> want<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.650> all<00:03:20.739> to

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
triple channel memory I want it all to

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.580 
triple channel memory I want it all to
be<00:03:20.920> in<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.370> same<00:03:21.580> channel<00:03:22.110> or<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.380> same

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
be in the same channel or in the same

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.350 
be in the same channel or in the same
color<00:03:24.070> so<00:03:24.519> those<00:03:24.670> are<00:03:24.760> going<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.120> black

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
color so those are going to be the black

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.199 
color so those are going to be the black
ones<00:03:25.660> this<00:03:25.810> was<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.170> 0<00:03:26.860> B<00:03:27.310> 0<00:03:27.540> c<00:03:28.540> 0<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.280> want<00:03:31.150> to

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
ones this was a 0 B 0 c 0 so you want to

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.130 
ones this was a 0 B 0 c 0 so you want to
get<00:03:31.330> your<00:03:31.420> ram<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:33.330> this<00:03:34.330> is<00:03:34.480> my<00:03:34.600> first<00:03:34.870> build

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
get your ram and this is my first build

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.780 
get your ram and this is my first build
so<00:03:35.440> i'm<00:03:35.620> trying<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.920> be<00:03:36.040> as<00:03:36.160> careful<00:03:36.220> as

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
so i'm trying to be as careful as

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.250 
so i'm trying to be as careful as
possible<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:38.110> even<00:03:38.700> experts<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:40.269> have<00:03:40.420> do<00:03:40.959> say

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
possible and even experts to have do say

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.400 
possible and even experts to have do say
just<00:03:42.040> be<00:03:42.160> as<00:03:42.280> careful<00:03:42.700> as<00:03:42.820> you<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.410> because

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
just be as careful as you can because

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.009 
just be as careful as you can because
there's<00:03:44.709> no<00:03:44.860> reason<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.280> break<00:03:45.549> apart<00:03:46.019> so

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
there's no reason to break apart so

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.870 
there's no reason to break apart so
here's<00:03:47.260> just<00:03:47.320> my<00:03:47.620> ram<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.280> is<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.459> two<00:03:48.700> gig

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
here's just my ram this is a two gig

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.310 
here's just my ram this is a two gig
stick<00:03:51.150> just<00:03:52.150> based<00:03:52.390> on<00:03:52.510> these<00:03:52.660> notches<00:03:52.989> you

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
stick just based on these notches you

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.690 
stick just based on these notches you
can<00:03:53.500> tell<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:53.769> there's<00:03:54.100> no<00:03:54.280> way<00:03:54.430> for<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:54.670> to

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
can tell that there's no way for you to

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.990 
can tell that there's no way for you to
put<00:03:54.940> them<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.180> wrong<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.410> if<00:03:56.620> you're<00:03:56.769> ever

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
put them in wrong so if you're ever

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.080 
put them in wrong so if you're ever
building<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.090> pc<00:03:58.329> or<00:03:59.430> you're<00:04:00.430> upgrading<00:04:00.640> one

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
building a pc or you're upgrading one

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.819 
building a pc or you're upgrading one
just<00:04:01.690> remember<00:04:02.110> that<00:04:02.230> with<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.500> RAM<00:04:02.680> you

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
just remember that with the RAM you

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.009 
just remember that with the RAM you
really<00:04:03.160> can't<00:04:03.370> put<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.640> in<00:04:03.760> wrong<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.930> be

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
really can't put it in wrong just to be

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.780 
really can't put it in wrong just to be
careful<00:04:05.410> now<00:04:06.250> you're<00:04:06.340> going<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.519> have<00:04:06.670> to

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
careful now you're going to have to

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.880 
careful now you're going to have to
exert<00:04:07.060> some<00:04:07.360> pressure<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.930> get<00:04:08.140> this<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.590> go<00:04:08.709> in

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
exert some pressure to get this to go in

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.610 
exert some pressure to get this to go in
but<00:04:09.160> you'll<00:04:09.310> see<00:04:09.519> these<00:04:09.700> two<00:04:09.880> notches<00:04:10.120> will<00:04:10.620> go

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
but you'll see these two notches will go

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.270 
but you'll see these two notches will go
to<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.890> top<00:04:13.410> once<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.590> RAM<00:04:14.709> is<00:04:14.860> properly

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
to the top once the RAM is properly

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.379 
to the top once the RAM is properly
installed

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.720 

you

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.020 

and<00:04:26.820> we<00:04:27.420> have<00:04:27.600> our<00:04:27.720> Ram<00:04:27.900> installed

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.120 

the<00:04:31.150> motherboard<00:04:31.600> one<00:04:32.290> prime<00:04:32.650> thing<00:04:32.920> to

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
the motherboard one prime thing to

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.090 
the motherboard one prime thing to
remember<00:04:33.280> are<00:04:34.120> these<00:04:34.450> risers<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:35.590> never<00:04:35.860> want

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
remember are these risers you never want

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.590 
remember are these risers you never want
the<00:04:36.220> motherboard<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.820> actually<00:04:37.150> be<00:04:37.270> touching

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
the motherboard to actually be touching

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.690 
the motherboard to actually be touching
the<00:04:37.690> back<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.080> case<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.980> will<00:04:39.100> be<00:04:39.310> first

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
the back of the case you will be first

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.820 
the back of the case you will be first
of<00:04:39.880> all<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.180> could<00:04:40.300> cause<00:04:40.480> a<00:04:40.510> short<00:04:40.900> second<00:04:41.770> of

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
of all you could cause a short second of

of all you could cause a short second of
all<00:04:41.920> could<00:04:42.160> overheat<00:04:42.730> or<00:04:42.910> damaged<00:04:43.450> one<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.050> the

sum of the capacitors or whatever that's

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.550 
sum of the capacitors or whatever that's
on<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.240> back<00:04:46.450> you<00:04:47.020> always<00:04:47.200> want<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.380> make<00:04:47.500> sure

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
on the back you always want to make sure

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.550 
on the back you always want to make sure
you<00:04:47.710> put<00:04:47.860> these<00:04:47.950> risers<00:04:48.220> in<00:04:48.580> first<00:04:48.880> for<00:04:49.810> me<00:04:49.990> it

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
you put these risers in first for me it

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.250 
you put these risers in first for me it
appears<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.460> antec<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.420> made<00:04:52.570> my<00:04:52.720> case

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
appears that the antec that made my case

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.950 
appears that the antec that made my case
I<00:04:53.560> already<00:04:54.010> put<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.520> rogers<00:04:55.150> in<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.390> correct

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
I already put the rogers in the correct

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.560 
I already put the rogers in the correct
place<00:04:56.110> for<00:04:56.410> my<00:04:56.500> ATX<00:04:57.040> motherboard<00:04:57.520> so<00:04:58.060> let's

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
place for my ATX motherboard so let's

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.510 
place for my ATX motherboard so let's
get<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.050> install<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.650> so<00:04:59.950> once<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.280> get<00:05:00.370> it

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
get in and install it so once you get it

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.710 
get in and install it so once you get it
in<00:05:00.610> there<00:05:00.790> it's<00:05:01.000> really<00:05:01.210> just<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.480> guessing

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
in there it's really just a guessing

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:09.570 
in there it's really just a guessing
game<00:05:01.930> you<00:05:02.710> need<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:03.010> line<00:05:03.280> it<00:05:03.310> up<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:08.460> if<00:05:09.460> you

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
game you need to line it up and if you

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.630 
game you need to line it up and if you
have<00:05:09.700> to<00:05:09.850> push<00:05:10.860> there's<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.950> lot<00:05:11.980> of<00:05:12.130> different

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
have to push there's a lot of different

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.150 
have to push there's a lot of different
things<00:05:12.700> that<00:05:13.150> are<00:05:13.240> on<00:05:13.360> this<00:05:13.630> board<00:05:14.140> but<00:05:14.890> you<00:05:15.010> do

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
things that are on this board but you do

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.870 
things that are on this board but you do
not<00:05:15.310> want<00:05:15.640> to<00:05:15.700> use<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.480> want<00:05:16.660> to<00:05:17.790> sort<00:05:18.790> of

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
not want to use that you want to sort of

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.250 
not want to use that you want to sort of
use<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.360> corner<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:19.930> board<00:05:22.080> all<00:05:23.080> right

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
use the corner to the board all right

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.350 
use the corner to the board all right
and<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:23.500> see<00:05:23.710> a<00:05:23.740> problem<00:05:24.010> already<00:05:27.090> once<00:05:28.090> you<00:05:28.210> get

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
and I see a problem already once you get

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.670 
and I see a problem already once you get
everything<00:05:28.600> fitting<00:05:29.140> you're<00:05:29.290> going<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.500> need

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
everything fitting you're going to need

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.110 
everything fitting you're going to need
to<00:05:29.710> use<00:05:29.890> a<00:05:29.920> screw<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.370> looks<00:05:30.550> similar<00:05:30.790> to

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
to use a screw that looks similar to

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.500 
to use a screw that looks similar to
this<00:05:31.150> to<00:05:31.990> screw<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.800> motherboard<00:05:33.430> into<00:05:34.360> the

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
this to screw the motherboard into the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:43.380 
this to screw the motherboard into the
riser<00:05:41.850> so<00:05:42.850> once<00:05:43.030> you<00:05:43.090> have<00:05:43.240> everything

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
riser so once you have everything

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.530 
riser so once you have everything
screwed<00:05:44.170> in<00:05:44.350> preliminary<00:05:45.220> Lee<00:05:45.520> again<00:05:46.300> don't

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
screwed in preliminary Lee again don't

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.260 
screwed in preliminary Lee again don't
torque<00:05:46.900> anything<00:05:47.320> don't<00:05:47.560> over<00:05:48.100> screw<00:05:48.490> screw

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
torque anything don't over screw screw

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.090 
torque anything don't over screw screw
it<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:49.420> screw<00:05:49.960> them<00:05:50.080> in<00:05:50.260> all<00:05:50.560> about<00:05:50.830> halfway

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
it and screw them in all about halfway

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.980 
it and screw them in all about halfway
so<00:05:51.340> you<00:05:51.490> know<00:05:51.580> they<00:05:51.700> all<00:05:51.820> fit<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:52.330> then<00:05:52.810> go

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
so you know they all fit and then go

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:59.490 
so you know they all fit and then go
back<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:54.150> tighten<00:05:55.150> them<00:05:55.360> all<00:05:55.570> up<00:05:58.170> you<00:05:59.170> want<00:05:59.380> it

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
back and tighten them all up you want it

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.050 
back and tighten them all up you want it
to<00:06:01.110> go<00:06:02.110> down<00:06:02.140> as<00:06:02.740> much<00:06:02.950> as<00:06:03.010> you<00:06:03.250> can<00:06:03.520> but<00:06:03.820> you

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
to go down as much as you can but you

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.890 
to go down as much as you can but you
don't<00:06:05.050> want<00:06:05.350> to<00:06:05.500> break<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.580> board<00:06:06.900> then

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
don't want to break the board then

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.120 
don't want to break the board then
that's<00:06:08.260> all<00:06:08.410> you<00:06:08.500> have<00:06:08.650> to<00:06:08.740> do<00:06:08.860> for<00:06:09.010> the

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
that's all you have to do for the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.060 
that's all you have to do for the
motherboard<00:06:09.550> install
