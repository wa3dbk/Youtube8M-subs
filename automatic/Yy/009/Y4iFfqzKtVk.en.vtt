00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello to all I am sir kabanov 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.990
 and welcome to the first episode of 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.420
 the history of warcraft looks like the other 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.469
 let's start from the beginning a lot 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.150
 of you are aware that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.320
 the history of warcraft takes place in 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.360
 azeroth azeroth all the space that's it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.020
 look at in more detail how a 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.020
 compound this world 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 as you see it azeroth is composed 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.180
 from four continents 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.260
 two were present the creation of 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.540
 top left 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.400
 kalimdor and right eastern kingdoms 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.350
 the norfendre of the pandarie have 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.570
 respectively been added to the output of the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 game with one of the lich extensions 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.080
 king and mister pandaria but he is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.340
 interesting to note that these continents 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.739
 were provided in the background of the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.780
 game before you start talking to you about 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.280
 the creation azeroth note that in the center 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.170
 of the map is a red spiral 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 which is located in the middle of the ocean 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.129
 it's called the maelstrom it's very 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.539
 important rise of warcraft but 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 now that the basics are laid 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.110
 we can start creating 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.160
 of azeroth just as our world is 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.530
 controversial 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.629
 for some it would be either the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.550
 creation to be all powerful be 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.649
 that would be the result of a mmorpg being 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.090
 no physicist we will be simple if we 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.220
 let's open this explosion in the space from where 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 results from matter once the universe 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 created we know how titans are 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.619
 appeared the titans are gods to the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.770
 metal skin that shaped the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.360
 worlds he creates ocean mountain and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.039
 the atmosphere so that the hundreds of 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.210
 millions of world be viable 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.979
 the titans were led by the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.509
 pantheon the equivalent of Olympus Mountain 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.009
 in Greek mythology 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.229
 their purpose was to bring order into 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.850
 the big nothing space is to protect 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.220
 this great nothingness of the threat of nothingness 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.240
 distorts a magic parallel space that 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.520
 would tell you demonic creatures 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 with the sole purpose of sucking energy 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.320
 vital world living to fight 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.670
 against the demons and were able to cross the 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 nothing from history to the world of 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.990
 titans the pantheon and he a warrior of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 sargeras name 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 whose task was to counter 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.689
 the payments offensive in all 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.270
 worlds he executed his task with talent 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.320
 for many miners one day the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.390
 encounters and tunes and art 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.770
 wizard demons want to reduce in 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.010
 slavery of the worlds created by 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.709
 titans sargeras is a titan so pure 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.000
 flawless do not understand the harm I 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.650
 am troubled by the desires of the airs and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.200
 of arms and after fighting them 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.890
 locked in the distorted nothingness he falls 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.860
 in depression 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
 while his depression which I owe him 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.600
 again countered a demon offensive 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.390
 and nate resin to the lord of dread 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.310
 sargeras beat them but was hit 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.950
 by the corruption of the demons is handed 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.320
 in question his faith interest his mission and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.990
 the very concept of order does not envisage 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.240
 more than yaws after that room thanks 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.450
 and in more badly decides to leave the order 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.819
 titans and follow his own path 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.130
 the titan consumed by his madness changes 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.230
 physically and mentally 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.420
 day to destroy the work of the titans 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.550
 creators and make clean slate for the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.680
 fire in need of an army to lead 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.300
 to his project he opened the prison 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.700
 tunes and darrell snr of dread 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.590
 after this act the demons swore 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.390
 allegiance to the black guy sargeras 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.600
 chosen among the champion at the helm 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.760

 who curry his troops in jayden combat 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.930
 against the lords of the dread that 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.050
 were perfect creatures continues 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.370
 m you forget existing at their will 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.670
 huge tiko briouze like his arm 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.550
 law 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.110
 as for him Archimonde recruited the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.640
 lords of the Bible whose leader 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.290
 mano roth 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.780
 he's known to be a fighter 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.069
 of elite so was born the fiery legion 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.069
 where the burning crusade 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.740
 during that time the titans continue 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.660
 their creative work 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.459
 until the day they arrived in the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.550
 Azeroth world to their surprise 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.260
 he was attacked by earth elements on 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.910
 even controlled by the ancient gods of 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.340
 deities dating from before the team years 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.020
 finally the titans pushed back the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.239
 dimensions and therefore the 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.400
 elemental once the battle is over 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.230
 and calm returned the titans started to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.060
 shape the world to help them in 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.890
 their task they created the dwarves to 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.230
 from living and magical rocks to 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.040
 to cut oneself off the ground and to control 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.450
 oceans and created a light at sea 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.280
 after long moments the titans 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.050
 achieve a perfect result in 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.420
 unique continent named she indoor 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.910
 which means the land of the eternal 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.160
 light in the center of this continent 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.100
 Giants placed in enque of energy 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.780
 magical named the well of eternity a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.550
 source of power so huge that 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.810
 little by little life is created around the well 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.760
 the world was taking shape 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.050
 but before their departure the titans 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.850
 wanted to give back to the most powerful 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.670
 creatures of the world a power capable of 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.650
 watch over kaline gold so each 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.020
 remaining members of the pantheon gave a 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.720
 little of his power to five dragons to 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.120
 the extra zalla own cup of life 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.150
 malygos the weaver is here at the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.730
 dreamy golden wedding on the menu the eternal and 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.320
 neltharion the guardian after creation 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.120
 of the world to titans leave for 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.620
 always certain that the dragons 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.070
 will best defend the new world 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.720
 of azeroth 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.460
 but if it was just a matter of 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.730
 time that that grace does not discover to his 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.730
 rotations
