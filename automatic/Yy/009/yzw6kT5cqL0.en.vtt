the<00:00:02.760> macbook<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.780> our<00:00:04.680> most<00:00:04.859> popular<00:00:05.190> mac<00:00:06.259> but

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
the macbook is our most popular mac but

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.129 
the macbook is our most popular mac but
what<00:00:07.410> we've<00:00:07.649> what<00:00:08.189> we've<00:00:08.250> done<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.870> we've

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
what we've what we've done and and we've

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.009 
what we've what we've done and and we've
made<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> habit<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.860> doing<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.190> if<00:00:11.370> Apple<00:00:11.730> is

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
made a habit of doing this if Apple is

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.500 
made a habit of doing this if Apple is
is<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.440> decided<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:15.030> over

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.410 

the<00:00:19.050> new<00:00:19.200> macbook<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:19.950> quite<00:00:20.340> remarkable

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.290 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:21.470> achievement<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:23.820> really

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.859 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:25.110> just<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.220> complete<00:00:26.670> revolution<00:00:27.150> in

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:40.450 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.740> notebooks<00:00:29.130> are<00:00:29.279> made

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.950 

when<00:00:41.460> traditionally<00:00:42.059> notebooks<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.750> made

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
when traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.090 
when traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:43.699> multiple<00:00:44.699> parts<00:00:45.530> but<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> problem<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:48.000> multiple<00:00:48.449> parts<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.469> add

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.030 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.460> weight<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.290> increase<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
size and weight and and you increase the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.399 
size and weight and and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.640> failure<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.979 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:56.129> breakthrough<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:57.269> we<00:00:57.449> heard<00:00:57.750> with

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.979 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.230> macbook<00:00:58.860> was<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.059> replace<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.629> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
with the macbook was to replace all of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.280 
with the macbook was to replace all of
those<00:01:01.140> parts<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.790> part<00:01:03.089> and<00:01:03.510> at

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.550 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:04.470> part<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.920> called<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> unibody<00:01:06.560> we

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
one part we called the unibody we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
one part we called the unibody we
figured<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.190> way<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.929> being<00:01:09.929> able<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> make

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
figured out a way of being able to make

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.980 
figured out a way of being able to make
make<00:01:10.950> make<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.429> notebook<00:01:11.990> fundamentally

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
make make the notebook fundamentally

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.910 
make make the notebook fundamentally
thinner<00:01:13.350> lighter<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:15.300> robust<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.080> wit<00:01:16.710> with

sort of a degree of a fit and finish
that<00:01:19.229> we've<00:01:19.619> we've<00:01:19.920> never<00:01:20.220> even<00:01:20.369> dreamed<00:01:20.700> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that we've we've never even dreamed of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.219 
that we've we've never even dreamed of
before<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:23.100> only<00:01:23.310> way<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.990> one

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
before and the only way to make that one

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.529 
before and the only way to make that one
part<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.280> machine<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.119> single

part was to machine it from a single
piece<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.899> aluminium<00:01:32.330> aluminum<00:01:33.330> was<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
piece of aluminium aluminum was the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.630 
piece of aluminium aluminum was the
ideal<00:01:34.050> choice<00:01:34.289> for<00:01:34.440> this<00:01:34.649> product<00:01:35.069> because<00:01:35.220> it

solid block of aluminum then we go

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.710 
solid block of aluminum then we go
through<00:01:54.040> an<00:01:54.159> extrusion<00:01:54.549> process<00:01:54.850> which<00:01:55.600> is

stole space from the tracking surface
and<00:05:02.410> we<00:05:03.010> did<00:05:03.190> that<00:05:03.400> by<00:05:03.610> making<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.180> entire

right texture just so that the
