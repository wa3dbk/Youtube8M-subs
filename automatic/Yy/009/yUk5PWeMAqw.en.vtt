the map that I will be referencing so
pay<00:01:26.520> attention<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.999> that<00:01:27.149> let's<00:01:27.569> get<00:01:27.779> started

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:28.139 
pay attention to that let's get started

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.019 
pay attention to that let's get started
with<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.439> breakdown<00:01:28.859> if<00:01:29.099> there's<00:01:29.669> ever<00:01:29.939> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the favor from one team to a next this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.620 
the favor from one team to a next this
is<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> fall<00:01:37.560> sperm<00:01:37.889> set<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.549> motion

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
is it and fall sperm set that in motion

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
is it and fall sperm set that in motion
once<00:01:39.630> he's<00:01:39.810> seen<00:01:40.020> our<00:01:40.259> flag<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.770> taken<00:01:41.130> he

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
once he's seen our flag get taken he

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.609 
once he's seen our flag get taken he
moved<00:01:41.639> into<00:01:41.789> enemy<00:01:42.179> position<00:01:42.630> grabbed<00:01:43.380> their

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
moved into enemy position grabbed their

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.949 
moved into enemy position grabbed their
flag<00:01:43.919> and<00:01:44.189> pulled<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.880> towards<00:01:45.329> our<00:01:45.479> zone<00:01:45.719> and

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
flag and pulled out towards our zone and

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.349 
flag and pulled out towards our zone and
then<00:01:46.229> defend<00:01:46.649> ated<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.399> allowed<00:01:47.789> me<00:01:48.029> to

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
then defend ated this allowed me to

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.870 
then defend ated this allowed me to
basically<00:01:49.079> move<00:01:49.709> into<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.189> enemy's<00:01:50.489> side<00:01:50.669> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
basically move into the enemy's side of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.449 
basically move into the enemy's side of
things<00:01:51.060> grab<00:01:51.840> their<00:01:52.079> flag<00:01:52.380> carrier<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.039> then

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
things grab their flag carrier and then

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.179 
things grab their flag carrier and then
work<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.999> respawns<00:01:54.599> effectively<00:01:55.349> enough<00:01:55.679> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
work the respawns effectively enough to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.830 
work the respawns effectively enough to
allow<00:01:56.399> me<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.609> basically<00:01:56.999> escape<00:01:57.630> any

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
allow me to basically escape any

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.039 
allow me to basically escape any
encounters<00:01:58.499> any<00:01:58.679> gunfights<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.399> simply<00:02:00.359> play

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
encounters any gunfights and simply play

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.469 
encounters any gunfights and simply play
the<00:02:01.259> objective<00:02:01.829> that's<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.969> important<00:02:03.419> thing

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the objective that's the important thing

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.879 
the objective that's the important thing
and<00:02:03.719> that's<00:02:03.899> what's<00:02:04.200> giving<00:02:04.559> us<00:02:04.709> the

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
and that's what's giving us the

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:07.729 
and that's what's giving us the
back-to-back<00:02:05.639> flag<00:02:06.119> caps<00:02:06.450> had<00:02:07.169> I<00:02:07.200> been<00:02:07.499> more

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
back-to-back flag caps had I been more

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.319 
back-to-back flag caps had I been more
worried<00:02:08.039> about<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.399> opposition<00:02:08.939> and<00:02:09.119> try<00:02:09.269> to
