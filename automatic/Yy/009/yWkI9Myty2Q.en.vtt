demonstrate the product performs at

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.830 
demonstrate the product performs at
least<00:01:53.890> as<00:01:54.130> well<00:01:54.159> as<00:01:54.390> any<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.690> other

least as well as any of the other

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.649 
least as well as any of the other
traditional<00:01:56.710> suspensions<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:58.330> know<00:01:58.450> that's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
traditional suspensions you know that's

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.630 
traditional suspensions you know that's
hard<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.930> fake<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.650> really<00:01:59.860> is<00:02:00.040> especially

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
hard to fake it really is especially

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.760 
hard to fake it really is especially
week<00:02:01.210> after<00:02:01.510> week<00:02:01.720> after<00:02:01.900> week<00:02:02.200> after<00:02:02.380> year

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
week after week after week after year

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.990 
week after week after week after year
after<00:02:02.890> year<00:02:05.220> one<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.369> things<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.670> think<00:02:06.729> is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
after year one of the things I think is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.199 
after year one of the things I think is
really<00:02:07.330> super<00:02:07.690> cool<00:02:07.869> is<00:02:08.170> that<00:02:09.039> you<00:02:09.670> guys<00:02:09.880> not

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
really super cool is that you guys not

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.140 
really super cool is that you guys not
only<00:02:10.239> you<00:02:11.230> know<00:02:11.260> autocross<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.160> stuff<00:02:12.400> but

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
only you know autocross this stuff but

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.270 
only you know autocross this stuff but
you<00:02:13.270> break<00:02:13.600> stuff<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.650> almost<00:02:14.830> enjoy

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you break stuff and you almost enjoy

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.770 
you break stuff and you almost enjoy
doing<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:16.650> well<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:18.489> know<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.640> tell<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.239> do<00:02:19.450> these

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
doing it well you know I tell I do these

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.479 
doing it well you know I tell I do these
air<00:02:20.050> suspension<00:02:20.440> seminars<00:02:20.950> once<00:02:21.160> in<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.340> while

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
air suspension seminars once in a while

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.540 
air suspension seminars once in a while
and<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.180> tell<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:23.410> people<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.800> attend<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.190> I

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
and I tell the people that attend that I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.370 
and I tell the people that attend that I
don't<00:02:24.850> know<00:02:25.060> what<00:02:25.269> every<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.690> there<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.140> to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
don't know what every way there is to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.190 
don't know what every way there is to
build<00:02:26.590> an<00:02:26.709> Ursus<00:02:27.040> much<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.640> know<00:02:27.760> about<00:02:28.480> 15

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
build an Ursus much but I know about 15

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.830 
build an Ursus much but I know about 15
years<00:02:29.560> worth<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.070> ways<00:02:30.250> not<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:31.600> have<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
years worth of ways not to we have a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.229 
years worth of ways not to we have a
whole<00:02:32.019> dumpster<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.890> broken<00:02:33.730> parts<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
whole dumpster of broken parts of the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.810 
whole dumpster of broken parts of the
shop<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.720> that's<00:02:35.230> what<00:02:35.560> allows<00:02:35.980> us<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.310> make

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
shop and that's what allows us to make

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.370 
shop and that's what allows us to make
sure<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.209> customer<00:02:37.630> doesn't<00:02:38.080> get<00:02:38.230> broken

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
sure the customer doesn't get broken

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.680 
sure the customer doesn't get broken
parts<00:02:38.950> yeah<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.519> play<00:02:39.760> bugs<00:02:40.060> I've<00:02:40.450> broken

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
parts yeah we play bugs I've broken

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.780 
parts yeah we play bugs I've broken
shock<00:02:41.050> waves<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> forearms<00:02:42.459> have<00:02:42.580> broken

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
shock waves of the forearms have broken

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.640 
shock waves of the forearms have broken
air<00:02:43.060> bars<00:02:43.300> up<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:43.870> kinds<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.230> stuff<00:02:44.410> but

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
air bars up with all kinds of stuff but

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.530 
air bars up with all kinds of stuff but
fortunately<00:02:45.190> sometimes<00:02:45.670> I've<00:02:45.820> done<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.150> in

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
fortunately sometimes I've done it in

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.410 
fortunately sometimes I've done it in
front<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.900> thousands<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.440> people<00:02:48.060> but<00:02:49.060> you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
front of thousands of people but you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.509 
front of thousands of people but you
know<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:50.050> those<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.980> days<00:02:51.160> that<00:02:51.190> make

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
know that's those are the days that make

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.880 
know that's those are the days that make
you<00:02:51.640> appreciate<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.269> good<00:02:52.510> days<00:02:52.690> well<00:02:53.620> it's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
you appreciate the good days well it's

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.280 
you appreciate the good days well it's
all<00:02:54.070> in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.700> interest<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.329> finding<00:02:56.140> out<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
all in the interest of finding out the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.500 
all in the interest of finding out the
limits<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.100> beefing<00:02:57.880> them<00:02:58.000> up<00:02:58.150> where

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
limits and then beefing them up where

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.050 
limits and then beefing them up where
they<00:02:58.630> need<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.840> be<00:02:58.930> beefed<00:02:59.170> up<00:02:59.320> exactly<00:03:00.340> yeah

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
they need to be beefed up exactly yeah

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.630 
they need to be beefed up exactly yeah
there's<00:03:01.480> no<00:03:01.720> way<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.070> do<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.370> only

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
there's no way that you can do this only

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.470 
there's no way that you can do this only
on<00:03:04.090> paper

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
on paper

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.180 
on paper
you<00:03:04.630> have<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.959> start<00:03:05.200> up<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.500> problem<00:03:05.950> and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
you have to start up a problem and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.640 
you have to start up a problem and
there's<00:03:07.030> certain<00:03:07.420> design<00:03:07.810> parameters<00:03:08.410> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
there's certain design parameters and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.259 
there's certain design parameters and
engineering<00:03:09.220> theories<00:03:09.579> that<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.910> adhere<00:03:10.030> to

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
engineering theories that you adhere to

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.600 
engineering theories that you adhere to
but<00:03:10.930> at<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.140> end<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> day<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:12.130> have<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.489> go

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
but at the end of the day you have to go

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.270 
but at the end of the day you have to go
out<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.000> make<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.329> work<00:03:13.769> if<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.950> don't<00:03:15.070> do

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
out and make it work if you don't do

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.770 
out and make it work if you don't do
that<00:03:15.430> then<00:03:15.670> all<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:15.970> engineering<00:03:16.390> theories

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
that then all the engineering theories

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.020 
that then all the engineering theories
don't<00:03:17.140> mean<00:03:17.350> anything<00:03:17.560> now<00:03:17.950> another<00:03:18.910> thing

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
don't mean anything now another thing

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.500 
don't mean anything now another thing
