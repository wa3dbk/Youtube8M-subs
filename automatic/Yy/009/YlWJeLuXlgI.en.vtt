00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
we're simply going to do that by doing a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.520 
we're simply going to do that by doing a

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
small triangle section this is going to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.230 
small triangle section this is going to
be<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.800> beginning<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.460> our<00:01:49.550> gut<00:01:49.760> right<00:01:50.030> the

be the beginning of our gut right the
Dutch<00:01:50.480> braids<00:01:50.780> are<00:01:50.990> when<00:01:51.140> you're<00:01:51.260> working

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
Dutch braids are when you're working

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.770 
Dutch braids are when you're working
underhanded<00:01:52.190> opposed<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.640> over<00:01:52.820> handed<00:01:53.270> but

we're just going to go ahead and split
the<00:01:54.980> hair<00:01:55.160> in<00:01:55.280> three<00:01:55.580> sections<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.780> right

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the hair in three sections the right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.230 
the hair in three sections the right
section<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.680> going<00:01:57.920> under<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.790> left<00:01:59.000> section

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
some hair from the hairline back to

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.520 
some hair from the hairline back to
braid<00:02:06.910> into<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.179> middle<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.320> left

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
braid into the middle now that left

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.960 
braid into the middle now that left
section<00:02:09.830> needs<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.220> little<00:02:10.340> bit<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.610> hair<00:02:10.790> so

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
parting to our braid and that whole

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.130 
parting to our braid and that whole
section<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.640> gonna<00:02:16.850> go<00:02:17.000> into<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.330> middle<00:02:17.570> so

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
section is gonna go into the middle so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.740 
section is gonna go into the middle so
we're<00:02:18.290> gonna<00:02:18.410> repeat<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:19.010> section

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
we're gonna repeat this section

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.330 
we're gonna repeat this section
technique<00:02:20.750> all<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.260> way<00:02:21.380> down<00:02:21.620> until<00:02:21.920> we<00:02:22.160> run

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
technique all the way down until we run

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.340 
technique all the way down until we run
out<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.580> hair<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.150> then<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:23.720> continue<00:02:23.959> with

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
out of hair and then just continue with

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:35.690 
out of hair and then just continue with
a<00:02:24.500> simple<00:02:24.890> three<00:02:25.190> strand<00:02:25.520> braid

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.100 

we're<00:02:36.700> gonna<00:02:36.790> go<00:02:36.970> ahead<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.390> secure<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.780> ends

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
we're gonna go ahead and secure the ends

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.260 
we're gonna go ahead and secure the ends
with<00:02:38.230> an<00:02:38.320> elastic<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.010> do<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> same<00:02:39.700> thing<00:02:40.060> on

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
with an elastic and do the same thing on

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:56.070 
with an elastic and do the same thing on
the<00:02:40.420> opposite<00:02:40.930> side

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.509 

so<00:02:57.080> before<00:02:57.440> we<00:02:57.590> start<00:02:57.620> working<00:02:58.010> with<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.310> back

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
so before we start working with the back

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.339 
so before we start working with the back
section<00:02:58.849> I'm<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.599> gonna<00:02:59.750> go<00:02:59.930> ahead<00:03:00.050> and

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
section I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.290 
section I'm just gonna go ahead and
stretch<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.890> braid<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.340> pan<00:03:01.580> pick<00:03:01.849> it<00:03:01.970> out<00:03:02.060> I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
stretch the braid and pan pick it out I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.210 
stretch the braid and pan pick it out I
do<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.780> lot<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.440> what's<00:03:03.860> really<00:03:04.099> cool

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
do this a lot and what's really cool

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.520 
do this a lot and what's really cool
about<00:03:04.640> having<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.239> salt<00:03:05.599> spray<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:05.959> there<00:03:06.170> is

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
about having that salt spray in there is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.500 
about having that salt spray in there is
that<00:03:06.769> it's<00:03:06.920> really<00:03:07.099> set<00:03:07.430> up<00:03:07.550> setting<00:03:08.150> us<00:03:08.300> up

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
that it's really set up setting us up

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.630 
that it's really set up setting us up
for<00:03:08.780> success<00:03:08.920> because<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.099> just<00:03:10.280> gonna<00:03:10.430> have

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
for success because it's just gonna have

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.850 
for success because it's just gonna have
that<00:03:10.790> grit<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.239> texture<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.690> hold<00:03:12.140> into<00:03:12.560> place

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
that grit and texture to hold into place

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.650 
that grit and texture to hold into place
so<00:03:13.400> that's<00:03:13.610> very<00:03:13.819> very<00:03:13.940> key<00:03:14.390> before

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
so that's very very key before

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:24.729 
so that's very very key before
performing<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.860> type<00:03:16.069> of<00:03:16.310> braid<00:03:23.680> okay<00:03:24.680> so

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
performing this type of braid okay so

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.320 
performing this type of braid okay so
now<00:03:25.099> what<00:03:25.280> I'm<00:03:25.400> going<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.580> go<00:03:25.700> ahead<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:26.030> do<00:03:26.180> is

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
now what I'm going to go ahead and do is

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.819 
now what I'm going to go ahead and do is
work<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.540> back<00:03:26.840> section<00:03:27.140> I'm<00:03:27.470> going<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.650> add<00:03:27.769> a

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
work the back section I'm going to add a

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.949 
work the back section I'm going to add a
little<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.250> souffle<00:03:28.730> by<00:03:28.940> label<00:03:29.299> then<00:03:29.480> this

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
little this souffle by label then this

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.900 
little this souffle by label then this
is<00:03:30.110> gonna<00:03:30.260> create<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.650> really<00:03:31.069> nice<00:03:31.220> undone

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
is gonna create a really nice undone

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.600 
is gonna create a really nice undone
texture<00:03:32.420> I'm<00:03:32.810> gonna<00:03:33.019> go<00:03:33.110> ahead<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.590> apply<00:03:34.190> it

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
texture I'm gonna go ahead and apply it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.850 
texture I'm gonna go ahead and apply it
from<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.970> roots<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> end<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.440> what<00:03:36.739> it's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
from the roots to the end and what it's

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.559 
from the roots to the end and what it's
for<00:03:36.950> help<00:03:37.220> do<00:03:37.400> add<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.760> little<00:03:38.060> bit<00:03:38.209> more

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
for help do add a little bit more

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.720 
for help do add a little bit more
separation<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.560> gives<00:03:39.769> some<00:03:39.950> definition<00:03:40.579> to

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
separation it gives some definition to

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.660 
separation it gives some definition to
our<00:03:40.849> waves<00:03:41.120> before<00:03:41.750> we<00:03:42.049> create<00:03:42.349> our<00:03:42.530> braid<00:03:42.769> so

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
our waves before we create our braid so

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.910 
our waves before we create our braid so
what<00:03:43.879> we're<00:03:44.030> gonna<00:03:44.120> do<00:03:44.329> now<00:03:44.769> they're<00:03:45.769> really

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
what we're gonna do now they're really

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.330 
what we're gonna do now they're really
nice

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
nice

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.089 
nice
it's<00:03:46.790> really<00:03:47.120> helps<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.450> polish<00:03:47.870> any<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.290> our
