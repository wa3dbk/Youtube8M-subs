00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
going to do it right because I was

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
going to do it right because I was
sitting<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.180> wrong<00:01:15.330> spot<00:01:15.540> yeah<00:01:16.259> you're

just got to have one flat so it can

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.200 
just got to have one flat so it can
actually<00:01:19.619> sit<00:01:20.189> down<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.850> turned<00:01:21.000> on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
actually sit down when it's turned on

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.690 
actually sit down when it's turned on
you<00:01:21.659> come<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> top<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.159> doesn't<00:01:23.520> go

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you come up to the top and it doesn't go

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.350 
you come up to the top and it doesn't go
over<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> edge<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.930> sort<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:26.210> put<00:01:27.210> one

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
over the edge you just sort of put one

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
over the edge you just sort of put one
up<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.659> put<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:28.290> all<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> way<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
up here put one down all the way down to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.670 
up here put one down all the way down to
the<00:01:29.280> bottom<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:30.110> then<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.259> back<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
the bottom and then go back up to the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
the bottom and then go back up to the
top<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.920> smash<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.540> put<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.780> block

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
top and smash it and then put a block

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.609 
top and smash it and then put a block
down<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> works<00:01:36.509> essentially<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.470> way

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
down and it works essentially that way

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
down and it works essentially that way
and<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.880> ends<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.180> slanting

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and then this one just ends up slanting

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.899 
and then this one just ends up slanting
so<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.860> build<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.880> down

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so then you build it all the way down

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
so then you build it all the way down
and<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.740> put<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and you get that and so you put this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.090 
and you get that and so you put this
down<00:01:47.310> blam<00:01:47.939> blam<00:01:48.360> turn<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:50.040> know

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
down blam blam turn it on I don't know

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.380 
down blam blam turn it on I don't know
if<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.250> fuck<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.640> yeah<00:01:50.939> probably<00:01:51.119> fucked

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
if I fuck that up yeah probably fucked

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.310 
if I fuck that up yeah probably fucked
it<00:01:51.509> up<00:01:51.570> anyway<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.710> you've<00:01:52.890> got<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:54.320> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it up anyway and then you've got that so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.929 
it up anyway and then you've got that so
it<00:01:55.409> ends<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.680> looking<00:01:55.710> pretty<00:01:56.159> nice<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.759> on

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
it ends up looking pretty nice and on

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.880 
it ends up looking pretty nice and on
the<00:01:57.030> hill<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.079> sort<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.380> come<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the hill if you sort of come back and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.950 
the hill if you sort of come back and
have<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> look<00:01:59.189> at<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.369> without<00:01:59.460> getting<00:01:59.670> my<00:02:00.270> pic

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
have a look at it without getting my pic

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.900 
have a look at it without getting my pic
perverted<00:02:01.530> pixel<00:02:01.799> art<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> hell

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.210 

well<00:02:07.910> another<00:02:08.540> process<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.200> failing<00:02:09.950> which<00:02:10.100> I

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
well another process of failing which I

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.860 
well another process of failing which I
just<00:02:10.399> failed<00:02:10.640> again<00:02:10.940> turns<00:02:11.840> out<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.050> works

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
just failed again turns out that works

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.210 
just failed again turns out that works
so<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.320> want<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.620> one<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.980> looks

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
so if you want to have one that looks

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.600 
so if you want to have one that looks
like<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.850> does<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.270> then<00:02:18.250> scrool<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.430> top

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
like it does this then scrool the top

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.660 
like it does this then scrool the top
ones<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.030> guess<00:02:21.610> yeah<00:02:22.610> well<00:02:23.500> thank<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:25.630> anyway

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
like to be called that was cool and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.090 
like to be called that was cool and
something<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.790> build<00:02:44.440> now<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.680> little<00:02:45.980> bit

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
something to build now a little bit

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.080 
something to build now a little bit
earlier<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.400> was<00:02:46.490> talking<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> one<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:47.000> my

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
earlier I was talking to one of my

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.520 
earlier I was talking to one of my
friends<00:02:47.150> she<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:48.440> she<00:02:48.680> doesn't<00:02:49.370> do<00:02:49.459> much<00:02:49.610> she

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
friends she like she doesn't do much she

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.690 
friends she like she doesn't do much she
was<00:02:51.530> trying<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.740> get<00:02:51.830> her<00:02:51.920> into<00:02:52.070> Minecraft<00:02:52.550> but

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
was trying to get her into Minecraft but

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.430 
was trying to get her into Minecraft but
she<00:02:52.910> said<00:02:53.090> something<00:02:53.270> about<00:02:53.600> what<00:02:54.110> she<00:02:54.230> wants

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
she said something about what she wants

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.840 
she said something about what she wants
to<00:02:54.470> do<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.860> real<00:02:55.070> life<00:02:55.130> which<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.700> actually

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
to do in real life which is actually

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.210 
to do in real life which is actually
just<00:02:56.270> like<00:02:56.930> building<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.440> pirate<00:02:57.830> ship<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
just like building a pirate ship in a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.430 
just like building a pirate ship in a
bottle<00:02:58.300> we<00:02:59.300> both<00:02:59.450> then<00:02:59.720> decide<00:03:00.020> that<00:03:00.230> would<00:03:00.350> be

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
bottle we both then decide that would be

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.760 
bottle we both then decide that would be
way<00:03:00.770> too<00:03:00.800> much<00:03:01.220> effort<00:03:01.490> but<00:03:02.000> then<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.870> put<00:03:03.620> it<00:03:03.709> on

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
way too much effort but then I put it on

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.350 
way too much effort but then I put it on
this<00:03:03.890> side<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.370> build<00:03:04.550> one<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.850> sander<00:03:05.150> speed

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
this side to build one the sander speed

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.390 
this side to build one the sander speed
so<00:03:05.690> I'm<00:03:06.320> probably<00:03:06.560> going<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.980> end<00:03:07.010> up<00:03:07.160> building

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
so I'm probably going to end up building

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.420 
so I'm probably going to end up building
a<00:03:07.610> bottle<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.470> put<00:03:09.470> pirate<00:03:09.770> ship<00:03:09.950> in<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.220> or

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
a bottle and put pirate ship in it or

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.860 
a bottle and put pirate ship in it or
build<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.910> pirate<00:03:11.209> ship<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.570> put<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.840> a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
build the pirate ship and put it in a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.680 
build the pirate ship and put it in a
bottle<00:03:12.760> leave<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.790> down<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.180> comments<00:03:14.510> if

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
bottle leave that down the comments if

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.320 
bottle leave that down the comments if
you'd<00:03:15.230> like<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.530> see<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.890> or<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.940> know<00:03:17.060> other

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
you'd like to see that or you know other

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.440 
you'd like to see that or you know other
things<00:03:17.480> you'd<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:17.900> to<00:03:18.170> see<00:03:18.350> because<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:19.450> don't

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
things you'd like to see because I don't

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.520 
things you'd like to see because I don't
put<00:03:20.600> our<00:03:20.720> videos<00:03:20.989> as<00:03:21.110> often<00:03:21.290> as<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.500> should

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
put our videos as often as I should

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.220 
put our videos as often as I should

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.330 
because I don't know what to put and
anything<00:03:24.230> missing<00:03:24.530> here<00:03:24.800> is<00:03:24.830> probably

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
anything missing here is probably

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.320 
anything missing here is probably
because<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.670> went<00:03:25.880> back<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.180> original

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330
