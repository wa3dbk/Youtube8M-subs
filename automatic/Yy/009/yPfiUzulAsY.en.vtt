00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.309
 who are kids how are the guides 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.500
 guides you learn something guides in this 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.140
 turn the jeans my name is earl and 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.390
 you are in game esports and we started 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.039
 in rue we are going to put damage marks 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.689
 of attacks they armor glyphs 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.400
 magic resistance and science kit 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.079
 attack speed I like 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.699
 change a speed routine 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.430
 attack for one of attack damage so I 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.930
 I got used to it and it beats me if it does not give you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 can use that of the professionals who 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.809
 is the one that I first mentioned so it's from 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.809
 likes bye 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.989
 good teachers master teachers to me 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.920
 I have the smallest ones left by hand 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.539
 forgiveness forgiveness masters in masters is 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.280
 good with a shooter let's put something 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.260
 standard no 21 9 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.879
 I recommend putting interwoven spells 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.530
 since it goes pretty well with jeans for 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.530
 increase its damage and then that would be all 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.309
 come on we come to the milestone powers let's go 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.900
 to focus on raising the q because in a 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 mode gives us rank and in the other gives us 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 attack speed after the wy 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.930
 leaving it as a last option 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.370
 Recalling that the ultimate r 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.070
 I will climb each can to 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.930
 levels 6 11 and 16 in summoner spells 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.370
 I recommend this healing me if the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 Support sometimes leads to better healing 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.470
 change barrier or ask you to change 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.470
 exhaustion 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 the items the objectives good the normal 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.070
 with a carry and let's wait is 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.810
 for the door ans a position and the 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.060
 trinket the words in the first bank 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.940
 let's try to have 1550 gold for 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.380
 be able to buy the broadsword zone and if not 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.150
 then share the picacho to see what you 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.160
 purchases and you reach the money so that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.900
 the main thing with jeans is to put together 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.910
 infinity obviously and the static eye 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.340
 Static with your missiles q 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.930
 you can clean a wave of millions 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.030
 with a single hit a zoom on all the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.659
 last sigh sleeves and boots 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.460
 bercy that the rest is situational 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.960
 we came to team fights but now 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.579
 that I will not say anything all are 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.579
 very good so the following 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.330
 who live examples and platinum bronzes 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.349
 hauled let's start we're going to 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.299
 position in the back 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.549
 normally for our rockets 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.010
 launch them and as thanks to the rank we 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.069
 we will keep in very very good place 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.690
 If you have a beach, it will be best to go with 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.150
 the blessing of the elder bus lizard 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.769
 red your damage increases too much the great 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.349
 problem with jeans is the cs that you 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.790
 they can do or a hard focus since they do not 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.140
 you have a lot of mobility unless it's 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.760
 anti passive veto or that kills 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.540
 someone or in the three seconds already the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.129
 you can read no 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.689
 but of course if it is practiced 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.129
 enough or is it really good not 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.530
 you will have problems the truth in 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.700
 position yourself so good remember to use 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.140
 your double there was someone who gave 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.599
 extend that is that it has a very bad 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.129
 position to kill him or start a 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.420
 fight with disadvantage for the team 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.220
 enemy since it will be badly stopped 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.409
 this brother tries to place also 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.849
 traps I kept so that they do not catch you 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.620
 the enemies that come directly to you 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.220
 like the tanks only some killer that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.170
 do not have jump 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.670
 good and this will keep alive the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.720
 it is better to attack with the machine gun with 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.160
 they are near you 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 for your speed so you remember 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.300
 when you are away with your account you are going to 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.400
 have more range will position you better 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.900
 when they are close with your machine gun and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.040
 here is going to give you attack speed and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.110
 if you have life robbery obviously 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.870
 more sustenance 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.480
 we come to the advice with the wise 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.730
 nephew is good I'll read them says 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.140
 so check the map as often as you can and 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.310
 be sure to see if there is someone with 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.650
 little life and throw your skill 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.630
 definitive is also useful to steal 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.420
 ball and dragon you just have to measure and 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.790
 control and perfect damage 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.170
 in fights it can be dangerous to throw 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.910
 the last since in that time you can 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.290
 kill not so better wait for him to run 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.440
 do not be bad, I'll remove chairs in the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.300
 environments 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.740
 remember to practice well the ranges of 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.990
 your different courses to have more 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.630
 controlled the damage and the ranges here well 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.880
 been a thing that I learned very well well 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.920
 interesting is that if you have your 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 active machine gun and four spears 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.910
 attacks you will have your passive activated 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.920
 then you change the rockets and the 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.750
 first missile will come out faster thanks to 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.780
 the passive of the machine gun this is 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.000
 pretty good 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.670
 good in qualifying only the strong 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.420
 of jeans is that it has quite a range 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.390
 pretty hurt besides that with w 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.700
 the two of high rank you can accuse your 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.380
 enemy as he had mentioned his 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.150
 Ying's weakness is his lack of 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.970
 mobility unless your 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.460
 passive then you will be very very weak 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.850
 against champions like final stick set 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.050
 that can jump on you pantion renga 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.820
 but good among more games judges with 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.980
 james and better this positioning better 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.620
 it will be your performance 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.840
 I would recommend three synergistically as 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.910
 with its hook hooks plus two traps 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.710
 making a perfect duo also when 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.320
 comes the great enemy you know the typical 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.820
 the lamp is saved then if the lady 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.970
 it seems used correctly it's going to 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.560
 save life thousands of times 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.569
 supports with sustenance and mobility 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.879
 they are also highly recommended 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.770
 and lastly in phase of lines you must 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.020
 put your enemy to bed without forgetting that the 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.179
 farmer and keep good position is 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.490
 the most important thing remember that ying is 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:09.709
 very easy to be won so eye with 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.529
 vision and you have a lot of advantage against 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.610
 of low range cables that's all 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.349
 I remember that in the coming days 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.599
 the raffles of rps and boxes begin 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:19.159
 mysterious adding as to give 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.619
 mysterious boxes I have to have the 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.800
