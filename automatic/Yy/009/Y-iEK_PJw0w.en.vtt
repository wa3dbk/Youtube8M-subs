we're definitely accepting for that
fight<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.640> don't<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.270> happening

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
in our next fight I think it's a little

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.760 
in our next fight I think it's a little
further<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.049> line<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.580> know<00:01:35.790> as
