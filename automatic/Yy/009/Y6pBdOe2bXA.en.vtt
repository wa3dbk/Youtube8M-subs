 hello everyone with you meshuggah and resource 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.299
 here is that point ru 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.950
 Today we will begin a series of videos about different 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.429
 modifications of world of tanks 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.099
 namely about the modification of the voice of the crew 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.980
 and go to the main page and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.680
 vozvochku voice and we will probably start with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.869
 voice duke nukem I think that very 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 Many old school gamers remember these a 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.820
 hit games 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.890
 well now we will try to see how 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
 does this voice in our 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.090
 familiar tanks and click download 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.460
 free dubbing is downloaded 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.829
 Well, now we move to the game 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.829
 let's hear how it all goes 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.940
 fasten your seat belts go on their Kolda 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.269
 there was a noob 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.269
 Well, all girl shot is no more 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.390
 I feel yours stronger than it was 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.869
 has come 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.869
 saw put on cast from 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.060
 I also have a bad feeling 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 still paid for death and you would have 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:28.649
 got rich 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.649
 We can already go there yet 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:37.260
 there was clearly a mess 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:47.840
 And the day you can see I usually tear my ass 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.840
 not scratching my tongue 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.340
 divorced noobs chuck norris resting oh 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.180
 mute you 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.819
 I like to be on top 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.129
 sumptuously 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.520
 uchi-path big 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.400
 OK, very well 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.370
 the cat nervously smokes in the corner 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.440
 hopefully paas cutting from fights he became 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.879
 I understand about what is the voice from 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.950
 yourself that Iâ€™m just not very good 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.349
 like the sound of a light bulb he is 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.660
 a little drawling and respond to 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.730
 it is possible with a delay of 34 seconds 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.739
 sometimes yours is critical in general 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.750
 voice quality and the only thing 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.549
 lover of masculine ducks it is unlikely 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.120
 like it made of some kind 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.739
 new parts i don't even know what a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.750
 farther wheel I think you all saw 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.269
 scrolling on the gameplay does not affect 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.299
 as well as the voice acting in principle therefore put 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.530
 or to pose and solve purely and you 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.690
 feeling of the game I would not say that 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.430
 it changes about the same 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.019
 what is there but if you are bored 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.880
 You can change the standard voice acting 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.310
 try maybe you will like it more 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.200
 well and then go to the installation and 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.569
 discussing the voice acting itself I would 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.390
 I do not see the point because the gameplay is like 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.700
 already said she does not affect went well what 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.190
 and now let's talk about installing this 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.019
 sound modification downloaded from us 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.000
 arhivchik Desktop 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.150
 open it with a regular conductor and 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.260
 here we have four folders a 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.500
 boot wheel sound of the sixth sense 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.299
 icon for xvm and etix crew voice 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.100
 track that tells us how 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.900
 install if you suddenly get confused but 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.510
 we do not need him we understand ourselves 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.250
 Perhaps we start the boot wheel as 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.799
 from duke nukem headlight you saw him 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.100
 she video now go to daddy 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.750
 clients and ssd and find the client folder 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.120
 world of tanks 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.769
 and go to the folder res-mods find 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.530
 folder current 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.530
 and the current client version is now 090 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.810
 you may have 091 or even 02 may 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.950
 even more and here you are at the very last 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.940
 which you have 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:26.630
 go with me this is 090 a and go in 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.210
 Download Modification Download Folder 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.110
 wheel here we find daddy gu and just 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.950
 move it 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.570
 and in our res-mods folder of tanks is excellent 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.430
 the wheel is already installed to 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.570
 earned you just need to close the client 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.669
 restart and 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.460
 at least we already have a loading wheel 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.770
 well and now to the modification itself and the sound 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.590
 sixth sense icon for sixth 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.180
 feelings of vyksa 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.920
 but I never use it to me 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.050
 really like replaces standard a 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.690
 so here it is she will 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.970
 look but for my taste it is not very 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.790
 Conveniently she pretty faded it can be 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.860
 miss the battles though she 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.750
 quite large but it is not the essence of a well 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.300
 We are interested in two folders with voice acting 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.150
 it is firstly the sound of the sixth sense as its 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.980
 you too he saw such and yes and voice acting 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.010
 the crew itself that is this one here itself 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.260
 modification we will try to transfer that 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.180
 another so as not to show everything by 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.820
 separately but first we need 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.980
 make a small hint and we are in the folder 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.590
 client go to daddy abruptly then 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.610
 there is a resource and copy the folder and here 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.920
 audio 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.940
 and click copy and go back to 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.300
 daddy res-mods 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.000
 and the version of the current patch 090 is repeated and 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.960
 we put it in here fine folder audio 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.300
 it needs to be copied 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.330
 this basis from the current game client 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.480
 and now begin to copy 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.210
 modified 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.980
 the voice acting first comes with the sound of the sixth 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.950
 feelings here as you see three folders 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:56.010
 and copy them from here to daddy 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.160
 current client and agree to everything 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.600
 hell replacements all 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.260
 the voice of the sixth sense we already have 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.900
 now the voice of the crew also copy 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.560
 both folders and insert them into daddy 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.630
 res-mods 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.600
 version of the current patches and again 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.090
 We agree to absolutely all replacements and 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.760
 Deal this for all kits but all here 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.680
 the voice of the remains set and I hope 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.930
 the video you were was helpful with you 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.770
