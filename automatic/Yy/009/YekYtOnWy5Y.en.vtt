00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
today we have three comments that really

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
today we have three comments that really
appeal<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.540> me<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.930> rest<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.559> don't

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
appeal to me the rest of them I don't

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.979 
appeal to me the rest of them I don't
know<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.969> could<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.450> trust<00:00:36.750> them

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
know if I could really trust them

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.330 
know if I could really trust them
because<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.350> sounded<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.770> little<00:00:37.950> bit<00:00:38.160> too

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
because they sounded a little bit too

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.709 
because they sounded a little bit too
far-fetched<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.300> saying<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.600> were

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
far-fetched and I'm not saying they were

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.000 
far-fetched and I'm not saying they were
lying<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.350> were<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.500> little<00:00:40.559> bit<00:00:40.800> hard<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
lying but they were a little bit hard to

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
lying but they were a little bit hard to
believe<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.090> these<00:00:42.329> were<00:00:42.540> them<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.989> ones

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
believe and so these were them the ones

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.569 
believe and so these were them the ones
I<00:00:43.379> believed<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:43.950> least<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> ones<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I believed at least are the ones that

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.180 
I believed at least are the ones that
seem<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> most<00:00:45.300> realistic<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.110> me<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> we're

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
seem the most realistic to me and we're

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.110 
seem the most realistic to me and we're
gonna<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.460> over<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.910> we're<00:00:48.030> gonna
