00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.079
 kilowatt 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.860
 now we will include 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:08.159
 I will build temperature for 200 and stuck it 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.549
 in the box and wait 15 minutes on this 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.549
 bye everyone 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.930

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.900
 so here 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.969
 was 15 minutes 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.969
 will go 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.170
 like that 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.470
 muharram 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.909
 dell 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.880
 this hair dryer stuck a box 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.359
 so it is visible not visible with exhibited 2 180 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.359
 degrees 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.270
 we are all the time 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.660
 I will continue to shoot 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:18.719
 here's the time I already started sharing 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.670
 very good 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:26.379
 I was sweating the spotlight I went to sleep on the plot 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.099
 gel but it didn't help and that way 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:34.980
 she opens everything with one hand not 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.980
 it will be convenient to open without video filming 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:45.489
 Well, so begins to look like headlights 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:54.299
 front of the front where the glass here 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:54.299
 so she looks at me from behind 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.800
 all continue to build 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:12.260
 Well , so here is the headlight with 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.270
 lenses and lamp are installed with this 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.910
 the parties that is , I did it like this 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:24.520
 that I have almost all the astral in place 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:29.740
 all that all that was on the native lamp hb4 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.740
 4 here I can see I'll show side 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:47.950
 flip and thus looks 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:52.990
 the couple itself can only put it 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:58.820
 adjust lighting this one headlight all 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:02.030
 I will finish with one form, but the turn has come 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:07.220
 up to 2 for here it was exactly the same 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:13.000
 ordinary as the previous ones will be 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:16.000
 prodelyvat which is the same as the cost 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 similarly 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:28.820
 Well, the second headlamp I also ready 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:34.600
 it means that's the look so I have it 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:45.310
 It turned out I already inserted 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:46.750
 light bulb light bulb i have my own light bulb 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.460
 hb4 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:57.290
 I have left from the kit 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.200
 so here are the details here they are to me 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:10.870
 just not needed even with rework 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:15.350
 I got everything so clearly everything is not exactly 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.410
 I know how I will be regulated a little 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.230
 I'll take it all off later 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:25.370
 Well, until the result here is a very all 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:29.300
 just very easy to put 300 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:34.100
 degrees 15 minutes split headlight 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:37.160
 very easy just to cheer i'm all this 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.520
 did field conditions this garden here 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.350
 me 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:48.380
 we will cook and so here a little bit 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:51.380
 I'll take off the table outlet so that's all very 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.740
 I just thought it would be harder on 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.600
 really very simple 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.890
 chopsticks prepared for separation to 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.320
 not a screwdriver but such chopsticks 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.650
 shared not to break the glass well here 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.650
 and all 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.590
 looks like this 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.590
 headlights off 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.440
 He looks 1 and 2 on 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:40.400
 let's see how we will shine 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:44.730
 I think that is very good right now 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:50.760
 I'm testing my neighbor now 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:52.880
 It turned out the light with lenses including long-range 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:07:01.880
 but the truth will turn on with halogen komi with 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:05.820
 paired now give me my neighbor again 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:13.370
 here we are so far 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:13.370
 looks like the result of the installation of lenses 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.750
 I think that the result 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.260
 very good 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.260
 but that's all
