00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

what<00:00:00.240> I'm<00:00:00.359> holding<00:00:00.570> here<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.380> prototype

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
what I'm holding here is the prototype

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.190 
what I'm holding here is the prototype
of<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.520> gamma<00:00:02.879> ray<00:00:03.090> spectrometer<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:04.080> our

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
of the gamma ray spectrometer that our

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.160 
of the gamma ray spectrometer that our
group<00:00:04.470> sent<00:00:05.220> on<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.609> messenger<00:00:06.150> mission<00:00:06.930> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
group sent on the messenger mission to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.030 
group sent on the messenger mission to
mercury<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.480> germanium<00:00:10.230> based<00:00:10.650> gamma

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
mercury it is a germanium based gamma

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.560 
mercury it is a germanium based gamma
ray<00:00:11.250> spectrometer<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
ray spectrometer so it's a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.330 
ray spectrometer so it's a
high-resolution<00:00:13.349> gamma<00:00:13.530> ray<00:00:13.679> detector<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
high-resolution gamma ray detector and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.570 
high-resolution gamma ray detector and
the<00:00:15.299> reason<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:16.139> gold-plated<00:00:16.890> that's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the reason that it's gold-plated that's

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.000 
the reason that it's gold-plated that's
polishing<00:00:18.180> gold-plated<00:00:18.810> as<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> act

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
polishing gold-plated as this is to act

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.460 
polishing gold-plated as this is to act
as<00:00:20.189> infrared<00:00:20.730> shielding<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> detector

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
as infrared shielding for the detector

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.609 
as infrared shielding for the detector
because<00:00:23.430> although<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:24.470> technology<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.590> very

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
because although this technology is very

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.460 
because although this technology is very
high<00:00:26.130> resolution<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:27.119> has<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> big<00:00:27.900> drawback

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
high resolution it has the big drawback

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.580 
high resolution it has the big drawback
that<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.980> operate<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.539> run<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.170> minus

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that to operate it has to run at minus

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.490 
that to operate it has to run at minus
200<00:00:32.070> degrees<00:00:32.369> Celsius<00:00:32.480> about<00:00:33.480> minus<00:00:33.809> 330

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
200 degrees Celsius about minus 330

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.720 
200 degrees Celsius about minus 330
Fahrenheit<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:36.770> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> especially

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
Fahrenheit so this is especially

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
Fahrenheit so this is especially
complicated<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.809> mercury<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.649> closest

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
complicated at mercury the closest

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.430 
complicated at mercury the closest
planet<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> Sun<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.780> extremely

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
planet to the Sun because of extremely

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.190 
planet to the Sun because of extremely
harsh<00:00:43.710> thermal<00:00:44.550> environment<00:00:44.820> there<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
harsh thermal environment there and the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.860 
harsh thermal environment there and the
way<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.410> cool<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.480> detector<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.690> such<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
way you cool the detector in such a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.529 
way you cool the detector in such a
harsh<00:00:49.140> thermal<00:00:49.500> environment<00:00:49.910> his<00:00:50.910> first<00:00:51.270> is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
harsh thermal environment his first is

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
harsh thermal environment his first is
to<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.020> lots<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.500> infrared<00:00:52.920> shielding<00:00:53.520> which

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
to have lots of infrared shielding which

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.479 
to have lots of infrared shielding which
reflects<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.140> sun's<00:00:55.440> heat<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.949> reflects<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
reflects the sun's heat and reflects the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.240 
reflects the sun's heat and reflects the
heat<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.140> coming<00:00:58.140> from<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> planet<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
heat off the coming from the planet and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.170 
heat off the coming from the planet and
so<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> highly<00:01:00.719> polished<00:01:01.280> gold<00:01:02.280> plated<00:01:02.699> surface

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
so a highly polished gold plated surface

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
so a highly polished gold plated surface
reflects<00:01:03.780> about<00:01:03.989> ninety-eight<00:01:04.409> percent<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
reflects about ninety-eight percent of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.609 
reflects about ninety-eight percent of
infrared<00:01:05.280> light<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.170> an

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
infrared light so what we have is an

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
infrared light so what we have is an
encapsulation<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.670> our<00:01:08.820> germanium

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
encapsulation with our germanium

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
encapsulation with our germanium
detector<00:01:09.810> inside<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.590> around<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.490> have

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
detector inside and around it we have

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.050 
detector inside and around it we have
several<00:01:12.380> infrared<00:01:13.380> shields<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.909> whole

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
several infrared shields and the whole

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.499 
several infrared shields and the whole
thing<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> suspended<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.460> Kevlar<00:01:17.460> set<00:01:18.390> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
thing is suspended on a Kevlar set of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.070 
thing is suspended on a Kevlar set of
Kevlar<00:01:18.840> fibers<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:20.070> isolate<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.150> mechanically

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
Kevlar fibers to isolate it mechanically

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.800 
Kevlar fibers to isolate it mechanically
from<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> outer<00:01:22.619> hot<00:01:22.950> body<00:01:23.270> we're<00:01:24.270> really

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
from the outer hot body we're really

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.130 
from the outer hot body we're really
getting<00:01:25.619> excited<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.990> instruments<00:01:27.990> been

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
getting excited now the instruments been

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.870 
getting excited now the instruments been
in<00:01:28.229> flight<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.710> nearly<00:01:28.890> seven<00:01:29.340> years<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
in flight for nearly seven years of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
in flight for nearly seven years of
course<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.720> exciting<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.290> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
course it's very exciting when it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.800 
course it's very exciting when it
launched<00:01:32.090> but<00:01:33.090> we've<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.270> sort<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> been

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
launched but we've just sort of been

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.179 
launched but we've just sort of been
waiting<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.350> we've<00:01:34.439> been<00:01:34.560> off<00:01:34.770> doing<00:01:35.130> other

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
waiting and we've been off doing other

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.649 
waiting and we've been off doing other
work<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.390> actually

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
work so now that it's actually

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.200 
work so now that it's actually
approaching<00:01:37.140> orbit<00:01:37.740> approaching<00:01:38.670> turn<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
approaching orbit approaching turn on of

approaching orbit approaching turn on of
the<00:01:39.329> instrument<00:01:39.780> we're<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.049> very<00:01:40.170> excited

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the instrument we're all very excited

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
the instrument we're all very excited
we've<00:01:41.070> been<00:01:41.189> having<00:01:41.460> conference<00:01:41.850> calls<00:01:42.119> we've

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
we've been having conference calls we've

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.480 
we've been having conference calls we've
been<00:01:42.570> reviewing<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.259> plans<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.920> what<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.220> are

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
been reviewing the plans of what we are

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.149 
been reviewing the plans of what we are
going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.570> testing<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.380> evaluation

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
going to do for testing and evaluation

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.700 
going to do for testing and evaluation
and<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.420> yeah<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> pretty

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and so on and so yeah it's a pretty

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.010 
and so on and so yeah it's a pretty
exciting<00:01:50.189> time<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.670> we<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:51.509> definitely<00:01:51.780> all

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
exciting time and we will definitely all

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.260 
exciting time and we will definitely all
rest<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.159> easier<00:01:53.399> once<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
rest a little easier once we see the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.100 
rest a little easier once we see the
first<00:01:54.390> data<00:01:54.720> coming<00:01:54.990> down<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.090> purpose<00:01:57.960> of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
first data coming down so the purpose of

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
first data coming down so the purpose of
having<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.500> gamma<00:01:58.710> ray<00:01:58.829> spectrometer<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.670> this

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
having a gamma ray spectrometer on this

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.350 
having a gamma ray spectrometer on this
NASA<00:02:00.119> mission<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.659> mercury<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
NASA mission at mercury is that the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.080 
NASA mission at mercury is that the
surface<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.600> mercury<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:04.110> highly<00:02:04.500> radioactive

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
surface of mercury is highly radioactive

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.559 
surface of mercury is highly radioactive
it's<00:02:06.090> bombarded<00:02:06.360> by<00:02:06.780> cosmic<00:02:07.350> rays<00:02:07.649> from<00:02:07.890> space

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
it's bombarded by cosmic rays from space

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.059 
it's bombarded by cosmic rays from space
unlike<00:02:09.569> earth<00:02:09.840> mercury<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.530> not<00:02:10.800> protected

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
unlike earth mercury is not protected

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.830 
unlike earth mercury is not protected
from<00:02:11.580> those<00:02:11.730> cosmic<00:02:11.970> rays<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
from those cosmic rays because it

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.730 
from those cosmic rays because it
doesn't<00:02:13.170> have

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
doesn't have

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.740 
doesn't have
a thick<00:02:14.580> atmosphere<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.360> doesn't<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a thick atmosphere and it doesn't have a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.360 
a thick atmosphere and it doesn't have a
strong<00:02:16.050> magnetic<00:02:16.410> field<00:02:16.740> both<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.250> those

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
strong magnetic field both of those

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.760 
strong magnetic field both of those
things<00:02:17.700> which<00:02:17.910> protect<00:02:18.270> Earth<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.260> mercury<00:02:19.680> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
things which protect Earth so mercury is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.310 
things which protect Earth so mercury is
highly<00:02:20.100> radioactive<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> our<00:02:21.600> instrument<00:02:22.170> in

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
highly radioactive so our instrument in

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.400 
highly radioactive so our instrument in
orbit<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.370> detect<00:02:23.730> those<00:02:23.910> gamma<00:02:24.300> rays<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.900> it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
orbit can detect those gamma rays and it

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.370 
orbit can detect those gamma rays and it
turns<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:25.860> gamma<00:02:26.250> rays<00:02:26.460> act<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
turns out that gamma rays act like a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.200 
turns out that gamma rays act like a
fingerprint<00:02:28.380> for<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> elements<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.490> emit

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
fingerprint for the elements that emit

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.970 
fingerprint for the elements that emit
them<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:30.990> measure<00:02:31.170> those<00:02:31.440> gamma

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
them so if you can measure those gamma

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.280 
them so if you can measure those gamma
rays<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.730> high<00:02:32.940> resolution<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:34.080> can

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
rays with high resolution you can

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.670 
rays with high resolution you can
determine<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:35.640> surface<00:02:36.420> composition<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
determine the surface composition of the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.130 
determine the surface composition of the
planet<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.300> important<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.900> help

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
planet and that's very important to help

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.080 
planet and that's very important to help
discriminate<00:02:40.740> between<00:02:40.890> various<00:02:41.460> formation

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
discriminate between various formation

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.360 
discriminate between various formation
theories<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:43.080> help<00:02:43.320> them<00:02:43.530> understand<00:02:44.040> how<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
theories to help them understand how the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.850 
theories to help them understand how the
planet<00:02:44.910> formed<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.540> what<00:02:45.720> its<00:02:46.170> geological

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
planet formed and what its geological

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.760 
planet formed and what its geological
history<00:02:47.400> is
