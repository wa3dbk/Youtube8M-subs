00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
squeezed a little bit of glue onto the
end<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.600> flat<00:01:27.869> surface<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> kind

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
end of the flat surface and then I kind

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.069 
end of the flat surface and then I kind
of<00:01:29.429> paint<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.850> onto<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.240> lashes<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.899> gets

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
of paint it onto the lashes so it gets

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.690 
of paint it onto the lashes so it gets
an<00:01:31.229> even<00:01:31.560> coat<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.549> have

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
an even coat and this way I don't have

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.950 
an even coat and this way I don't have
to<00:01:32.789> worry<00:01:32.999> about<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> glue<00:01:33.329> bubbling<00:01:33.810> or

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to worry about the glue bubbling or

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.300 
to worry about the glue bubbling or
anything<00:01:34.139> like<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.740> super<00:01:35.159> easy

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
anything like that it's just super easy

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.309 
anything like that it's just super easy
once<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.999> glue<00:01:36.149> is<00:01:36.179> tacky<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> apply

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
once the glue is tacky I like to apply

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:39.109 
once the glue is tacky I like to apply
the<00:01:37.439> lashes<00:01:37.770> with<00:01:37.950> tweezers<00:01:38.639> just<00:01:38.850> because

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the lashes with tweezers just because

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.819 
the lashes with tweezers just because
they<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.359> so<00:01:39.479> much<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:39.659> precise<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.469> easier

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
they are so much more precise and easier

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.679 
they are so much more precise and easier
to<00:01:40.889> handle<00:01:41.039> at<00:01:41.700> first<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.630> to

to handle at first you just want to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.419

place<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.020> lashes<00:01:43.380> exactly<00:01:43.920> where<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.219> want

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.300 
them to be and then with your fingers
you<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.289> want<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> press<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.189> the

so that's my super easy technique on how

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.160

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
applying false eyelashes used to take me

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.729 
applying false eyelashes used to take me
so<00:02:23.239> long<00:02:23.510> because<00:02:23.959> I<00:02:24.080> was<00:02:24.170> making<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.560> mess<00:02:24.709> of

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
so long because I was making a mess of

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.470 
so long because I was making a mess of
the<00:02:24.980> band<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:25.430> everything<00:02:25.549> but<00:02:26.030> by<00:02:26.150> cutting

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
the band and everything but by cutting

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.210 
the band and everything but by cutting
the<00:02:26.569> lashes<00:02:26.900> into<00:02:27.140> two<00:02:27.290> pieces<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.920> makes<00:02:27.950> it

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the lashes into two pieces it makes it

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.100 
the lashes into two pieces it makes it
so<00:02:28.370> much<00:02:28.400> easier<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.120> place<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:29.780> move<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
so much easier to place and to move the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.900 
so much easier to place and to move the
lashes<00:02:30.440> around<00:02:30.769> into<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.220> correct<00:02:31.459> decision

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
lashes around into the correct decision

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.640 
lashes around into the correct decision
but<00:02:32.150> anyways<00:02:32.480> that's<00:02:32.690> my<00:02:32.810> video<00:02:33.080> on<00:02:33.440> how<00:02:33.470> to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
but anyways that's my video on how to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.680 
but anyways that's my video on how to
apply<00:02:33.890> false<00:02:34.340> eyelashes<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.269> hopefully<00:02:35.569> you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
apply false eyelashes so hopefully you
