00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
this website it generates a true random

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.800 
this website it generates a true random
number<00:04:07.410> which<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:07.950> completely<00:04:08.580> unfair<00:04:08.810> sorry

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
number which is completely unfair sorry

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.610 
number which is completely unfair sorry
fair<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.470> by<00:04:10.650> unbiased<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.600> we<00:04:13.170> are<00:04:13.320> now

fair and by unbiased and so we are now
going<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:13.980> generate<00:04:14.430> this

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
going to generate this

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.020 
going to generate this
number<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.229> see<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.799> first<00:04:17.070> number<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:17.729> 1
