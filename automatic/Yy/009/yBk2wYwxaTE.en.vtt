00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.799 

so<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.219> first<00:00:42.489> ingredient<00:00:42.699> that<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.269> use<00:00:43.510> is

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
so the first ingredient that I use is

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.389 
so the first ingredient that I use is
brown<00:00:44.079> sugar<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:47.140> is<00:00:47.440> sugar<00:00:47.800> cane<00:00:48.070> sugar

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
brown sugar and this is sugar cane sugar

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.160 
brown sugar and this is sugar cane sugar
so<00:00:48.729> it's<00:00:48.909> not<00:00:49.030> white<00:00:49.300> sugar<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.839> has<00:00:49.989> been

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
so it's not white sugar that has been

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.630 
so it's not white sugar that has been
coated<00:00:50.379> with<00:00:50.800> molasses<00:00:51.399> the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640
