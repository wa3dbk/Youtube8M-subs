00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.519
 you wanted it 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.530
 welcome to this video during which we will discover 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.749
 freedom here 4 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.329
 it is a universal charger that allows you to recharge most 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.500
 devices from our everyday smartphone to mp3 player going through 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.119
 your portable game console title psp or mittens ds 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.279
 the idea that it's just to avoid burying cables for high 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.300
 point all in one and the same device 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.200
 the date is so composed a base that will accommodate different 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.870
 taken 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.530
 different adapters that will make it compatible with most devices 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.470
 we have 33 others micro and mini USB and priority card 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.840
 call and that of sam submitted and the case for example 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.480
 this adapter without its fronts and three slots on the top 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.470
 of the Eid Ap 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.510
 once the device is plugged in 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.050
 all that remains is to choose those that correspond to the devices that we 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.250
 wants to change 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.300
 in our case we have a crazy mail a hands-free kit and an mp3 player 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.600
 for the first two I only have to use the special adapter call and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.260
 the micro usb 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.970
 by cons there is no adapter that is compatible with - belfry 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.680
 in this case we can simply not use the usb cable that allows the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.280
 connect to the pc and plug directly into the socket the Iberian integrates 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.130
 adapt it on the side 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.050
 to launch the load is then sufficient action of farmers what has for 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.830
 effect of lighting up lights that will turn green once the charge 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.080
 completed even though I realized that it was not necessarily the case with 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.350
 all the devices I tested with and of course not with 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.790
 the device you plug in usb since there is no help at all 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.500
 for this port 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.860
 So here is the date, it's sort of the power strip of chargers in 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.830
 the same spirit it was believed that the first wireless charging system 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.140
 to impose 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.810
 but in the end since most of the time you have to buy a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.990
 adapter because the batteries are not necessarily compatible 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.189
 it does not really make sense what makes a device like freedom to 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130
 less equally credible and practical
