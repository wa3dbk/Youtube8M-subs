different routes two worlds four and
three<00:01:03.020> so<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.500> can<00:01:03.710> kind<00:01:03.890> of<00:01:03.949> take<00:01:04.100> shortcuts

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
three so you can kind of take shortcuts

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.890 
three so you can kind of take shortcuts
and<00:01:04.789> bypass<00:01:05.180> things<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:08.150> then<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:08.750> is

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
and bypass things and then this is

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.090 
and bypass things and then this is
inside<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.260> world<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:09.590> this<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:09.830> your<00:01:09.920> level

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
inside the world so this is your level

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.679 
inside the world so this is your level
map<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.549> can<00:01:10.760> see<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:10.909> this<00:01:11.150> level<00:01:11.479> here

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
map and you can see that this level here

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.130 
map and you can see that this level here
as<00:01:12.619> you<00:01:13.130> can<00:01:13.280> get<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.460> two<00:01:13.700> levels<00:01:14.060> from<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.390> so

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
as you can get to two levels from it so

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.270 
as you can get to two levels from it so
when<00:01:15.260> you've<00:01:15.380> obviously<00:01:15.560> first<00:01:15.950> start<00:01:16.159> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
when you've obviously first start the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.910 
when you've obviously first start the
game<00:01:16.400> these<00:01:17.000> paths<00:01:17.360> are<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:17.930> here<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.470> you

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
game these paths are in here and you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.850 
game these paths are in here and you
have<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.159> work<00:01:19.310> out<00:01:19.520> how<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.299> work<00:01:20.810> out<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.770> get

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
have to work out how to work out to get

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.399 
have to work out how to work out to get
the<00:01:21.979> joints<00:01:22.340> between<00:01:22.580> each<00:01:22.850> level<00:01:23.290> so<00:01:24.290> we're

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
the joints between each level so we're

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.660 
the joints between each level so we're
very<00:01:24.439> influenced<00:01:24.920> by<00:01:25.009> Superman<00:01:25.369> yoga

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670

learn how to play the game and I find

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.319 
learn how to play the game and I find
the<00:01:40.369> tutorials<00:01:40.850> if<00:01:40.939> you're<00:01:41.060> constantly

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
the tutorials if you're constantly

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.730 
the tutorials if you're constantly
popping<00:01:41.509> up<00:01:41.720> messages<00:01:42.079> and<00:01:42.229> have<00:01:42.350> some<00:01:42.500> people

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
popping up messages and have some people

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.420 
popping up messages and have some people
that<00:01:42.770> can<00:01:43.070> become<00:01:43.520> quite<00:01:43.909> frustrating<00:01:44.420> so

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
that can become quite frustrating so

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.219 
that can become quite frustrating so
this<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.000> simplest<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:49.130> can<00:01:49.280> kind<00:01:49.490> of

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
this is the simplest you can kind of

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.780 
this is the simplest you can kind of
really<00:01:51.229> break<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.860> game<00:01:51.979> down<00:01:52.250> into<00:01:52.520> all

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
really break the game down into all

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.370 
really break the game down into all
you've<00:01:53.030> got<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.210> do<00:01:53.360> is<00:01:53.450> go<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.840> foresight

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
you've got to do is go to the foresight

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.690 
you've got to do is go to the foresight
of<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:55.310> cell<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:55.820> then<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:57.560> exit<00:01:57.979> appears

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
of the cell and then the exit appears

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.030 
of the cell and then the exit appears
and<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.450> can<00:01:59.630> move<00:01:59.719> out<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.990> exit<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:00.829> that's

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
and you can move out the exit so that's

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.069 
and you can move out the exit so that's
the<00:02:01.189> general<00:02:01.520> rules<00:02:01.909> for<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.180> game<00:02:02.210> levels

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
the general rules for the game levels

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.899 
the general rules for the game levels
will<00:02:03.200> have<00:02:03.350> more<00:02:03.619> many<00:02:03.920> more<00:02:04.009> cells<00:02:04.430> than<00:02:04.700> just

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
will have more many more cells than just

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.160 
will have more many more cells than just
one<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.360> there's<00:02:05.780> going<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:05.960> be<00:02:06.020> enemies

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
one and there's going to be enemies

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.720 
one and there's going to be enemies
another

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
another

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:13.280 
another
carrying<00:02:07.030> sobs<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.420> better<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:07.900> introduced

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.830 

so<00:02:14.290> we'll<00:02:14.470> skip<00:02:14.590> ahead<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.100> couple<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.610> words

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
so we'll skip ahead a couple of words

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.640 
so we'll skip ahead a couple of words
I'll<00:02:16.840> explain<00:02:17.380> some<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.830> game<00:02:18.520> mechanics

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
I'll explain some of the game mechanics

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.810 
I'll explain some of the game mechanics
so<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:20.860> we've<00:02:20.980> got<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
so what we've got here is this is the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.330 
so what we've got here is this is the
score<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.230> your<00:02:23.350> juice<00:02:23.560> bar<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.010> starts

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
score this is your juice bar it starts

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.220 
score this is your juice bar it starts
the<00:02:24.430> game<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.700> don't<00:02:24.850> have<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.300> as<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.990> play

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
the game you don't have this as you play

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
the game you don't have this as you play
you<00:02:26.530> unlock<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.040> then<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.430> unlock

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
you unlock it and then you unlock

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.250 
you unlock it and then you unlock
subsequent<00:02:28.240> chunks<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.870> can<00:02:28.990> see<00:02:29.140> this

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
subsequent chunks so you can see this

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.760 
subsequent chunks so you can see this
chunk<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:30.580> still<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.180> lot<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.020> these<00:02:32.710> are

chunk here is still a lot and these are

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.100 
chunk here is still a lot and these are
your<00:02:32.890> detonation<00:02:33.520> pips<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.240> again<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.930> start

first is you have to build up a
detonation<00:02:47.260> pit<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.860> do<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.130> if<00:02:48.370> you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
detonation pit and to do that if you

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.300 
detonation pit and to do that if you
drive<00:02:48.760> around<00:02:48.970> or<00:02:49.840> move<00:02:50.170> right<00:02:50.380> other<00:02:50.590> I'm<00:02:51.010> the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
four sides of of any sale then this is

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.130 
four sides of of any sale then this is
now<00:02:54.430> filled<00:02:54.820> up<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.240> I've<00:02:55.600> now<00:02:55.750> got<00:02:55.960> one

now filled up and I've now got one
destination<00:02:56.530> pit<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.370> that's<00:02:57.550> going<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.820> allow

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
destination pit so that's going to allow

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.020 
destination pit so that's going to allow
me<00:02:58.240> to<00:02:58.290> move<00:02:59.290> towards<00:02:59.680> M<00:02:59.860> save<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.460> enemy<00:03:00.820> and

me to move towards M save this enemy and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.210 
me to move towards M save this enemy and
I<00:03:01.390> press<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.810> two<00:03:01.960> bottom<00:03:02.110> its<00:03:02.740> first<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.070> I

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
I press the two bottom its first and I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.180 
I press the two bottom its first and I
sharply<00:03:03.670> destroys<00:03:04.480> those<00:03:04.660> enemies<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.590> also

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
sharply destroys those enemies and also

sharply destroys those enemies and also
fills<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.030> cells<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:08.200> you've<00:03:08.560> got<00:03:08.590> a

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
fills in this cells so you've got a

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.500 
fills in this cells so you've got a

decision making process to go because if

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.360 
decision making process to go because if
you<00:03:10.630> want<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.870> get<00:03:10.959> high<00:03:11.170> score<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:12.040> best<00:03:12.220> way

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
you want to get high score the best way

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.340 
you want to get high score the best way
to<00:03:12.430> get<00:03:12.580> high<00:03:12.760> score<00:03:13.090> is<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.390> detonate<00:03:13.840> several

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
to get high score is to detonate several

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.380 
to get high score is to detonate several
cells<00:03:14.620> at<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:14.950> same<00:03:15.160> time<00:03:15.400> because<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.209> more

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
cells at the same time because the more

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.449 
cells at the same time because the more
cells<00:03:16.660> that<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:17.470> do<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.770> with<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.250> higher

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
cells that you do that with the higher

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.470 
cells that you do that with the higher
the<00:03:18.670> score<00:03:18.760> does<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.600> make<00:03:19.780> sense<00:03:19.810> cool<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
the score does that make sense cool and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.910 
the score does that make sense cool and
if<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.780> finish<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.080> level<00:03:23.290> without<00:03:23.620> using

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
if you finish a level without using

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.040 
if you finish a level without using
dad's<00:03:24.190> need<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.489> talk<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.239> problems<00:03:25.720> that

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
dad's need to talk to you problems that

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.810 
dad's need to talk to you problems that
wasn't<00:03:26.260> very<00:03:26.290> clever<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.370> finish<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> level

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
wasn't very clever if you finish a level

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.670 
wasn't very clever if you finish a level
without<00:03:28.150> using<00:03:28.600> definite<00:03:29.020> at<00:03:29.110> all<00:03:29.260> then

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
without using definite at all then

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.540 
without using definite at all then
you'll<00:03:30.160> get<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.670> star<00:03:31.000> on<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.510> maximum<00:03:32.550> plan

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
you'll get the star on the maximum plan

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.970 
you'll get the star on the maximum plan
you'll<00:03:33.730> get<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> highest<00:03:34.120> combination<00:03:35.020> or

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
you'll get the highest combination or

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.580 
you'll get the highest combination or
just<00:03:36.940> filled<00:03:37.239> sale<00:03:37.540> because<00:03:38.019> they<00:03:38.260> basically

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
just filled sale because they basically

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.030 
just filled sale because they basically
all<00:03:38.800> will<00:03:39.040> fill<00:03:39.400> up<00:03:39.430> at<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.760> same<00:03:39.909> time<00:03:40.120> okay

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
all will fill up at the same time okay

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.350 
all will fill up at the same time okay
cool<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.400> I'm<00:03:42.670> just<00:03:42.819> going<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.000> jump<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.269> little

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
cool so I'm just going to jump a little

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.970 
cool so I'm just going to jump a little
bit<00:03:43.569> further<00:03:43.750> ahead<00:03:43.989> soon<00:03:44.409> as<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.590> died<00:03:44.739> another

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
bit further ahead soon as I died another

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.930 
bit further ahead soon as I died another
one<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:46.209> show<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:48.310> let's<00:03:48.340> go<00:03:48.730> back<00:03:48.909> to

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
one and show you so let's go back to

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.589 
one and show you so let's go back to
this<00:03:49.269> one<00:03:49.480> here<00:03:50.849> you<00:03:51.849> can<00:03:52.030> see<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.299> medals

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
this one here you can see the medals

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.030 
this one here you can see the medals
that<00:03:52.720> you've<00:03:52.870> got<00:03:53.049> there<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.799> can<00:03:53.920> see

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
that you've got there and you can see

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.770 
that you've got there and you can see
your<00:03:54.160> bronze<00:03:54.400> silver<00:03:54.730> gold<00:03:54.849> and<00:03:55.299> then<00:03:55.629> this

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
your bronze silver gold and then this

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.820 
your bronze silver gold and then this
would<00:03:55.930> be<00:03:56.019> platinum<00:03:56.230> but<00:03:56.500> we've<00:03:56.709> obviously

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
would be platinum but we've obviously

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.470 
would be platinum but we've obviously
not<00:03:57.160> managed<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.489> do<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.700> bottom<00:03:58.030> level<00:03:58.209> this

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
not managed to do the bottom level this

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.670 
not managed to do the bottom level this
level<00:03:58.750> yet<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.930> level<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.349> where<00:04:02.530> you

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
level yet so this level is where you

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.500 
level yet so this level is where you
would<00:04:02.799> first<00:04:03.010> on<00:04:03.220> lock<00:04:03.400> boosts<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:04.390> can

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
would first on lock boosts you can

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.610 
would first on lock boosts you can
obviously<00:04:04.629> want<00:04:05.019> you<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.200> unlock<00:04:05.409> the

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
obviously want you to unlock the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.809 
obviously want you to unlock the
abilities<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.069> come<00:04:06.220> back<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.519> use<00:04:06.640> them<00:04:06.760> in

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
abilities and come back and use them in

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.339 
abilities and come back and use them in
any<00:04:06.940> level<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:07.780> that's<00:04:07.870> actually<00:04:08.230> how<00:04:08.290> you

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
any level and that's actually how you

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.199 
any level and that's actually how you
need<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.190> do<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:09.819> can<00:04:10.000> get<00:04:10.120> the

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
need to do that so that you can get the

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.330 
need to do that so that you can get the
platinum<00:04:10.660> metals<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.140> all<00:04:11.230> others<00:04:11.709> so<00:04:12.250> you

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
platinum metals and all others so you

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.009 
platinum metals and all others so you
can<00:04:12.489> see<00:04:12.640> here<00:04:12.879> we've<00:04:13.060> got<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.299> patrols<00:04:13.720> and

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
can see here we've got the patrols and

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.599 
can see here we've got the patrols and
they<00:04:14.410> are<00:04:14.500> patrolling<00:04:14.829> up<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.160> down<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.519> I'm

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
they are patrolling up and down and I'm

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.939 
they are patrolling up and down and I'm
going<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.819> have<00:04:15.970> to<00:04:16.000> use<00:04:16.299> my<00:04:16.570> list<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.829> be

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
going to have to use my list and to be

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.520 
going to have to use my list and to be
able<00:04:18.039> to<00:04:18.250> properly<00:04:18.549> get<00:04:18.820> down<00:04:19.229> these<00:04:20.229> paths

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
able to properly get down these paths

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:21.629 
able to properly get down these paths
because<00:04:20.769> they're<00:04:21.010> going<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.250> start<00:04:21.370> chasing

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
because they're going to start chasing

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.490 
because they're going to start chasing
me<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.150> if<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.780> don't<00:04:22.930> know<00:04:22.990> if<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.139> noticed

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
me and if I don't know if you noticed

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.210 
me and if I don't know if you noticed
but<00:04:23.560> when<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:23.979> go<00:04:24.130> in<00:04:24.250> front<00:04:24.460> of<00:04:24.610> an<00:04:24.699> enemy<00:04:26.220> they

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
but when I go in front of an enemy they

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.340 
but when I go in front of an enemy they
turn<00:04:27.460> red<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.060> will<00:04:28.510> speed<00:04:28.900> up<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.169> start

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
turn red and will speed up and start

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.830 
turn red and will speed up and start
chasing<00:04:29.500> me<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:29.919> actually<00:04:30.310> quite<00:04:30.520> quick<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:31.780> I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
chasing me so actually quite quick so I

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.080 
chasing me so actually quite quick so I
was<00:04:31.990> quickly<00:04:32.199> go<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.530> this<00:04:32.650> lovely<00:04:32.860> how<00:04:33.850> am<00:04:33.970> I

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
was quickly go to this lovely how am I

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.670 
was quickly go to this lovely how am I
just<00:04:34.300> rather<00:04:34.750> than<00:04:34.900> clicking<00:04:35.080> am<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.470> just

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
just rather than clicking am I just

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.920 
just rather than clicking am I just
don't<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:35.979> I<00:04:36.400> just<00:04:36.699> go<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:39.580> some<00:04:39.729> other<00:04:39.789> levels

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.379 

so<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:44.139> level<00:04:44.500> introduces<00:04:45.039> us<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.210> an<00:04:46.210> enemy

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
so this level introduces us to an enemy

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.029 
so this level introduces us to an enemy
called<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.870> interceptor<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:47.470> he's<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.800> lot

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
called the interceptor and he's a lot

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.760 
called the interceptor and he's a lot
smarter<00:04:48.490> than<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.389> patrols<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.349> when<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.530> go

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
smarter than the patrols so when I go

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.920 
smarter than the patrols so when I go
through<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:51.700> gate<00:04:51.760> he's<00:04:52.389> going<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.690> spawn

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
through this gate he's going to spawn

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.379 
through this gate he's going to spawn
and<00:04:53.500> he's<00:04:53.680> going<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.950> start<00:04:54.070> chasing<00:04:54.340> me<00:04:54.639> which

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
and he's going to start chasing me which

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.010 
and he's going to start chasing me which
because<00:04:55.750> I'm<00:04:55.900> talking<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.440> destroyed

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
because I'm talking and destroyed

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.129 
because I'm talking and destroyed

there you and so they're they're
probably<00:05:42.289> more<00:05:42.620> small<00:05:42.919> vicious<00:05:43.159> enemies

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
probably more small vicious enemies

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.529 
probably more small vicious enemies
because<00:05:43.699> they're<00:05:43.819> smart<00:05:44.090> they<00:05:44.240> know<00:05:44.270> where

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539

down to the lobby however their

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.180 
down to the lobby however their
weaknesses<00:05:47.449> they<00:05:47.630> can<00:05:47.750> only<00:05:47.870> turn<00:05:48.139> 10<00:05:48.830> times

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
weaknesses they can only turn 10 times

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.459 
weaknesses they can only turn 10 times
and<00:05:49.639> once<00:05:50.150> they<00:05:50.300> turn<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.719> 10th<00:05:50.930> time<00:05:51.199> they'll

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
and once they turn to 10th time they'll

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.620 
and once they turn to 10th time they'll
destroy<00:05:51.830> themselves<00:05:52.069> and<00:05:52.610> then<00:05:53.060> they'll

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
destroy themselves and then they'll

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.240 
destroy themselves and then they'll
respond<00:05:54.020> later<00:05:54.229> so<00:05:54.710> if<00:05:54.770> you<00:05:54.860> can<00:05:54.979> stay<00:05:55.129> ahead

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
respond later so if you can stay ahead

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.680 
respond later so if you can stay ahead
of<00:05:55.370> them<00:05:55.550> for<00:05:55.729> those<00:05:55.819> 10<00:05:56.000> turns<00:05:56.330> then<00:05:56.539> you're

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
of them for those 10 turns then you're

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.490 
of them for those 10 turns then you're
going<00:05:56.810> to<00:05:56.900> survive<00:05:59.080> so<00:06:00.080> I'll<00:06:00.169> jump<00:06:00.349> higher

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
going to survive so I'll jump higher

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.230 
going to survive so I'll jump higher
discography<00:06:01.389> I'm<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.449> voice<00:06:02.719> mode<00:06:04.690> let's<00:06:05.690> jump

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
discography I'm a voice mode let's jump

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.050 
discography I'm a voice mode let's jump
to<00:06:07.389> you<00:06:07.740> so<00:06:08.740> then<00:06:08.919> so<00:06:09.310> basically<00:06:09.669> what<00:06:09.910> we've

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
to you so then so basically what we've

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.580 
to you so then so basically what we've
done<00:06:10.150> has<00:06:10.360> been<00:06:10.389> been<00:06:10.840> inspired<00:06:11.169> by<00:06:11.259> games

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
done has been been inspired by games

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.339 
done has been been inspired by games
like<00:06:11.740> portal<00:06:12.130> where<00:06:12.699> you<00:06:13.330> they<00:06:13.870> introduce<00:06:14.259> the

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
like portal where you they introduce the

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:15.930 
like portal where you they introduce the
mechanic<00:06:14.740> slowly<00:06:15.009> and<00:06:15.220> then<00:06:15.370> start<00:06:15.639> to<00:06:15.759> layer

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
mechanic slowly and then start to layer

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.760 
mechanic slowly and then start to layer
them<00:06:16.120> together<00:06:16.300> so<00:06:16.990> this<00:06:17.259> is<00:06:17.289> kind<00:06:17.590> of<00:06:17.620> what

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
them together so this is kind of what

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.670 
them together so this is kind of what
we're<00:06:17.919> doing<00:06:17.949> here<00:06:18.310> you<00:06:18.490> should<00:06:18.669> see<00:06:19.500> in<00:06:20.500> this

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
we're doing here you should see in this

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.200 
we're doing here you should see in this
puzzle<00:06:20.949> actually<00:06:21.400> notice<00:06:21.699> levels<00:06:22.030> have

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
puzzle actually notice levels have

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.790 
puzzle actually notice levels have
enemies<00:06:22.539> in<00:06:22.660> it<00:06:22.750> this<00:06:23.080> Bible<00:06:23.410> introduced<00:06:23.680> the

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
enemies in it this Bible introduced the

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.860 
enemies in it this Bible introduced the
concept<00:06:23.919> of<00:06:24.220> gates<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:24.669> phantoms<00:06:25.030> again<00:06:25.240> and

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
concept of gates and phantoms again and

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.260 
concept of gates and phantoms again and
then<00:06:26.080> we've<00:06:26.740> layered<00:06:26.949> it<00:06:27.160> together<00:06:27.430> so<00:06:28.000> what

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
then we've layered it together so what

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.689 
then we've layered it together so what
happens<00:06:28.690> here<00:06:28.780> I'll<00:06:29.380> just<00:06:29.919> zoom<00:06:30.370> around<00:06:32.699> I'm

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
happens here I'll just zoom around I'm

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.839 
happens here I'll just zoom around I'm
now<00:06:34.030> going<00:06:34.479> to<00:06:34.710> hit<00:06:35.710> a<00:06:35.919> switch<00:06:36.190> which<00:06:36.610> is<00:06:36.729> going

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
now going to hit a switch which is going

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:37.770 
now going to hit a switch which is going
to<00:06:36.970> spawn<00:06:37.150> another<00:06:37.270> one<00:06:37.569> of<00:06:37.660> these

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
to spawn another one of these

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.490 
to spawn another one of these
interceptors<00:06:38.470> and<00:06:39.870> he's<00:06:40.870> now<00:06:41.050> going<00:06:41.229> to<00:06:41.349> chase

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
interceptors and he's now going to chase

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.589 
interceptors and he's now going to chase
me<00:06:41.740> so<00:06:42.190> the<00:06:42.280> best<00:06:42.460> tactic<00:06:42.880> to<00:06:42.970> win<00:06:43.090> this<00:06:43.240> level

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
me so the best tactic to win this level

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.420 
me so the best tactic to win this level
is<00:06:43.750> actually<00:06:44.080> to<00:06:44.169> try<00:06:44.409> and<00:06:44.590> complete<00:06:45.069> as<00:06:45.280> many

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
is actually to try and complete as many

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.640 
is actually to try and complete as many
of<00:06:45.639> these<00:06:45.759> cells<00:06:46.120> as<00:06:46.300> possible<00:06:46.810> before<00:06:47.440> you

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
of these cells as possible before you

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.999 
of these cells as possible before you
get<00:06:47.860> to<00:06:48.340> the<00:06:48.370> Interceptor<00:06:49.319> or<00:06:50.319> do<00:06:50.530> I<00:06:50.560> just<00:06:50.889> did

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009 
get to the Interceptor or do I just did

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.140 
get to the Interceptor or do I just did
there<00:06:51.159> and<00:06:51.460> managed<00:06:51.669> to<00:06:51.699> trick<00:06:51.970> them<00:06:52.090> into

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
there and managed to trick them into

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.920 
there and managed to trick them into
hitting<00:06:52.659> that<00:06:52.840> electric<00:06:53.289> fence<00:06:54.599> so<00:06:55.599> it<00:06:55.750> kind

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
hitting that electric fence so it kind

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.360 
hitting that electric fence so it kind
of<00:06:55.960> gets<00:06:56.050> more<00:06:56.289> complex<00:06:56.620> you'll<00:06:56.860> have<00:06:57.009> levels

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
of gets more complex you'll have levels

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.059 
of gets more complex you'll have levels
apartment<00:06:57.849> unless<00:06:58.060> John<00:06:58.500> one<00:06:59.500> last<00:06:59.740> I<00:06:59.860> what<00:07:00.039> I

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:00.069 
apartment unless John one last I what I

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:10.769 
apartment unless John one last I what I
don't<00:07:00.280> really<00:07:00.400> far<00:07:00.669> ahead

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779 

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:13.149
