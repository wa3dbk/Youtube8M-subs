00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.550
 MAK OS x on a windows pc and although the requests pile up so slowly 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.010
 how does that work and percent you can do there tutorial 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.230
 how it works is ever so expensive as 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.529
 in YouTube 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.249
 how to throw he was wrong 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:26.789
 and around 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.109
 any other videos the judges could move in if you want to know 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.750
 how it works 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.640
 on the topic you can because you do this year No Konieczny 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.250
 I do not want to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.660
 I thought so back then 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.540
 presented differently 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 I just wanted to show with this video that you can do it 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.690
 and not 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.300
 yes, build in everyone with a decent Mac 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.380
 what do I get from that 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.810
 I have my Mac I have my Mac Book 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.680
 and there I do not need to um in the us-band REM with percent ridiculous 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.730
 Components that do not really work with this operating system 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.260
 that starts with the one with the Kadeer 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.590
 I would have to compete for Crowe now 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.469
 that have three visit network card is not working properly Dr and what 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.740
 I know something 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.560
 so 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.210
 how does this help me 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.680
 if I want something like that 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.620
 then and I can watch my purse I can afford that if 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.260
 not not then 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.330
 But from when you think of Skibbe Maori ever properly through 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.620
 expects 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.970
 there are 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.550
 tons of offer on the PC very much if I now buy new PC with monitor 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.350
 and what do I know what I am also twelve 1300 Euro going on 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800
 I can do that in the Mac pro Colonia 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480
 and percent 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.650
 that I'm completely into it 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.870
 why I need a cheap Windows notebook then has to get more where 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.999
 then the components do not match up 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.929
 So I would say keep away from it 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.909
 down who is anyway 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.879
 already asks and how does that work there Oreal I want 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.539
 anyway, to let the fingers of it 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.269
 because then he has 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.629
 Definitely not aware of what we have to do there 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.389
 Source I hope 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:36.319
 it has you so we are the ones who asked 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.559
 times 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:43.119
 shown in a little different Pilic angle as you see the whole thing sometimes different 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.629
 can Dr then percent 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.769
 all that glitters is not gold 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.480
 Dog I'm out of here now they were in 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.979
