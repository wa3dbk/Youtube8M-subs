00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
just plant hundreds of them just scatter

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.769 
just plant hundreds of them just scatter
your<00:00:19.560> seed<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.240> poppy<00:00:21.240> seeds<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> row<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
your seed like poppy seeds on a row and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.359 
your seed like poppy seeds on a row and
again<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.990> little<00:00:25.289> time<00:00:25.529> consuming<00:00:26.010> but<00:00:28.160> if<00:00:29.160> you

only have one or two heat mats to get
your<00:00:31.680> seeds<00:00:31.920> started<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> good<00:00:33.300> way<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
six-packs I did to drill holes in them I

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.130 
six-packs I did to drill holes in them I
always<00:00:47.519> drill<00:00:47.729> them<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.150> couple<00:00:48.720> holes<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
but you stack them out there potting

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.200 
but you stack them out there potting
soil<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.710> these<00:00:58.710> will<00:00:59.040> be<00:01:01.699> these<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:02.909> be<00:01:03.030> all

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
soil and these will be these will be all

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
soil and these will be these will be all
clumped<00:01:03.659> together<00:01:03.750> I'll<00:01:04.350> root<00:01:04.769> rooted

a<00:05:19.659> greenhouse<00:05:20.280> friend<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.370> Mines<00:05:21.630> daughter

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
a greenhouse friend of Mines daughter

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.089 
a greenhouse friend of Mines daughter
puts<00:05:24.639> a<00:05:24.820> blanket<00:05:25.180> over<00:05:25.599> her<00:05:26.080> greenhouse<00:05:26.770> and

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
puts a blanket over her greenhouse and

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.860 
puts a blanket over her greenhouse and
has<00:05:27.250> been<00:05:27.490> doing<00:05:27.669> so<00:05:27.940> for<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.150> long<00:05:28.330> time<00:05:28.630> and

has had great results with it so that
helps<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.460> heat<00:05:33.699> loss<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.599> throw<00:05:34.990> something

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
helps the heat loss so throw something

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.770 
helps the heat loss so throw something
over<00:05:35.500> it<00:05:35.710> I'm<00:05:35.860> gonna<00:05:36.010> put<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.220> tarp<00:05:36.610> over<00:05:36.789> it<00:05:36.940> but

over it I'm gonna put a tarp over it but

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.390 
over it I'm gonna put a tarp over it but
anyway<00:05:37.990> there's<00:05:38.200> some<00:05:38.409> six<00:05:38.620> packs<00:05:38.889> that<00:05:39.039> I<00:05:39.159> did

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
anyway there's some six packs that I did

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.070 
anyway there's some six packs that I did
that<00:05:39.760> are<00:05:39.880> standing<00:05:40.300> up<00:05:40.419> real<00:05:40.630> nice

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
that are standing up real nice

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.830 
that are standing up real nice
I<00:05:41.199> need<00:05:41.979> to<00:05:42.189> tomorrow<00:05:42.939> I<00:05:43.090> don't<00:05:43.360> want<00:05:43.599> to<00:05:43.659> water

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
I need to tomorrow I don't want to water

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.330 
I need to tomorrow I don't want to water
them<00:05:44.080> right<00:05:44.500> now<00:05:44.710> because<00:05:46.199> if<00:05:47.199> it<00:05:47.530> does<00:05:47.740> get<00:05:48.069> to

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
them right now because if it does get to

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.159 
them right now because if it does get to
freezing<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.300> I<00:05:49.360> don't<00:05:49.509> think<00:05:49.719> it<00:05:49.840> will<00:05:49.960> with

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
freezing and I don't think it will with

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.450 
freezing and I don't think it will with
a<00:05:50.199> heat<00:05:50.409> lamp<00:05:50.439> in<00:05:50.770> here<00:05:50.919> but<00:05:51.039> if<00:05:51.129> it<00:05:51.250> does

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
a heat lamp in here but if it does

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.969 
a heat lamp in here but if it does
plants<00:05:54.460> seedlings<00:05:55.090> that<00:05:55.180> are<00:05:55.830> hydrated<00:05:56.830> that

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
plants seedlings that are hydrated that

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.790 
plants seedlings that are hydrated that
are<00:05:57.159> well<00:05:57.430> hydrated<00:05:57.729> will<00:05:58.659> do<00:05:58.840> worse<00:05:59.080> because

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
are well hydrated will do worse because

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.330 
are well hydrated will do worse because
the<00:06:00.280> cells<00:06:01.150> explode<00:06:01.719> inside<00:06:02.620> them<00:06:02.949> you<00:06:03.219> know

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
the cells explode inside them you know

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.760 
the cells explode inside them you know
if<00:06:03.400> they're<00:06:03.580> really<00:06:04.060> full<00:06:04.300> of<00:06:04.330> water<00:06:04.629> so

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
if they're really full of water so

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.080 
if they're really full of water so
trying<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:05.889> let<00:06:06.039> these<00:06:06.189> dry<00:06:06.430> out<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.639> little<00:06:06.879> bit

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
trying to let these dry out a little bit

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.159 
trying to let these dry out a little bit

the heat lamp tonight let's get only go
down<00:07:04.270> 32<00:07:04.839> if<00:07:05.050> I<00:07:05.139> can<00:07:05.229> trap<00:07:05.409> some<00:07:05.440> of<00:07:05.680> the<00:07:05.740> heat

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
down 32 if I can trap some of the heat
