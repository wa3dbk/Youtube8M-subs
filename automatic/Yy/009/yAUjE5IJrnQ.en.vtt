keyboard it may seem a little bit

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.630 
keyboard it may seem a little bit
strange<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.590> first<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.130> definitely<00:01:44.369> got

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
strange at first but I definitely got

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
strange at first but I definitely got
used<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.570> enjoying<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.290> so

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
just give us an idea of how this types I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
just give us an idea of how this types I
did<00:01:49.020> notice<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:49.619> typing<00:01:49.950> speed<00:01:50.220> was

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
did notice that my typing speed was

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670 
did notice that my typing speed was
about<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> same<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.810> did<00:01:52.049> find<00:01:52.259> myself<00:01:52.409> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
about the same but I did find myself to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.170 
about the same but I did find myself to
be<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.189> more<00:01:53.369> accurate<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> keys

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
be a little bit more accurate the keys

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.749 
be a little bit more accurate the keys
overall<00:01:54.689> feel<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.259> nice<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
overall feel really nice and and of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.039 
overall feel really nice and and of
course<00:01:57.000> even<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> design<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
course even with the design and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.080 
course even with the design and
functionality<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.860> mind<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.369> most<00:01:59.579> important

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
functionality in mind the most important

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.850 
functionality in mind the most important
thing<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> keyboard<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.680> can

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
thing about the keyboard is how it can

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.319 
thing about the keyboard is how it can
type<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.399> how<00:02:02.520> good<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.759> feels<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.180> your<00:02:03.210> hand

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
type and how good it feels in your hand

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.389 
type and how good it feels in your hand
so<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.350> say<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.619> overall<00:02:04.979> layout<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
so I have to say the overall layout is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.830 
so I have to say the overall layout is
what<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.969> people<00:02:06.210> will<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.540> used<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
what a lot of people will be used to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.419 
what a lot of people will be used to
especially<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.560> you're<00:02:07.710> coming<00:02:07.890> from<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.220> Mac

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
especially if you're coming from a Mac

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.309 
especially if you're coming from a Mac
already<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.660> definitely<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.050> joy<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
already and it is definitely a joy to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.440
