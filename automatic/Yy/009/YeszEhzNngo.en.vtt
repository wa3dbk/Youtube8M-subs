00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.839 
answer is well how do we build chords
every<00:02:47.939> basic<00:02:48.510> chord<00:02:48.780> C<00:02:49.140> major<00:02:49.170> D<00:02:49.560> minor<00:02:50.010> etc<00:02:50.700> is

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
every basic chord C major D minor etc is

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.809 
every basic chord C major D minor etc is
a<00:02:51.480> triad<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.560> made<00:02:52.799> out<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> three<00:02:53.310> notes<00:02:53.549> and

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
a triad it's made out of three notes and

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.899 
a triad it's made out of three notes and
those<00:02:54.209> three<00:02:54.510> notes<00:02:54.750> are<00:02:54.959> one<00:02:55.409> three<00:02:55.829> five<00:02:56.250> so

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
those three notes are one three five so

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.149 
those three notes are one three five so
let's<00:02:56.939> look<00:02:57.299> at<00:02:57.480> how<00:02:57.689> we<00:02:57.750> build<00:02:58.140> C<00:02:58.470> major<00:02:58.769> we

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
let's look at how we build C major we

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.640 
let's look at how we build C major we
build<00:02:59.430> C<00:02:59.609> major<00:02:59.819> by<00:03:00.209> starting<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:00.870> one<00:03:01.200> which

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
build C major by starting with one which

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.920 
build C major by starting with one which
is<00:03:01.799> going<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.129> C<00:03:02.459> then<00:03:03.120> we<00:03:03.239> go<00:03:03.359> to<00:03:03.420> three

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
is going to be C then we go to three

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.039 
is going to be C then we go to three
along<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.859> C<00:03:05.069> major<00:03:05.310> scale<00:03:05.579> which<00:03:06.209> will<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.629> C

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
along the C major scale which will be C

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.980 
along the C major scale which will be C
D<00:03:07.349> E

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.650 

you

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
you

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:21.350 
you
and<00:03:12.070> then<00:03:13.070> we<00:03:13.220> go<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.370> five<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.510> go<00:03:14.830> cdefg

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.010 

so<00:03:22.360> C<00:03:22.600> major<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:23.020> made<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.440> C<00:03:23.770> E<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.580> G<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
so C major is made up of C E and G the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.620 
so C major is made up of C E and G the
next<00:03:29.500> note<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> C<00:03:30.520> major<00:03:30.700> scale<00:03:30.850> is<00:03:31.210> D<00:03:31.420> and

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
next note in the C major scale is D and

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.780 
next note in the C major scale is D and
as<00:03:31.810> we<00:03:31.960> already<00:03:32.080> saw<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.890> context<00:03:33.460> of<00:03:33.580> C

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
as we already saw it in the context of C

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.210 
as we already saw it in the context of C
major<00:03:34.000> we<00:03:34.540> have<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.720> D<00:03:34.990> minor<00:03:35.230> chord<00:03:35.350> but<00:03:36.070> we

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
major we have a D minor chord but we

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.620 
major we have a D minor chord but we
build<00:03:36.460> it<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.700> same<00:03:36.880> way<00:03:37.090> it's<00:03:37.240> one<00:03:37.390> three

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
build it the same way it's one three

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.690 
build it the same way it's one three
five<00:03:37.870> we<00:03:38.140> start<00:03:38.410> with<00:03:38.560> one<00:03:38.860> which<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.310> in<00:03:39.520> this

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
five we start with one which is in this

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
five we start with one which is in this
case<00:03:39.910> D<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.780> we<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:41.050> to<00:03:41.110> three<00:03:41.560> we're<00:03:41.890> counting

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
case D and we go to three we're counting

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.550 
case D and we go to three we're counting
up<00:03:42.340> using<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.120> notes<00:03:43.330> in<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.570> C<00:03:43.840> major<00:03:44.050> scale

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
up using the notes in the C major scale

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.230 
up using the notes in the C major scale
okay<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:44.890> d<00:03:45.430> e<00:03:45.700> f<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:49.800> then<00:03:50.800> we<00:03:50.890> go<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.010> five<00:03:51.370> d<00:03:52.030> e

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
okay so d e f and then we go to five d e

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:03.390 
okay so d e f and then we go to five d e
f<00:03:52.540> G<00:03:53.320> a<00:03:59.550> so<00:04:00.550> D<00:04:00.940> F<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.920> that's<00:04:02.920> going<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.190> give<00:04:03.280> you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
f G a so D F a that's going to give you

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.210 
f G a so D F a that's going to give you
D<00:04:03.580> minor<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:04.330> next<00:04:04.660> chord<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.080> a<00:04:05.500> minor<00:04:05.560> okay

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
D minor the next chord is a minor okay

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.370 
D minor the next chord is a minor okay
and<00:04:06.730> we<00:04:06.820> build<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.360> exact<00:04:07.660> same<00:04:07.870> way<00:04:08.110> as

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
and we build this the exact same way as

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.590 
and we build this the exact same way as
all<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.980> other<00:04:09.100> ones<00:04:09.160> one<00:04:09.820> three<00:04:10.060> five<00:04:10.270> one

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
all the other ones one three five one

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.110 
all the other ones one three five one
starting<00:04:11.350> on<00:04:11.470> e<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.980> then<00:04:12.220> we<00:04:12.340> count<00:04:12.520> up<00:04:12.730> three

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
starting on e and then we count up three

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.630 
starting on e and then we count up three
so<00:04:13.510> e<00:04:13.750> f<00:04:14.350> g<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:16.590> then<00:04:17.590> we<00:04:17.709> go<00:04:17.859> up<00:04:18.040> two<00:04:18.250> more<00:04:18.489> to

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
so e f g and then we go up two more to

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.710 
so e f g and then we go up two more to
the<00:04:18.730> fifth<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.269> B<00:04:23.130> so<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.280> e<00:04:24.310> minor<00:04:24.820> chord<00:04:25.180> is<00:04:25.360> e

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
the fifth a B so the e minor chord is e

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.580 
the fifth a B so the e minor chord is e
G<00:04:26.380> B<00:04:26.800> that's<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.460> minor

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
G B that's a minor

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.150 
G B that's a minor
the<00:04:30.520> next<00:04:30.850> chord<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.540> f<00:04:31.870> okay<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:32.889> F

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
the next chord is f okay and this F

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.920 
the next chord is f okay and this F
major<00:04:33.460> start<00:04:34.419> with<00:04:34.540> F<00:04:34.720> go<00:04:35.290> 1<00:04:35.530> 3<00:04:35.770> 5<00:04:36.040> so<00:04:36.610> f<00:04:36.790> is<00:04:37.090> 1<00:04:37.330> G

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
major start with F go 1 3 5 so f is 1 G

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:49.170 
major start with F go 1 3 5 so f is 1 G
a<00:04:38.080> is<00:04:38.590> 3<00:04:39.010> B<00:04:41.310> C<00:04:42.310> is<00:04:42.520> 5<00:04:43.180> 1<00:04:43.780> 3<00:04:44.050> 5<00:04:46.080> f<00:04:47.130> AC<00:04:48.130> that's<00:04:48.850> F

a is 3 B C is 5 1 3 5 f AC that's F

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.840 
a is 3 B C is 5 1 3 5 f AC that's F
major<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:52.060> next<00:04:52.450> chord<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:52.990> G<00:04:53.050> G<00:04:54.010> major<00:04:54.280> start

major the next chord is G G major start

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.640 
major the next chord is G G major start
with<00:04:54.970> 1<00:04:55.240> which<00:04:55.540> is<00:04:55.720> going<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.900> be<00:04:56.020> G<00:04:56.290> in<00:04:56.440> this

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
with 1 which is going to be G in this

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.850 
with 1 which is going to be G in this
case<00:04:56.889> G<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.730> B<00:04:58.270> B<00:04:58.630> is<00:04:58.810> 3<00:05:00.540> then<00:05:01.540> we<00:05:01.630> go<00:05:01.780> up<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.960> 5<00:05:02.200> G<00:05:02.680> a

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
case G a B B is 3 then we go up to 5 G a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:12.629 
case G a B B is 3 then we go up to 5 G a
B<00:05:03.520> C<00:05:03.729> D<00:05:04.660> so<00:05:07.500> G<00:05:08.500> B<00:05:08.889> D<00:05:09.100> that's<00:05:09.880> G<00:05:10.240> major

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.749 

and<00:05:12.759> then<00:05:13.750> we<00:05:13.900> go<00:05:14.020> up<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.259> a<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:14.770> the<00:05:15.159> key<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.370> C

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 
and then we go up to a and the key of C

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.029 
and then we go up to a and the key of C
we<00:05:16.090> have<00:05:16.270> an<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.479> minor<00:05:16.810> chord<00:05:17.199> and<00:05:17.319> so<00:05:17.770> let's

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
we have an a minor chord and so let's

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.050 
we have an a minor chord and so let's
build<00:05:18.280> it<00:05:18.400> 1<00:05:18.610> 3<00:05:18.849> 5<00:05:19.060> start<00:05:19.539> with<00:05:19.659> a<00:05:19.780> count<00:05:20.500> of<00:05:20.650> 3

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
build it 1 3 5 start with a count of 3

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:29.999 
build it 1 3 5 start with a count of 3
ABC<00:05:23.430> count<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.550> 5<00:05:24.789> a<00:05:25.030> b<00:05:25.479> c<00:05:25.509> d<00:05:25.840> e<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:29.530> we<00:05:29.620> have<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.889> c

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
ABC count to 5 a b c d e so we have a c

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.950 
ABC count to 5 a b c d e so we have a c
e<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.849> gives<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.419> minor<00:05:33.419> the<00:05:34.419> last<00:05:34.659> chord

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
e that gives you a minor the last chord

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.649 
e that gives you a minor the last chord
is<00:05:35.110> B<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:36.009> B<00:05:36.250> diminished<00:05:36.550> but<00:05:37.030> it's<00:05:37.150> built<00:05:37.509> the

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
is B the B diminished but it's built the

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.649 
is B the B diminished but it's built the
exact<00:05:38.080> same<00:05:38.289> way<00:05:38.560> 1<00:05:39.069> 3<00:05:39.340> 5<00:05:39.580> so<00:05:39.969> we<00:05:40.090> start<00:05:40.330> with<00:05:40.449> B

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
exact same way 1 3 5 so we start with B

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.749 
exact same way 1 3 5 so we start with B
count<00:05:41.050> up<00:05:41.169> to<00:05:41.289> 3<00:05:41.530> B<00:05:41.830> C<00:05:42.099> D<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:42.669> we<00:05:42.879> have<00:05:43.000> B<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.479> D

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
count up to 3 B C D so we have B and D

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.570 
count up to 3 B C D so we have B and D
now<00:05:45.759> we<00:05:45.819> need<00:05:46.029> to<00:05:46.120> get<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.330> fifth<00:05:46.659> so<00:05:47.349> b<00:05:47.770> c<00:05:48.069> d<00:05:48.099> e

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
now we need to get the fifth so b c d e

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.029 
now we need to get the fifth so b c d e
f<00:05:51.719> b<00:05:52.719> DF<00:05:53.500> that<00:05:54.159> gives<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:54.639> your<00:05:54.879> B<00:05:55.120> diminished

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
f b DF that gives you your B diminished

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.179 
f b DF that gives you your B diminished
