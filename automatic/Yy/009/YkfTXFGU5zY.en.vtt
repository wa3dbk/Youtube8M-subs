00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
very confusing process as the how this

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.490 
very confusing process as the how this
is<00:01:36.420> put<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:38.810> don't<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.229> really

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
is put out I don't know it's really

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
far-fetched but I didn't really believe

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.490 
far-fetched but I didn't really believe
this<00:01:43.770> mart<00:01:44.100> part<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> too<00:01:45.360> much<00:01:45.540> just

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this mart part of it too much just

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.050 
this mart part of it too much just
because<00:01:46.649> they<00:01:47.009> wanted<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.670> much<00:01:47.790> detail

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
