00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
the house on Newtown where you would

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.520 
the house on Newtown where you would
climb<00:01:24.020> out<00:01:24.230> pry<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.590> windows<00:01:25.480> and<00:01:26.480> he<00:01:27.140> has<00:01:27.290> to

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
climb out pry the windows and he has to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.290 
climb out pry the windows and he has to
get<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:27.980> towers<00:01:28.460> up<00:01:28.670> there<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.120> have<00:01:29.180> to

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
get the towers up there so you have to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.860 
get the towers up there so you have to
create<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.690> lot<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.170> crawlers<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.720> have

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
create a lot of crawlers then you have

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.050 
create a lot of crawlers then you have
to<00:01:33.050> jump<00:01:33.290> out<00:01:33.500> get<00:01:34.040> on<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.280> ground<00:01:34.550> where<00:01:34.940> you

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
to jump out get on the ground where you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.780 
to jump out get on the ground where you
would<00:01:35.210> climb<00:01:35.420> up<00:01:35.630> on<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.990> I<00:01:36.220> think<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.460> have<00:01:37.580> to

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.140 
would climb up on it I think you have to
try<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.630> jump<00:01:38.990> up<00:01:39.170> high<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.770> nice<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.940> while

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
try to jump up high and nice it while

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.440 
try to jump up high and nice it while
it's<00:01:41.360> up<00:01:41.510> there<00:01:42.760> so<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:43.820> have<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.120> get<00:01:44.300> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
it's up there so you have to get the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.240 
it's up there so you have to get the
zombies<00:01:44.810> out<00:01:44.960> there<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.410> then<00:01:45.530> if<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.890> almost

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
life on your super jump and if you do it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.380 
life on your super jump and if you do it
right<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.620> you<00:01:51.620> aim<00:01:51.830> right<00:01:52.130> when<00:01:52.580> you<00:01:52.760> go<00:01:53.210> on

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
right and you aim right when you go on

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.690

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
top of it you can get on top of the roof

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.620 
top of it you can get on top of the roof
