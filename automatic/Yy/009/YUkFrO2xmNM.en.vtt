 very good to all of you today I am going to bring you a 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.950
 tutorial on how to retrieve note 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.160
 minecraft deleted by mistake 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.770
 ok here I have my world I'm sorry 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.520
 for the dap but I have a computer and I'm going 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.190
 to proceed to delete it 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.100
 then it's like I'm going to lose it 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.540
 but in one in a moment in just 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.240
 two minutes we will be able to recover 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:36.800
 without losing anything, I erase it 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:41.220
 is already deleted I do not have any world anymore 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.230
 and let us proceed to recover 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.980
 we have to go and look and we have to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.040
 search with the command percent to data 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.250
 percent then it will take us to this 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.570
 folder and we went into point minecraft in 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.930
 six you know 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.090
 and we have to create a folder with the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.309
 world that is with the name I had 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.500
 our former mine as world power 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.890
 as you can see above is the first 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.890
 world 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:15.479
 67 2 move to the folder we have to 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.070
 give order and by modification date 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.649
 I already have it so what I need 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.329
 last time I modified this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.270
 file has been today at 6 and 20 or 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.759
 do I would lose it 10 minutes what 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.170
 we take and copy it to the folder that 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.650
 just we created but we stuck here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.710
 and we extract it as simple as this 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.720
 we wait today and we are already erasing what 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.660
 we just paid, but it's not necessary 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.930
 just in case so that at least we achieve 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.990
 and it's already here all the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.570

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.479

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.610
 Okay, well, this has been everything now 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.110
