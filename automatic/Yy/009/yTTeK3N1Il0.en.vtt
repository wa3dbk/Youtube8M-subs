00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.970 
noises on the guitar and we give it kind
of<00:00:27.180> video<00:00:27.330> game<00:00:27.510> names<00:00:27.779> because<00:00:28.470> that's<00:00:28.680> cool

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
of video game names because that's cool

of video game names because that's cool
you<00:00:29.250> know<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.390> one's<00:00:30.630> from<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.019> song

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you know so this one's from the song

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.750 
you know so this one's from the song
through<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> fire<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.740> flames<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.369> just

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
through the fire and flames and just

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.060 
through the fire and flames and just
before<00:00:32.879> the<00:00:33.059> solo<00:00:33.330> kicks<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.649> make<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:34.980> we

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
before the solo kicks in we make what we

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.770 
before the solo kicks in we make what we
call<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> pattern<00:00:35.640> noise<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.329> let's<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
call the pattern noise so let's have a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
call the pattern noise so let's have a
look<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:40.100> it's<00:00:41.100> actually<00:00:41.399> cooler<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.760> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
look at that it's actually cooler if you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
look at that it's actually cooler if you
combine<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.899> ghost<00:00:43.500> noise<00:00:43.800> since

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
combine it with a ghost noise since

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.160 
combine it with a ghost noise since
pac-man<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.420> pointless<00:00:45.750> having<00:00:46.050> him

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
pac-man it's a bit pointless having him

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.229 
pac-man it's a bit pointless having him
on<00:00:46.230> his<00:00:46.379> own<00:00:49.460> we're<00:00:50.460> gonna<00:00:50.550> try<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> put

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
on his own we're gonna try to put

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.380 
on his own we're gonna try to put
pac-man<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.170> goes<00:00:52.500> together<00:00:53.239> just<00:00:54.239> like

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
pac-man and it goes together just like

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:07.789 
pac-man and it goes together just like
the<00:00:54.480> video<00:00:54.570> game

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

through the farm the flames at the end

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.590 
through the farm the flames at the end
of<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.220> song<00:02:57.459> we<00:02:57.610> actually<00:02:57.880> break<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> string

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
of the song we actually break the string

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.970 
of the song we actually break the string
I<00:02:58.690> broke<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.959> string<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> album<00:02:59.800> and<00:02:59.920> we

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
I broke the string on the album and we

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.710 
I broke the string on the album and we
left<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.310> there<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.000> let's<00:03:01.209> see<00:03:01.300> how<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.450> did

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
left it there so let's see how I did

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.059 
left it there so let's see how I did
that<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.140> don't<00:03:02.530> think<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.739> break<00:03:02.920> the

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
that I don't think I can break the

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.309 
that I don't think I can break the
string<00:03:03.280> now<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.700> let's<00:03:03.850> try<00:03:03.940> it

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.509
