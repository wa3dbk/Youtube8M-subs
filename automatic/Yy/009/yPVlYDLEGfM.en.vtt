00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.340
 short or long stories 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.680

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.800

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.710

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.630
 but then something unexpected happened 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.439
 I fell in love with a good king and at the end 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.420
 I looked into your eyes as if 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.729
 looked at my own heart 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.360
 I don't need a magic mirror to 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:38.140

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.710
 and I was not going to sit back 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.009

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.820

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.539
 except to love me 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.260

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.470
