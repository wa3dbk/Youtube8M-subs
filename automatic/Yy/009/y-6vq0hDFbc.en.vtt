check that video out down below there is
a<00:00:25.170> link<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:26.240> definitely<00:00:27.240> want<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:27.869> well

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
a link I definitely want to see how well

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.759 
a link I definitely want to see how well
this<00:00:28.230> thing<00:00:28.289> works<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> then<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> second<00:00:30.480> thing

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
this thing works and then a second thing

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.069 
this thing works and then a second thing
cost<00:00:31.769> effective<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> cost<00:00:33.239> next<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
cost effective one at the cost next to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.840 
cost effective one at the cost next to
nothing<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> first<00:00:35.070> step<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.670> going

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
nothing so the first step here is going

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.049 
nothing so the first step here is going
to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.630> take<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.520> four<00:00:38.910> way

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to be to take this this little four way

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.450 
to be to take this this little four way
piece<00:00:39.300> here<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.739> need<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> sand<00:00:41.250> down<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
piece here and we need to sand down the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.900 
piece here and we need to sand down the
insides<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:43.070> so<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> bearings<00:00:44.640> here

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
insides so so that the bearings here

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.529 
insides so so that the bearings here
will<00:00:45.090> fit<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> now<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.430> we've<00:00:47.730> sanded<00:00:48.360> these

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
will fit and now that we've sanded these

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.920 
will fit and now that we've sanded these
up<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.230> double-check<00:00:49.710> make<00:00:49.950> sure<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.399> this

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
up just double-check make sure that this

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
up just double-check make sure that this
bearing<00:00:51.930> fits<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.309> tap<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.699> down<00:00:53.760> will

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
bearing fits in as I tap that down will

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.630 
bearing fits in as I tap that down will
fit<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.539> nicely<00:00:54.750> there<00:00:55.250> just<00:00:56.250> make<00:00:56.399> sure<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
fit in nicely there just make sure it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.139 
fit in nicely there just make sure it
fits<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.030> all<00:00:57.120> four<00:00:57.570> all<00:00:58.350> four<00:00:58.649> sides<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.370> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
fits in all four all four sides here the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.420 
fits in all four all four sides here the
right<00:01:00.329> angle<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.829> sander<00:01:02.219> back

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
right angle here get your sander back

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.840 
right angle here get your sander back
out

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
out

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
out
we<00:01:02.940> need<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> sand<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.539> inside<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.199> sand

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
we need to sand this inside out sand

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.460 
we need to sand this inside out sand
that<00:01:04.739> out<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> pretty<00:01:07.049> much<00:01:07.229> good<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that out this is a pretty much good to

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.130 
that out this is a pretty much good to
go<00:01:08.659> next<00:01:09.659> step<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.400> that<00:01:11.659> three<00:01:12.659> inch<00:01:12.810> bolt

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
go next step is a that three inch bolt

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.940 
go next step is a that three inch bolt
that<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.470> talked<00:01:13.710> about<00:01:13.830> earlier<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> 5/16

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
that we talked about earlier the 5/16

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.109 
that we talked about earlier the 5/16
bought<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> three<00:01:17.280> inch<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.549> think<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> two<00:01:17.939> inch

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bought a three inch I think a two inch

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.039 
bought a three inch I think a two inch
is<00:01:18.270> probably<00:01:18.659> better

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
is probably better

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
is probably better
I'm<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.500> block<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I'm going to block it off here with a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
I'm going to block it off here with a
few<00:01:21.290> few<00:01:22.290> nuts<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.259> it'll<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
few few nuts here and so it'll be a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.960 
few few nuts here and so it'll be a
little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.710> shorter<00:01:26.009> don't<00:01:26.430> look<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:26.820> inch

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
little bit shorter don't look a two inch

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.870 
little bit shorter don't look a two inch
now<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:29.130> that's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
now so we have that and then that's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.249 
now so we have that and then that's
going<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> go<00:01:30.210> over<00:01:30.240> top<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> bearing<00:01:31.110> there

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
going to go over top the bearing there

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.410 
going to go over top the bearing there
this<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.040> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> seat<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:33.000> inside

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
this is all going to seat right inside

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.950 
this is all going to seat right inside
here

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
here

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740 
here
and<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.549> glue<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.600> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and then I will glue that in this is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.539 
and then I will glue that in this is
going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> be<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.200> handle<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
going to be your handle so this way this

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.920 
going to be your handle so this way this
step<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.030> we're<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> take<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
step is we're going to take this

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.100 
step is we're going to take this
three-inch<00:01:40.799> coupling<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:41.930> we're<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
three-inch coupling here we're going to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.800 
three-inch coupling here we're going to
cut<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.009> way<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:45.479> bit<00:01:45.810> beyond<00:01:46.799> half

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
cut it this way a little bit beyond half

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
cut it this way a little bit beyond half
so<00:01:48.810> somewhere<00:01:49.140> around<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:50.430> we're

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
so somewhere around here and then we're

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
so somewhere around here and then we're
going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.090> cut<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.600> down<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> middle<00:01:52.530> we

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
going to cut it right down the middle we

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
going to cut it right down the middle we
want<00:01:53.250> about<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:54.030> down<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> middle<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.659> we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
want about not down the middle but we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.560 
want about not down the middle but we
want<00:01:54.990> about<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.290> inch<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.740> after<00:01:56.070> cutting<00:01:56.570> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
want about an inch or after cutting this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.440 
want about an inch or after cutting this
is<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:58.159> this<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.430> piece<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> comes

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is about this is the piece that comes

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.109 
is about this is the piece that comes
off<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:01.020> next<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:03.000> need

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
off here next up we have here is we need

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.780 
off here next up we have here is we need
to<00:02:03.240> drill<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> hole<00:02:03.600> directly<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.460> center

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
to drill a hole directly in the center

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.210 
to drill a hole directly in the center
here<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.840> we're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.170> take<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
here then we're going to take this

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.130 
here then we're going to take this
and<00:02:08.460> drill<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.970> hole<00:02:09.150> just<00:02:09.180> slightly<00:02:09.690> small

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and drill the hole just slightly small

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.030 
and drill the hole just slightly small
so<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.620> we<00:02:10.770> could<00:02:11.090> thread<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.240> on<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:13.040> this

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
so that we could thread it on there this

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.920 
so that we could thread it on there this
will<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> handle<00:02:14.820> here<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.750> going<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
will be the handle here this is going to

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.840 
will be the handle here this is going to
be<00:02:15.990> one<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.320> revolving<00:02:16.770> axes<00:02:17.280> okay<00:02:17.790> so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
be one of the revolving axes okay so

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.140 
be one of the revolving axes okay so
next<00:02:18.270> step<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:19.950> our<00:02:20.400> little

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
next step is so we have our little

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.530 
next step is so we have our little
four-way<00:02:21.600> divider<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:23.330> we're<00:02:24.330> going<00:02:24.450> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
four-way divider here and we're going to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.140 
four-way divider here and we're going to
take<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> 5/16<00:02:25.620> by<00:02:25.950> inch<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.730> half<00:02:27.740> bolt<00:02:28.740> here

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
take a 5/16 by inch and a half bolt here

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.490 
take a 5/16 by inch and a half bolt here
we're<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.300> put<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:30.900> through<00:02:31.230> kind

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
we're going to put it down through kind

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.400 
we're going to put it down through kind
of<00:02:31.530> drop<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.040> find<00:02:32.370> its<00:02:32.550> way<00:02:32.700> through<00:02:33.410> so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
of drop it in find its way through so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
of drop it in find its way through so
that<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.710> comes<00:02:34.890> out<00:02:35.160> all<00:02:35.490> we're<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.850> do

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
that it comes out all we're going to do

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.330 
that it comes out all we're going to do
with<00:02:36.390> our<00:02:36.420> other<00:02:36.630> piece<00:02:36.900> here<00:02:37.070> is<00:02:38.070> we're<00:02:38.250> going

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
with our other piece here is we're going

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.800 
with our other piece here is we're going
to<00:02:38.400> have<00:02:38.490> this<00:02:38.790> go<00:02:39.240> right<00:02:39.420> through<00:02:39.600> there

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
to have this go right through there

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.380 
to have this go right through there
through<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.200> holes<00:02:40.530> which<00:02:40.710> is<00:02:40.860> true<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.610> then

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
through the holes which is true and then

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.150 
through the holes which is true and then
the<00:02:42.540> same<00:02:42.750> deal<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> other<00:02:43.320> side<00:02:43.590> we're

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
the same deal on the other side we're

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
the same deal on the other side we're
going<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> put<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.490> bearing<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:45.690> we

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
going to put the bearing in this what we

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.660 
going to put the bearing in this what we
got<00:02:45.960> so<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.290> would<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.530> our<00:02:46.560> handle<00:02:47.040> this

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
got so this would be our handle this

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.450 
got so this would be our handle this
would<00:02:47.880> be<00:02:48.380> one<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> axes<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.340> is

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
would be one of the axes that this is

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.790 
would be one of the axes that this is
going<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.670> be<00:02:50.790> spinning<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.330> now<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.680> have

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
going to be spinning on now we have

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.350 
going to be spinning on now we have
going<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.100> here<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.490> drill<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> hole<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.150> either

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
going on here to drill a hole on either

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.210 
going on here to drill a hole on either
side<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.530> now<00:02:55.770> put<00:02:56.730> about<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.710> an<00:02:58.710> inch<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.190> a

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
side and now put about a an inch and a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.500 
side and now put about a an inch and a
quarter<00:02:59.460> bolt<00:02:59.850> through

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
quarter bolt through

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.350 
quarter bolt through
now<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.590> bolt<00:03:01.890> as<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.610> can<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.970> here

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
now that bolt as you can see here

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.450 
now that bolt as you can see here
there's<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.050> be<00:03:04.110> another<00:03:04.530> nut<00:03:05.130> in

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
there's going to be another nut in

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.110 
there's going to be another nut in
between<00:03:06.000> spacing<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.750> then<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.430> nylon<00:03:08.430> nut<00:03:08.880> on

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
between spacing and then a nylon nut on

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.520 
between spacing and then a nylon nut on
top<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> that's<00:03:09.810> going<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.020> pinch<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.470> down

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
top and that's going to pinch it down

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.550 
top and that's going to pinch it down
together<00:03:11.040> holding<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.180> bearing<00:03:13.080> right

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
together holding the the bearing right

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.699 
together holding the the bearing right
here<00:03:13.800> let's<00:03:14.459> slide<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:15.530> clamp<00:03:16.530> these

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
here let's slide this on clamp these

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.120 
here let's slide this on clamp these
together<00:03:16.950> nicely<00:03:18.410> that's<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.590> map<00:03:19.770> we'll<00:03:19.980> let

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
together nicely that's the map we'll let

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.740 
together nicely that's the map we'll let
it<00:03:20.160> sit<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.150> want<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.360> make<00:03:21.450> sure<00:03:21.480> that

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
it sit and you want to make sure that

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.030 
it sit and you want to make sure that
this<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.020> able<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.350> spin<00:03:22.560> freely

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
this is able to spin freely

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.800 
this is able to spin freely
right<00:03:23.250> now<00:03:23.400> we're<00:03:23.550> going<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.730> take<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
right now we're going to take the the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.800 
right now we're going to take the the
rod<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:25.590> had<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.610> 5/16<00:03:27.330> pretty<00:03:27.720> much

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
rod that we had this is 5/16 pretty much

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.620 
rod that we had this is 5/16 pretty much
everything<00:03:28.170> we're<00:03:28.290> using<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.680> 5/16<00:03:29.340> here

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
everything we're using is 5/16 here

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.199 
everything we're using is 5/16 here
reason<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.720> picked<00:03:30.900> 5/16<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
reason I picked 5/16 just that's the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.110 
reason I picked 5/16 just that's the
inside<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.840> bearings<00:03:34.170> here<00:03:34.500> now<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.120> assume

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
inside of the bearings here now I assume

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.670 
inside of the bearings here now I assume
all<00:03:36.330> rollerblades<00:03:36.930> are<00:03:37.140> pretty<00:03:37.350> much<00:03:37.470> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
all rollerblades are pretty much the
