00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
octave what that does is make the chord

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.140 
octave what that does is make the chord
a<00:02:39.900> little<00:02:40.110> bit<00:02:40.320> fatter<00:02:40.680> sounding<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.490> here<00:02:42.030> is

fingering<00:03:27.880> now<00:03:28.720> it's<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.140> little<00:03:29.350> tricky<00:03:29.590> when

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
fingering now it's a little tricky when

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
you get to the D string you go D string

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.050 
you get to the D string you go D string
but<00:03:35.470> because<00:03:35.740> of<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.920> tuning<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.730> have<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:36.970> go

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
but because of the tuning you have to go

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.750 
but because of the tuning you have to go
