stands<00:01:30.930> right<00:01:31.620> here<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.370> when<00:01:33.300> I<00:01:33.510> take<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
stands right here and when I take it to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.870 
stands right here and when I take it to
my<00:01:35.280> hand<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:37.620> image<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:39.680> constantly<00:01:40.880> updated

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
my hand the image is constantly updated

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.530 
my hand the image is constantly updated
in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.930> screen<00:01:43.430> there<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.820> an<00:01:45.060> live

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
in the screen there we have an live

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.100 
in the screen there we have an live
image<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.740> depth<00:01:47.280> information<00:01:47.910> from<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
image of the depth information from the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.290 
image of the depth information from the
connects<00:01:50.300> depth<00:01:51.300> sensor

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.670 

and<00:01:56.220> here<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.760> setup<00:01:58.140> connect<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.380> the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
and here is the setup connect and the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.180 
and here is the setup connect and the
motorcycle<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:01.780> I'm<00:02:02.050> going<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.590> grab<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
motorcycle and now I'm going to grab the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:14.540 
motorcycle and now I'm going to grab the
image<00:02:03.910> from<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:05.170> sensor

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.230 

so<00:02:15.550> there<00:02:15.970> we<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.750> now<00:02:17.380> we<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.860> open

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
so there we have it and now we can open

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.980 
so there we have it and now we can open
just<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.480> normal<00:02:20.370> text<00:02:21.370> editor<00:02:21.820> or<00:02:22.120> see<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
just a normal text editor or see the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.610 
just a normal text editor or see the
file<00:02:23.290> with<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.600> terminal<00:02:25.600> application<00:02:25.840> it's

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
file with the terminal application it's

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.340 
file with the terminal application it's
only<00:02:27.130> x<00:02:27.720> y&amp;z<00:02:28.720> coordinates<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.130> file

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
only x y&amp;z coordinates in the file

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.280 

and<00:02:32.970> then<00:02:33.970> we<00:02:34.150> open<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.840> mesh<00:02:35.020> lab

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and then we open the mesh lab

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.830 
and then we open the mesh lab
application<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:37.650> open<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.070> file<00:02:39.510> import<00:02:40.510> it

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
application and open the file import it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.470 
application and open the file import it
and<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:42.850> show<00:02:43.630> us<00:02:43.870> an<00:02:44.230> point<00:02:44.980> cloud<00:02:45.490> in

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and it will show us an point cloud in

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.250 
and it will show us an point cloud in
the<00:02:46.630> Michelin

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.520 

so<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.709> have<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.920> each<00:02:56.909> dot<00:02:57.329> represents

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
so there we have it each dot represents

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.929 
so there we have it each dot represents
one<00:02:58.530> depth<00:02:58.980> information<00:02:59.370> and<00:03:00.209> whole<00:03:00.629> 3d<00:03:01.530> scan

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
one depth information and whole 3d scan

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.530 
one depth information and whole 3d scan
is<00:03:02.939> right<00:03:03.569> there<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.590> contains<00:03:05.099> about<00:03:05.540> 300,000

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
is right there it contains about 300,000

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:16.950 
is right there it contains about 300,000
individual<00:03:07.260> depth<00:03:07.530> points<00:03:08.159> at<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.670> stage

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:34.150 

you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.090 

as<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:34.910> now<00:03:35.060> have<00:03:35.300> an<00:03:35.510> very<00:03:36.080> affordable<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.800> 3d

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
as we now have an very affordable a 3d

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.020 
as we now have an very affordable a 3d
scanner<00:03:37.550> all<00:03:38.090> kind<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.780> things<00:03:38.840> are<00:03:39.500> possible

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
scanner all kind of things are possible

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.790 
scanner all kind of things are possible
we<00:03:41.030> could<00:03:41.180> use<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.570> along<00:03:41.900> with<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.170> 3d<00:03:42.590> printer

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
we could use it along with a 3d printer

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.570 
we could use it along with a 3d printer
to<00:03:43.730> model<00:03:44.090> different<00:03:44.570> prototype<00:03:45.050> parts<00:03:45.580> here

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
to model different prototype parts here

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.400 
to model different prototype parts here
we<00:03:46.730> have<00:03:46.880> one<00:03:47.090> part<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:47.630> have<00:03:47.900> printed

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
we have one part that I have printed

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.490 
we have one part that I have printed
with<00:03:48.650> my<00:03:48.830> 3d<00:03:49.190> printer<00:03:49.760> it's<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.990> custom

scanning<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.870> 3d<00:04:29.770> printing<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:31.170> very<00:04:32.170> good

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
scanning and 3d printing is very good

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:46.410 
scanning and 3d printing is very good
for<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.730> prototyping<00:04:34.630> uses<00:04:36.990> I'm<00:04:37.990> using<00:04:38.260> them

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.990 

here<00:04:47.420> we<00:04:47.600> have<00:04:47.810> also<00:04:48.170> one<00:04:48.710> part<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.640> would

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
here we have also one part that would

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.350 
here we have also one part that would
benefit<00:04:50.540> from<00:04:50.650> 3d<00:04:51.650> modeling<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.460> 3d<00:04:52.850> scanning

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
benefit from 3d modeling and 3d scanning

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.410 
benefit from 3d modeling and 3d scanning
it's<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.020> back<00:04:54.230> fork<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.910> was<00:04:56.150> pretty

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
it's the back fork it was pretty

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:04.159 
it's the back fork it was pretty
difficult<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:58.070> measure

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.520 

so<00:05:05.169> I<00:05:05.199> think<00:05:05.910> upper<00:05:06.910> dublin<00:05:07.180> 3d<00:05:07.630> scanning<00:05:08.110> is

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
so I think upper dublin 3d scanning is

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.420 
so I think upper dublin 3d scanning is
finally<00:05:09.100> here<00:05:09.520> as<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.720> can<00:05:10.750> see<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:11.860> results

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
finally here as you can see the results

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.950 
finally here as you can see the results
are<00:05:13.169> more<00:05:14.169> than<00:05:14.860> good<00:05:15.430> enough<00:05:16.620> for<00:05:17.620> for<00:05:18.250> the
