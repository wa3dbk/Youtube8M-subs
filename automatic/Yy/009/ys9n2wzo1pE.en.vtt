00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:36.770 
through your webpage or whatever it is
you're<00:01:27.780> looking<00:01:27.810> at<00:01:31.189> like<00:01:32.189> so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.840 

so<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:38.350> definitely<00:01:38.799> not<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.250> most<00:01:39.280> ideal

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
so it's definitely not the most ideal

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.460 
so it's definitely not the most ideal
way<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.210> scrolling<00:01:40.540> but<00:01:40.780> it's<00:01:40.960> not<00:01:41.140> too<00:01:41.320> bad

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
way of scrolling but it's not too bad

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.020 
way of scrolling but it's not too bad
once<00:01:41.770> again<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.250> did<00:01:42.369> take<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.580> little<00:01:42.820> while<00:01:43.000> to

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
once again it did take a little while to

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.450 
once again it did take a little while to
get<00:01:43.240> used<00:01:43.299> to<00:01:43.600> but<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.649> updated<00:01:45.040> drivers<00:01:45.369> that
