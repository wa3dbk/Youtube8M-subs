00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
what is going on guys briar rabbit here

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.850 
what is going on guys briar rabbit here
I<00:00:19.890> got<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> few<00:00:20.580> questions<00:00:20.880> lately<00:00:21.630> about<00:00:21.869> what

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
I got a few questions lately about what

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.370 
I got a few questions lately about what
the<00:00:23.009> advanced<00:00:23.669> warfare<00:00:24.210> pre-order<00:00:25.079> looks

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the advanced warfare pre-order looks

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.339 
the advanced warfare pre-order looks
like<00:00:25.650> inside<00:00:26.250> destiny<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.930> can<00:00:27.960> see

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
like inside destiny so here you can see

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.589 
like inside destiny so here you can see
it<00:00:28.469> it's<00:00:28.649> actually<00:00:29.009> a<00:00:29.040> shader<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.969> your<00:00:30.149> armor

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it it's actually a shader for your armor

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
it it's actually a shader for your armor
you<00:00:30.960> can<00:00:31.110> see<00:00:31.259> my<00:00:31.410> character<00:00:31.800> kind<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.070> dancing

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
you can see my character kind of dancing

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.880 
you can see my character kind of dancing
around<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:33.660> I'll<00:00:33.960> show<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.469> how<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.770> actually

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
around and I'll show you how it actually

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.549 
around and I'll show you how it actually
works<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.610> once<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.600> into<00:00:37.050> your<00:00:37.079> character

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
works so once you go into your character

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.740 
works so once you go into your character
screen<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> come<00:00:39.239> down<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
screen you kind of come down here to

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
screen you kind of come down here to
equipment<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.160> select<00:00:41.550> all<00:00:41.700> your

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
equipment and you select all your

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
equipment and you select all your
shaders<00:00:42.329> right<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.110> here's<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.070> my

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
shaders right here so here's what my

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.640 
shaders right here so here's what my
armor<00:00:44.520> looks<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:45.060> without<00:00:45.390> any<00:00:45.900> shaders<00:00:46.470> on

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
armor looks like without any shaders on

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.740 
armor looks like without any shaders on
it<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.860> takes<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.100> second<00:00:47.460> update<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.660> know

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it it takes a second update you know

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
it it takes a second update you know
it's<00:00:48.960> kind<00:00:49.290> of<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.440> mishmash<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:50.100> colors<00:00:50.489> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's kind of a mishmash of colors and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's kind of a mishmash of colors and
styles<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.930> frankly<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.950> looks<00:00:52.980> okay

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
styles and frankly I think it looks okay

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.810 
styles and frankly I think it looks okay
but<00:00:53.700> once<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.900> have<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.470> shader<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.670> is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
but once you have a shader and this is

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.729 
but once you have a shader and this is
the<00:00:56.940> blacksmith<00:00:57.600> shader<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.200> you<00:00:58.290> get<00:00:58.500> for

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the blacksmith shader that you get for

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
the blacksmith shader that you get for
pre-ordering<00:00:59.480> advanced<00:01:00.480> warfare<00:01:00.510> that's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
pre-ordering advanced warfare that's

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
pre-ordering advanced warfare that's
call<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.410> duty<00:01:01.620> advanced<00:01:01.890> warfare<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:03.239> then

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
call of duty advanced warfare and then

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
call of duty advanced warfare and then
putting<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.899> code<00:01:04.110> into<00:01:04.470> destiny<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.700> put

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
putting your code into destiny you put

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
putting your code into destiny you put
that<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.750> instantly<00:01:07.049> changes<00:01:07.560> your

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that on and it instantly changes your

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
that on and it instantly changes your
armor<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.790> cohesive

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
armor to be this kind of cohesive

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.270 
armor to be this kind of cohesive
package<00:01:09.689> with<00:01:10.560> kind<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> advanced

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
package with kind of the advanced

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.149 
package with kind of the advanced
warfare<00:01:11.820> theme<00:01:12.149> colors<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.710> also<00:01:13.860> do

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
warfare theme colors you can also do

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.789 
warfare theme colors you can also do
other<00:01:14.189> themes<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.930> might<00:01:16.110> find<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
other themes so you might find some of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.039 
other themes so you might find some of
these<00:01:16.890> along<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.970> your<00:01:18.090> travels<00:01:18.690> or

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
these along the way in your travels or

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.460 
these along the way in your travels or
you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.770> buy<00:01:20.010> them<00:01:20.340> from<00:01:20.670> merchants<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:22.290> they

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you can buy them from merchants and they

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.440 
you can buy them from merchants and they
just<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.010> give<00:01:23.190> you<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.370> new<00:01:23.850> look<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.330> if

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
just kind of give you a new look so if

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.360 
just kind of give you a new look so if
you<00:01:24.510> get<00:01:24.630> sick<00:01:24.870> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.140> look<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.740> had<00:01:25.770> like

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
you get sick of the look you had like

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.910 
you get sick of the look you had like
something<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.119> zebra<00:01:27.450> striped<00:01:27.960> pants

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
something like the zebra striped pants

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.469 
something like the zebra striped pants
that<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> was<00:01:29.310> wearing<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.760> yesterday's<00:01:30.210> video

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that I was wearing in yesterday's video

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
that I was wearing in yesterday's video
it's<00:01:31.380> nice<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.770> able<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> change<00:01:32.280> these

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
it's nice to be able to change these

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.399 
it's nice to be able to change these
shaders<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.119> think<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.690> level<00:01:34.049> 20

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
shaders I think you have to be level 20

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.590 
shaders I think you have to be level 20
to<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.950> start<00:01:35.190> doing<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
to actually start doing it but it's a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240 
to actually start doing it but it's a
nice<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.350> touch<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.770> kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.010> lets<00:01:38.159> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
nice little touch you kind of lets you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.710 
nice little touch you kind of lets you
customize<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.880> character<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.330> little<00:01:39.600> bit

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
customize your character a little bit

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
customize your character a little bit
more<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.080> you're<00:01:40.260> not<00:01:40.350> happy<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.100> way<00:01:41.280> he

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
more if you're not happy with the way he

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
more if you're not happy with the way he
looks<00:01:42.180> by<00:01:42.420> default<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.530> that's<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> do

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
looks by default so that's going to do

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
looks by default so that's going to do
it<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.340> quick<00:01:44.549> video<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:45.600> viewing

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it just a quick video just over viewing

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.230 
it just a quick video just over viewing
the<00:01:46.110> advanced<00:01:46.439> warfare<00:01:47.010> pre-order<00:01:47.580> bonus<00:01:47.939> for

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the advanced warfare pre-order bonus for

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.630 
the advanced warfare pre-order bonus for
destiny<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.460> pretty

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
destiny I actually think it's a pretty

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640 
destiny I actually think it's a pretty
wild<00:01:50.909> thing<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.689> preorder<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.260> game

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
wild thing that you preorder one game

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.780 
wild thing that you preorder one game
and<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.040> something<00:01:53.400> else<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.700> another

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and you get something else in another

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.140 
and you get something else in another
game<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
game and you know that it is what it is

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.820

the white boots they're kind of like a
patent<00:02:06.990> leather<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.950> they're<00:02:08.069> probably

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.189 
patent leather I think they're probably
