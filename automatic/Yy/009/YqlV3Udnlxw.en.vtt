00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.000 
sweet potato vine and it's about a good
sort<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> 20<00:00:44.429> centimeters<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.179> length<00:00:46.010> but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
sort of 20 centimeters in length but

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.009 
sort of 20 centimeters in length but
look<00:00:47.219> at<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.460> root<00:00:47.640> growth<00:00:47.909> it's<00:00:48.539> incredible

isn't<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.409> so<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> way<00:00:50.249> you<00:00:50.309> plant<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.940> I'm

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
isn't it so the way you plant it I'm

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
isn't it so the way you plant it I'm
just<00:00:51.420> planting<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.929> a<00:00:52.019> big<00:00:52.260> big<00:00:52.469> pot<00:00:52.679> I<00:00:52.920> live

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
just planting it in a big big pot I live

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.149 
just planting it in a big big pot I live
in<00:00:53.309> Melbourne<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.879> pretty<00:00:54.179> warm<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:55.159> but

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
in Melbourne it's pretty warm here but

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.669 
in Melbourne it's pretty warm here but
if<00:00:56.309> we've<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> string<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.510> bad<00:00:57.690> weather<00:00:57.870> say

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
if we've got a string of bad weather say

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:01.549 
if we've got a string of bad weather say
it's<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.760> particularly<00:01:00.179> warm<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.229> always

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it's not particularly warm I can always

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.919 
it's not particularly warm I can always
bring<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.979> into<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> glass<00:01:02.879> house<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.479> grow

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
bring this into a glass house and grow

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.960 
bring this into a glass house and grow
it<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.380> have<00:01:04.980> a<00:01:05.010> long<00:01:05.190> enough<00:01:05.430> season<00:01:05.820> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it and have a long enough season in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
it and have a long enough season in
order<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.300> have<00:01:06.390> sweet<00:01:06.630> potatoes<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.920> best

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
order to have sweet potatoes the best

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.090 
order to have sweet potatoes the best
way<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> grow<00:01:08.550> sweet<00:01:08.940> potatoes<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.600> actually

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
way to grow sweet potatoes is actually

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
way to grow sweet potatoes is actually
burying<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.400> 2/3<00:01:12.120> of<00:01:12.300> it<00:01:12.480> even<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> leaves

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
burying about 2/3 of it even the leaves

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.400 
burying about 2/3 of it even the leaves
underneath<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> soil<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.170> always<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.290> an

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
underneath the soil and always at an

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.290 
underneath the soil and always at an
angle<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> encourages

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
angle like this because it encourages

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.960 
angle like this because it encourages
more<00:01:18.900> root<00:01:19.140> growth<00:01:19.440> or<00:01:19.710> evenly<00:01:20.550> around<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
more root growth or evenly around the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.750 
more root growth or evenly around the
pot<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.010> that's<00:01:23.010> what<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.370> want<00:01:23.580> because

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
pot and that's what you want because

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.580 
pot and that's what you want because
this<00:01:24.300> is<00:01:24.480> where<00:01:24.690> all<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.960> tube<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.500> be

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this is where all the tube is will be

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.300 
this is where all the tube is will be
coming<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.330> always<00:01:27.330> put<00:01:27.510> it<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.810> an<00:01:27.930> angle

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
coming from always put it at an angle

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.950 
coming from always put it at an angle
because<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.090> plant<00:01:30.330> will<00:01:30.510> always<00:01:30.750> want<00:01:30.930> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
because the plant will always want to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.320 
because the plant will always want to
grow<00:01:31.140> upwards<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.160> you're<00:01:32.370> going<00:01:32.550> to<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.760> all

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
grow upwards so you're going to get all

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.540 
grow upwards so you're going to get all
these<00:01:33.540> underground<00:01:34.140> growths<00:01:34.500> shooting<00:01:35.430> up

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
these underground growths shooting up

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.380 
these underground growths shooting up
through<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.290> through<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.410> pot<00:01:37.620> and<00:01:38.390> it's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
through the through the pot and it's

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.910 
through the through the pot and it's
just<00:01:39.660> a<00:01:39.720> normal<00:01:39.870> soil<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.620> little<00:01:40.830> bit

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920

heavy it's got a little bit of a clay
mushroom<00:01:44.550> compost<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.300> I've<00:01:45.420> added<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.720> little

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
mushroom compost and I've added a little

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.220 
mushroom compost and I've added a little
bit<00:01:46.050> of<00:01:46.640> sand<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.060> lighten<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.450> up<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.110> now

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.860 
have to do is bury it at an angle just
at<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.400> angle<00:01:53.730> and<00:01:54.350> leave<00:01:55.350> about<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.920> much

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
at this angle and leave about that much

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.600 
at this angle and leave about that much
above<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:58.020> ground<00:01:58.260> so<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.190> just<00:01:59.370> going<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
above the ground so I'm just going to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
above the ground so I'm just going to
get<00:01:59.730> that<00:01:59.760> done<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.060> then<00:02:00.300> I'll<00:02:00.420> show<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
get that done and then I'll show you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.690 
get that done and then I'll show you
what<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> looks<00:02:01.260> like

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.820 

so<00:02:04.700> I've<00:02:05.240> just<00:02:05.600> buried<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.200> as<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.710> can

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
so I've just buried it and as you can

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.890 
so I've just buried it and as you can
see<00:02:07.010> I've<00:02:07.280> buried<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:08.090> little<00:02:08.390> bit<00:02:08.570> further

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:08.900 
see I've buried it a little bit further

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.190 
see I've buried it a little bit further
than<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.830> anticipated<00:02:10.820> but<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.810> doesn't<00:02:12.110> really

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
than I anticipated but it doesn't really

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.780 
than I anticipated but it doesn't really
matter<00:02:12.440> these<00:02:12.680> things<00:02:12.980> are<00:02:13.160> pretty<00:02:13.310> resilient

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
matter these things are pretty resilient

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.900 
matter these things are pretty resilient
and<00:02:14.500> all<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:15.680> going<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.010> do<00:02:16.100> now<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.730> to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
and all I'm going to do now is just to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.830 
and all I'm going to do now is just to
mulch<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:18.460> water<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:19.760> well<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.660> mean

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
mulch it and water it in well and I mean

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.230 
mulch it and water it in well and I mean
by<00:02:21.050> watering<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.770> mean<00:02:21.980> sopping<00:02:22.820> wet<00:02:22.850> and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
by watering in I mean sopping wet and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.600 
by watering in I mean sopping wet and
then<00:02:23.900> once<00:02:24.680> you've<00:02:24.860> mulch<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.430> don't

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
then once you've mulch it you don't

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.910 
then once you've mulch it you don't
really<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.090> water<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.390> again<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:27.200> maybe

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
really have to water it again for maybe

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.990 
really have to water it again for maybe
once<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.280> week<00:02:29.740> this<00:02:30.740> is<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.010> other<00:02:31.130> slip<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.700> had

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
once a week this is the other slip I had

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.200 
once a week this is the other slip I had
two<00:02:32.270> from<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.080> same<00:02:33.260> one<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.740> I've<00:02:34.730> buried<00:02:35.030> it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
two from the same one and I've buried it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.240 
two from the same one and I've buried it
a<00:02:35.360> little<00:02:35.540> bit<00:02:35.720> more<00:02:35.870> shallower<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:37.100> can

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
a little bit more shallower as you can

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.710 
a little bit more shallower as you can
see<00:02:37.400> there's<00:02:37.610> more<00:02:37.820> leaf<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.240> this<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:38.570> might

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
see there's more leaf so this one might

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.590 
see there's more leaf so this one might
take<00:02:38.930> off<00:02:39.170> better<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.160> what<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.090> really<00:02:41.420> wanted

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
take off better but what I really wanted

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.270 
take off better but what I really wanted
to<00:02:41.690> show<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:41.960> was<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.590> one<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.950> did<00:02:43.160> about

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
to show you was the one that I did about

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.240 
to show you was the one that I did about
a<00:02:43.400> week<00:02:43.610> earlier<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.470> when<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> buried<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:46.010> it

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
a week earlier and when I buried it it

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.950 
a week earlier and when I buried it it
looked<00:02:46.460> exactly<00:02:46.580> like<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.270> I<00:02:47.600> thought<00:02:47.900> it

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
looked exactly like this I thought it

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.020 
looked exactly like this I thought it
wasn't<00:02:48.200> going<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.470> grow<00:02:48.650> very<00:02:48.890> well<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.730> just

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
wasn't going to grow very well but just

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.770 
wasn't going to grow very well but just
one<00:02:50.360> week<00:02:50.570> work<00:02:50.810> week<00:02:51.440> later<00:02:52.300> no<00:02:53.300> watering

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
one week work week later no watering

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.690 
one week work week later no watering
just<00:02:53.930> some<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:54.650> really<00:02:54.890> hot<00:02:55.160> weather<00:02:55.370> and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
just some really really hot weather and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.300 
just some really really hot weather and
I<00:02:55.790> mean<00:02:56.060> over<00:02:56.780> 30<00:02:56.990> degrees<00:02:57.200> for<00:02:57.709> about<00:02:57.830> 4<00:02:58.130> days

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
I mean over 30 degrees for about 4 days

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.120 
I mean over 30 degrees for about 4 days
and<00:02:58.730> look<00:02:58.880> what<00:02:59.030> happened<00:02:59.560> as<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.770> can<00:03:00.920> see

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
and look what happened as you can see

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.270 
and look what happened as you can see
it's<00:03:01.850> doing<00:03:02.209> very<00:03:02.450> well<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.190> although<00:03:04.190> I'm

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
it's doing very well and although I'm

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.980 
it's doing very well and although I'm
not<00:03:04.400> getting<00:03:04.730> any<00:03:04.850> growth<00:03:05.090> from<00:03:05.330> below<00:03:05.690> here

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
not getting any growth from below here

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.810 
not getting any growth from below here
yet<00:03:07.600> hopefully<00:03:08.600> this<00:03:08.870> one<00:03:09.280> really<00:03:10.280> takes<00:03:10.580> off

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
yet hopefully this one really takes off

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.420 
yet hopefully this one really takes off
and<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.090> has<00:03:11.270> no<00:03:12.230> watering<00:03:12.650> yet<00:03:12.860> after<00:03:13.070> week

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
and it has no watering yet after week

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.900 
and it has no watering yet after week
and<00:03:14.320> let's<00:03:15.320> see<00:03:15.530> underneath<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.310> sugarcane

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
and let's see underneath this sugarcane

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.190 
and let's see underneath this sugarcane
mulch<00:03:17.470> still<00:03:18.470> wet<00:03:18.739> actually<00:03:19.340> it's<00:03:19.959> just<00:03:20.959> get

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
mulch still wet actually it's just get

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.040 
mulch still wet actually it's just get
it<00:03:21.320> up<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.790> see<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.360> still<00:03:23.600> wet<00:03:23.810> and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
it up you see that it's still wet and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.530 
it up you see that it's still wet and
the<00:03:24.220> sugarcane<00:03:25.220> mulch<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:25.760> does<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.330> job

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the sugarcane mulch just does the job

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.920 
the sugarcane mulch just does the job
really<00:03:26.810> well<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:28.160> um<00:03:28.430> as<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:29.390> can<00:03:29.510> see<00:03:29.660> sweet

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
really well so um as you can see sweet

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.740 
really well so um as you can see sweet
potatoes<00:03:30.350> pretty<00:03:30.769> forgiving<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:32.330> variety

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
potatoes pretty forgiving the variety

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.390 
potatoes pretty forgiving the variety
that<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:32.959> have<00:03:33.230> here<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.560> don't<00:03:33.980> know<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.220> name

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
that I have here I don't know the name

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.130 
that I have here I don't know the name
but<00:03:34.700> it's<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:35.500> white<00:03:36.500> skinned<00:03:36.860> variety<00:03:37.370> and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
but it's a white skinned variety and

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.449 
but it's a white skinned variety and
inside<00:03:39.140> it's<00:03:39.350> actually<00:03:39.709> purple<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.250> minute

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
inside it's actually purple the minute

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.420 
inside it's actually purple the minute
you<00:03:40.550> cook<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.950> they're<00:03:42.950> doing<00:03:43.070> pretty<00:03:43.280> well

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
you cook it so they're doing pretty well

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.720 
you cook it so they're doing pretty well
and<00:03:43.900> due<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.170> success<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.739> this<00:03:45.860> one<00:03:46.130> I've

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
and due to the success of this one I've

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.449 
and due to the success of this one I've
actually<00:03:46.970> bought<00:03:47.420> from<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.930> supermarket<00:03:48.459> an

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
actually bought from the supermarket an

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.330 
actually bought from the supermarket an
orange<00:03:49.790> variety<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:51.200> purple<00:03:51.560> skin<00:03:51.769> variety

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
orange variety and a purple skin variety

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.900
