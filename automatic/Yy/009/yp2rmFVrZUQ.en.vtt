people<00:00:08.910> remember<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.809> do<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.559> Daisy

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
people remember how to do it the Daisy

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.610 
people remember how to do it the Daisy
here<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> little<00:00:12.389> different<00:00:12.870> from<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
here is a little different from the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.049 
here is a little different from the
other<00:00:13.860> days<00:00:14.130> as<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.460> might<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.759> seen

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
other days as you might have seen

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.990 
other days as you might have seen
because<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.529> thinner<00:00:16.859> Daisy<00:00:17.220> all<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.910> way

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
because it's a thinner Daisy all the way

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.849 
because it's a thinner Daisy all the way
through<00:00:18.330> but<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.199> different<00:00:19.439> one

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
through but it's just a different one

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.240 
through but it's just a different one
and<00:00:20.070> nice<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> choice<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> have

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
and nice to have a choice so here I have

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
and nice to have a choice so here I have
tip<00:00:24.150> number<00:00:24.359> three<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:26.240> I<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.840> prepared

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
tip number three and I have prepared

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880 
tip number three and I have prepared
everything<00:00:28.939> my<00:00:29.939> my<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.599> am<00:00:31.050> using<00:00:31.260> wax<00:00:31.529> paper

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
everything my my I am using wax paper

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.819 
everything my my I am using wax paper
because<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.460> clearer<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.110> template

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
because it's clearer I have a template

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.240 
because it's clearer I have a template
underneath<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.270> frosting<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.590> adhere

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
underneath and I have frosting to adhere

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.389 
underneath and I have frosting to adhere
to<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.149> stays<00:00:39.420> down<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.129> see

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
guidelines so that little dot I'm going

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.340 
guidelines so that little dot I'm going
to<00:00:47.850> try<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.680> move<00:00:49.680> toward<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.110> tip

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
to try to move toward it the on the tip

to try to move toward it the on the tip
104<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.680> thick<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.860> one

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
104 you can see that it is thick on one

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.099 
104 you can see that it is thick on one
side<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.760> fin<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.120> other<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.600> this

side and fin on the other in this
particular<00:00:58.559> flower<00:00:59.100> we're<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> keep

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
particular flower we're going to keep

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.470 
particular flower we're going to keep
the<00:01:00.780> tip<00:01:01.079> toward<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.829> fat<00:01:02.250> part<00:01:02.730> toward<00:01:03.270> me

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the tip toward the fat part toward me

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
the tip toward the fat part toward me
and<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.260> makes<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.739> different<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and that makes it a little different and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.850 
and that makes it a little different and
it'll<00:01:05.580> make<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.760> different<00:01:06.150> shape<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:07.409> 45

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
it'll make a different shape at a 45

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.760 
it'll make a different shape at a 45
degree<00:01:07.890> angle<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:10.189> push<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.549> glide<00:01:12.770> turn

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.429 

and<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.270> looks<00:01:54.420> like<00:01:54.509> two<00:01:54.810> more

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
want to make it thick all the way into

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.819 
want to make it thick all the way into
the<00:02:03.670> center<00:02:03.850> because<00:02:04.630> well<00:02:05.079> and<00:02:05.560> came<00:02:05.799> a

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
the center because well and came a

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.039 
the center because well and came a
little<00:02:06.219> bit<00:02:06.340> off<00:02:06.460> I'm<00:02:06.670> sorry<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.689> don't<00:02:07.869> want

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
to make it thick all the way into the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.949 
to make it thick all the way into the
center<00:02:09.670> because<00:02:10.060> then<00:02:10.420> you'll<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.750> hard

center because then you'll have a hard
time<00:02:11.230> moving<00:02:11.980> your<00:02:12.400> tip<00:02:12.910> into<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
time moving your tip into it and the

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.800 
time moving your tip into it and the
last<00:02:14.080> part<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:15.010> take<00:02:15.370> tip<00:02:15.730> number<00:02:15.910> 12<00:02:16.299> you<00:02:16.599> see

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
last part is take tip number 12 you see

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.520 
last part is take tip number 12 you see
how<00:02:16.930> thick<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.959> go<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.319> center

how thick it is and you go in the center

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.390 
how thick it is and you go in the center
a<00:02:21.239> dot<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.540> that's<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:23.950> that's<00:02:24.190> the
