00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 to make a video as short and as 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.250
 small to be to explain the two 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.900
 steps of how to make a phone a way 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.330
 factory because they were asking me 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.220
 how to do it because many are 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.019
 is frozen and they do not know what to do and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 this is not only for the phone 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.830
 samsung galaxy s 4 but I'm going to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.660
 do in this other I'm going to demonstrate how 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.290
 is you can do it on any phone 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.360
 and so gives samsung 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.750
 and Android account you can do it with 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.250
 any of them and well let's say there 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.340
 two ways how to do it once 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.050
 turning off the phone and the other is fine 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.420
 be a modest when you can enter 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.820
 configurations the screen will be 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.020
 frozen and you can not have it no 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.760
 you can do anything neither here nor for 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.800
 help or anything but if you can enter 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.480
 Mode of settings on this occasion 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.210
 I'll show you how as a 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.220
 configurations that you go where it says 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.890
 accounts you look for what comes to be 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.050
 make a backup just 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.420
 as you see in the video where it says 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.090
 here where they tell you to reset values 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.540
 down in which in the bottom 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 finally you enter 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.610
 and there automatically it will go there 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.380
 as you see with the bottom part says 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.610
 restore values ​​and you just go 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.580
 to pressed there 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.200
 and well let's push and it's going to 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.050
 start the phone to restart and 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.450
 be made as a factory and how and that 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.990

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.020
 phone I have it about to go off 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.220
 well I want to explain this what 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.960
 you have to do is press the three 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.200
 buttons together at the same time and drop 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.670

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.930
 values ​​this factory mode when for 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.849
 what is done is mostly done to 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.950
 when you can load an application and 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.450
 this application does anyone make you live or 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.630
 that has something malicious and your phone 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.819
 I froze it or it just did not work 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.060
