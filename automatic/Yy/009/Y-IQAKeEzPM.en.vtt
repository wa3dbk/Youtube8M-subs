00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
ones that will allow us to cast while

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.749 
ones that will allow us to cast while
we're<00:01:16.619> moving<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.159> something<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.700> that

we're moving or something like that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.670

in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.790> game<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.450> anyway<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
in the game there anyway this is what I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.530 
in the game there anyway this is what I
can<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.770> right<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.670> anywhere<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.270> line

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
can do right now so anywhere in my line

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.270 
can do right now so anywhere in my line
of<00:01:27.570> side<00:01:27.869> right<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.890> cast<00:01:29.009> over

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
of side right now see I can cast over

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.770 
of side right now see I can cast over
here<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.579> can't<00:01:29.850> cast<00:01:30.060> over<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.659> my

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
here I can't cast over here because my

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
here I can't cast over here because my
line<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> sight<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.439> broken<00:01:31.860> there's<00:01:32.280> walls<00:01:32.549> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
line of sight is broken there's walls in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
line of sight is broken there's walls in
between<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.840> can't<00:01:34.320> cast<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.650> over

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
between me and that I can't cast it over

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
between me and that I can't cast it over
here<00:01:34.920> because<00:01:35.100> i<00:01:35.280> cannot<00:01:35.579> see<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.119> can

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
here because i cannot see that i can

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390 
here because i cannot see that i can
guess<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:36.869> over<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.409> i<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> but

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
guess it all over here if i want to but

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
guess it all over here if i want to but
let's<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.759> over<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.990> staff

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
let's do it over here and this staff

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.130 
let's do it over here and this staff
just<00:01:40.710> shoots<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.460> puff<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.030> all<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.780> just

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
just shoots out a puff of all just just

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.780 
just shoots out a puff of all just just
a<00:01:43.229> puff<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.649> clouds<00:01:43.950> basically<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.729> what

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
a puff of clouds basically that's what

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
a puff of clouds basically that's what
it<00:01:44.970> does<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.689> charge<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> few<00:01:46.380> seconds

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
it does the charge it for a few seconds

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
it does the charge it for a few seconds
for<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.159> second<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.640> two<00:01:47.670> actually<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.360> then

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
for a second or two actually and then

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
for a second or two actually and then
shoots<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> puff<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.979> only<00:01:50.189> does<00:01:50.369> one

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
shoots out the puff it only does one

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
shoots out the puff it only does one
damage<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.000> mobs<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.420> stuff<00:01:51.600> right<00:01:51.780> now<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
damage on mobs and stuff right now so

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.899 
damage on mobs and stuff right now so
it's<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:52.829> super<00:01:53.430> effective<00:01:53.700> or

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
it's not really super effective or

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.149 
it's not really super effective or
anything<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:55.860> fall

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
anything but it's more here to just fall

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
anything but it's more here to just fall
for<00:01:56.460> testing<00:01:56.790> purposes<00:01:57.180> basically<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.110> can

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
for testing purposes basically you can

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.569 
for testing purposes basically you can
also<00:01:58.350> right-click<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.979> staff<00:01:59.250> by<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> way

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
also right-click the staff by the way

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.580 
also right-click the staff by the way
which<00:01:59.790> also<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.299> powers<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.899> but

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
which also just powers it up but

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
which also just powers it up but
curiously<00:02:02.130> enough<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.600> let<00:02:03.810> go

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
curiously enough if you just let go

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
curiously enough if you just let go
right<00:02:04.200> click<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.890> lose<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> charge<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.700> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
right click you lose the charge and it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029 
right click you lose the charge and it
doesn't<00:02:06.060> shoot<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.110> hold<00:02:07.259> down<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.740> click

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
doesn't shoot if I hold down right click

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.309 
doesn't shoot if I hold down right click
and<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.060> suddenly<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.450> press<00:02:09.780> left<00:02:10.140> leg

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and if I suddenly just press left leg

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.590 
and if I suddenly just press left leg
while<00:02:10.470> I'm<00:02:10.560> still<00:02:10.709> holding<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.160> click

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
while I'm still holding right click

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.450 
while I'm still holding right click
it<00:02:12.260> will<00:02:12.410> actually<00:02:12.530> transfer<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.220> become

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
it will actually transfer and become

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.580 
it will actually transfer and become
more<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:14.060> left<00:02:14.240> click<00:02:14.360> attack<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.290> I'm

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
more the left click attack so I'm

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.650 
more the left click attack so I'm
thinking<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.610> well<00:02:17.030> these<00:02:17.390> staffs

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
thinking that this well these staffs

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.300 
thinking that this well these staffs
will<00:02:17.840> actually<00:02:18.080> have<00:02:18.170> two<00:02:18.350> functions<00:02:18.650> like<00:02:19.040> to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
will actually have two functions like to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.190 
will actually have two functions like to
sort<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.700> spells<00:02:19.970> tie<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.270> them<00:02:20.540> or<00:02:20.690> they<00:02:21.140> could

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
sort of spells tie to them or they could

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.990 
sort of spells tie to them or they could
possibly<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.740> more<00:02:21.980> spells<00:02:22.280> tied<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.850> them

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
possibly have more spells tied to them

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.520 
possibly have more spells tied to them
in<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.240> future<00:02:23.390> which<00:02:23.990> i<00:02:24.080> think<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.350> really

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
in the future which i think is really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.860 
in the future which i think is really
cool<00:02:24.710> idea<00:02:24.860> now<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.820> just<00:02:25.910> want<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.240> just

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
cool idea now I just want to just

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.630 
cool idea now I just want to just
demonstrate<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.740> tiny<00:02:27.920> bit<00:02:28.100> what<00:02:28.460> it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
demonstrate it just a tiny bit what it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.670 
demonstrate it just a tiny bit what it
will<00:02:28.790> actually<00:02:28.940> do<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.690> my<00:02:29.990> strapon<00:02:30.230> crashes

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
will actually do and my strapon crashes

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.740 
will actually do and my strapon crashes
so<00:02:31.010> let's<00:02:31.190> dive<00:02:31.340> back<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.790> okay<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:32.480> we

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
so let's dive back in okay so we

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.180 
so let's dive back in okay so we
actually<00:02:32.900> made<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.350> onto<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.710> planet<00:02:33.950> without

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
actually made it onto a planet without

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.460 
actually made it onto a planet without
crashing<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.570> really<00:02:35.600> good<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.440> now

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
crashing it which is really good so now

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.230 
crashing it which is really good so now
i<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.680> show<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:36.950> guys<00:02:37.130> what<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> size<00:02:38.000> staff

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
i can show you guys what the size staff

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.310 
i can show you guys what the size staff
would<00:02:38.390> do<00:02:38.540> i'm<00:02:38.720> not<00:02:38.870> sure<00:02:38.990> if<00:02:39.050> it<00:02:39.110> can<00:02:39.200> actually

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
would do i'm not sure if it can actually

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.280 
would do i'm not sure if it can actually
destroy<00:02:39.650> us<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.610> can<00:02:41.570> destroy<00:02:41.870> us<00:02:42.110> but

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
destroy us it can destroy us but

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.410 
destroy us it can destroy us but
i'm<00:02:42.410> not<00:02:42.530> sure<00:02:42.590> if<00:02:42.800> it's<00:02:42.860> okay<00:02:43.460> so<00:02:44.210> right<00:02:44.390> now

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
i'm not sure if it's okay so right now

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.790 
i'm not sure if it's okay so right now
it's<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:44.810> not<00:02:45.020> do<00:02:45.140> enough<00:02:45.350> damage<00:02:45.410> to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
it's just not do enough damage to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.140 
it's just not do enough damage to
actually<00:02:46.040> one<00:02:46.220> shot<00:02:46.430> those<00:02:46.610> but<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.000> can

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
actually one shot those but it can

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.910 
actually one shot those but it can
destroy<00:02:47.480> them<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.870> fact<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.350> look<00:02:48.710> at<00:02:48.770> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
destroy them in fact and look at this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.190 
destroy them in fact and look at this
and<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:50.000> basically<00:02:50.180> have<00:02:50.570> unlimited<00:02:51.080> range

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
and you basically have unlimited range

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.810 
and you basically have unlimited range
as<00:02:51.470> far<00:02:51.680> as<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:51.860> can<00:02:51.980> see<00:02:52.190> which<00:02:52.400> i<00:02:52.520> think<00:02:52.580> is

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
as far as you can see which i think is

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.610 
as far as you can see which i think is
really<00:02:53.030> cool<00:02:53.270> i<00:02:53.360> mean<00:02:53.480> look<00:02:53.600> at<00:02:53.660> this<00:02:53.810> second

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
really cool i mean look at this second

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.350 
really cool i mean look at this second
just<00:02:54.740> cast<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.160> them<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.910> will<00:02:56.060> hit<00:02:56.270> him

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
just cast it on them and it will hit him

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.240 
just cast it on them and it will hit him
a<00:02:56.480> few<00:02:56.510> times<00:02:56.870> as<00:02:57.200> you<00:02:57.320> can<00:02:57.470> actually<00:02:57.710> vote

gonna do I'm hoping there's gonna be
like<00:03:06.530> different<00:03:06.980> forecheck<00:03:07.250> tiles<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:07.670> stuff

because<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.410> well<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.590> possibilities<00:03:10.280> with

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
because the well the possibilities with

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.160 
because the well the possibilities with
this<00:03:10.610> weapon<00:03:10.850> type<00:03:11.210> is<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.780> pretty<00:03:11.960> damn

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
this weapon type is just pretty damn

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.230 
this weapon type is just pretty damn
endless<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.830> I'm<00:03:12.890> really<00:03:13.070> excited<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.940> see<00:03:14.090> it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
endless and I'm really excited to see it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.960 
endless and I'm really excited to see it
just<00:03:14.450> execute<00:03:15.020> it<00:03:15.140> more<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.620> think<00:03:16.580> this<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.850> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
just execute it more I think this is a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.790 
just execute it more I think this is a
really<00:03:17.150> cool<00:03:17.330> idea<00:03:17.480> it's<00:03:18.080> not<00:03:18.260> really<00:03:18.440> magic

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
really cool idea it's not really magic

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.340 
really cool idea it's not really magic
because<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.670> are<00:03:19.940> using<00:03:20.270> technology<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.960> cast

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
because you are using technology to cast

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.920 
because you are using technology to cast
sort<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.100> magic<00:03:22.460> like<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.510> said<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:23.840> a

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
sort of magic like like I said it's a

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.200 
sort of magic like like I said it's a
size<00:03:24.170> staff<00:03:24.470> i'm<00:03:24.740> i'm<00:03:25.520> not<00:03:25.700> sure<00:03:25.880> if<00:03:26.090> it

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
size staff i'm i'm not sure if it

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.480 
size staff i'm i'm not sure if it
actually<00:03:26.450> is<00:03:26.780> magic<00:03:27.200> it<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.710> using<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.130> gem

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
actually is magic it is using a gem

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.060 
actually is magic it is using a gem
which<00:03:29.180> i<00:03:29.360> think<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.810> well<00:03:30.110> yeah<00:03:30.500> i<00:03:30.530> think<00:03:30.740> it's

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
which i think is well yeah i think it's

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.590 
which i think is well yeah i think it's
powered<00:03:31.340> by<00:03:31.370> technology<00:03:31.940> instead<00:03:32.180> of<00:03:32.300> magic

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
powered by technology instead of magic

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.870 
powered by technology instead of magic
we<00:03:32.930> can<00:03:33.050> debate<00:03:33.290> this<00:03:33.500> arm<00:03:33.800> all<00:03:34.130> we<00:03:34.490> can<00:03:34.640> debate

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
we can debate this arm all we can debate

the<00:03:37.460> size<00:03:37.670> staff<00:03:37.940> i<00:03:38.180> think<00:03:38.600> this<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.780> gonna<00:03:38.900> be

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050
