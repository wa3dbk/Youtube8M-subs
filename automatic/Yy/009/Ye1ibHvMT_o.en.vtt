00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
these at least in the level we were

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.720 
these at least in the level we were
shown<00:02:42.380> today<00:02:42.590> they<00:02:43.160> had<00:02:43.340> optional<00:02:43.670> objectives

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
shown today they had optional objectives

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.729 
shown today they had optional objectives
as<00:02:44.209> well<00:02:44.239> which<00:02:44.780> changed<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.290> rest<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.650> the

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
as well which changed the rest of the

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.890 
as well which changed the rest of the
level<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.670> let's<00:02:47.209> take<00:02:47.360> for<00:02:47.450> example<00:02:47.510> this

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
level so let's take for example this

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.720 
level so let's take for example this
level<00:02:48.170> we<00:02:48.230> were<00:02:48.320> shown<00:02:48.530> is<00:02:48.680> called<00:02:48.890> sky<00:02:49.220> lantus

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
level we were shown is called sky lantus

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.060 
level we were shown is called sky lantus
there<00:02:50.120> was<00:02:50.239> an<00:02:50.360> area<00:02:50.690> in<00:02:50.900> there<00:02:51.140> where<00:02:51.590> you

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
there was an area in there where you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.010 
there was an area in there where you
could<00:02:52.310> players<00:02:52.489> up<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.790> submarine<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.540> go

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
could players up a submarine so you go

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.570 
could players up a submarine so you go
through<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.230> submarine<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.310> optional

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
through the submarine and the optional

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.850 
through the submarine and the optional
objective<00:02:56.000> was<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.209> destroy<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> storm

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
objective was to destroy a storm

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.009 
objective was to destroy a storm
generator<00:02:58.370> now<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:58.850> think<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.570> way<00:02:59.660> it<00:02:59.840> works

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
generator now I think the way it works

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.570 
generator now I think the way it works
is<00:03:00.200> if<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.410> destroy<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:00.920> storm<00:03:01.160> generator

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
is if you destroy that storm generator

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.630 
is if you destroy that storm generator
the<00:03:02.209> fog<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.500> quite<00:03:03.830> prevalent<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.489> that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
the fog that is quite prevalent in that

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.020 
the fog that is quite prevalent in that
level<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.810> then<00:03:06.200> removed<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.100> it's<00:03:07.760> not<00:03:07.970> just

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
level is then removed so it's not just

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.060 
level is then removed so it's not just
now<00:03:08.480> they<00:03:08.690> offer<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.049> bonus<00:03:09.410> items<00:03:09.799> these

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
now it's like let's have the equal

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.810 
now it's like let's have the equal
sections<00:03:44.150> hmm<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.560> don't<00:03:46.220> know<00:03:46.430> if<00:03:46.580> it's

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820

and with this game but you can't trap
enemies<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:12.340> them<00:04:12.670> basically<00:04:13.330> if<00:04:13.540> you<00:04:13.660> put<00:04:13.840> a

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
enemies in them basically if you put a

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.160 
enemies in them basically if you put a
trap<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:15.190> gives<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:16.120> mo<00:04:16.750> for<00:04:17.049> your

vehicle<00:04:17.489> relative<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.640> element<00:04:18.910> so<00:04:19.480> you

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
vehicle relative to that element so you

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.690 
vehicle relative to that element so you
put<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> live<00:04:19.930> trap<00:04:20.230> in<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.560> get<00:04:20.709> life<00:04:20.920> mo<00:04:21.310> it
