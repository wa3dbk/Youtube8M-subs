00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the kids then I leave here a video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.830
 in which we hunt a kid who 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.750
 flame network mason hunter network using the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.889
 x-ray that is a kind of hack like the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.990
 what are you seeing, we use it 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.030
 to hunt down people who really 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.710
 is and is a hack to know where 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 are the minerals and the truth is that 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.250
 people do not know we have plugins 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.590
 fighting equity and see that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.960
 we warn we warn but we have already hunted 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.519
 a lot of people so as I say 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.260
 they always recommend using it because we're going 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.880
 to end up catching and nothing that I leave the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.410
 video so you can see the procedure 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.300
 that we do before we shoot at 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.790
 people who use x-ray we make ourselves 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.410
 invisible and we do the following good 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 the skype conversation is between david 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.040
 of special and I and the only bad thing is that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 my voice was not recorded I had it set 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 so my voice will not be recorded but good 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.450
 I think that is pretty much understood 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.450
 to hit a jump 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 to put it another iron band 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.250
 Let's see 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.590
 goes for the diamonds from to 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.490
 let's go the diamonds that we can 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490
 download it 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.170
 the voice is being recorded 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 that leaves aside 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.460
 and not 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.740
 have us for washing machine 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.250
 and another one we have in the neighborhood x of 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 09 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.849
 yes before 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.849
 and the stability of the tours 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.540
 fuck but if above is that they are 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.540
 asshole because in the options of 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.540
 soft 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.700
 and then power to then upload 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.090
 again and continue there has more opposite 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.090
 in front of 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.980
 it's straight 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.290
 hears 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.129
 and in lads like you do you go to 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.440
 finish as you are doing with this 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.760
 man I will vary the ip you are not going to 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.680
 be able to reenter highland like that 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.090
 that recommends doing it and nasals I hope 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.680

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.310

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.310
