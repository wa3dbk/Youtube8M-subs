being basically a 48 millimeter wide

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.370 
being basically a 48 millimeter wide
square<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> large<00:00:27.170> timepiece<00:00:28.170> not

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
square this is a large timepiece not

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.089 
square this is a large timepiece not
quite<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.619> scare

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
quite a scare

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.410 
quite a scare
square<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.640> some<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.939> those<00:00:30.029> rounded

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
square you have some of those rounded

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
square you have some of those rounded
edges<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.080> that's<00:00:31.500> essential<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.099> we

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
edges there but that's essential that we

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.170 
edges there but that's essential that we
have<00:00:33.230> this<00:00:34.230> version<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.880> sort<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
have this version is in this sort of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.670 
have this version is in this sort of
rosed<00:00:36.899> gold<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:39.059> know<00:00:39.210> toned<00:00:39.570> steel<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
rosed gold you know toned steel so I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.400 
rosed gold you know toned steel so I
think<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> PVD<00:00:41.640> coating<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.140> steel

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
think it's a PVD coating on the steel

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
think it's a PVD coating on the steel
but<00:00:43.590> there's<00:00:43.739> also<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> black<00:00:44.370> version<00:00:44.969> there

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
but there's also a black version there

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.510 
but there's also a black version there
as<00:00:45.989> well<00:00:46.200> as<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.710> steel<00:00:46.950> version<00:00:47.280> let's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
as well as I think a steel version let's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.389 
as well as I think a steel version let's
let's<00:00:47.730> put<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.200> beast<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.559> watch<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
let's put this beast of a watch on the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.200 
let's put this beast of a watch on the
chrono<00:00:50.670> beast

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
chrono beast

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.260 
chrono beast
it<00:00:51.480> sounds<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.230> Jurassic<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
it sounds very like Jurassic I just I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.310 
it sounds very like Jurassic I just I
think<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.510> need<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.690> come<00:00:54.840> out<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> watch

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
think I need to come out with a watch

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.010 
think I need to come out with a watch
called<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> Jurassic<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
called the Jurassic so there you have it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.720 
called the Jurassic so there you have it
again<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.379> don't<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> largest<00:00:59.070> wrists<00:00:59.640> in

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
again I don't have the largest wrists in

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
again I don't have the largest wrists in
the<00:00:59.820> world<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:01.079> small<00:01:01.440> wrist

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the world but if you have small wrist

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.160 
the world but if you have small wrist
this<00:01:01.890> might<00:01:02.100> completely<00:01:02.579> dwarf<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.960> wrist

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this might completely dwarf your wrist

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.750 
this might completely dwarf your wrist
or<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.589> might<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:05.070> awesome<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.610> your

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
or this might just look awesome on your

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.280 
or this might just look awesome on your
wrist<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> big<00:01:06.689> watch<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
wrist so if you like a big watch this is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.980 
wrist so if you like a big watch this is
it<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:08.040> glad<00:01:08.250> for<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.520> hands<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it and I'm glad for the hands are you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.210 
it and I'm glad for the hands are you
know<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.260> thin<00:01:10.530> hands<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.100> they're

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
know they're thin hands but they're

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.990 
know they're thin hands but they're
reasonably<00:01:11.880> long<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.990> terms<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.500> their<00:01:13.619> size

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
reasonably long in terms of their size

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.330 
reasonably long in terms of their size
so<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.530> nice<00:01:16.799> legible

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so that you get you know a nice legible

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.649 
so that you get you know a nice legible
look<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> tell<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.270> big<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.509> is

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
look but you can tell how big it is

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
look but you can tell how big it is
because<00:01:18.990> most<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> features<00:01:19.710> are<00:01:19.979> kind<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
because most of the features are kind of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.649 
because most of the features are kind of
in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> middle<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.479> sort

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
in the middle there and so there's sort

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
in the middle there and so there's sort
of<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.930> actually<00:01:25.770> recessed<00:01:26.280> area<00:01:26.759> which<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
of this actually recessed area which I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.390 
of this actually recessed area which I
think<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:27.900> big<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.170> dial<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.799> supposed<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
think is how big the dial is supposed to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.969 
think is how big the dial is supposed to
be<00:01:29.610> or<00:01:30.000> suggested<00:01:30.840> for<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> movement<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
be or suggested for the movement and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
be or suggested for the movement and
then<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.090> larger<00:01:33.479> area<00:01:33.509> there

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
then you have this larger area there

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.590 
then you have this larger area there
with<00:01:34.680> those<00:01:34.799> Roman<00:01:35.130> numeral<00:01:35.400> Roman<00:01:36.299> numeral

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
with those Roman numeral Roman numeral

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.270 
with those Roman numeral Roman numeral
our<00:01:36.750> indicators<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.740> know<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.100> very

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
our indicators you know this is very

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.890 
our indicators you know this is very
kind<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.670> hybrid<00:01:39.060> design<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> have

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
kind of hybrid design here you have

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
kind of hybrid design here you have
classic<00:01:40.619> elements<00:01:41.100> again<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.460> these<00:01:41.610> Roman

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
classic elements again with these Roman

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.870 
classic elements again with these Roman
numeral<00:01:42.320> elements<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.729> sort

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
numeral elements and then you have sort

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.789 
numeral elements and then you have sort
of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> sporty<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.530> interesting

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
of the sporty look and it's interesting

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
of the sporty look and it's interesting
sort<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> combination<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.509> it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
sort of combination I think it's a it's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.160 
sort of combination I think it's a it's
an<00:01:49.020> overall<00:01:49.399> interesting<00:01:50.399> design<00:01:51.170> it's

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
an overall interesting design it's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
an overall interesting design it's
definitely<00:01:52.590> novel<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.610> course

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
definitely novel and there is of course

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.969 
definitely novel and there is of course
loom<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> hands<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.470> legibility

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
loom there on the hands for legibility

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.260 
loom there on the hands for legibility
so<00:01:56.040> let's<00:01:56.189> talk<00:01:56.310> about<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> movement<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.210> is

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
so let's talk about the movement this is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.209 
so let's talk about the movement this is
a<00:01:57.420> Swiss<00:01:57.719> quartz<00:01:57.990> movement<00:01:58.170> Saranda

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
a Swiss quartz movement Saranda

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.200 
a Swiss quartz movement Saranda
it's<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.820> Ronda<00:02:00.360> calibre<00:02:01.700> 5130<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
it's a Ronda calibre 5130 so it's a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.050 
it's a Ronda calibre 5130 so it's a
quartz<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> lot<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.530> stuff<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
quartz but it does a lot of stuff so

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.429 
quartz but it does a lot of stuff so
what<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.290> course

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
what you have here is you have of course

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.130 
what you have here is you have of course
the<00:02:07.649> time<00:02:08.000> there<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.569> subsidiary

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the time there you have the subsidiary

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.700 
the time there you have the subsidiary
second<00:02:10.649> style<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> Kronecker

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
second style I have the Kronecker

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.610 
second style I have the Kronecker
running<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.520> here<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.450> sub<00:02:13.720> dial<00:02:13.990> you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
running so here in this sub dial you

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.070 
running so here in this sub dial you
have<00:02:15.000> hands<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.210> both<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.570> chronograph

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
have hands for both the chronograph

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.160 
have hands for both the chronograph
minutes<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.730> hour<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.480> there's<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.750> 30

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
minutes and the hour so there's a 30

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.680 
minutes and the hour so there's a 30
minute<00:02:20.620> counter<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.190> then<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.880> hour<00:02:22.300> hand

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
minute counter and then the hour hand

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.410 
minute counter and then the hour hand
will<00:02:22.870> move<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.290> stops<00:02:23.730> again<00:02:24.730> it's<00:02:25.030> it's

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
will move to stops again it's it's

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.120 
will move to stops again it's it's
smaller<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.260> need<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.980> know

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
smaller so you need to have you know

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.760 
smaller so you need to have you know
good<00:02:27.490> eyes<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.560> have<00:02:29.710> a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
good eyes to see that but you do have a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.250 
good eyes to see that but you do have a
full<00:02:30.040> 12<00:02:30.340> hour<00:02:30.580> chronograph<00:02:31.150> big<00:02:32.020> date

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
full 12 hour chronograph big date

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530 
full 12 hour chronograph big date
indicator<00:02:32.770> up<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.490> down<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:34.120> is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
indicator up there and down here is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.320 
indicator up there and down here is
alarm<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.320> have<00:02:35.500> chronograph<00:02:36.330> calendar

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
alarm so you have chronograph calendar

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.690 
alarm so you have chronograph calendar
and<00:02:38.170> alarm<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.950> there's<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.250> lot<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.520> features

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
and alarm so there's a lot of features

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.450 
and alarm so there's a lot of features
here<00:02:40.090> which<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:40.690> interesting<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:42.160> you

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
here which is interesting that you you

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.060 
here which is interesting that you you
might<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:42.820> see<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.210> again<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:44.410> rod<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.800> 50

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
might not see and again the rod of 50

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.160 
might not see and again the rod of 50
130<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.610> not<00:02:45.790> exactly<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.300> common<00:02:46.690> movement<00:02:46.900> so

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
130 is not exactly a common movement so

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.140 
130 is not exactly a common movement so
you're<00:02:47.320> not<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.650> see<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.100> ton<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.700> watches

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
you're not going to see a ton of watches

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.900 
you're not going to see a ton of watches
out<00:02:49.270> there<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:50.290> have<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.730> there's

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
out there that have it you know there's

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.580 
out there that have it you know there's
a<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.330> strap<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.050> very<00:02:53.080> wide<00:02:53.440> it's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
a the strap is very wide it's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.820 
a the strap is very wide it's
cool-looking<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:55.330> it's<00:02:55.900> it's<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.500> course

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
cool-looking and it's it's of course

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.770 
cool-looking and it's it's of course
it's<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.460> niche<00:02:57.700> watch<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.540> sense

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
it's a it's a niche watch in the sense

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.410 
it's a it's a niche watch in the sense
that<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.050> isn't<00:02:59.230> going<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.530> be<00:02:59.710> a<00:03:00.030> main<00:03:01.030> sort

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
that this isn't going to be a main sort

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.120 
that this isn't going to be a main sort
of<00:03:01.510> mainstream<00:03:02.020> thing<00:03:02.320> but<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.650> think<00:03:03.010> there's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
of mainstream thing but I think there's

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.350 
of mainstream thing but I think there's
a<00:03:03.190> lot<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.400> things<00:03:03.580> done<00:03:03.760> right<00:03:03.820> here<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.300> if

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
a lot of things done right here and if
