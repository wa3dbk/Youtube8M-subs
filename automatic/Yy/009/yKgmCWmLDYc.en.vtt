you will to allow that to happen and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.609 
you will to allow that to happen and
also<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.210> ever<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.540> any<00:01:28.110> chance<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
also if if there ever is any chance of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.010 
also if if there ever is any chance of
moisture<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.460> inside<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> light<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
moisture to get inside the light this is
a<00:01:31.049> breathable<00:01:31.829> membrane<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.939> allow<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
a breathable membrane to allow it to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.350 
a breathable membrane to allow it to
escape<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.400> out<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.210> kind

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
escape so it's got a way out so it kind

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.719 
escape so it's got a way out so it kind
of<00:01:36.420> serves<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.780> dual<00:01:36.960> purpose<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:38.549> course

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.070 
Phoenix Cobra T six light we've actually
had<00:02:26.489> several<00:02:27.060> customers<00:02:27.480> look<00:02:27.690> at<00:02:27.840> them<00:02:27.959> as

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
had several customers look at them as

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.360 
had several customers look at them as
well<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:29.640> know<00:02:29.730> next<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> each<00:02:30.209> other<00:02:30.360> and

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
well you know next to each other and

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.870 
well you know next to each other and
they<00:02:32.370> agree<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.980> basically<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.700> an

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
they agree so basically just a just an

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.900 
they agree so basically just a just an
overview<00:02:36.290> full<00:02:37.290> aluminum<00:02:37.800> casing<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.760> it's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
overview full aluminum casing so it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.039 
overview full aluminum casing so it's
going<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> protect<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.510> light<00:02:39.690> very<00:02:39.959> well

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
going to protect the light very well

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.979 
going to protect the light very well
this<00:02:41.010> is<00:02:41.250> kind<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.810> plastic<00:02:42.810> e

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
this is kind of like a plastic e

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.710 
this is kind of like a plastic e
polycarbonate<00:02:43.830> kind<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.250> material<00:02:44.760> with<00:02:45.690> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
polycarbonate kind of material with a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.920 
polycarbonate kind of material with a
fluted<00:02:46.700> front<00:02:47.700> lens<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.360> help<00:02:48.540> disperse<00:02:48.870> the

fluted front lens to help disperse the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.240 
fluted front lens to help disperse the
light<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:50.989> again<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.170> it's<00:02:52.440> very<00:02:52.709> small<00:02:53.010> so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
light and again it's it's very small so

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.979 
light and again it's it's very small so
