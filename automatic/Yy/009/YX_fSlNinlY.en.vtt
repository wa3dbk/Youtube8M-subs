00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.269
 hello my dear viewer having read your 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.940
 comments and reviews 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.110
 I understand that you really like the brick 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.570
 pirate series 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.029
 and now it's finally gone 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.830
 time i listened to your words 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.349
 and now in my hands 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.509
 the most interesting set is something like 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.290
 pirate base pirate lair 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:32.200
 pirate bay call it what you want 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:35.260
 Essentially this does not change this is the base of pirates 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.080
 here dwell in this place are going 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.370
 the most hardened such pirates who 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.740
 not afraid of no water or not guns Knights 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.079
 who chase the pirates article 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.520
 set 309 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.920
 here is 1 9 years old pirates series 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.420
 206 details here we can see me 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.000
 I understand the pirate treasure and this is something 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.310
 similarity trap when gontar sly 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.729
 runs up here trying to steal treasure 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.280
 the trap works and cuts it 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.280
 these axes also we can see 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.240
 of course pet pirates it 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.999
 monkey and crocodile which also 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.539
 guard the treasure here us guns and how I 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:23.170
 I understand the pirates brought new prey here 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.509
 they are 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.060
 raw platform came the boss we found by 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.100
 this map is the treasure he is 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.259
 pretty not saying if you didn't find me 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.509
 would have blown you up we’re drawing it and 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.670
 so carefree pirates lie drags behind 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.249
 on a rope 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.770
 a barrel of rum to wash the loot 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.630
 consider from the back here as 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.859
 there are always modifications that 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.889
 can design 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:55.689
 without the help of instructions let's 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:58.060
 open this set of cars here with us 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.979
 There is a big package in which there is still 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.229
 small packages instruction form 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:13.000
 little books rarely you see the brick 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:15.220
 instructions form books and platform yet 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.950
 heap of details it is apparently mountains 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.709
 but here are friends we have collected our pirate 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.510
 the lair looks like she is very cool to me 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.060
 I really liked it by myself 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.659
 I think the design is nothing superfluous 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.739
 In general, there are no such nuances 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.099
 the only thing i didn't like 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.500
 this 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.810
 in the design itself along the way I'm you 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.549
 I'll tell you let's start with a little 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.670
 in the set is such a boat with 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:45.700
 a chest and a chest with us like you 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.439
 think that you spent in the chest with us 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.650
 gold which pirates have grabbed somewhere 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:56.560
 and driven to their base also in a set of 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.709
 We are here like this, but the crocodile 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:04.569
 or alligator probably he's here what are you 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.909
 guard the loot 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.090
 monkey 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:12.790
 also simple interesting i think for 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.590
 minifigure it does not count therefore not 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.049
 I will drag her to minifigur 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.040
 Now what about the construction itself to me 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.650
 let's like everything in order 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.129
 for starters, this one here too 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.069
 made very cool here you can it 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:33.700
 see just that simple 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.799
 the design is very interesting here gun 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.079
 and not only is it not just a duck cannon 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.090
 she also shoots you now 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.829
 demonstrate it so put here 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.819
 projectile so how to grasp so 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.010
 comfortably pull and shoot like that 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.890
 before the kind seen in the BRIC 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.349
 and now they have already started doing something 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.420
 this goes to a new level so 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.540
 say right here you can see on 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.700
 the pillar is hanging on this 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.800
 the barrel can be removed 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.150
 and you know, I told you first what was there 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.220
 rum but I was wrong there such here 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.319
 gems here we see something 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.370
 similarity 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.350
 armory here we have a pickaxe and weapons and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.320
 Of course, the highlight of this set 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.750
 it's a trap now I'll show you how it is 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.570
 acts otkovyrnut curious pirate 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.750
 stole our gold and then sent 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.490
 on the way here is the trap 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.889
 I wonder what I did not like about this 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.770
 designs as a matter of fact it must hold 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:46.470
 You see here it falls so it can 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.300
 conceived I don't know anyway on 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.090
 the picture was shown to be holding 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.190
 and I do not hold want to draw your 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.530
 attention to the fact that the creators of brik 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.870
 finally began to do some other 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.560
 lights can on camera it is not very 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.240
 noticeably but they are more such 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.350
 detailed volumetric this is also not 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.139
 may not please 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.919
 Well, with regards to the design it's all going on 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.919
 to man 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.840
 Well, I wanted to tell a little bit but 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.540
 This mini-figures this apparently assistant 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.810
 captain because he is such the most 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.020
 the most courageous in appearance the most discreet and the most 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.550
 one-eyed and of course the captain is 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.550
 brown beard 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.850
 let's call her so one-eyed brown 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.370
 a beard, of course, it’s not for me 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.620
 really like the captain need 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.780
 was to make something more solid the same 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.880
 the assistant captain looks like it is respectable 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.560
 than the captain himself is a mess 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.810
 most interesting set we are with you today 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.660
 I disassembled it very much 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.479
 perhaps I'll put you as much as 10 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.090
 points this is the second time I already 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.490
 pirate series put 10 points only 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.150
 she in my opinion is a shield designer bric and 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.550
 does not allow him to go into the abyss 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.039
 chinese lego counterparts i think u you 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.169
 liked this set because the price 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.380
 its only 300 rubles for such 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.169
 coolest set with a bunch of minifigures 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:23.050
 very cheap price and very good 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.750
 quality really advise everyone to this set 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.479
