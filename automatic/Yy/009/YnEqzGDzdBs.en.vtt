week for a year however the fact of the
matter<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.100> basic<00:01:41.700> motions<00:01:42.270> work

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
matter is that the basic motions work

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.080 
matter is that the basic motions work
for<00:01:42.780> everyone<00:01:43.290> from<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.009> complete<00:01:44.610> novice

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
for everyone from your complete novice

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.469 
for everyone from your complete novice
to<00:01:45.390> an<00:01:45.630> IFBB<00:01:46.320> Pro<00:01:46.610> alright<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.240> aren't

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
to an IFBB Pro alright so if you aren't

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
to an IFBB Pro alright so if you aren't
supposed<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.990> change<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> exercises<00:01:50.399> all

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
supposed to change of the exercises all

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.880 
supposed to change of the exercises all
the<00:01:50.700> time<00:01:50.909> then<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.409> supposed<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the time then what are you supposed to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.370 
the time then what are you supposed to
change<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.579> touched<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.570> earlier<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
change I touched on it earlier but the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.499 
change I touched on it earlier but the
most<00:01:55.590> important<00:01:56.340> variables<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> training<00:01:57.450> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
most important variables and training in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.800 
most important variables and training in
my<00:01:57.780> opinion<00:01:58.290> are<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> weights<00:01:59.250> reps<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.210> rest

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
my opinion are the weights reps and rest
