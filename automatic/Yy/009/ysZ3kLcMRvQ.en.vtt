00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:02.400
 platform that lifts the stretcher to the 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.400
 same level of the operating room 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.330
 own generator that works with 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.210
 diesel provides the energy for 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.420
 surgery and sterilization equipment 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 air conditioning the patient is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.980
 an indigenous Shuar suffering from hernia 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.380
 inguinal and has come to be operated from the 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.360
 Jungle do not speak any Spanish 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.130
 an assistant who speaks Shuar will make 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.420
 interpreter so that the patient can 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.420
 collaborate with doctors 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.770
 pullman and the type of anesthesia that is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.420
 is going to apply is regional is to say that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.460
 It will only effect the waist for 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.290
 baptize is placed a little anesthesia 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.240
 local at a point in the column 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.310
 vertebral and then enter a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.680
 Special needle with a guide inside 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.380
 that will indicate to the doctor that he is right in 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.320
 the precise place is then injected the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.170
 anesthetic for the operation the patient 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.670
 will be aware and wake up all the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.670
 how long this intervention lasts 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.250
 has the advantage of visca authorizing 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.110
 the glasses are 6 o'clock in the afternoon and 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.209
 doctors have carried out 18 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.950
 operations today is pretty much 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.010
 a number of operations that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.870
 performed by 25 surgeons in a day in 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.020
 the hospital vicente corral moscoso in 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.390
 basin 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.380
 an immense mysticism is what moves 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.810
 teachers and students 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.390
 the pace of work was very intense but 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.660
 the people collaborated until it touches him 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.660
 now 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.370
 and the same operation 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.260
 and we wonder why come here for 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 what does not make it easier for people to come to 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.550
 the big hospitals if I do not see the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.280
 human aspect of people in the field 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.350
 for people it's all a huge problem 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.110
 and not without reason to go out to the city 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.030
 where they are abused always mistreated 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.550
 with air of superiority on the part of the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.590
 people from the city ​​from the porters of 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.110
 the institutions to the doctors of 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.030
 our institutions constitutes a 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.060
 huge trauma to the people who have to 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.130
 leave your field your hut your animals 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.490
 to move to the city 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.370
 I thought it was much more human to carry 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.140
 medical care to their own habitat there 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.239
 so many beautiful things that can be 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.610
 enjoy as the nature of these 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:35.340
 fields this climate the landscape and the people 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.440
 same then we are seeing people 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.010
 in its purest form I think that that is 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.200
 contagious and one is contagious in something if 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.510
 well is already a little bit corrupted by the 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.720
 civilization but nevertheless I think that 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.310
 we all learn here 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.220
 Dr. Edgar Rodas Andrade surgeon 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.960
 university professor researcher 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.420
 Minister of Health and author of numerous 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.330
 publications continued touring the country 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.760
 during the next 20 years together 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.320
 a team of medical professionals from the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.750
 foundation cnse members were made 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.760
 785 missions in the isuzu truck called 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.160
 the mobile operating room to reach the 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.239
 less accessible places of various 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.580
 provinces of the country where it was possible to do 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.830
 7500 five surgeries for the benefit of 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.810
 people most in need 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.020
 Dr. Rhodes leaves the Equator a 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.580
 enormous legacy of surrender and sacrifice 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.680
 embodied in a great dream that has 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.560
 become a commitment that 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.480
 will continue his colleagues and friends the 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.520
 mobile operating rooms have managed to break 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.640
 the barriers of time and geography 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.919
 to become health carriers 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.500
 what for edgar rodas was what 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.620
 truly important when he said 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.050
 that medicine as a profession is a 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.639
 source of services before a source 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.520
 of light 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.520
 that is always transmitted
