school sorry about that guys but I

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.460 
school sorry about that guys but I
especially<00:00:26.580> like<00:00:27.150> today<00:00:27.600> because<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
especially like today because it

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.590 
especially like today because it
demonstrates<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.580> importance<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.300> who<00:00:30.480> we

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
demonstrates the importance of who we

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200 
demonstrates the importance of who we
have<00:00:30.750> become<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.219> process<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> who<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.180> are

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
have become in the process of who we are

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.020 
have become in the process of who we are
becoming<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:34.050> walk<00:00:34.800> across<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.370> stage<00:00:35.670> is

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
becoming I walk across the stage is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.689 
becoming I walk across the stage is
meaningful<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:38.039> because<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
meaningful I think not just because the

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.479 
meaningful I think not just because the
future<00:00:38.879> holds<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.570> much<00:00:39.749> promise<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.260> us<00:00:40.559> but

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
future holds so much promise for us but

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
future holds so much promise for us but
because<00:00:41.809> what<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.109> already<00:00:43.289> done<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
because what we have already done is

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.470 
because what we have already done is
just<00:00:44.429> so<00:00:45.530> promising<00:00:46.699> let<00:00:47.699> me<00:00:47.819> tell<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> about

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
just so promising let me tell you about
