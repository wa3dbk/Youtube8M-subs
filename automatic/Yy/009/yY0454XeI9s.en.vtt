goalkeeper<00:01:01.980> attributes<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.730> basically

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
goalkeeper attributes are just basically

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.179 
goalkeeper attributes are just basically
the<00:01:03.239> card<00:01:03.480> face<00:01:03.750> stats<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the card face stats there you know you

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
can see there's no difference from what

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.990 
can see there's no difference from what
we've<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> card<00:01:08.250> phase<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we've got on the card phase and then you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
we've got on the card phase and then you
can<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> other<00:01:09.600> end<00:01:09.840> game<00:01:10.049> stats<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.590> see

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
can see the other end game stats you see

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.980 
can see the other end game stats you see
is<00:01:10.890> shrimp<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.340> 67<00:01:11.880> his<00:01:11.970> reaction<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.540> 78

is shrimp at 67 his reaction at 78

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.660 
is shrimp at 67 his reaction at 78
that's<00:01:13.470> probably<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> only<00:01:13.920> other<00:01:14.369> ones<00:01:14.580> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that's probably the only other ones that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
that's probably the only other ones that
really<00:01:14.939> make<00:01:15.270> any<00:01:15.479> difference<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.170> if<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
really make any difference and if you

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.230 
really make any difference and if you
look<00:01:16.920> at<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> other<00:01:17.400> attributes<00:01:18.090> the

look at all the other attributes the
wall<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.570> bread<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:18.990> don't<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.560> make

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
wall in bread but they don't really make

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.590 
wall in bread but they don't really make
any<00:01:20.369> difference<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> goalkeeper

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
