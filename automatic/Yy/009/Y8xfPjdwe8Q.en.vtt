the book

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
the book
I<00:00:34.920> liked<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.520> almost<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> standalone

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
I liked it almost more as a standalone

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.670 
I liked it almost more as a standalone
than<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:38.010> did<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.210> trilogy

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
than I actually did as a trilogy

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
than I actually did as a trilogy
I<00:00:40.710> know<00:00:40.860> hollow<00:00:41.280> cities<00:00:41.670> already<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:42.149> but

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I know hollow cities already out but

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
I know hollow cities already out but
I've<00:00:42.510> had<00:00:42.660> no<00:00:42.690> desire<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> actually<00:00:43.890> buy<00:00:44.129> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
I've had no desire to actually buy it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.670 
I've had no desire to actually buy it
but<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> put<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.660> number<00:00:45.930> 5<00:00:46.170> because

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but I put this one at number 5 because

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
but I put this one at number 5 because
there<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> slight<00:00:47.850> chance<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.840> might

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there is a slight chance that I might

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.049 
there is a slight chance that I might
eventually<00:00:49.320> read<00:00:50.250> hollow<00:00:51.180> City<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.500> not

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
eventually read hollow City but it's not

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
eventually read hollow City but it's not
anytime<00:00:54.059> soon<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:55.110> liked<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
anytime soon I liked it more as a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340 
anytime soon I liked it more as a
standalone<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.670> I'd<00:00:56.730> rather<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.210> keep<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
standalone so I'd rather just keep that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.580 
standalone so I'd rather just keep that
in<00:00:58.770> my<00:00:59.370> head<00:00:59.579> as<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.270> standalone<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.469> why

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
in my head as a standalone so that's why

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.139 
in my head as a standalone so that's why
this<00:01:01.770> one's<00:01:01.920> number<00:01:02.039> 5<00:01:02.340> coming<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.820> at<00:01:03.000> number

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
this one's number 5 coming in at number

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.340 
this one's number 5 coming in at number
four<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.409> forsaken<00:01:05.159> by<00:01:05.339> Lisa<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.390> stas<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.700 
four is the forsaken by Lisa and stas I
actually<00:01:08.000> did<00:01:09.000> consider<00:01:09.720> getting<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.380> second

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
actually did consider getting the second

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.310 
actually did consider getting the second
book<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.159> uprising<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> realized<00:01:13.170> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
book the uprising but then I realized I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
book the uprising but then I realized I
was<00:01:13.409> only<00:01:13.590> considering<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
was only considering that because I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.670 
was only considering that because I
really<00:01:15.180> liked<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.540> covers<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.140> book<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
really liked the covers of this book I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
really liked the covers of this book I
actually<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.610> did<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.970> like<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.509> series

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
actually really did not like this series

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.140 
actually really did not like this series
at<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.100> too<00:01:20.430> insta-love

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
at all it was too insta-love

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.700 
at all it was too insta-love
for<00:01:21.930> me<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> handle<00:01:22.619> concept<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.880> world

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
for me to handle concept of this world

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.819 
for me to handle concept of this world
seems<00:01:25.710> cool<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.729> wasn't<00:01:27.570> executed<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
seems cool it wasn't executed in the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.770 
seems cool it wasn't executed in the
expectations<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.759> expecting<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> be

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
expectations I was expecting it to be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
expectations I was expecting it to be
executed<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> main<00:01:32.579> characters

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
executed and then the main characters

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
executed and then the main characters
really<00:01:33.450> annoyed<00:01:33.810> me<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.439> can't<00:01:34.829> continue<00:01:35.159> if

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really annoyed me so I can't continue if

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.190 
really annoyed me so I can't continue if
I<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.240> characters<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:36.930> no

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
I don't like the characters they have no
