real quick so people don't get in a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.040 
real quick so people don't get in a
panic<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:24.080> do<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.830> believe<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:26.390> what<00:02:26.930> is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
panic now do I believe that what is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.450 
panic now do I believe that what is
happening<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.790> Gulf<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.380> some<00:02:31.220> kind<00:02:31.340> of

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
happening in the Gulf is a some kind of

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.750 
happening in the Gulf is a some kind of
sign<00:02:31.730> from<00:02:32.000> God<00:02:32.240> or<00:02:32.270> something<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.900> that

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
sign from God or something like that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.330 
sign from God or something like that
certainly<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.970> think<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.870> God<00:02:36.740> has<00:02:37.010> allowed

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
certainly I think that God has allowed

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.110 
certainly I think that God has allowed
this<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.670> happen<00:02:38.080> because<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:40.070> various<00:02:40.850> and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
this to happen because of various and

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.300 
this to happen because of various and
sundry<00:02:41.920> reasons<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:43.070> sure<00:02:43.960> greed<00:02:45.310> man's

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
sundry reasons I'm sure greed man's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.560 
sundry reasons I'm sure greed man's
pride<00:02:48.130> corruption<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:50.060> could<00:02:50.210> be<00:02:50.300> any<00:02:50.480> number

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
pride corruption it could be any number

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.050 
pride corruption it could be any number
of<00:02:50.840> things<00:02:50.960> and<00:02:51.650> it's<00:02:52.340> unfortunate<00:02:52.670> that

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
of things and it's unfortunate that

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.050 
of things and it's unfortunate that
we're<00:02:53.570> having<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.960> deal<00:02:54.170> with<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:56.030> I

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
we're having to deal with this but I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.490 
we're having to deal with this but I
think<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.390> God<00:02:56.660> has<00:02:56.870> allowed<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.380> happen

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
think that God has allowed it to happen

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.830 
think that God has allowed it to happen
to<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.070> degree<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.580> has<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:59.660> make<00:02:59.810> a

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
to the degree that it has to make a

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.860 
to the degree that it has to make a
point<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.730> also<00:03:01.730> think<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.070> to

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
point I also think that this is going to

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.450 
point I also think that this is going to
lead<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.230> much<00:03:07.130> more<00:03:07.540> dire<00:03:08.540> consequences<00:03:09.530> than

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
lead to much more dire consequences than

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.850 
lead to much more dire consequences than
people<00:03:10.820> are<00:03:10.970> realizing<00:03:11.750> right<00:03:12.260> now<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.530> think<00:03:12.740> a

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
people are realizing right now I think a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.590 
people are realizing right now I think a
lot<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.070> people<00:03:13.160> out<00:03:13.430> there<00:03:13.490> just<00:03:13.880> saying<00:03:14.180> and

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
lot of people out there just saying and

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.199 
lot of people out there just saying and
it's<00:03:15.590> an<00:03:15.650> oil<00:03:15.800> spill<00:03:16.040> let's<00:03:16.580> happened<00:03:16.910> before

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
it's an oil spill let's happened before

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.910 
it's an oil spill let's happened before
they'll<00:03:17.750> stop<00:03:18.050> it<00:03:18.290> they'll<00:03:18.500> get<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.709> cleaned

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
they'll stop it they'll get it cleaned

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.180 
they'll stop it they'll get it cleaned
up<00:03:19.040> life<00:03:19.370> will<00:03:19.520> go<00:03:19.550> on<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:20.650> get<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.740> feeling

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
up life will go on I get the feeling

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.400 
up life will go on I get the feeling
that<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:23.090> is<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.630> be<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.930> different

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
that this is going to be a different

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.620 
that this is going to be a different
scenario<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:25.070> time<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.580> think<00:03:26.450> the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
scenario this time I think the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.540 
scenario this time I think the
consequences<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.380> what's<00:03:27.680> happening<00:03:28.130> are

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
consequences of what's happening are

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.090 
consequences of what's happening are
going<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.120> be<00:03:29.560> much<00:03:30.560> worse<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:31.190> listen<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.240> the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
going to be much worse I listen to the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.760 
going to be much worse I listen to the

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
won't know until after it's happened but

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.990 
won't know until after it's happened but
I<00:05:40.500> believe<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.490> yes<00:05:41.669> we<00:05:42.000> are<00:05:43.310> now<00:05:44.310> moving

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
I believe that yes we are now moving

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.189 
I believe that yes we are now moving
into<00:05:45.389> the<00:05:46.169> Tribulation<00:05:46.770> Period<00:05:46.800> and<00:05:48.199> there

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
into the Tribulation Period and there

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.019 
into the Tribulation Period and there
will<00:05:49.409> only<00:05:49.439> be<00:05:51.469> God<00:05:52.469> my<00:05:52.889> estimation<00:05:53.490> is<00:05:53.639> that

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
will only be God my estimation is that

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.149 
will only be God my estimation is that
we're<00:05:54.330> moving<00:05:54.599> into<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.899> this<00:05:55.020> year<00:05:55.319> and<00:05:55.529> if

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
we're moving into it this year and if

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.350 
we're moving into it this year and if
that's<00:05:56.339> the<00:05:56.430> case<00:05:56.520> that<00:05:56.909> means<00:05:57.060> we'll<00:05:57.210> only

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
that's the case that means we'll only

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.769 
that's the case that means we'll only
have<00:05:57.479> seven<00:05:57.960> years<00:05:58.139> left<00:05:58.379> and<00:05:59.270> if<00:06:00.270> that<00:06:00.569> is
