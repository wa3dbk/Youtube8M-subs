00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:10.559
 Hello everyone to remove the bumper and us 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:12.420
 you must first unscrew it by 3 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.740
 bolts on each side of the bumper that is 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.330
 they are here right here if 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.289
 you have protection below remove protection 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:29.250
 also we need to unscrew remove these 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.500
 here are the bars here we have one bolt 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.309
 fastened here and the other on the other hand 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:39.719
 in the same way, you just need to unscrew 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.969
 liner because there is attached to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.890
 someone's bumper is not here already 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.129
 factory because the bumper and already 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 repeatedly removes and plucked that is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.800
 here here we have 2 bolts attached 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.010
 lower part of the bumper to the fender liner and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.170
 son body but here if you have a pit 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.979
 you can unscrew the liner 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 and here are these three bolts on the bumper you 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.520
 is here to take off unscrew 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.840
 below me 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:19.610
 I am a coin therefore I will be through 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.060
 top get to these do it 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.220
 here to get to them from 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.470
 right where the filter is i pulled the filter 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.290
 I removed the whole box here and here 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.840
 we can now quite simply 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.810
 get to the bolts that are at 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:48.689
 we are over there we see dikes one of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:52.360
 they are precisely the one that you need to unscrew 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.590
 on the left side, in principle, you can 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.390
 stick your hand but if you can 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.490
 take off 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:06.640
 that does not remove just unscrew the attachment 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:09.280
 and push back the gur tank let's start with 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.209
 unscrewing these bolts because 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.720
 that principle is the most difficult process 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.400
 removing the bumper for this i take the key on 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:29.319
 10 and just in case I 'll take 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:35.760
 ratchet-head for a month grope 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.760
 that's a pretty sustainable process 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.709
 nowhere 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:58.450
 we move and immediately head back here 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:03:00.880
 it will not work out a little bit after 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.430
 as we unscrew all the nuts that 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.989
 fix the bumper fender and also we removed everything 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.480
 bolts twisted that fasten with us 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.700
 liner 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.090
 we need to unscrew the main ones 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.130
 mounts that attach the bumper like 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.720
 TV itself, that is, here we are 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:25.780
 We removed the grating here we have there the bolts 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 there is one of the same cultural us 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.760
 need them too 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.630
 unscrew after which we can bumper 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.530
 will take off her knowing there still stand by me 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.260
 two phone there still will need 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.450
 unscrew the plan that goes tank on 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.910
 headlight washer 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.709
 here we have bolts inside 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.280
 hexagon like this 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.280
 millimeters 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:10.659
 Here we have a bolt and also erase the Permian 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:13.390
 the most well and after we unscrewed 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:19.769
 all bolts just pull the bumper over and 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.769
 we have here to tear down this country of tears 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.080

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.900
 said here we go there he hose 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.080
 headlight washer meaning we are now we 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.110
 just take off the hose and everything after that 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.600
 as we disconnected the headlight washer hose at 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.479
 we flowed water tass manga since u 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.340

 put the water tank we have already glass 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.870
 the rest of the water is getting tighter 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.690
