00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.920 
opened it up and saw that a circuit
board<00:02:41.500> for<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.830> SNES<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:43.030> long<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
board for the SNES is that long is the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.050 
board for the SNES is that long is the
it's<00:02:44.350> as<00:02:44.560> thick<00:02:44.800> as<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:44.980> regular<00:02:45.310> short<00:02:45.580> circuit

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
it's as thick as a regular short circuit

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.530 
it's as thick as a regular short circuit
board<00:02:46.330> not<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.870> thick<00:02:47.280> almost<00:02:48.280> paper<00:02:49.270> thin

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
board not that thick almost paper thin

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.250 
board not that thick almost paper thin
and<00:02:50.580> then<00:02:51.580> for<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.420> NES<00:02:52.780> it's<00:02:53.080> about

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
and then for this the NES it's about

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.580 
and then for this the NES it's about
that<00:02:53.560> much<00:02:53.770> so<00:02:54.130> it's<00:02:54.250> about<00:02:54.930> size<00:02:55.930> love<00:02:56.230> and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
that much so it's about size love and

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.100 
that much so it's about size love and
almond<00:02:56.980> Hershey's<00:02:57.340> bar<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.840> thought<00:02:58.989> was

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
almond Hershey's bar which I thought was

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.630 
almond Hershey's bar which I thought was
pretty<00:02:59.290> cool<00:02:59.410> when<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.739> opened<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.070> up<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.489> they

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
pretty cool when I opened it up but they

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.680 
pretty cool when I opened it up but they
could<00:03:00.880> have<00:03:00.970> made<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.480> lot<00:03:01.870> smaller<00:03:02.380> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
could have made this a lot smaller and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
could have made this a lot smaller and
it<00:03:04.690> wouldn't<00:03:05.050> have<00:03:05.170> had<00:03:05.410> just<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.739> whole<00:03:05.890> bunch

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
it wouldn't have had just a whole bunch

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.070 
it wouldn't have had just a whole bunch
of<00:03:06.190> dead<00:03:06.459> air<00:03:06.670> in<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.400> yes<00:03:09.810> let's<00:03:10.810> talk

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
of dead air in it so yes let's talk

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.949 
of dead air in it so yes let's talk
about<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:12.160> controllers<00:03:12.790> why<00:03:13.780> not<00:03:15.510> if<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.690> sound

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
about the controllers why not if I sound

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.479 
about the controllers why not if I sound
a<00:03:16.989> little<00:03:17.170> down<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.980> because<00:03:18.220> I've<00:03:18.370> done

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
a little down it's because I've done

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.550 
a little down it's because I've done

it's an it's a balk NES controller let's
face<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:30.520> is<00:03:30.580> an<00:03:30.880> SNES<00:03:31.239> controller

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
face it this is an SNES controller

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.440 
face it this is an SNES controller
original<00:03:33.850> SNES<00:03:34.150> controller<00:03:34.810> also<00:03:36.239> this<00:03:37.239> was

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
original SNES controller also this was

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.620 
original SNES controller also this was
made<00:03:37.720> in

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.440 

1991<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.980> this<00:03:43.130> was<00:03:43.340> made<00:03:43.580> in<00:03:43.610> oh<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.300> doesn't

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
1991 and this was made in oh it doesn't

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.830 
1991 and this was made in oh it doesn't
tell<00:03:45.819> so<00:03:46.819> yes

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
tell so yes

tell so yes
the<00:03:48.260> only<00:03:48.380> difference<00:03:48.800> between<00:03:48.980> using<00:03:49.700> these

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849 
the only difference between using these

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.160 
the only difference between using these
is<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.580> this<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.330> yes<00:03:53.959> it's

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
is this is a this is the yes it's
