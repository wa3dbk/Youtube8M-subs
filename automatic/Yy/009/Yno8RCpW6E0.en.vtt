00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.160
 so hello friends of stephan 1 2 3 2 1 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.670
 I would like to see how I do it 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.840
 get done 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.850
 to cook with teaspoons and I have 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.769
 already shot videos was already before 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.689
 few days I have 200 milliliters 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.650
 heated water 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.449
 but only with a tealight and there has 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 then almost half an hour bit 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.680
 more so that took half an hour 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:36.140
 until then the water has cooked so 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.090
 the great thing about the oboist yes you have here 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.989
 many adjustments I do it 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.300
 with two tealights and it is 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.190
 of course now only in the room here 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.890
 no wind is nothing at all so the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.460
 flame goes concentrated 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.600
 also this us field mug that if I 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.350
 Now of course cooking outside now 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.429
 would and it was windy you would have to 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.800
 every case for a good wind protection 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.519
 So I'm here now 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.850
 glass with water 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.420
 that's my kind of offender, so to speak 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 is easy to show how fast 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.790
 I have a cup of tea with tea lights 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.950
 can bring warm to bring as well 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.990
 I could do more so now as well 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.680
 water goes in the soup or for the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.540
 pea soup et cetera so warm me 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.829
 get it in a little while and do it 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:36.259
 that's also a little bit of a spit look 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.899
 okay well as you can see it is 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.680
 even a little over 200 milliliters 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.670
 what fits into this little cup then 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.719
 I want to say 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.579
 I give this in here and the 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.670
 time we take now the same 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.670
 still 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.070
 I think first have the candles 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.070
 just have to go through it 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:20.270
 now we have 15h35 and I am setting 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:24.320
 now my mug on it as I said 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.980
 that is now active with two then so 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.130
 safer and of course I do 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.960
 now a small cut and the same 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.640
 I'll see you again on a 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.410
 Perspective from above and look at them 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.600
 mug in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.760
 and that was only the mobile phone again 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.980
 when it starts to bleed 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.980
 so it took me then balance 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.770
 such a little update we have now 15 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.770
 40 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:09.810
 15 40 and now it runs offered yes 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.810
 but now, again, make a quick stop 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.100
 and as you can see 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.160
 picture already blow on the bottom 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.140
 So in five minutes I think 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.170
 not so much now 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.650
 bad or tragic is also very much 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.020
 Well 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.390
 Let's have a good start 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.770
 You can also see exactly that 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.260
 put once here so where where shadow 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.610
 is when you finger or blow 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.270
 ascend and sometimes over there 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.440
 among these two points so the 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:54.070
 are the candles and bubbles are 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.570
 take a long look takes 22 100 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.870
 milliliters even a bit more 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.870
 heat 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.400
 So now you can really see it 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.680
 clearly everywhere bubbles are forming on the 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:13.450
 soil also rise and it 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:25.720
 Smokes and that we have completely 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:31.240
 sharp 1549 yes I think it is the same 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:33.430
 so far that I can make a tea like that 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.919
 I believe it is enough to show now 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.810
 So while it works to cook too 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.550
 of course, bring bubbling now 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.310
 Of course not like on a gas stove 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.530
 or such a gas stove but that one 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.720
 really heated what is enough for everyone 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.090
 all fall if I go down here now 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.610
 until then it works out the same 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.729
 really a heat so also the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.849
 cup it is really hot 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:03.430
 and now I will take my tea 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:06.039
 at a crackle the cord 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.550
 outside on the right burn us 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:15.970
 candles is still off and the time is now 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:23.979
 we have 15 o'clock 57 korea one pulls 5 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:26.470
 So in 758 we started 35 man 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.750
 can say 25 minutes so it already has 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.599
 it has been here for a while now 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.139
 chattered but not so old now 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.570
 now also correct and I hope that was 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.240
 proof enough 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.889
 cooking with tealight works and 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.889
 say it then we look at the tube
