00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.400 
gassing off the remaining clear will
sink<00:02:56.819> in<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.390> won't<00:02:57.569> necessarily<00:02:57.780> have

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
on their site a little bit closer to the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.290 

looks<00:03:59.239> good<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.450> me<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.910> then<00:04:01.910> we<00:04:02.000> take<00:04:02.180> the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
looks good to me so then we take the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.040 
looks good to me so then we take the
little<00:04:02.420> pyramids<00:04:02.870> off<00:04:04.000> put<00:04:05.000> them<00:04:05.150> in<00:04:05.420> a<00:04:05.599> safe

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
little pyramids off put them in a safe

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.970 
little pyramids off put them in a safe
place<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:10.720> then<00:04:11.720> there's<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.530> other<00:04:12.739> little

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
place and then there's this other little

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.890 
place and then there's this other little
tool<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.180> string<00:04:14.569> lift<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:17.829> you<00:04:19.780> put<00:04:20.780> this

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
tool it's a string lift and you put this

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.090 
tool it's a string lift and you put this
in<00:04:20.959> here<00:04:21.139> and<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:22.340> twist<00:04:22.729> it<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:24.680> lift

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
in here and you twist it and you lift

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.010 
in here and you twist it and you lift
forward<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.729> what<00:04:25.850> this<00:04:25.970> will<00:04:26.240> do<00:04:26.419> is<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.930> will

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
forward and what this will do is it will

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.390 
forward and what this will do is it will
elevate<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.560> strings<00:04:27.800> for<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.479> so<00:04:29.479> then<00:04:30.400> this

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
elevate the strings for you so then this

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.340 
elevate the strings for you so then this
will<00:04:31.610> slide<00:04:31.850> underneath<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.479> underneath

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
will slide underneath this underneath

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:47.390 
will slide underneath this underneath
the<00:04:33.470> strings

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.430 

there<00:04:48.400> we<00:04:48.490> go<00:04:50.130> okay<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.370> now<00:04:52.110> we're<00:04:53.110> covering

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
there we go okay so now we're covering

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.690 
there we go okay so now we're covering
the<00:04:53.740> entire<00:04:53.830> fretwork<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.980> manual<00:04:57.460> suggests

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
the entire fretwork the manual suggests

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.980 
the entire fretwork the manual suggests
to<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:59.710> sand<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.250> like<00:05:00.340> an<00:05:00.460> X<00:05:00.730> kind<00:05:01.390> of<00:05:01.510> motion

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
to to sand and like an X kind of motion

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.020 
to to sand and like an X kind of motion
so<00:05:02.260> and<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.280> don't<00:05:03.310> need<00:05:03.640> to

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
so and you don't need to

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.760 
so and you don't need to
since<00:05:04.480> this<00:05:04.630> covers<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:04.930> entire<00:05:05.290> fretboard

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
since this covers the entire fretboard

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.040 
since this covers the entire fretboard
you<00:05:05.860> don't<00:05:06.010> really<00:05:06.130> need<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.550> move<00:05:06.760> it<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:07.180> whole

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
you don't really need to move it a whole

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.580 
you don't really need to move it a whole
lot<00:05:08.880> so<00:05:09.880> let's<00:05:10.480> do<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.690> one<00:05:11.260> of<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.410> things

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
lot so let's do that one of the things

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.210 
lot so let's do that one of the things
that<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:11.740> did<00:05:12.870> before<00:05:13.870> instead<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.800> filming<00:05:15.010> is

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
that I did before instead of filming is

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.010 
that I did before instead of filming is
I<00:05:15.340> did<00:05:15.750> my<00:05:16.750> normal<00:05:17.520> step<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.760> sharp<00:05:19.570> being<00:05:19.810> off

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
I did my normal step of sharp being off

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.600 
I did my normal step of sharp being off
the<00:05:20.410> frets<00:05:20.740> just<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.100> see<00:05:21.250> how<00:05:21.370> much<00:05:21.460> I'm

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
the frets just to see how much I'm

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.010 
the frets just to see how much I'm
taking<00:05:21.880> off<00:05:22.030> just<00:05:22.270> make<00:05:22.450> sure<00:05:22.600> that<00:05:22.720> it's<00:05:22.870> done

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
taking off just make sure that it's done

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.530 
taking off just make sure that it's done
that<00:05:23.230> uniform<00:05:24.220> level<00:05:24.430> even<00:05:25.120> though<00:05:25.210> I've<00:05:25.360> got

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540

the the neck elevated here it's

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.450 
the the neck elevated here it's
important<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:28.090> to<00:05:28.810> support<00:05:29.260> this<00:05:29.560> because<00:05:29.830> if

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
neck is gonna bow with me so it's

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.790

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.850 

so<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:54.630> got<00:05:54.870> through<00:05:55.080> all<00:05:55.140> six<00:05:55.440> strings<00:05:55.590> with

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
so I got through all six strings with

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.040 
so I got through all six strings with
the<00:05:55.890> katana<00:05:56.280> and<00:05:56.550> it<00:05:56.730> did<00:05:56.850> a<00:05:56.880> really<00:05:56.940> nice<00:05:57.210> job

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.210 

next<00:06:01.050> is<00:06:01.350> a<00:06:03.050> do<00:06:04.050> the<00:06:04.140> little<00:06:04.290> crowning<00:06:04.830> that's

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
next is a do the little crowning that's

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.590 
next is a do the little crowning that's
what<00:06:05.340> this<00:06:05.490> is<00:06:05.730> I<00:06:05.970> guess<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:08.480> since<00:06:09.480> I've

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
what this is I guess and since I've

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.730 
what this is I guess and since I've
already<00:06:09.780> covered<00:06:09.930> that<00:06:10.080> in<00:06:10.230> another<00:06:10.530> video

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
already covered that in another video

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.910 
already covered that in another video
I'm<00:06:11.220> will<00:06:11.940> go<00:06:12.060> ahead<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:12.360> stop<00:06:12.570> here<00:06:12.870> but<00:06:13.080> this

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
I'm will go ahead and stop here but this
