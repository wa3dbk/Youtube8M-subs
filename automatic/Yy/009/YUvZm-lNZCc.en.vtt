00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.710 
quite a bit from the previous games
which<00:01:48.810> had<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> much<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.310> linear<00:01:50.610> story<00:01:51.479> mode

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
which had a much more linear story mode

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.960 
which had a much more linear story mode
that<00:01:52.350> pretty<00:01:52.770> much<00:01:52.950> sent<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.399> from<00:01:53.520> fight<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
that pretty much sent you from fight to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
that pretty much sent you from fight to
fight<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.079> broke<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.409> up<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.710> story

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
fight and kind of broke it up with story

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.760 
fight and kind of broke it up with story
sequences<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> kind<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> told<00:01:57.420> whatever<00:01:58.200> rqr

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
sequences that kind of told whatever rqr

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.880 
sequences that kind of told whatever rqr
on<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.820> Dragon<00:02:00.149> universe<00:02:00.509> mode<00:02:00.750> sort<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.740> does

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.550 
on the Dragon universe mode sort of does
that<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.149> will<00:02:03.270> find<00:02:03.509> points<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that in that you will find points on a

you sort of clear those the story we

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.780 
you sort of clear those the story we
progress<00:02:13.060> but<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.080> difference<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.790> these

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790

basically you have a key meter that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.630 
basically you have a key meter that
we've<00:05:19.420> kind<00:05:19.630> of<00:05:19.690> mentioned<00:05:20.110> in<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.410> game<00:05:20.640> and

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
we've kind of mentioned in the game and

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.550 
we've kind of mentioned in the game and
that<00:05:21.850> builds<00:05:22.300> up<00:05:22.450> and<00:05:22.720> stores<00:05:22.960> energy<00:05:23.140> and<00:05:23.470> you

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
that builds up and stores energy and you

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.070 
that builds up and stores energy and you
are<00:05:23.650> able<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:24.040> use<00:05:24.160> it<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.520> perform<00:05:24.880> skills<00:05:25.210> to

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
are able to use it to perform skills to

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.960 
are able to use it to perform skills to
transform<00:05:26.560> into<00:05:26.710> your<00:05:26.890> you<00:05:27.160> know<00:05:27.280> your<00:05:27.490> super

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
transform into your you know your super

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.370 
transform into your you know your super
incarnation<00:05:28.600> depending<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.110> character

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
incarnation depending on the character

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.080 
incarnation depending on the character
that<00:05:29.410> you're<00:05:29.560> playing<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:30.550> fire<00:05:30.730> off<00:05:30.910> energy

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
that you're playing and fire off energy

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.320 
that you're playing and fire off energy
attacks<00:05:31.830> but<00:05:32.830> when<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.400> use<00:05:33.550> a<00:05:33.580> counter<00:05:34.060> you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
attacks but when you use a counter you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.330 
attacks but when you use a counter you
will<00:05:34.480> take<00:05:34.750> one<00:05:35.170> bar<00:05:35.440> away<00:05:35.650> out<00:05:35.860> of<00:05:35.890> that<00:05:36.070> meter

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
will take one bar away out of that meter

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.940 
will take one bar away out of that meter
so<00:05:37.060> you<00:05:37.120> can't<00:05:37.630> counter<00:05:37.990> forever<00:05:38.290> which<00:05:38.770> is

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
so you can't counter forever which is

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.060 
so you can't counter forever which is
good<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:39.820> then<00:05:40.480> you<00:05:40.960> know<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.290> game<00:05:41.500> kind<00:05:41.980> of

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
good so then you know the game kind of

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.800 
good so then you know the game kind of
has<00:05:42.220> shifted<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.790> a<00:05:43.060> little<00:05:43.600> more<00:05:43.690> of<00:05:43.750> a

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
has shifted to a little more of a

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.060 
has shifted to a little more of a
strategic<00:05:44.290> field<00:05:44.470> because<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.800> need<00:05:44.890> to<00:05:44.920> make

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
strategic field because you need to make

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.710 
strategic field because you need to make
sure<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.670> you're<00:05:45.820> balancing<00:05:46.330> your<00:05:46.540> key

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
sure that you're balancing your key

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.130 
sure that you're balancing your key
usage<00:05:47.050> with<00:05:47.290> either<00:05:47.830> attacking<00:05:48.520> or

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
usage with either attacking or

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.140 
usage with either attacking or
countering<00:05:50.140> so<00:05:50.760> you're<00:05:51.760> going<00:05:51.850> to<00:05:51.910> have<00:05:52.060> to

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
countering so you're going to have to

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.460 
countering so you're going to have to
think<00:05:52.180> a<00:05:52.360> little<00:05:52.450> bit<00:05:52.630> more<00:05:52.750> when<00:05:52.900> you're<00:05:52.990> when

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
think a little bit more when you're when

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.300 
think a little bit more when you're when
you're<00:05:53.560> playing<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.950> game<00:05:53.980> which<00:05:54.280> is

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
you're playing the game which is

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.340 
you're playing the game which is
actually<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.790> good<00:05:54.940> thing<00:05:55.000> because<00:05:55.240> one<00:05:56.170> of<00:05:56.200> the

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
actually a good thing because one of the

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.810 
actually a good thing because one of the
complaints<00:05:56.590> about<00:05:56.890> the<00:05:57.010> franchise<00:05:57.460> has<00:05:57.610> just

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
complaints about the franchise has just

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.990 
complaints about the franchise has just
been<00:05:57.970> at<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.120> fighting<00:05:58.330> system
