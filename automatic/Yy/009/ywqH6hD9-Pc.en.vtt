00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.410 
there and you can see the chip inside
that<00:02:49.329> allows<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.079> electronics<00:02:51.069> to<00:02:51.190> work

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
that allows all the electronics to work

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.740 
that allows all the electronics to work
back<00:02:52.420> here<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.900> got<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.170> two<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.680> there<00:02:56.280> so

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
back here it's got the two on there so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.339 
back here it's got the two on there so
put<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.870> one<00:02:59.049> in<00:02:59.549> and<00:03:00.549> then<00:03:00.700> next<00:03:00.940> up<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.349> bata

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
put that one in and then next up is bata

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.840 
put that one in and then next up is bata
or<00:03:02.880> grasshopper<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.170> nice<00:03:05.170> grasshopper<00:03:06.010> detail

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
or grasshopper a nice grasshopper detail

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.349 
or grasshopper a nice grasshopper detail
logo<00:03:07.299> right<00:03:07.510> there<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.069> these<00:03:09.069> rings<00:03:09.609> around

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
logo right there and these rings around

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.199 
logo right there and these rings around
it<00:03:10.510> are<00:03:10.630> gold<00:03:11.319> painted<00:03:11.799> on<00:03:13.079> diecast<00:03:14.079> metal<00:03:14.290> so

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
it are gold painted on diecast metal so

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.839 
it are gold painted on diecast metal so
you<00:03:16.209> want<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.450> be<00:03:16.480> careful<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.730> don't

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
you want to be careful that you don't

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.879 
you want to be careful that you don't
chip<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:20.290> then<00:03:22.410> put<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.560> one<00:03:23.680> in<00:03:23.709> there

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
chip it so then put that one in there

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.339 
chip it so then put that one in there
and<00:03:24.900> then<00:03:26.099> just<00:03:27.099> like<00:03:27.280> in<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.430> show<00:03:28.169> take<00:03:29.169> the

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
and then just like in the show take the

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.680 
and then just like in the show take the
skin<00:03:29.620> or<00:03:29.829> take<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.220> driver<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.819> tilt<00:03:31.540> it

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
skin or take the driver and tilt it

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.039 
skin or take the driver and tilt it
sideways<00:03:32.459> then<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.609> take<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.940> scanner<00:03:34.209> hold

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
sideways then you take the scanner hold

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:53.089 
sideways then you take the scanner hold
on<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.349> bunny

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.100 

and<00:03:54.099> just<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:54.489> that<00:03:54.550> you<00:03:55.090> have<00:03:55.270> taught<00:03:55.780> avaz

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
and just like that you have taught avaz

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:03.140 
and just like that you have taught avaz
henshin<00:03:56.650> sound<00:03:56.980> which<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:58.120> pretty<00:03:58.840> cool<00:03:59.110> and

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.390 

yeah<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.420> very<00:04:05.050> nice<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.590> does<00:04:06.040> read<00:04:06.370> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
yeah it's very nice it does read the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.930 
yeah it's very nice it does read the
chips<00:04:07.090> inside<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.810> metals<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:09.640> doesn't

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
chips inside the metals and it doesn't

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.120 
chips inside the metals and it doesn't
matter<00:04:10.090> how<00:04:10.390> slow<00:04:11.050> or<00:04:11.230> how<00:04:11.349> fast<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:11.860> go<00:04:11.980> it

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
matter how slow or how fast you go it

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.640 
matter how slow or how fast you go it
will<00:04:12.190> still<00:04:12.519> read<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.239> after<00:04:14.170> knocking

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
will still read it so after knocking

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.650 
will still read it so after knocking
life<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.190> always<00:04:15.430> I'll<00:04:15.880> ruin<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.329> surprise

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
life and always I'll ruin the surprise

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:27.770 
life and always I'll ruin the surprise
um<00:04:17.500> so<00:04:18.280> if<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.549> were<00:04:18.669> just<00:04:18.820> thinking<00:04:19.180> into<00:04:19.479> this

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.300 

it<00:04:28.780> still<00:04:29.080> reads<00:04:29.290> it<00:04:29.500> out<00:04:29.620> pretty<00:04:29.889> well<00:04:30.010> and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
it still reads it out pretty well and

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.570 
it still reads it out pretty well and
then<00:04:31.290> again<00:04:32.290> if<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.620> if<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:33.130> have<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.400> same

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
then again if you if you have the same

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:43.959 
then again if you if you have the same
metals<00:04:33.970> in<00:04:34.120> here<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.419> do<00:04:34.479> it<00:04:34.510> again

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.640 

you<00:04:44.969> have<00:04:45.180> o's<00:04:45.449> finisher<00:04:46.050> attack<00:04:46.319> which<00:04:46.530> is

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
you have o's finisher attack which is

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.219 
you have o's finisher attack which is
the<00:04:46.800> scanning<00:04:47.129> charge<00:04:47.569> now<00:04:48.569> i<00:04:50.960> would<00:04:51.960> say

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
the scanning charge now i would say

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.459 
the scanning charge now i would say
that's<00:04:52.499> about<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.770> for<00:04:53.009> this<00:04:53.340> belt<00:04:53.639> but<00:04:54.469> just

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
that's about it for this belt but just

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.170 
that's about it for this belt but just
like<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.800> double<00:04:56.129> belt<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.999> devil<00:04:57.330> driver

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
like the double belt the devil driver

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.399 
like the double belt the devil driver
you<00:05:00.180> don't<00:05:00.360> just<00:05:00.449> can't<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> one

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
you don't just can't the one

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.200 
you don't just can't the one
transformation<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:02.340> actually<00:05:02.669> get<00:05:02.789> for

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
transformation you actually get for

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.839 
transformation you actually get for
metals<00:05:03.870> this<00:05:04.080> time<00:05:04.319> and<00:05:04.499> i<00:05:04.590> took<00:05:04.650> out<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.159> toro

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
metals this time and i took out the toro

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.320 
metals this time and i took out the toro
one<00:05:06.090> in<00:05:06.860> place<00:05:07.860> of<00:05:08.069> the<00:05:08.430> comic<00:05:08.879> eerie<00:05:09.120> or

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
one in place of the comic eerie or

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.950 
one in place of the comic eerie or
praying<00:05:09.870> mantis<00:05:10.259> which<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:10.680> upside<00:05:11.009> down<00:05:11.960> and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
praying mantis which is upside down and

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.869 
praying mantis which is upside down and
as<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.499> see<00:05:13.680> right<00:05:13.710> there<00:05:13.979> it<00:05:14.189> is<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.580> nice

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
as you see right there it is a nice

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.820 
as you see right there it is a nice
praying<00:05:15.270> mantis<00:05:15.629> one<00:05:15.810> it's<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.199> lighter<00:05:16.469> green

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
praying mantis one it's a lighter green

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
put it in the center one of course I

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.129 
put it in the center one of course I
can't<00:05:37.289> talk<00:05:37.500> now<00:05:37.740> um<00:05:38.330> also<00:05:39.330> i<00:05:39.569> forgot<00:05:39.990> to
