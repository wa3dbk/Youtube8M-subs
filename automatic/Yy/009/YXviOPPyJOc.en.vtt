adolescence an important statistic to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.129 
adolescence an important statistic to
note<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.030> seizures<00:00:12.630> occur<00:00:12.780> in

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
note is that seizures occur in

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.780 
note is that seizures occur in
approximately<00:00:13.259> ten<00:00:14.070> percent<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.580> children
