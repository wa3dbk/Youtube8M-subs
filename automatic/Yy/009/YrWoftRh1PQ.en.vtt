00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
game played with one of the new camos of

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.150 
game played with one of the new camos of
course<00:00:34.239> most<00:00:34.989> of<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.290> already<00:00:35.320> know<00:00:35.800> this

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
course most of you already know this

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.750 
course most of you already know this
this<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.120> weaponized<00:00:37.720> 115<00:00:38.590> camo<00:00:39.070> really

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
this is the weaponized 115 camo really

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.569 
this is the weaponized 115 camo really
really<00:00:39.910> nice<00:00:40.120> really<00:00:40.570> really<00:00:40.750> green<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.370> main

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
really nice really really green the main

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.960 
really nice really really green the main
downside<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.110> camo<00:00:44.380> I<00:00:44.649> would<00:00:44.890> say<00:00:45.160> is<00:00:45.430> that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
downside to the camo I would say is that

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.029 
downside to the camo I would say is that
it<00:00:46.149> takes<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.660> lot<00:00:46.989> of<00:00:47.019> your<00:00:47.260> attention<00:00:47.710> into

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
it takes a lot of your attention into

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.560 
it takes a lot of your attention into
the<00:00:48.129> camo<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:49.000> know<00:00:49.090> instead<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.390> you

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
the camo you know instead of you

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.229 
the camo you know instead of you
focusing<00:00:50.170> in<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:51.010> enemy<00:00:51.489> team<00:00:51.699> and<00:00:51.940> on<00:00:52.090> the

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
focusing in the enemy team and on the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.299 
focusing in the enemy team and on the
enemy<00:00:52.570> players<00:00:52.840> but<00:00:53.530> other<00:00:53.739> than<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:53.980> I

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
enemy players but other than that I

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.880 
enemy players but other than that I
think<00:00:54.370> it's<00:00:54.699> nice<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.090> have<00:00:55.239> something<00:00:56.140> really

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
think it's nice to have something really

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.849 
think it's nice to have something really
not<00:00:57.550> so<00:00:57.820> realistic<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.829> something<00:00:59.829> just

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
not so realistic and something just

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.619 
not so realistic and something just
completely<00:01:00.129> different<00:01:00.789> from<00:01:00.940> what<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.600> are

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
completely different from what we are

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.770 
completely different from what we are
used<00:01:01.839> to<00:01:02.410> see<00:01:03.010> in<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.309> game<00:01:03.519> every<00:01:04.300> single<00:01:04.330> day

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
used to see in the game every single day

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.890 
used to see in the game every single day
so<00:01:05.230> going<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.580> main<00:01:06.730> topic<00:01:07.060> out<00:01:07.450> say

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
so going in to the main topic out say

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.380 
so going in to the main topic out say
that<00:01:08.410> this<00:01:08.650> video<00:01:09.040> is<00:01:09.280> some<00:01:09.460> sort<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:09.730> player

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
that this video is some sort of player

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.660 
that this video is some sort of player
profile<00:01:11.110> 2<00:01:11.530> point<00:01:11.800> 0<00:01:11.920> or<00:01:12.159> something<00:01:12.520> like<00:01:12.610> that

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
profile 2 point 0 or something like that

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.660 
profile 2 point 0 or something like that
I<00:01:13.060> felt<00:01:13.630> like<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.650> video<00:01:14.800> that<00:01:15.040> i<00:01:15.100> made<00:01:15.130> in<00:01:15.580> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
I felt like the video that i made in the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.970 
I felt like the video that i made in the
first<00:01:16.240> player<00:01:16.510> profile<00:01:17.110> was<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.620> little<00:01:17.890> bit

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
first player profile was a little bit

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.070 
first player profile was a little bit
short<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.550> montage<00:01:18.880> was<00:01:19.090> only<00:01:19.480> four<00:01:19.720> or<00:01:19.840> five

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
short the montage was only four or five

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.410 
short the montage was only four or five
minutes<00:01:20.380> long<00:01:20.620> and<00:01:20.830> I<00:01:20.970> feel<00:01:21.970> like<00:01:22.000> it<00:01:22.270> could

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
minutes long and I feel like it could

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.060 
minutes long and I feel like it could
have<00:01:22.450> been<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.630> longer<00:01:22.840> commentary<00:01:23.410> but<00:01:24.010> a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
have been a longer commentary but a

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.860 
have been a longer commentary but a
commentary<00:01:24.700> is<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:24.970> lasts<00:01:25.210> for<00:01:25.420> 10<00:01:25.660> minutes

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
commentary is that lasts for 10 minutes

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.740 
commentary is that lasts for 10 minutes
or<00:01:26.080> more<00:01:26.320> can<00:01:27.040> sometimes<00:01:27.760> be<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.540> know<00:01:28.720> a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
or more can sometimes be you know a

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.420 
or more can sometimes be you know a
little<00:01:28.930> bit<00:01:29.020> over<00:01:29.440> extending<00:01:30.010> it<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.160> little

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
little bit over extending it a little

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.550 
little bit over extending it a little
bit<00:01:30.580> boring<00:01:30.940> sometimes<00:01:31.180> I'm<00:01:31.720> not<00:01:32.260> really<00:01:32.440> sure

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
bit boring sometimes I'm not really sure

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.920 
bit boring sometimes I'm not really sure
so<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:33.070> thought<00:01:33.280> about<00:01:33.490> why<00:01:34.180> not<00:01:34.390> just<00:01:34.720> make

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
so I thought about why not just make

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.380 
so I thought about why not just make
another<00:01:35.140> video<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.070> talk<00:01:36.400> a<00:01:36.610> little<00:01:37.030> bit<00:01:37.210> more

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
another video to talk a little bit more

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.830

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
just for the main reason that it is so

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.990 
just for the main reason that it is so
delayed<00:04:29.110> compared<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.860> pc<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.460> xbox<00:04:30.550> one
