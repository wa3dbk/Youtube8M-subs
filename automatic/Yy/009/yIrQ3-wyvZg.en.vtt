let's<00:00:08.040> begin<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> sample<00:00:09.769> so<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.800> just

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
let's begin the sample so we just

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.070 
let's begin the sample so we just
created<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.490> differencing<00:00:12.030> disk<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.450> server<00:00:12.750> 0

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
created a differencing disk on server 0

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.340 
created a differencing disk on server 0
1<00:00:13.380> using<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.920> temp<00:00:14.250> drive<00:00:14.549> 7<00:00:15.210> as<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> parent

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
1 using that temp drive 7 as the parent

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.439 
1 using that temp drive 7 as the parent
now<00:00:17.250> let's<00:00:17.460> say<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.820> another<00:00:17.850> graphic

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
now let's say we have another graphic

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:18.830 
now let's say we have another graphic

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
they need this same fonts that are on

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
they need this same fonts that are on
temp<00:00:21.449> drive<00:00:21.660> 7<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.710> need<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.010> able<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
temp drive 7 but they need to be able to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.150 
temp drive 7 but they need to be able to
modify<00:00:23.730> their<00:00:24.090> own<00:00:24.180> copy<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:25.590> I've

any changes I make to this F Drive are

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.800 
any changes I make to this F Drive are
going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> be<00:02:12.450> you're<00:02:12.569> now<00:02:12.750> written<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
going to be you're now written to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.730 
going to be you're now written to
our<00:02:14.380> 10th<00:02:14.680> drive<00:02:14.890> 7-2<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.720> didn't<00:02:17.230> have<00:02:17.470> to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
our 10th drive 7-2 so I didn't have to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.960 
our 10th drive 7-2 so I didn't have to
make<00:02:17.980> multiple<00:02:18.910> copies<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.400> original

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
make multiple copies of the original

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.750 
make multiple copies of the original
fonts<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:23.200> all<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.860> our<00:02:23.950> graphic<00:02:24.340> designers

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
fonts that all of our graphic designers

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.960 
fonts that all of our graphic designers
needed<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.270> just<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.350> one<00:02:26.650> copy<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.430> then

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
needed I just have the one copy and then

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.330 
needed I just have the one copy and then
any<00:02:28.150> changes<00:02:28.660> they<00:02:28.810> make<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.440> are<00:02:29.650> written

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
any changes they make to it are written

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.430 
any changes they make to it are written
to<00:02:30.550> their<00:02:30.760> corresponding<00:02:31.420> differencing<00:02:32.410> disk

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
to their corresponding differencing disk

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.760 
to their corresponding differencing disk
this<00:02:33.400> is<00:02:33.550> helpful<00:02:33.760> in<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.030> lot<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.300> scenarios

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
this is helpful in a lot of scenarios

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.500 
this is helpful in a lot of scenarios
especially<00:02:35.770> with<00:02:35.920> developers<00:02:36.580> they<00:02:37.300> need

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
especially with developers they need

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.320 
especially with developers they need
databases<00:02:38.470> they<00:02:38.950> all<00:02:39.100> need<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.520> same<00:02:39.880> set

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
databases they all need this same set

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.300 
databases they all need this same set
that's<00:02:40.840> probably<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.470> production<00:02:42.040> currently

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
that's probably in production currently

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.699 
that's probably in production currently
and<00:02:42.790> they're<00:02:43.060> modifying<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.959> but<00:02:44.530> each

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
and they're modifying that but each

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.070 
and they're modifying that but each
developer<00:02:45.370> needs<00:02:45.850> their<00:02:46.120> own<00:02:46.300> copy<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.840> that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
developer needs their own copy of that

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.060 
developer needs their own copy of that
because<00:02:47.410> they're<00:02:47.590> making<00:02:47.890> their<00:02:48.040> own

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
because they're making their own

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.449 
because they're making their own
modifications<00:02:49.050> well<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.230> make<00:02:50.500> separate

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
modifications well to make separate

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.460 
modifications well to make separate
copies<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.209> will<00:02:52.570> take<00:02:52.810> up<00:02:52.959> a<00:02:53.019> lot<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.170> disk

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
copies of it will take up a lot of disk

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.680 
copies of it will take up a lot of disk
space<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.190> differencing<00:02:54.730> disks<00:02:55.120> we<00:02:55.540> can

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
space but with differencing disks we can

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.509 
space but with differencing disks we can
only<00:02:55.810> make<00:02:56.050> what<00:02:56.260> we<00:02:56.440> can<00:02:56.560> make<00:02:56.709> one<00:02:56.980> copy<00:02:57.280> of

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
only make what we can make one copy of

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.640 
only make what we can make one copy of
it<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.480> only<00:02:58.630> takes<00:02:58.900> up<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.230> amount<00:02:59.560> of

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
it so it only takes up that amount of

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.040 
it so it only takes up that amount of
disk<00:02:59.830> space<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.310> then<00:03:00.940> again<00:03:01.239> just<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
disk space and then again just the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.509 
disk space and then again just the
changes<00:03:02.650> are<00:03:02.830> written<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.280> these

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
changes are written to these

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.460 
changes are written to these
differencing<00:03:04.030> disk<00:03:04.060> saving<00:03:04.810> us<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.050> lot<00:03:05.290> of

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
differencing disk saving us a lot of

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.010 
differencing disk saving us a lot of
disk<00:03:05.709> space
