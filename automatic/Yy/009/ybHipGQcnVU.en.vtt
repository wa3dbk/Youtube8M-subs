spinning off holding on precariously
back<00:02:38.540> there<00:02:38.690> let's<00:02:38.870> see<00:02:38.990> how<00:02:39.050> she<00:02:39.140> holds<00:02:39.350> her

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:48.220 
back there let's see how she holds her
accessory<00:02:42.010> fairly<00:02:43.010> well<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.780> let's<00:02:48.050> take<00:02:48.200> a

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
accessory fairly well so let's take a

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.750 
accessory fairly well so let's take a
look<00:02:48.410> at<00:02:48.500> her<00:02:48.620> again<00:02:52.450> 360<00:02:53.450> degree<00:02:53.750> view<00:02:54.080> I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
look at her again 360 degree view I

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.980 
look at her again 360 degree view I
really<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.270> figure<00:02:56.480> there's<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.810> couple

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
really like this figure there's a couple

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.230 
really like this figure there's a couple
of<00:02:57.170> interesting<00:02:57.410> things<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:58.640> paint<00:02:58.940> on<00:02:59.120> this

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
of interesting things the paint on this

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.210 
of interesting things the paint on this
is<00:02:59.480> shiny<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.050> a<00:03:00.110> lot<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.350> them<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.800> paint<00:03:01.040> I

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
is shiny and a lot of them the paint I

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.880 
is shiny and a lot of them the paint I
have<00:03:01.520> is<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.760> flat<00:03:02.300> paint<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.410> makes<00:03:03.680> it

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
have is a flat paint so this makes it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.890 
have is a flat paint so this makes it
look<00:03:04.040> more<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.610> think<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.390> makes<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.600> look<00:03:05.660> more

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
look more I think it makes it look more

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.760 
look more I think it makes it look more
like<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.080> statute<00:03:06.590> be<00:03:07.040> honest<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:09.110> like<00:03:09.380> the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
like a statute be honest and I like the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.650 
like a statute be honest and I like the
mini<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.040> like<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.460> effect<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:10.850> is<00:03:11.030> an<00:03:11.120> older

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
mini I like the effect this is an older

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.720 
mini I like the effect this is an older
meeting<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.080> PI's<00:03:12.470> very<00:03:13.010> cool<00:03:13.250> very
