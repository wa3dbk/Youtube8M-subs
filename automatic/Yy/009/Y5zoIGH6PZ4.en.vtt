00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.050
 also in the startups area here in 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.610
 campus party 2014 is being presented 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.750
 the first telepresence robot 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.279
 Brazilian 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 through him it is possible that a person 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.720
 who is at home communicates with other 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 people who are here at the event by 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.810
 For example, I'll talk now to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.730
 antÃ´nio who is one of the creators of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.050
 project that had the idea of â€‹â€‹creating a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.340
 Robot Antonio explains to us better 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.739
 how does r1 work the gospel r 1 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.140
 is the first people and also the Brazilian 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.120
 and telepresence and in the series to give you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.309
 the feeling of you is physically in the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.850
 place where you are remote 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.260
 then our focus is on health education and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.390
 large corporations 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.580
 for example , a hospital it can 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.650
 being used in several different 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.570
 areas it may be interacting with 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.030
 pediatric outpatient clinic 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.989
 monitoring you are consulting the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 patient 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.470
 one of the applications I found 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.030
 particularly interesting is a doctor 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.430
 surgeon is connected with it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.969
 participating in a surgery remotely 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.450
 to give to the second view type 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:15.479
 this generates agility and quality within 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.070
 the hospital is tremendously and how 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.689
 a person who is using a robot 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.210
 can control it 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.609
 today we basically have two ways 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.229
 to control a robot is currently it 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.859
 you can simply use a control 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.390
 of xbox is the one that is kind easily 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.189
 any child can control people 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 let the staff here and in control 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.679
 campus party, everyone goes out with 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.270
 mouth without problem and i love remotely 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.939
 by any device connected to the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 internet is mobile tablet computer 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.560
 he may be controlling the robot without 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.659
 be present at the site and what is 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.439
 inside the robot any brain of that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.719
 theft 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.359
 We have a notebook inside the robot. 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.649
 in addition it has the controller cards 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:00.960
 of it a kinect sensor is a 2 the nose 3 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.119
 infrared sensors that make the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.840
 presence of it preventing the robot from 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.609
 harvested 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.200
 so even though the person remotely 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:09.420
 grip at the front may collide with a 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.670
 person it for him deviate 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.130
 automatically is if someone jumps in the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.700
 front 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.560
 The same or the same time is because if you 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.390
 is controlling this locally in a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.940
 like this one that has thousands of 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.390
 people here is so could contain this 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.150
 problem then with r 1 no no no 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.770
 would collision and control all this 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.960
 you need a very powerful battery to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.780
 any battery life of r 1 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.660
 today it has autonomy between 4 to 6 hours 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.460
 depending on the usage is forecast 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.680
 had to be marketed 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.370
 it is already being marketed this is 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.850
 the official version released version of it 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.170
 while you're thinking is okay 35000 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.700
 about 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.950
 beauty then we talked to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.440
 who is one of the creators of the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.690
 project and creator of r 1 t 1 which is the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.340
 first Brazilian telepresence robot 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.440
 his startup booth is 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.450
 located in open fields as well as the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.430
 other fields of the fair then anyone 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.870
 t1 should run because the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.280
 march tomorrow, tomorrow 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.290
 continue to follow the adrenaline in 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.420
 We'll be back soon with more information. 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.600
 of campus party 2014 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.600
 bye
