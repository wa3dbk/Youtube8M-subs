00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello and welcome to shares 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.540
 with head of boring and rational 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.960
 to become rich in fashion 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.880
 Today, it's about the question of what makes 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.179
 actually money makes it rather happy 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.210
 or that makes him unhappy because 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.830
 always when it comes to money 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.740
 individual questions and discussions of the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.170
 everyday then quickly form such a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.820
 old son has two fronts or one 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 front where people say yes 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.320
 Money that does not make you happy at all 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 and all people have the money 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.750
 are in principle completely disturbed 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 depressed and the faxes all that and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 then pull behind control and stuff 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.329
 It does not make you happy 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.329
 and then the other side says 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.309
 Well, of course, only those say that 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.750
 Neider who have no money so well 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.590
 Of course, making money happy and so 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.129
 on and on 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.489
 and that's why we are dedicated to today 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.859
 just in the issue number 2 of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.199
 Psychology of money of this question 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.640
 makes money actually happy 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.530
 or not i can for my part 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.659
 Both perspectives speak because I 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 have a very long time with very little 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.189
 money and as a pretty amarok I lived 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.509
 I'm here as a personal trainer 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 starting in berlin zehlendorf too 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.400
 I have worked for over three years 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.900
 Principle lived by the hand in the mouth 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320
 Maybe I had to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.170
 do you know that at lidl or aldi at that time? 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.119
 these 39 cent noodle packs 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.759
 always bought so where ever so 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.710
 pack of spaghetti was then one 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.549
 Pack of tomato paste and a pack like that 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.409
 a disgusting parmesan cheese and it 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.659
 I have some really weeks long 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.399
 Yes, of course I lived too much 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.310
 Proud to be kind to my parents 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.049
 go there and somehow there for money 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 because of course I am looking for the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.320
 had decided on an independent way 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.119
 and I did not want that then 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.950
 arrive again in all their spells 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.640
 because you see there you have it unfortunately 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.469
 not done and so and then now 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 I am a fraction where it is quite good 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.900
 I'm still not multi 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.520
 millionaire but I am like that 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.410
 financially free that I mean 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.479
 livelihood and my holidays and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.800
 whatever more stop I like 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.240
 can afford and that's why I know just 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.790
 both sides a bit and so on 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.410
 that's why my opinion is doing now 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.020
 money happy or unhappy mine 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.080
 opinion is not mine at all 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.430
 opinion, money is something pretty 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.380
 neutral and it reinforces what already 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.300
 that could be a bit now 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.860
 philosophically esoteric yes but me 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.260
 wants to explain a few examples 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.290
 money reinforces what is already there 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.700
 if someone is absolutely not partout now 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.330
 to deal with money 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.280
 yes, because he somehow all the time 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.190
 is overindebted all the money he is one 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.050
 Immediately returns and unnecessary things 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.760
 is constantly being financed somehow new 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.920
 You do not need to buy cars or cars 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.540
 somehow I heard of the other day 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.670
 one of the remove transform the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.190
 for 400 500 euro the newest 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.970
 Vacuum cleaner begrudge although they have no 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.590
 has money and so if i have this people 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.910
 give more money or if these people 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.160
 have more money 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.830
 yes and then it would be in my opinion 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.440
 only aggravate the problems 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.630
 The leaf money reinforces that already 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.060
 there it is also brings in humans the 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.310
 character more apparent 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.420
 So money does not change the character 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.489
 of a human 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.110
 it only brings the character he has 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.480
 better to see because you 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.300
 See what he does with this money and what 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.040
 he hires money in general so is 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.170
 nothing good or bad money is 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.600
 actually completely passive neutral I 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.700
 Can with money either in a school 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.920
 invest and always have a school 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.750
 building a third world country and I can 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.820
 but also with the same money a 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.560
 investing and 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.470
 bomb this school again 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.750
 So what I do with the money that 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.760
 is the ultimate crew at the whole 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.110
 thing yes and that's the point I too 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.510
 have a long time in the sports shop 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.620
 worked the completely catastrophic 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.390
 was managed 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.680
 in my opinion anyway and there 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.570
 it was always said yes soon come new ones 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.700
 Investors and there we have more money 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.580
 yes and that leads to if one 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.400
 System is ill in the sense of that 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.650
 not work if just too much 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.100
 high costs are there if 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.079
 if there is no real structure 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.880
 Anyway from customer so if there is 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.530
 There is no system at all here 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.940
 More and more people survive in us 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.009
 the proximity in the store street that is so 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.690
 right on the subway without at all 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.949
 somehow my art market analysis too 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.259
 make or look there is ever 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.240
 interest for yes and if you stop more 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.820
 money comes in then you will 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.910
 Generally the problems only continue and 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.729
 further and further tighten 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.000
 whereas if something is done well and 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.699
 works well and is positive and 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.449
 something works well in small and 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.880
 then more money goes into it both 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.180
 now at the company level as well 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.770
 Personal level then money is something 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.539
 positive in my opinion then makes 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.030
 it also happier so if i am this 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.260
 system can develop gradually and 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.990
 that is one of the most important points 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.330
 in my opinion, then with money 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.240
 to be able to handle this is something like 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.009
 playing the piano or playing football or 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.410
 somehow learn a language 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:20.770
 you have to learn it step by step 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.360
 and just train yes and that is 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.099
 just do not go from one day to the next 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.380
 you can see all the lottery players 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.510
 who somehow never money before 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.919
 or very little, only then suddenly two 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.349
 million or 3 million on the account 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.690
 and just not at all 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.120
 money has grown so much so 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.919
 this responsibility comes with it 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.440
 which you also have to grow into 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.740
 a little yes and so it depends on the one hand 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.110
 from what is already if you have many 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.110
 problems has financial problems though 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.639
 one owe many, etc 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.400
 then you become theoretical or then 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.440
 one usually holds the debt practically 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.210
 even more if you do not have money 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.010
 does he have that means someone over-indebted 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.690
 is not going to owe all his 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.580
 Immediately pay off with more money 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.020
 at least not in most cases 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.729
 is a part of it using the 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.669
 pay off debts and the rest already 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.260
 again spend this unnecessarily 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.060
 means in my opinion is money makes 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.770
 money neither happy nor unhappy 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.130
 But money is completely neutral and 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.440
 reinforces what is already there and it 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.599
 depends also on which kind and 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.180
 Of course, I earn the money 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.790
 So do me what I'm doing and fun 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.740
 I am 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.840
 By doing that, of course , it makes me too 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.940
 the money I get from it happy 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.880
 yes if it is something where I somehow 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.530
 the feeling I have is not really 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.300
 behind it as not fun or it 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.130
 is somehow ethically unreasonable 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.440
 then it can be that money too 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.060
 not necessarily happy yes that makes 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.280
 In any case, my opinion was the 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.730
 psychology of money you have to go into that 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.890
 money into it, yes, and money 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.750
 brings the character to the fore it 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.120
 reinforces what is already there 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.580
 What is your opinion makes money 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.440
 happy or rather unhappy and how 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.880
 you really need a lot of money 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.700
 to be happy 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.030
 I was then a poor staff 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.560
 Coach happy too I knew that 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.760
 I will earn more money someday 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.040
 I just always have mine too 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.660
 Talents focused on my work 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.940
 and I was happy anyway 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.620
 people then but what is theirs 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.300
 Write down your opinion here 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.970
 and then we'll see each other the next 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.970
 subtract video in Iraq
