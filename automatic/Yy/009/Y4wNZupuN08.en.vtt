00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.350
 it's a butterfly 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.269
 42 species 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.370
 they told us that the morning was coming out 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.440
 born 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.440
 if the mornings said that newborn 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.550
 the Paradise 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.629
 so this 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.260
 he has even eaten his bananas 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.469
 if not 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:02.379
 but I'm fine not only the right one 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.379
 light blue his football players 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.080
 good for that 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.290
 and another silver 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.509
 yes 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140
 [Music] 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.570
 look at this white room finally here I 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 brought list 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.950
 why not one 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.320
 according to the scientific studies the 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.590
 butterflies that can not live on 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.590
 the rest 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.870
 same if we 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.300
 then private going through 43 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.300
 species 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.500
 Fermented fruit plants because 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.790
 we have to put how it is protected 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.469
 do 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.800
 put the food so that they can 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.600
 survive 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.840
 and in captivity they can live a 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.190
 little more than what was studied 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.530
 whose two weeks more 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.750
 here it comes to live up to four 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.750
 weeks depends on the species 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 I already made four processes in the east 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.410
 blue on the morphing lake 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.030
 butterflies has a very special plant 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.170
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.170
 the problem is that rap 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.010
 yes yes 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.050
 the celestial ones 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.050
 have sustenance 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.180
 inside of that 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.180
 what is that 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.640
 when they have wings for protection 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.160
 there are so many you did not know that a post-title 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.509
 but it seems as if their wings are 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.509
 were not broken he said 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.590
 can not play anymore 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.590
 Y 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.780
