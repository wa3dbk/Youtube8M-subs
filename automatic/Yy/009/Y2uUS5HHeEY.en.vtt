looks<00:03:13.080> like<00:03:13.200> they<00:03:13.560> did<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.280> supplied

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
looks like they did you the supplied

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.930 
looks like they did you the supplied
allen<00:03:15.030> key<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.770> couple<00:03:16.770> caps<00:03:17.040> looks<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:17.910> a

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
allen key a couple caps looks like a

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.640 
allen key a couple caps looks like a
couple<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.390> cable<00:03:18.750> ties<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.260> thing<00:03:19.470> does

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
couple of cable ties this thing does

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.100 
couple of cable ties this thing does
have<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.860> cable<00:03:20.340> management<00:03:20.570> solution<00:03:21.570> on<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.930> a

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
have a cable management solution on it a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.480 
have a cable management solution on it a
couple<00:03:22.830> spacer<00:03:23.400> some<00:03:24.890> different<00:03:25.890> size<00:03:26.070> screws

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
couple spacer some different size screws

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.370 
couple spacer some different size screws
here<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.000> these<00:03:27.570> are<00:03:27.720> your<00:03:27.810> big<00:03:27.959> mounting

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
here and these are your big mounting

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.140 
here and these are your big mounting
screws<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.920> mount<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.730> rest<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
screws that mount this to the rest of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.410 
screws that mount this to the rest of
the<00:03:30.420> mounting<00:03:30.720> solution<00:03:32.120> speaking<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.240> that

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
the mounting solution speaking of that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.030 
the mounting solution speaking of that
here<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.410> rest<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.800> mounting

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
here is the rest of the mounting

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.940 
here is the rest of the mounting
solution<00:03:35.220> now<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:36.780> does<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.080> mounts<00:03:37.800> to

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
solution now what this does is mounts to

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.010 
solution now what this does is mounts to
the<00:03:37.980> other<00:03:38.190> side<00:03:38.430> your<00:03:38.640> desk<00:03:38.910> bolts<00:03:39.840> through

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
the other side your desk bolts through

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.300 
the other side your desk bolts through
this<00:03:40.170> guy<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.860> kid<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.870> know

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
this guy and you kid you know

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.740 
this guy and you kid you know
mount<00:03:44.310> up<00:03:44.400> like<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:44.910> you're<00:03:45.030> not<00:03:45.120> really

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
mount up like that so you're not really

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.449 
mount up like that so you're not really
damaging<00:03:46.320> your<00:03:46.410> desk<00:03:46.650> at<00:03:46.830> all<00:03:46.920> I'm<00:03:47.070> sure<00:03:47.160> to
