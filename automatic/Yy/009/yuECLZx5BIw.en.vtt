I'm going oh no I gotta do it the right
way<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.840> do<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:45.230> way<00:03:45.440> then<00:03:46.340> I'm<00:03:46.489> going<00:03:46.640> to

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
way so do it this way then I'm going to

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.830 
way so do it this way then I'm going to
say<00:03:47.830> roll<00:03:48.830> it<00:03:48.980> up<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.340> when<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:49.970> roll<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.360> what

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
say roll it up and when you roll it what

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.809 
say roll it up and when you roll it what
I've<00:03:50.930> learned<00:03:51.230> is<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:51.860> layer<00:03:52.550> it<00:03:52.640> out

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
I've learned is you layer it out

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.610 
I've learned is you layer it out
properly<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.420> you<00:03:53.510> can<00:03:53.630> get<00:03:53.720> your<00:03:53.780> ends<00:03:54.170> but

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
properly so you can get your ends but

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.890 
properly so you can get your ends but
the<00:03:54.709> middle<00:03:55.010> bit<00:03:55.160> is<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.430> most<00:03:55.610> important<00:03:56.120> so

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
the middle bit is the most important so

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.720 
the middle bit is the most important so
you<00:03:56.959> just<00:03:57.110> kind<00:03:57.319> of<00:03:57.440> wrap<00:03:58.099> it<00:03:58.250> around<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.810> then

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
you just kind of wrap it around and then

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.860 
you just kind of wrap it around and then
pull<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:01.760> back<00:04:02.060> hopefully<00:04:03.019> this<00:04:03.200> works<00:04:04.870> you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
pull it back hopefully this works you

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.030 
pull it back hopefully this works you
got<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.140> pull<00:04:06.319> it<00:04:06.440> really<00:04:06.590> tight<00:04:06.680> but<00:04:06.980> you

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
got to pull it really tight but you

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.589 
got to pull it really tight but you
don't<00:04:07.190> want<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.370> be<00:04:07.760> too<00:04:07.940> crazy<00:04:08.180> or<00:04:08.390> else

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
don't want to be too crazy or else

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.030 
don't want to be too crazy or else
you're<00:04:08.780> going<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.930> or<00:04:09.530> else<00:04:09.680> you're<00:04:09.769> going<00:04:09.980> to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
you're going to or else you're going to

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.830 
you're going to or else you're going to
rip<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.290> nori<00:04:12.290> sheet<00:04:12.620> which<00:04:13.190> is<00:04:13.310> not<00:04:13.459> good<00:04:13.840> and

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
rip the nori sheet which is not good and

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.050

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
just wrap it over and then I you can do

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.120 
just wrap it over and then I you can do
another<00:04:17.209> kind<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.290> get<00:04:18.470> it<00:04:18.560> out<00:04:18.680> do<00:04:18.919> another
