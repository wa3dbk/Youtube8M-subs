00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.209
 good good my name is black we are 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.450
 playing minecraft tutorial we are at 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.870
 our chapter of mind factor and mode 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.780
 Rules of 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.990
 so as chapter number 2 I'm going to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.180
 show three other three things about this 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.330
 way the first one we're going to see is the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.590
 fertilize that complements the harvester 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.840
 and when planting, what he does is enter 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.770
 with fertilizers to the earth and do 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.000
 grow much faster 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.850
 and the harvest 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.770
 It looks exactly the same as if it were 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.750
 a harvester is put on one side in the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.330
 center and makes the 3 x 3 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.400
 an area of 3 x 3 ahead of itself 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.870
 just like the extra jug so the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.380
 upgrade pattern now in this I put 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.150
 well the numbers of how would the the 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.160
 areas 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.230
 so use the same types of 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.650
 upgrade that we saw in the chapter 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.020
 previous 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.610
 as the harvest now yes that would be 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.230
 are these areas to fertilize this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.270
 here 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.470
 so we put it I put it in this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.760
 case opposite we can put in 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.700
 either side while you are 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.040
 focused on the area and on one of the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.370
 sides 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.370
 and well in this case I finished it like this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.540
 I have connected the energy and we are going to talk 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.000
 a little of the fertilizers that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.670
 they use comes by default to use 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.790
 the fertilizing industries that is the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.010
 manure fertilizer reloaded 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.710
 we can also use the if we have 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.960
 installed forestry to use the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.850
 fertilized fort street and in the case 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.770
 that we have industries we can both 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.640
 use industrial fertilizer 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.580
 craft these three are the ones you accept for 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.780
 fertilize so before you enter it 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.790
 let's put a couple to see how 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.790
 it works putting 8 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.119
 it's instant 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.720
 in fertilization and obviously that the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:13.580
 harvester will harvest it without any 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.130
 problem the others this does not generate any 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:22.120
 cell type and without any waste 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.120
 so it's not going to create this 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.140
 I do not remember the name je 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.700
 good 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.950
 It is light and this will not create the south and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.310
 so then only connecting the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.120
 energy can not enter and with a 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.209
 Hindu or any other system of 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.460
 entry of items to enter 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.430
 automatically the 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.570
 the fertilizers so let's do 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.530
 that we are also going to put them 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.250
 fertilizers here 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.280
 and we are going to put an item of these 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.280
 products and I have this one here 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.400
 let's grab a grow 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.640
 and a pneumatic engine plan 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.489
 so I can automatically take it out 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.830
 and click and I'm not going to take it out yet 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.360
 because before entering the fertilized 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.310
 I'm going to show you the other two items that 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.379
 let's see what we're going to see in this 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.850
 episode the second is this that is the 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.670
 Belta Convention 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.350
 is a good is a greater system that 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.870
 I'm going to show all the colors there 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.140
 they do exactly the same when the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.740
 income we put it 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.610
 of either of the senses 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.440
 as you can see 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.040
 and we put it backwards we can make a 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 circle well 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.650
 and if we put ourselves above, look how we 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:00.830
 carries 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.520
 among all of them you are not 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.520
 there it goes 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:11.700
 to you but there 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.700
 if we throw one comes right in there 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.900
 let's make it like this we have 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.470
 so what he does is transport items 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.199
 or animals or players or what you 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.290
 want through these same we have 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:32.130
 Various colors to use 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.070
 As you can see all these here we are going to 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.330
 see the colors that we want 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.240
 and networking is pretty easy to make 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.560
 colors in really easy think that if 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.460
 we use white 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:53.530
 where is the agreement this is the 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.610
 original 5 rubÃ©n reston iron does not give 16 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.910
 directly and then we can 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.950
 color it with a potter and what 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.050
 will be measured and well in mind factor loader 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.120
 what is done with clay 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.120
 and the color you want 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.520
 that way you can paint from 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:18.320
 any color and I have put them here 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.440
 to go down from the hard western 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:26.000
 until a collector system that is 3rd 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.310
 and they say we 're going to see in this episode 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.639
 of the tutorial that what it does is 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.550
 grab an item let's put this pick 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.070
 absorbs it and if we have only if 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.500
 we have a chef or a doom item or a 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.150
 where the item goes if it does not go to 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.310
 work will stay up going to 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.139
 wait until he has an exit to 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.370
 be able to absorb what you think has 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:51.370
 put here 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.370
 tec 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.870
 so now we are going to connect 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.360
 imagine what will happen the 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.160
 harvester lower beasts will stretch 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.440
 all the sites around here and they're going to go to 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.850
 this list in collector and chest is a 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.530
 of the forms after being the one 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.720
 want is one of the many ways that 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.040
 you can do to collect 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.470
 we can also use it for 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.240
 transport animals and if we kill 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.680
 wrong animals can absorb 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.520
 the drop of the mod 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.210
 so 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.750
 We are gonna give 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.750
 Y 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.650
 you saw 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.900
 let's get a chorus so 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.129
 li qing 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.150
 and in this way you can see how they are 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.130
 collected 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.170
 here I'm going away so that numbers do not 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.170
 the aggressor can not see 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.400
 many 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:00.310
 and return them to the campus 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.080
 and this way if we bring unit in a 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.440
 attempt or any way to enter 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.440
 the cidh that same that we harvest 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.440
 so 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:15.140
 it's going to be automatically while we read 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.610
 the amount of fertilize so that 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.129
 work 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.050
 infinitely so I hope that you 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:24.939
 have liked with people in subscribe 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.939
 and see you in the next tutorial goodbye
