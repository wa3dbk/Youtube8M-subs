00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.360
 no, we're really happy I think 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.160
 it continues a bit their behavior of 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.370
 paris saint germain we are really 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.500
 content today it was and avoids the 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.880
 last last week for us 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.980
 but it's true that today if a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.650
 day taking away for two days which 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.910
 come from jurors have experienced a lot 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.890
 of opportunities many of you 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.810
 wish even other teams they 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.010
 have chosen paris saint germain 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.229
 I think it's a moment that for 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.920
 we who have seen become really 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:38.710
 important 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.469
 I see it was like that with momo 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.449
 sissoko it was like that with salvatore 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.559
 Sirigu 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.469
 I believe they will bring with 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.299
 moment by swear I'm going to start 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.129
 at auxerre but I have teams like 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.559
 valence like liverpool like the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.469
 juventus one day said big time 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.209
 even though he's only 26 years old I think 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.579
 it's nice to come back to paris 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:05.470
 it's something that is to be at 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.420
 bets for him be accepted 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.820
 important also in this choice 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.330
 he is really happy to have a 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.130

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.820
 a lot to bring to the club and the team 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.700
 this rigals is another great player 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.180
 which is also chosen a challenge to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.210
 overseas 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.950
 this is the first time she comes 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.050
 the stranger put himself in great 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.650
 experience for or for him level 1 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.440
 human level at the sporting level he has 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.810
 does very well last 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.140
 two years that the permit to be in the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 three best goalkeepers in Italy and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.480
 today it is considered vice and 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.130
 buffoon me this is where everything is there he is 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.840
 very happy to be in paris 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.480
 he is very happy to be a part 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.050
 of a team like paris saint germain 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.340
 and he is honored with the interest they 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.780
 were carrying towards him and marrying a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.280
 happier from the last days 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.840
 that a student ue that this desire to 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.840
 acquire it and bring it back to paris 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.340
 it's predicted and offers 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.290
 actually as united combined with its 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.930
 aspirations 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.240
 the team leaves with a management that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.030
 perfectly suited to the career of 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.920
 solo and for his feet of his 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.550
 commitments to the team 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.860
 Italian and internationally I think 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.560
 firstly, that's where it's deserved 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.930
 that it is won on the field so 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.770
 his commitment is first to make 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.350
 his best 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.610
 here the team that has just integrated to 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.070
 the army the land convocations has 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.320
 does a European opera what are there there 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.430
 already care for me it's a huge 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.540
 fun to play at paris saint germain 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.190
 why I opted for holy paris 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.210
 germain simply because it's 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.060
 a saint club with a very project 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:02.020
 ambitious with them great people 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.060
 who gave me that they show that they 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.660
 have helped very important speeches to 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.520
 My respect 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.160
 so that's why I really 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.360
 opted for paris saint-germain 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.370
 I think that kind of speech that has 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.220
 really makes the difference and especially 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.300
 their long-term project that makes 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.900
 that kim who really motivated me opted 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.900
 for paris saint-germain
