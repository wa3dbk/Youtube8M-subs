okay<00:00:30.340> so<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:32.529> will<00:00:32.649> see<00:00:32.920> if<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.460> working

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
okay so we will see if I working

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.170 
okay so we will see if I working

the copter by pushing up and down the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.680 
the copter by pushing up and down the
throttle<00:00:56.589> it<00:00:57.159> will<00:00:57.309> become<00:00:57.549> solid<00:00:57.789> so<00:00:58.479> now

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690

transmission is right is correct have
close<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:54.490> 1618<00:01:55.750> frame<00:01:56.750> per<00:01:56.960> second<00:01:57.380> okay<00:01:58.370> a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
close to 1618 frame per second okay a

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.370 
close to 1618 frame per second okay a
battle<00:02:00.050> of<00:02:01.330> course<00:02:02.330> in<00:02:02.570> since<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.900> digital

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
battle of course in since the digital

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.080 
battle of course in since the digital
solution<00:02:04.130> ah<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.860> image<00:02:07.100> quality<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.550> perfect

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
solution ah the image quality is perfect

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.440 
solution ah the image quality is perfect
but<00:02:09.160> versus<00:02:10.160> distance<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.759> frame<00:02:11.000> rate<00:02:11.210> will

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
but versus distance the frame rate will

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.740 
but versus distance the frame rate will
decrease<00:02:12.700> no<00:02:13.780> free<00:02:14.780> lunch<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.200> we<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.440> say

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
decrease no free lunch and we can say

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.600 
decrease no free lunch and we can say
it's<00:02:17.750> very<00:02:17.870> stable<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.620> beginner<00:02:19.250> mode<00:02:21.610> okay

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
it's very stable and beginner mode okay

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:32.000 
it's very stable and beginner mode okay
i<00:02:22.640> will<00:02:22.910> now<00:02:23.270> engage

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.910 

I<00:02:32.129> would<00:02:32.700> turn<00:02:32.879> now<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.209> sport<00:02:33.540> mode<00:02:33.569> now

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.780 

so<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:39.950> would<00:02:40.310> say<00:02:40.460> how<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.100> return<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.700> them

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
so I would say how is a return to them

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.850 
so I would say how is a return to them
function<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.750> working<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.320> press<00:02:45.560> long

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
function is working and we press long

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:56.200 
function is working and we press long
time<00:02:46.070> here<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:50.530> don't<00:02:51.530> know<00:02:51.590> where<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.860> go<00:02:55.210> Wow

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
function in the return home will be fake

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.660 
function in the return home will be fake
I<00:03:11.050> forgot<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.290> disengage<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:13.600> okay<00:03:15.250> as<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.520> can

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.340 

the<00:05:16.919> video<00:05:17.220> link<00:05:17.430> is<00:05:17.639> correct<00:05:18.090> as<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:19.020> can<00:05:19.169> see

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
the video link is correct as you can see

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.260 
the video link is correct as you can see
on<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.130> display<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.580> frame<00:05:21.300> rate<00:05:21.509> is

on the display the frame rate is

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.040 
on the display the frame rate is

meters and 15 and the transmission link

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.379 
meters and 15 and the transmission link
is<00:05:37.050> good<00:05:40.220> as<00:05:41.220> you<00:05:41.400> can<00:05:41.550> see<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.910> iop

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
is good as you can see the iop

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:51.320 
is good as you can see the iop
Invincibles<00:05:43.139> I<00:05:44.330> will<00:05:45.330> try<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.630> turn<00:05:45.960> on

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.920 

okay<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:53.520> light<00:05:53.699> start<00:05:54.000> to<00:05:54.120> be<00:05:54.300> inside<00:05:54.539> I<00:05:54.750> mean

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
okay the light start to be inside I mean

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.939 
okay the light start to be inside I mean
I<00:05:55.080> really<00:05:55.229> see<00:05:55.830> so<00:05:56.099> i<00:05:56.129> was<00:05:56.370> gently<00:05:57.199> no<00:05:58.199> slow

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
I really see so i was gently no slow

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.559 
I really see so i was gently no slow
down<00:05:59.189> and<00:05:59.909> we<00:06:00.030> stopped<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.419> rake

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.899 

so<00:06:06.110> you<00:06:06.229> have<00:06:06.499> something<00:06:07.039> like<00:06:07.069> four<00:06:07.550> minutes

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
so you have something like four minutes

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.239 
so you have something like four minutes
five<00:06:08.539> minutes<00:06:08.599> when<00:06:09.499> you<00:06:09.710> are<00:06:09.860> transmitting

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:10.249 
five minutes when you are transmitting

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.659 
five minutes when you are transmitting
and<00:06:10.669> recording<00:06:11.289> okay<00:06:12.289> probably<00:06:12.919> more<00:06:13.279> if<00:06:13.520> you

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
and recording okay probably more if you

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:22.500 
and recording okay probably more if you
are<00:06:13.759> not<00:06:13.879> recording

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.640 

okay<00:06:23.350> we<00:06:23.650> learned<00:06:23.860> our<00:06:24.040> country

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.170 

well<00:06:28.310> Livefyre<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:31.250> new<00:06:31.400> functionalities

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
well Livefyre the new functionalities

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.490 
well Livefyre the new functionalities
are<00:06:32.210> written<00:06:32.630> to<00:06:32.810> them<00:06:32.960> while<00:06:33.759> is<00:06:34.759> not<00:06:35.030> so

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
are written to them while is not so

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.379 
are written to them while is not so
efficient<00:06:36.500> because<00:06:36.949> when<00:06:37.789> you<00:06:37.910> engage<00:06:38.060> it

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
efficient because when you engage it

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:44.010 
efficient because when you engage it
versus<00:06:38.840> time<00:06:39.850> the<00:06:41.020> return<00:06:42.020> to<00:06:42.259> estimation<00:06:43.100> is

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
versus time the return to estimation is

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.740 
versus time the return to estimation is
more<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.199> more<00:06:45.350> biased<00:06:45.949> and<00:06:46.250> so<00:06:46.940> it's<00:06:47.419> less

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
more and more biased and so it's less

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.100 
more and more biased and so it's less
and<00:06:47.960> less<00:06:48.080> accurate<00:06:48.590> so<00:06:49.490> definitively<00:06:50.240> don't

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
and less accurate so definitively don't

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.529 
and less accurate so definitively don't
use<00:06:51.440> it<00:06:51.740> don't<00:06:51.889> expect<00:06:52.430> some<00:06:52.639> accurate<00:06:53.060> result

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:53.539
