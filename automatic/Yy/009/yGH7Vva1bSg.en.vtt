00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the 4 gig I bought two of these so it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.399 
the 4 gig I bought two of these so it
totals<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> 8<00:01:00.870> gigs<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.640> they<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:02.820> have

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
totals up to 8 gigs and they don't have

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.039 
totals up to 8 gigs and they don't have
the<00:01:04.409> 8<00:01:05.040> gig<00:01:05.489> kits<00:01:05.820> available<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:06.930> not

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the 8 gig kits available but I'm not

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.820 
the 8 gig kits available but I'm not
sure<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.549> even<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.970> any<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.710> for<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
sure if they even have any and for the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.109 
sure if they even have any and for the
power<00:01:11.310> supply<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:12.590> have<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.010> Xigmatek<00:01:14.610> vector

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
power supply I have the Xigmatek vector

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.270 
power supply I have the Xigmatek vector
as<00:01:15.680> 650<00:01:16.680> watt<00:01:16.830> 80<00:01:17.159> plus<00:01:17.520> silver<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.009> for<00:01:20.009> the

as 650 watt 80 plus silver and for the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.420 
as 650 watt 80 plus silver and for the
cooling<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.850> chose<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.650> thermal<00:01:22.650> tech<00:01:22.770> TT

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
cooling I chose the thermal tech TT

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.830 
cooling I chose the thermal tech TT
water<00:01:24.619> 3.0<00:01:25.619> Pro<00:01:25.979> I'm<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.670> mistaken<00:01:26.939> yeah<00:01:27.240> got

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
water 3.0 Pro I'm not mistaken yeah got

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.090 
water 3.0 Pro I'm not mistaken yeah got
that<00:01:27.869> one

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that one

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.300 
that one
because<00:01:29.880> even<00:01:30.360> if<00:01:30.509> he's<00:01:31.229> not<00:01:31.259> overclocking<00:01:32.130> he

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because even if he's not overclocking he

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.539 
because even if he's not overclocking he
wants<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.299> processor<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.110> last<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.430> bit

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
wants the processor to last a little bit

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.990 
wants the processor to last a little bit
longer<00:01:35.670> than<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.210> should<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:37.640> good<00:01:38.640> cooling

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
longer than it should so good cooling

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.710 
longer than it should so good cooling
would<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:40.140> better<00:01:40.590> because<00:01:41.189> silicones<00:01:42.030> heat

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
would be better because silicones heat

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.940 
would be better because silicones heat
not<00:01:43.229> good<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.729> last<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.140> least<00:01:46.409> I'm

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
not good and last but not least I'm

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.120 
not good and last but not least I'm
sorry<00:01:48.110> for<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.350> storage

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
sorry for the storage

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.289 
sorry for the storage

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
I bought the Samsung 840 Evo SSD for the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.219 
I bought the Samsung 840 Evo SSD for the
price<00:01:54.540> for<00:01:55.409> about<00:01:55.619> 200<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.420> think<00:01:57.420> about<00:01:57.600> 280

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
price for about 200 I think about 280

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.469 
price for about 200 I think about 280
the<00:01:59.009> performance<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.610> good<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.000> read<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the performance is good the read and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.789 
the performance is good the read and
writes<00:02:00.719> are<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.079> talking<00:02:01.619> about

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
writes are good talking about

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.789 
writes are good talking about
performance<00:02:02.520> I'll<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.479> short<00:02:04.020> benchmark

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
performance I'll have a short benchmark

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.999 
performance I'll have a short benchmark
of<00:02:04.979> these<00:02:05.509> components<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.320> the
