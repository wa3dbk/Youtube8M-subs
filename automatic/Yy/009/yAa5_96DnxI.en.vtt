00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.270
 the sprouted king in glass in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.030
 sprouted very beautiful king can be 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.970
 also used as a centerpiece e 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.000
 very easy to use and suitable 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 especially with mucilaginous seeds such as 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 the mustard arugula the watercress but 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.490
 also to others such as the radish the grass 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.430
 medical broccoli 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.899
 let's see how to use a sprouted King 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.350
 example with watercress seeds 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.659
 take a teaspoon of seeds and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 we put them to soak in a teacup 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:49.429
 of water we stir let it soak for the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.920
 time indicated on the package 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:55.519
 in the case of fashion, just half an hour 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.519
 an hour 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.590
 after the soak we pour the seeds on the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.260
 retina and with a teaspoon with your fingers 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:16.910
 they spread all over the retina 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:20.120
 at this point we fill the base 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.330
 of water so that placing the retina 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.620
 on the base the water gets to touch i 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:31.110
 signs the seeds feel luminous 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.030
 [Music] 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 the sprouted reva placed in a place 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.940
 at room temperature away from sources 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.520
 of heat and intense as for example i 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.780
 stove and where there is a bit of light 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.470
 natural after 24 hours 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.050
 take the retina and moisten the seeds 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.530
 under a thread of water or with one 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.530
 spray 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.479
 after 24 hours we will still see the seeds 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.000
 they took root in the water 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.959
 and at this point they will supply themselves 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.160
 from there it is no longer necessary to water the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.989
 seeds indeed this should be avoided because 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.120
 watering them from above could do 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:26.910
 rot the bottom if necessary we can 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.069
 change the water in the base 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.370
 but at this point he sprouted king 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.580
 mainly will do everything alone and how 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.099
 I like to say you can even go out 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.040
 come back two three days later and find 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.180
 we will find the salad ready to ours 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.380
 return the sprouts will be ready about 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.239
 from the fifth sixth day of germination 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.910
 they are ready when the roots will have 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.680
 reached the bottom and the leaves will be 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.500
 well developed 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.850
 at this point we can use them for 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.519
 garnish our preparations if not 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.160
 we eat them immediately we can keep them in 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.260
 sprouted and leaving only a veil 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.680
 water on the bottom so that the roots 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.170
 do not dry up and they will still remain 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.170
 for three to five days 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.790
 not 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.790
 [Music] 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.280
 when we have consumed all 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.950
 shoots we can take the basis the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.630
 wash them with soap and water too 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.430
 with the help of a toothbrush and then 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.270
 using other signs we can 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.349
 start over 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.500
 when the shoots are bridges you can 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.860
 use them in the kitchen for your own 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:56.260
 salad preparations but not only also 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.920
 bruschetta first course side dishes and go 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.190
 saying 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.160
 if you want you can always take inspiration 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.610
 on the recipes on the site 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.610
 sprout it
