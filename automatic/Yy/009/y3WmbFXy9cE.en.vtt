00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
first one I saw it move

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.200 
first one I saw it move
did<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.870> see<00:04:36.050> ID<00:04:36.260> as<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.770> did<00:04:36.980> I<00:04:37.220> thought<00:04:38.060> it

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
did you see ID as I did I thought it

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.480 
did you see ID as I did I thought it
moved<00:04:38.510> on<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.870> first<00:04:39.110> one<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.440> remember<00:04:39.920> there

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
moved on the first one I remember there

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.910 
moved on the first one I remember there
is<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.730> pass<00:04:41.180> interference<00:04:41.570> on<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.350> call<00:04:42.590> too

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
is a pass interference on the call too

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.740 
is a pass interference on the call too
so<00:04:43.310> it's<00:04:43.490> going<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.670> be<00:04:43.760> a<00:04:43.790> first<00:04:44.090> down<00:04:44.300> one<00:04:44.600> way

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
so it's going to be a first down one way

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.530 
so it's going to be a first down one way
or<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.020> other<00:04:45.050> first<00:04:45.920> look<00:04:46.310> we<00:04:46.520> had<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:47.210> thought

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540
