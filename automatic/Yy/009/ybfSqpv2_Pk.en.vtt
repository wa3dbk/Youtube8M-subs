frequently<00:01:49.439> at<00:01:49.890> large<00:01:50.369> manufacturers<00:01:51.210> when

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
frequently at large manufacturers when

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.359 
frequently at large manufacturers when
they're<00:01:51.750> trying<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.110> determine<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:53.189> can

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
they're trying to determine if they can

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.789 
they're trying to determine if they can
somehow<00:01:53.579> improve<00:01:54.030> their<00:01:54.240> product<00:01:54.689> by<00:01:55.290> looking

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
somehow improve their product by looking

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.889 
somehow improve their product by looking
at<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> competitor<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> same<00:01:57.600> test
