00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.990
 daily shrimp 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.480
 yo guests a whole day 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.580
 good day all here and you know 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.380
 of course all a bee or and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 wasps that prick you that stings you 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 and it hurts a lot for one 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 few seconds or a minute 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.550
 maybe maximum 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.199
 but just does quite a while but when 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 what are the most painful ones 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.369
 insect bites someday that I go for you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.810
 put in a list and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.880
 the pain scale over the course of 0 to 4 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.500
 where 0 is almost no pain and where it is 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.030
 with 4 horrible pain and we are 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.040
 start at the sweet pea 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.620
 north america and that's just a pain 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.250
 and have a fair amount of tendons or wasps 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.780
 in this list 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.219
 I also don't know why probably 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.020
 because i just know to be super annoying 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 and have no other purpose than it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 pollinating plants and flowers and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.910
 so 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.250
 and stabbing of people of course but the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.110
 its pain scale is zero and you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 have only a very short pain and only the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 pain is slightly fleeting and our for with 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.750
 a small fork and ready for use on your arm 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.670
 you are seared away so that is 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.230
 hardly any pain and the next 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.030
 pain comes from fire more and more that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 are also reasonably spiky animals off 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.670
 and every now and then because every now and then it just crawls 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.930
 on your legs so then you have absolutely no 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.580
 by until you then all think 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.380
 spots on your legs are but the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.390
 pain scale thereof is a point two and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.439
 the duration of the pain is around 2 to 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.850
 5 minutes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.770
 involving a sudden sharp pain 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.570
 so that lasts a few minutes and you 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.970
 gets annoyed by itching 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.990
 red bumps on your leg and it looks 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 not out 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.750
 and it is therefore fairly quickly gone 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.310
 but it's just crazy because that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.229
 animals that just poke apps and it 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.430
 briefly hurts and the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.680
 next on the list comes from the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.170
 and Kasimir bull ears deliver 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.729
 pain scale of a point 8 and the duration 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.200
 about four to six minutes 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.850
 and it is a rare pain 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 people describe that by that beast 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.210
 because it is kind of 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.770
 penetrating kind of pain as if 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.180
 someone a not you by you scared you a 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.619
 shoot and that quite apart to 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.659
 and is then on the list 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.310
 the north american hornet and it lives 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.780
 the pain of two 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.939
 and you let them so it three to four 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.990
 minutes and the pain is also quite apart 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.700
 because it feels like you're in one 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.320
 hinged door is stuck with your hand 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.700
 that the crow door is called that by 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.630
 and he has it against your hand 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.189
 offense 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 but the revolving door can by so so 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.570
 all the time a bit of pain which is very 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.619
 very annoying and you can go free 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.940
 do little if they are natural 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.800
 hey are crossed I can not really 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.300
 but that you only 3 to 4 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.050
 minutes so that in itself is okay 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.550
 falling 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.020
 but from a small time it is quite 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.400
 fairly irritating and the next 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.170
 irritating insects when it comes from the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.700
 yellow jacket and our wasps species and 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.320
 it lives just as much pain on ours 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.240
 North American Hornet namely one 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.890
 pain scale of two point zero and the 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.330
 duration is 4 to 10 minutes 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.640
 resting on that of course is number 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.500
 coins more than with that hornet but the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.790
 the pain is incredibly hot 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.650
 it looks like someone is casting a cigar 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.270
 makes up your tongue 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.250
 and that is of course a super horrible 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.910
 feeling annoying and painful as someone 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.770
 that would do 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.630
 i don't know i think pretty much 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.610
 people have ever experienced myself 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.260
 not that anyone cares in a cigar 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.030
 Your tongue also quite strange because 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.320
 doing it of course but so and pain is 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.270
 it and then prom of course quite well 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.800
 violent and the next irritating bug 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.970
 is the honeybee and I think we have this one 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.050
 actually all have it 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.430
 experienced because we have reasonable 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.200
 many honey bees in the Netherlands 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.550
 and I think everyone has one 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.230
 has been stuck through and the bowl 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.120
 two of them are zero and the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.350
 duration is also four to ten minutes 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 and it feels about like one 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.430
 match head being shot and on 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.500
 your skin ends up being quite irritating 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.480
 feeling and so it takes a reasonable amount of time 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.950
 number of minutes and I have it too 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.360
 I have had a choir sometime 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.550
 a wasp or a bee firing 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.590
 france we were in the slide and 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.890
 a traffic jam occurred in the middle of the slide 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.630
 to hold 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.730
 well that is of course a genius 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.320
 young am a feather totally awesome though 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.239
 then someone falls behind on ours 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.250
 group because we were with him with one 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.140
 number of people in the middle of the slide and there 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.370
 was another buddy of us who stayed upstairs 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.320
 but that was forced by one 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.489
 number of people to get off the slide 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.080
 and because those people who stood 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.790
 of course waiting so that had to be there 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.070
 coming at the back and it filled us up 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.350
 and under the slide was a wasp's nest 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.209
 and that berry with cameras to go up and down 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.310
 I had my hand on the side of the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.470
 slide and then where I stung through 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.239
 a wasp in the middle of my hand and the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.100
 the west in the middle of my index finger and 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.870
 that was a fairly irritating feeling and 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.070
 well you know she's about 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.570
 similar to such a steak of the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.250
 honeybee and the next annoying 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.410
 Insects come from the red mine 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.870
 more and its pain scale is 3 points zero 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.950
 and it takes about 1 to 8 hours is that 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.120
 is quite a bit longer than the 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.340
 previous one 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.870
 animals and insects better but the pain 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.130
 and this is literally the 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.350
 description that is included 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.209
 he is hefty and inexorable and it 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.100
 feels like someone used to be a farmer 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.440
 remove your ingrown toenail 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.239
 well that is really delicious 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.610
 feel I think and especially if you have that one 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.070
 full for eight hours and the next 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.960
 stab 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.780
 from pier is best and the pain thereof is 3 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.700
 point zero on the scale of pain of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.200
 animal stings or insect stings that is 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.460
 really a weird scale he chose it that way 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.500
 mentioned but well you know 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.050
 its duration is 5 to 15 minutes 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.820
 and it feels a bit corrosive and 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.480
 burning and it feels a bit like 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.550
 someone 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.050
 acid murder on a cut and that is 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.310
 pretty annoying feeling because you 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.780
 have probably been one time that had 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.300
 you have a wound somewhere and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.830
 then then if salt comes in if you like 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.540
 that for example 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.190
 and then making food or something like that 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.080
 a little salt in it or if a little 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.360
 drink just throws a drink over it 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.470
 coal or something that burns pretty well 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.970
 reasonable if we let it out 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.830
 and that's how it feels for five to five 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.570
 fifteen minutes and the next 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.010
 Sting comes from Michelangelo's rake and it 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.080
 That name sounds terribly scary 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.880
 jewel heart till just sounds fucking 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.470
 scary and the pain scale is therefore four 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.030
 point 0 so as the worst pain you 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.250
 can ask for and yet the only state 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.810
 at number two because the duration of the 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.960
 pain is only three minutes so that 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.630
 is not too bad and the pain is blinding 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.980
 had to be shocking and electric that state 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.330
 at the description and that feels like 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.670
 a hair dryer has fallen 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.170
 here bubble bath holy shit that's really one 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.330
 kutgevoel and that we create in your note 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.850
 luckily only 3 minutes is left 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.110
 doing a lot of pain and last stitch 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.690
 from the koog more and the pain scale 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.490
 of which is 4 plus the city is even worse 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.800
 then the one from above to whip that 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.340
 huck but the pain of it, the duration 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.780
 12 to 24 hours so that is really fucking 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.100
 long that is really huge long we really 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.320
 do not experience mittens descriptions of 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.820
 the pain is pure and intense you must 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.160
 compare to walking over burning 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.980
 charcoal and 8 centimeters long rusty 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.170
 nail in your holy shit here 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.580
 and that is really that pained fucked up 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.700
 you really don't want to experience it 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.650
 just so and very pain and that 12 to 24 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.330
 holy shit really pity for hours 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.650
 the people who are stung by it 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.910
 I never want to experience it, I hope so 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.530
 it never went through but this was mine 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.360
 List again for this week I hope so 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.470
 you enjoyed it 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.450
 if you liked it please leave one 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.680
 inch height for this video and for me 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.030
 see you again next week with a new one 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.530
 in fact also left behind 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.490
 you want me to talk about it 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.190
 and then maybe I'll go next week 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.630
 something from the bowl and from reactions 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.430
 but how people get for it 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.430
 until the next time and hour
