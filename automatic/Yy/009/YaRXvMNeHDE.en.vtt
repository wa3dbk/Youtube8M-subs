but it's pretty small you can see here

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.459 
but it's pretty small you can see here
and<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.300> has<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.899> couple<00:00:55.140> h2

and on the back of it it has a couple h2
it<00:00:55.620> has<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.920> HDMI<00:00:56.399> port<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it has one HDMI port and it's got the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
it has one HDMI port and it's got the
power<00:00:57.510> input<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.280> got<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> little

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
power input and then it's got a little

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.250 
power input and then it's got a little
mini<00:01:00.480> USB<00:01:00.690> port<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:01.949> which<00:01:02.570> had<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.930> rubber

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
mini USB port on it which had a rubber

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740 
mini USB port on it which had a rubber
cover<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:06.090> guessing<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.540> used

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
cover on it that I'm guessing is used

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.620 
cover on it that I'm guessing is used
for<00:01:06.960> service<00:01:07.320> use<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:09.000> we'll<00:01:09.360> leave<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
for service use and so we'll leave that

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.390 
for service use and so we'll leave that
there<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:10.380> connected<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.220> laptop

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
there it's connected up and the laptop

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.830 
there it's connected up and the laptop
I'm<00:01:14.790> using<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.360> mid<00:01:15.990> 2010<00:01:16.680> MacBook<00:01:17.250> Pro<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
I'm using is mid 2010 MacBook Pro and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
I'm using is mid 2010 MacBook Pro and
it's<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:19.080> audio<00:01:19.409> or<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.490> one<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> features

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it's got audio or it one of the features

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
it's got audio or it one of the features
is<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.720> outputs<00:01:22.080> audio<00:01:22.439> through<00:01:22.710> its

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
is that it outputs audio through its

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
is that it outputs audio through its
mini<00:01:23.130> DVI<00:01:23.490> port<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:25.049> order<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> make<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
mini DVI port so in order to make it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.550 
mini DVI port so in order to make it
work<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.270> laptop<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.299> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> have

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
work on a laptop like this is I have

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.730 
work on a laptop like this is I have
this<00:01:29.720> adapter<00:01:30.720> cable<00:01:30.990> from<00:01:31.110> Griffin<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
this adapter cable from Griffin it's the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.539 
this adapter cable from Griffin it's the
mini<00:01:31.920> DVI<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> HDMI<00:01:32.520> adapter<00:01:33.299> cable<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
mini DVI to HDMI adapter cable and that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.490 
mini DVI to HDMI adapter cable and that
makes<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> work<00:01:36.000> with<00:01:36.150> these<00:01:36.270> MacBook<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
makes it work with these MacBook so the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.310 
makes it work with these MacBook so the
first<00:01:37.740> step<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.840> will<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.170> ahead

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
first step here is to we will go ahead

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
first step here is to we will go ahead
and<00:01:40.560> plug<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.040> adapter<00:01:41.130> cable<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:44.420> okay

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
and plug in the adapter cable here okay

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.200 
and plug in the adapter cable here okay
we've<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.140> connected<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.399> since

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
we've got that connected and then since

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.399 
we've got that connected and then since
the<00:01:48.360> MacBook<00:01:48.689> Pros<00:01:48.930> USB<00:01:49.470> ports<00:01:51.020> output<00:01:52.020> higher

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the MacBook Pros USB ports output higher

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
the MacBook Pros USB ports output higher
voltage<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.700> power<00:01:53.909> than<00:01:54.180> an<00:01:54.420> average

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
voltage more power than an average

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.200 
voltage more power than an average
laptop<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.799> only<00:01:55.920> requires<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> these<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
laptop it only requires one of these to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
laptop it only requires one of these to
power<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> device<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.200> when<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.070> see<00:01:59.250> here

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
power the device so when you see here

see<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.170> wallpaper<00:02:06.619> which<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.799> do<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> if<00:02:09.539> we

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
see my wallpaper which I do so if we

I<00:02:25.950> think<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.700> marketing<00:02:27.000> materials<00:02:27.450> say<00:02:27.540> less

I think the marketing materials say less

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.320 
I think the marketing materials say less
than<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:28.349> millisecond<00:02:29.010> which<00:02:29.160> seems<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.239> be

than one millisecond which seems to be

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.370 
than one millisecond which seems to be
pretty<00:02:30.600> accurate

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
pretty accurate
