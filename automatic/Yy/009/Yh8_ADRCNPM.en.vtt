his<00:01:51.570> soil<00:01:51.780> testing<00:01:52.110> equipment<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.860> he

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
his soil testing equipment because he

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
his soil testing equipment because he
wanted<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:53.970> here<00:01:54.240> they

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
says these are wood chips this is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.630 
says these are wood chips this is
supposed<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.509> acid<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.310> did<00:02:05.549> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
supposed to be acid and and we did it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.930 
supposed to be acid and and we did it
twice<00:02:05.850> he<00:02:06.210> couldn't<00:02:06.509> believe<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.020> saw<00:02:07.320> it's

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
twice he couldn't believe they saw it's

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.140 
twice he couldn't believe they saw it's
7.0<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.570> exact<00:02:09.929> perfect<00:02:10.380> pH<00:02:11.100> for<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> garden<00:02:12.420> I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
7.0 the exact perfect pH for a garden I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.610 
7.0 the exact perfect pH for a garden I
you<00:02:13.840> think<00:02:14.019> God<00:02:14.200> was<00:02:14.560> doing<00:02:15.870> was<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.079> so<00:02:17.379> loved

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
obviously ideal when the science you

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.289 
obviously ideal when the science you
know<00:02:29.739> wanna<00:02:29.890> see<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.099> tes<00:02:30.459> yeah<00:02:30.909> of<00:02:31.030> course

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299

enough here but I'm gonna get it up and
take<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.019> photograph<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.769> show<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.159> soup

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
take and photograph and show that soup

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.970 
take and photograph and show that soup
rice<00:02:54.940> like<00:02:55.510> wasabi<00:02:55.930> has<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.409> grow<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:56.650> standing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
rice like wasabi has to grow in standing

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.699 
rice like wasabi has to grow in standing
water<00:02:57.239> but<00:02:58.239> I'm<00:02:58.359> growing<00:02:58.569> at<00:02:58.689> wasabi<00:02:59.290> not

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
water but I'm growing at wasabi not

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.809 
water but I'm growing at wasabi not
understanding<00:03:00.159> what<00:03:00.280> I'm<00:03:00.400> gonna<00:03:00.489> grow<00:03:00.639> rice

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
understanding what I'm gonna grow rice

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.429 
understanding what I'm gonna grow rice
is<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.150> show<00:03:01.329> people<00:03:01.359> I<00:03:01.659> can<00:03:01.870> do<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.319> that

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
is to show people I can do it so that

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.720 
is to show people I can do it so that
people<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.799> know<00:03:02.829> wherever<00:03:03.159> you<00:03:03.340> live<00:03:03.579> you're

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
people can know wherever you live you're

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.460 
people can know wherever you live you're
in<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.849> hot<00:03:04.000> place<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:04.989> grow<00:03:05.109> Alliance

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
in a hot place you can grow Alliance

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.020 
in a hot place you can grow Alliance
which<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.129> because<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.549> has<00:03:06.670> enough<00:03:06.879> moisture

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
which is because it has enough moisture

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.420 
which is because it has enough moisture
there<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.290> noticed<00:03:08.739> see<00:03:09.069> all<00:03:09.220> the
