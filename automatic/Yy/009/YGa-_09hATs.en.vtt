00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.210 
black ops I always play team deathmatch
because<00:01:27.750> it's<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> most<00:01:28.170> basic<00:01:28.560> gameplay<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
because it's the most basic gameplay the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
because it's the most basic gameplay the
idea<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.150> get<00:01:30.360> kills<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.049> try<00:01:31.259> not

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
idea was you get kills and you try not

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
idea was you get kills and you try not
to<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:31.680> killed<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.640> way<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> won

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
to get killed and not that way you won

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.969 
to get killed and not that way you won
the<00:01:33.180> game<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:34.140> was<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.380> i<00:01:34.409> liked<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.860> was

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the game that was what i liked it was

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
the game that was what i liked it was
simple<00:01:35.430> whereas<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.810> modern<00:01:37.079> warfare<00:01:37.110> 3

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

i'm<00:01:37.619> obviously<00:01:37.770> trying<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.369> mobile<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869

doesn't<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.229> work<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
doesn't really work as well because you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.010 
doesn't really work as well because you
to<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> mobile<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> third

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to get a mobile you have to get a third

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.990 
to get a mobile you have to get a third
of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.259> kills<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.890> often<00:01:47.430> you'd<00:01:47.579> be<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
of the kills which often you'd be like a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.179 
of the kills which often you'd be like a
20<00:01:48.360> street<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.439> someone<00:01:49.799> else<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
20 street and then someone else to

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.710 
20 street and then someone else to
finish<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.579> game<00:01:50.729> which<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.509> Kill

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
finish the game which with Kill

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.090 
finish the game which with Kill
Confirmed<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.229> still<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.649> chance<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
Confirmed you still have that chance of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800 
Confirmed you still have that chance of
happening<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:53.939> general<00:01:54.420> rule<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
happening what as in general rule the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690 
happening what as in general rule the
games<00:01:55.079> go<00:01:55.290> on<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.590> longer<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.040> there<00:01:56.399> isn't<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
games go on for longer and there isn't a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
games go on for longer and there isn't a
kills<00:01:57.149> limit<00:01:57.540> it's<00:01:57.689> kind<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.049> tag<00:01:58.290> limit<00:01:58.590> so

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
kills limit it's kind of a tag limit so

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
kills limit it's kind of a tag limit so
that<00:01:58.950> works<00:01:59.340> better<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> that's<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
that works better so that's what I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
that works better so that's what I
always<00:02:01.320> play<00:02:01.649> kill<00:02:01.860> confirmed<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.820> knew

that<00:02:22.910> I'm<00:02:23.000> looking<00:02:23.180> at<00:02:23.510> that's<00:02:24.080> they're<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
that I'm looking at that's they're the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.890 
that I'm looking at that's they're the
only<00:02:24.800> two<00:02:24.950> places<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.370> can<00:02:25.550> spawn<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.540> it's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
only two places you can spawn so it's

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.229 
only two places you can spawn so it's
really<00:02:27.290> simple<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.770> play<00:02:28.010> all<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.310> had<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.730> do<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
really simple to play all I had to do is

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.940 
really simple to play all I had to do is
just<00:02:29.450> hold<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.080> middle<00:02:30.380> area<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.800> map

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
just hold this middle area of the map

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.680 
just hold this middle area of the map
and<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.430> watch<00:02:31.700> them<00:02:31.910> flood<00:02:32.269> out<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.540> front

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
and just watch them flood out in front

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.059 
and just watch them flood out in front
of<00:02:32.780> me<00:02:32.840> as<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:32.989> can<00:02:33.110> see<00:02:33.319> here<00:02:33.530> when<00:02:34.040> my

doing<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.220> i'm<00:02:49.340> watching<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.850> gate<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.390> then

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
doing is i'm watching that gate and then

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.330 
doing is i'm watching that gate and then
walking<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.410> those<00:02:51.620> two<00:02:51.680> alleyways<00:02:52.190> i'm

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
walking down to those two alleyways i'm

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.610 
walking down to those two alleyways i'm
just<00:02:52.519> checking<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.850> exits<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:54.230> was<00:02:54.380> quite

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
just checking the exits and it was quite

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.890 
just checking the exits and it was quite
easy<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.980> play<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.549> end<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.690> the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
easy to play in the end so the the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.030 
easy to play in the end so the the
benefit<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.410> as<00:02:57.590> well<00:02:57.709> as<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
benefit of this as well as the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.440 
benefit of this as well as the
Commission's<00:02:58.400> obviously<00:02:58.760> really<00:02:58.940> close<00:02:59.209> map

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
Commission's obviously really close map

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.670 
Commission's obviously really close map
that<00:02:59.630> was<00:02:59.690> another<00:02:59.900> reason<00:03:00.110> for<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:00.650> I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
that was another reason for it but I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.320 
that was another reason for it but I
mean<00:03:00.830> if<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.010> think<00:03:01.040> about<00:03:01.220> sea<00:03:01.549> town<00:03:01.760> that's

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
mean if you think about sea town that's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.000 
mean if you think about sea town that's
a<00:03:02.450> close-range<00:03:02.870> map<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.620> spawn<00:03:03.860> by

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
a close-range map but you can spawn by

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.420 
a close-range map but you can spawn by
the<00:03:04.069> tower<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.819> well<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.450> hotel<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.430> the

the tower the well the hotel the the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.850 
the tower the well the hotel the the
market<00:03:07.910> dome<00:03:08.630> is<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> same<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.319> can<00:03:09.440> spawn<00:03:09.680> by
