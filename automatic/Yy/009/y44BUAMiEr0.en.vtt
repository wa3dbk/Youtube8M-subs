00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:10.559
 and there guys I'm here again to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:15.559
 show you a 12 volt source 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 how do you do it using a tx source? 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.000
 this is very easy on the source until xii 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.920
 normal computer you want to have a sound 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 at home if you want to use it 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:35.070
 then the automotive source you if you 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 cut off all children from other 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.489
 things just leave the yellow next to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.120
 all yellow all black meets 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:52.949
 will make 12 volts the name and still 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:56.160
 interacts with others if you can go there and 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:04.320
 one green and one black pp one green going 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:08.130
 Here you have a green wire and the black one you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.540
 the two to be able to connect the 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.790
 my sources even all movies 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.259
 black green I say in this key to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.820
 me at the source 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:24.450
 the key is to do a deal here I did 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.890
 four fonts the font 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.509
 with four sources at tx I called 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.090
 that if you connect in series to aa 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.409
 at a voltage 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 in parallel maintain voltage adding up to 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.299
 amperage 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.299
 so I connected 4 in parallel 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.229
 I gathered all the yellow of the fountains I made 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.369
 one and all prices are also for mascara 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:05.350
 automotive sound 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.350
 here in the fourth deputy 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.039
 call here you see it does not trip is 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.819
 very good 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.190
 sleep disarm may be a more 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.610
 we weigh our door well 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.610
 same 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:03:14.910
