00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.330
 marakasi and you are watching the transfer of fun 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.340
 and bugs part 11 and 1 tank occurred on 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.309
 tundra map 143 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.190
 he lands safely on IS-6 and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.500
 then just sits a long time for him 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 and shoots the enemies but then here it is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 so that's cool he is spinning like 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.340
 you can not continue to fight like nothing 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.680
 I did nâ€™t really like it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.779
 attach to the world from different sides of the tank 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.090
 and then watch it fly 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.940
 I think it looks pretty cool 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.850
 I hope you like them too 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.820
 moments we will have a lot of this today 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.969
 a kind of attraction turns out so 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.340
 The next hero of our video is mx 40 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.710
 the funniest tank in my game 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.050
 every time I see him 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.440
 smile and don't understand how to create 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 this engineering marvel is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 the feeling that this tank just inflated it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.940
 more like at all on some 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.489
 rubber inflatable toy and in my 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.340
 it's very funny and really 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.799
 mx 40 can perform in the comedy club and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.900
 there people laugh and here is our Frenchman 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.170
 apparently decided to swim and accidentally 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.159
 kills t-34 but it seems to me 3 four 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 died not from the blow of laughter after seeing this 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.479
 rubber inflatable tanchik seems to me 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.390
 in general, he can not scare anyone 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.049
 only if you laugh so friends 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.049
 quickly place your bets who will win 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.079
 fv304 or hellcat both players accelerate 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.560
 and go to meet their fate but 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.380
 still, hellcat is victorious and defeated 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.960
 the enemy falls and is very epic to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.750
 rumor has it that this hellcat killed 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.090
 mouse ramming dangerous type how much 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.579
 still illiterate drivers in our 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.030
 the game, for example, wanted to prune the tree 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.759
 arta 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 but the flash drive thought that such a racer 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.880
 places at the bottom the truth is shallow here and ours 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.640
 grief and Lt.-shka continue to merge and here 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.039
 very unlucky object 140 he decided 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.009
 use very risky tactics and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.340
 went to enemy territory but right away 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.459
 same first h150 shots 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.400
 5 he was pleased to blow his side and to 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.190
 besides, our sorrows are failing 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.890
 somewhere under the earth is visible to hell and this 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.379
 pretty funny that this dude 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.150
 did that he was so unlucky and maybe 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.950
 with such bad luck, he better not 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.799
 use such tactics 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.099
 I can assume that he took there 500 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.319
 gold have a serb or something like that so 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.750
 friends continue our rides on 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.879
 this time we'll take a ride on this tree 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.610
 light tank is able to climb where 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.400
 pleases but this time he gets stuck and 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.829
 while next to the cliff and through 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.650
 some time of course christmas tree 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.019
 spins and it's all very spectacular 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.790
 I definitely like watching such 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.220
 moments I imagine how much 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.739
 still such funny situations happen 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.200
 on this without similar tanks all the more 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.340
 conventional tanks infects terrible 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.049
 virus skynet which makes of tank 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.019
 terminator and now he can 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.750
 go down the gun down under the tank maybe 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.030
 so that it is not critical and then later 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.819
 rises with a charged gold 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.480
 projectile which pierces absolutely 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.190
 all afraid to imagine what will happen next 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.519
 the standard situation in the random remains 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.130
 one art attacks under the water but does not sink 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.130
 and the enemies turn on the greed they want 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.410
 destroy it first the Frenchman falls but 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.560
 he can't do it next 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.440
 50 falls four and here she is in beautiful 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.889
 jump takes art boat and this 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.530
 kid i want to shake hands with this and card 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:54.560
 business of course well done are made so that 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.329
 expect here could not drown and so 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.560
 Now I will teach you how to properly 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.010
 shoot down the grip 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.739
 here are two opponents 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.440
 first blow to the first and then 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.290
 heals tee 2 and its nuclear 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.810
 shells also blow it to him bk all 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.299
 it's pretty easy to be tired of losing 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.780
 on the seizure I take the legs constantly take 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.209
 the base 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.180
 then here's a guide on how to shoot down the grip 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.360
 on the map himmelsdorf if you 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.300
 a fugaster of the type like that of sou-152 or apt-2 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.000
 boiled down to your base shoot 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.370
 guilder and capture shot down although you can 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.190
 was in this fight and lose see 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.840
 our guides help watch them more often and 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.599
 then you will bend down 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.479
 and in the next part we will show how 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:44.210
 blow up the enemy without shells and bacon 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.270
 also how to ram the mouse on batchata and 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.210
 demolish a thousand thousand strength well and ours 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.690
 standard heading break uncle vani's house 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.090
