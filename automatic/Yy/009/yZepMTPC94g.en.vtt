00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.940

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:08.020
 so that the press conference also likes 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.290
 in his native language in Spanish 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.230
 can perform 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.630
 You've been here for two months now 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.000
 are you getting settled in he feels 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.270
 well it meets almost like 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.270
 home against Kaiserslautern 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.600
 the only two major differences 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.940
 to santander should the weather and also 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.540
 the different times to those 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.210
 is trained and played to spain 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.760
 he feels very much of the team 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.130
 well received 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.140
 the people are friendly to her too 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.020
 his family was loud then fulfilled 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.520
 very well 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.229
 the 1 1 against Brunswick against 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.970
 Table guide do you rate that 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.549
 this was a success later 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.049
 or lost points and how did that want 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.049
 tackle the game in Ingolstadt 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.370
 a little bit the feeling that we 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:16.880
 lost two points 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.510
 We believe that we are better Brunswick 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.980
 a bit was missing luck too 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.310
 It was a difficult game on 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.990
 tactically continue and have the bulls the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.940
 We now have at home leave 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:49.430
 on sunday pick up against germany and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:52.550
 So there he got in 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.520
 spain in sant he 's tuned 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.430
 from the first league august in one 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.840
 difficult situation forced 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.750
 then came the offer of there 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.180
 Kaiserslautern a cold loud lawyer 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.120
 chrysler and as a traditional club too 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.400
 in Spain is very well known and as 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.950
 great happiness is true then he has 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.870
 again august at 15 approximately with stefan 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.710
 Kunz met and on 25 August can the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.710
 change 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.340
 short review of the game against 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.750
 against braunschweig 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.660
 the question is already 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.150
 having come up he felt two points 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.730
 lost or in the end, too 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.350
 now days with after about five 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.320
 still satisfied with the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.540
 point was still with the game I was 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.740
 satisfied with the overall 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.600
 point we do not want this game 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.730
 also believe that we win the 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.500
 better team were the better ones 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.870
 Opportunities had over 90 minutes 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.700
 and so we have two points 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.800
 left lying 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.110
 now it goes right to ingolstadt 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:05.060
 neat launched new aufsteiger 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:10.190
 stadium but not up-grades neat 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.420
 We want a similar team 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.820
 occur as in the last 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.239
 play away from home say our series 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.370
 continue writing our intention 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.930
 always that we are that we each 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.060
 want to win the game whether away or away 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.570
 at home 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.090
 of course, we try of course 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.130
 Also, we want to start from the beginning 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.080
 we want to go through our game 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.150
 try to play forward 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.780
 creating opportunities and goals 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.900
 achieve 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.760
 That's why you play football and that is 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.600
 we succeeded better at the moment abroad 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.500
 as at home 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.990
 we have performed at home but it 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.880
 failed to refill the 2 0 to achieve 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.050
 and that we are right in the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.520
 play much better off 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.380
 succeeded and that's why we have 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.380
 won the games away 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.660
 albert has 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.600
 one is trained with the team 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.160
 see how the knee reacts we have 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.260
 a training this morning and then 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.630
 I will decide if he is operational 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.460
 is or not 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.260
 well you have now in principle the 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.960
 complete week with the team 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.600
 course, but has some training before 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.120
 Of course, there was no play for weeks 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.150
 Rhythm and I will be there too 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.430
 consider if I take him already 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.260
 in the 18er squad or if we have something else 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.790
 have patience with him we have yes then 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.850
 also next week a test match against 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.980
 the vfb stuttgart but as we said 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.780
 have a training today and and 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.630
 after this training will stand 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.620
 decisive who then the way to 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.620
 Ingolstadt with entrance 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:51.969
 he likes has one must not forget 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.429
 No preparation we had 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:58.139
 just on the first ten days with him 

00:05:54.429 --> 00:06:02.979
 it completes a special program 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:05.169
 Absolute pro tries relatively quickly 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:05.769
 Learning German is very attentive 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.609
 training 

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:11.999
 he wants to learn to get and yes it does 

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:16.599
 absolutely integrated into the team and 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:18.549
 this can also be seen in the game stabilizer 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.049
 in our defense leaves 

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:22.049
 a good impression and I am convinced 

00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:26.049
 if he will eventually ours 

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:27.999
 he then masters the language 

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:29.739
 We will become the leader 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:32.339
 imagine and there is a lot on 

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:32.339
 good way
