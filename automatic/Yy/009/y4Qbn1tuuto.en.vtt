we<00:00:48.390> duct-tape<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.960> everywhere<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
we duct-tape it everywhere so the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.529 
we duct-tape it everywhere so the
battery<00:00:50.070> hatch<00:00:50.280> won't<00:00:50.520> fly<00:00:50.760> open<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.270> such

battery hatch won't fly open and such

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.389 
battery hatch won't fly open and such
things<00:00:53.930> also<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.500> gives<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> mobility

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
things also it gives a lot of mobility

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.150 
things also it gives a lot of mobility
on<00:00:56.760> stage<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:58.350> special<00:00:58.680> thing<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
on stage the special thing about it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.819

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
it won't like fly open or go away if you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
it won't like fly open or go away if you
know<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> mean

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
know what I mean

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240 
know what I mean
and<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.900> check<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.740> actually

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and just check it out it's it's actually

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
and just check it out it's it's actually
made<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> same<00:01:20.909> material<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.540> car<00:01:21.990> belts

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
made of the same material as car belts

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.310 
made of the same material as car belts
so<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.700> more<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:25.110> more

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
so it's kind of more it got more

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.700 
so it's kind of more it got more
durability<00:01:25.770> than<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.340> usual<00:01:26.720> strap<00:01:27.720> so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
durability than a usual strap so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.260 
durability than a usual strap so
basically<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> need<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.240> a

just<00:02:03.750> how<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.050> make<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.350> bass<00:02:05.100> flip<00:02:05.400> or<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> bass

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
just how to make a bass flip or a bass

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.830 
just how to make a bass flip or a bass
bass<00:02:07.140> flip<00:02:07.440> if<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.010> like<00:02:08.160> fishes<00:02:08.840> so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
bass flip if you like fishes so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.110 
bass flip if you like fishes so
basically<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.860> need<00:02:11.010> to<00:02:11.130> do<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.490> yes<00:02:11.850> you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
have to die to do it because the gravity

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.650 
have to die to do it because the gravity
does<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.640> work<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.360> it's<00:02:15.510> not

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
does all the work for you so it's not

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.780 
does all the work for you so it's not
really<00:02:16.020> hard<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.130> put<00:02:17.430> your<00:02:17.550> leg<00:02:17.760> back

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
really hard you just put your leg back

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.190 
really hard you just put your leg back
like<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.860> get<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> firm<00:02:20.100> grip<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:21.060> your<00:02:21.240> bass

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
like this get a firm grip of your bass

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.620 
like this get a firm grip of your bass
or<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> guitar<00:02:23.130> whatever<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.910> use<00:02:24.150> it's

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
or a guitar whatever you use it's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.990 
or a guitar whatever you use it's
basically<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.320> same<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:26.130> main<00:02:26.430> problem<00:02:26.850> we

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
basically the same the main problem we

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.780 
basically the same the main problem we
face<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.870> our<00:02:28.020> straps<00:02:28.350> quite<00:02:28.790> far

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
face is we have our straps quite far

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.000 
face is we have our straps quite far
down<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.990> if<00:02:31.230> you're<00:02:31.410> going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.830> this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
down so if you're going to do it this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.890 
down so if you're going to do it this
way<00:02:32.310> then<00:02:32.790> your<00:02:33.590> head<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.040> head<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.900> bass

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
way then your head the head of the bass

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.980 
way then your head the head of the bass
or<00:02:37.230> guitar<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:38.340> might<00:02:38.550> hit<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.940> ground<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.480> I'm

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
or guitar it might hit the ground so I'm

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.540 
or guitar it might hit the ground so I'm
going<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.470> backwards<00:02:40.710> now<00:02:41.100> just<00:02:41.400> is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
going to do it backwards now just is

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.940 
going to do it backwards now just is
safe<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.720> recommend<00:02:43.050> everyone<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.770> this

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
safe and I recommend everyone to do this

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.470 
safe and I recommend everyone to do this
in<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.220> start<00:02:44.520> because<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.000> actually

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
in the start because it's actually

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.300 
in the start because it's actually
easier<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.380> what<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.830> put<00:02:47.070> your<00:02:47.190> leg

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
easier so what you do is put your leg

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.790 
easier so what you do is put your leg
back<00:02:47.340> like<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.120> then<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.680> flip<00:02:49.680> it

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
back like this and then you just flip it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.840 
back like this and then you just flip it
like<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.910> see<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:53.040> really<00:02:53.400> easy<00:02:53.580> and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
like this you see it's really easy and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.190 
like this you see it's really easy and
then<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> catch<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.570> can<00:02:54.840> do<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:54.959> like

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
then you catch it you can do it like

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.350 
then you catch it you can do it like
multiple<00:02:55.709> times<00:02:55.980> we<00:02:56.280> will<00:02:56.430> show<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.030> later

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
multiple times we will show you later

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.330 
multiple times we will show you later
like<00:02:57.959> from<00:02:58.200> out<00:02:58.320> some<00:02:58.650> live<00:02:58.830> gigs<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.280> stuff

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
like from out some live gigs and stuff

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.310 
like from out some live gigs and stuff
but<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.240> think<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.690> pretty<00:03:00.870> much<00:03:00.989> should

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
but I think this pretty much should

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.290 
but I think this pretty much should
cover<00:03:01.560> how<00:03:01.800> you<00:03:01.830> do<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.280> I'll<00:03:02.489> just<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.000> once

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
cover how you do it I'll just do it once

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.390 
cover how you do it I'll just do it once
more<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.870> get<00:03:04.110> a<00:03:04.140> hang<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:05.250> know

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
more so you get a hang of it you know

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.820 
more so you get a hang of it you know
you<00:03:05.459> take<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.270> throw<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.380> back<00:03:07.590> all

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
you take it like this throw it back all

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.229 
you take it like this throw it back all
you<00:03:08.010> got<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.950> see<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.940> no<00:03:12.060> big
