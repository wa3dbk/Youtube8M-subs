00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
do my whole step by step how you play

do my whole step by step how you play
the<00:02:19.709> game<00:02:19.890> process<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:21.269> really

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the game process so you can just really

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.850 
the game process so you can just really
see<00:02:22.400> how<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> turn<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.140> game<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.470> quarters
