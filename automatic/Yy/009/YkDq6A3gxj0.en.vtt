00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.580
 it was the psv sparta day weekend 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 the youth side of the herdgang 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.360
 psv a1 played with noel and also the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.190
 bits 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.870
 the peers received from 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.690
 Rotterdam 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.699
 psv has four points sparta 6 so that 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.939
 promises an interesting duel in advance 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.160
 to be played two minutes 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.890
 know the specific combination design and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.500
 very controlled around 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.529
 great attack by the claudio team 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.790
 ferrera and the fast lead 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.790
 for the home club 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 the e2 between the motor and pole 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.579
 goalkeeper michael fabry is hopeless and psv 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 has got the taste goes on 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.410
 the miss of fabry 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.239
 and vermote is then a real striker and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.859
 shoot that ball nicely in from the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.770
 difficult corner is very alert to the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.760
 blunder of fabry in the roof of it 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.150
 target 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.150
 2 0 for PSV played less than 6 minutes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 feel a new attack on the left 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.280
 a dyke 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.930
 supplies a corner kick on all couples 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 forward and junior is the man who kicks 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.900
 almost leaves with the head and with the murder 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.310
 on the legs of fabry 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.170
 big chance again for the striker 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:40.920
 but this time the young keeper saves 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:44.070
 sparta p a certain when it will with it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.160
 shot and the beautiful swipe 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.160
 great goal 3 0 for psv 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.360
 what state that free kawai will see one 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:05.340
 beautiful inside and it is not his 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:07.710
 morning then now what the trick box is pulling 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.990
 open , he seems to be losing the ball 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.440
 but more already the left back of sparta there 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:19.460
 what along and find pole that is on the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.460
 number 10 spent 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:30.840
 it is already 4 0 huge blunder 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:32.310
 in the back at sparta and there is nothing 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.459
 withstand 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.040
 with this get rebuild 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.130
 the weather is not good and here what goes 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.780
 having the ball off has all the time and 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.500
 looking for room 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.660
 and this may be a junior goal 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.860
 foot inside but the ball touches the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.040
 wrong side of the pole 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:59.520
 next to it will undoubtedly also marcel 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.739
 brands of psv b1 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.670
 does not stop going in search of more 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.380
 hits 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.040
 know that the sparta passes when it does 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.480
 wind good action from junior no header 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.140
 from van de moat 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.140
 but a corner 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.060
 so it is we all hands on deck for 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.680
 sparta that comes far to the second post 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.170
 and van der moot 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:29.560
 is completely free and shoots beautifully 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:29.560
 inside it is five zero 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.540
 he can just shoot in freely 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:42.310
 so again no chance for michael fabry 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.310
 aad the moss attentive spectator 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.459
 may not know what he sees in that 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:51.470
 first half that is now five zero 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.120
 and what does sparta do then what comes 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.120
 even once over the center line 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.220
 the ball then comes to arnoldus that max grandma 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.220
 go through and sure enough it's five one 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.060
 Arnold can walk through wouters in it 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.810
 groenendijk do not intervene or intervene too late 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.989
 a goalkeeper 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.950
 janiek van os has no chance 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.020
 5 one that is also the rest position what would 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.020
 that then mean for the second half 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.000
 does sparta smell another chance or remains psv 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.980
 effortlessly standing up first avons is one 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.110
 level of the closet from Rotterdam via 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.610
 drilling facia 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.610
 his shot in front 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.550
 they do not give up and in any case 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.800
 alberto from reverse with a great pass 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.890
 on of fashion that only goes on 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.460
 factory and then hit hard 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.460
 his face 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.850
 it was the last action for the goalkeeper 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.980
 from sparta 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.040
 none of the field injured and injured 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.120
 was replaced by robin boat 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.620
 Sparta then again wallpapering which 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.990
 the cross 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.360
 country in the side net but ours is there 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.970
 still on so quickly is still kicking in the 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.840
 absolute final phase of the match five 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.870
 a 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.720
 psv cannot happen anymore can sparta 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.220
 add something to that one hit 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720
 no that is not possible 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.930
 because separating due to flute for it 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.430
 end and so psv wins with five one of 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.110
 Sparta 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.300
 these are all the results of the 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.720
 national b-youth psv therefore wins well 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.540
 Sparta and FC win at Groningen Cambuur 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.060
 FC Utrecht at Almere City Roda JC and 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.790
 Excelsior play a lot of wind right here 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.919
 with az ado and twente the same and feyenoord 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:51.640
 wins from ajax fc twente in the lead 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:56.430
 with 10 out of four and psv is about sparta 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.430
 and is now in place 5 with 7 out of 4
