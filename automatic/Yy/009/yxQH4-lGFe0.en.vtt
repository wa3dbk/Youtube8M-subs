00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
soil building compost with this we want

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.460 
soil building compost with this we want
to<00:02:00.759> do<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.030> at<00:02:01.209> a<00:02:01.270> ratio<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.690> about<00:02:01.780> one<00:02:02.170> part

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
to do this at a ratio of about one part

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.669 
to do this at a ratio of about one part
compost<00:02:02.679> of<00:02:03.220> three<00:02:03.549> parts<00:02:03.850> oil<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.229> just<00:02:05.530> go

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
compost of three parts oil and just go

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:13.890 
compost of three parts oil and just go
ahead<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.009> start<00:02:06.190> shoveling<00:02:06.610> around<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:13.690> this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
ahead and start shoveling around at this

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.020 
ahead and start shoveling around at this
stage<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.950> build<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.280> dam<00:02:15.459> around<00:02:15.849> it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
stage I like to build a dam around it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.479 
stage I like to build a dam around it
just<00:02:16.209> before<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:17.140> completely<00:02:17.590> full<00:02:17.830> in

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
just before it's completely full in

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.520 
just before it's completely full in
order<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.150> hold<00:02:19.360> water<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.900> want<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.170> put<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.349> lot

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
order to hold water I want to put a lot

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.229 
order to hold water I want to put a lot
of<00:02:20.650> water<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.070> for<00:02:21.400> two<00:02:21.579> reasons<00:02:22.030> when<00:02:22.209> I

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
of water in it for two reasons when I

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.479 
of water in it for two reasons when I
need<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.540> hydrate<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.049> tree<00:02:23.470> second<00:02:24.250> thing<00:02:24.400> I

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
need to hydrate the tree second thing I

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.039 
need to hydrate the tree second thing I
want<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:24.880> rid<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.120> all<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.390> air<00:02:25.510> pockets

want to get rid of all the air pockets

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.900 
want to get rid of all the air pockets
that<00:02:26.260> are<00:02:26.859> down<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> root<00:02:27.459> zone<00:02:27.489> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
that are down in the root zone and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:39.750 
that are down in the root zone and
that's<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.540> very<00:02:28.660> best<00:02:28.900> way<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.170> do<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:38.760> we'll

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that's the very best way to do it we'll

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.580 
that's the very best way to do it we'll
just<00:02:39.940> let<00:02:40.090> this<00:02:40.239> fill<00:02:40.510> up<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:41.109> just<00:02:41.320> go<00:02:41.470> right

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
just let this fill up and just go right

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.039 
just let this fill up and just go right
up<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> edge<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.430> dam<00:02:42.609> a<00:02:43.000> couple<00:02:43.959> of

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
up to the edge of the dam a couple of

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:52.940 
up to the edge of the dam a couple of
times

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.199 

you<00:02:53.950> can<00:02:54.129> see<00:02:54.310> how<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.790> can<00:02:54.939> if<00:02:55.090> you

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
you can see how that you can if you

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.580 
you can see how that you can if you
watch<00:02:55.390> closely<00:02:55.599> you<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:55.989> see<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> bubbles

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
watch closely you can see the bubbles

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.959 
watch closely you can see the bubbles
come<00:02:56.769> out<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.040> when<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.219> see<00:02:57.400> bubbles<00:02:57.760> come

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
come out and when you see bubbles come

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.610 
come out and when you see bubbles come
out<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.569> good<00:02:58.750> sign<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.019> means<00:02:59.409> that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
out that's a good sign that means that

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:10.190 
out that's a good sign that means that
the<00:02:59.739> air<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.099> getting<00:03:00.400> settled<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.909> there<00:03:07.769> okay

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
the air is getting settled in there okay

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.940 
the air is getting settled in there okay
there<00:03:11.200> we<00:03:11.319> go<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.260> just<00:03:14.409> let<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.739> water

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
there we go now we just let that water

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.949 
there we go now we just let that water
settle<00:03:15.430> down<00:03:15.549> there<00:03:15.790> let<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> disappear<00:03:16.599> then

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
settle down there let it disappear then

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.559 
settle down there let it disappear then
we'll<00:03:17.139> finish<00:03:17.409> filling<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.829> dirt<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.569> looks

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
we'll finish filling the dirt in looks

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.970 
we'll finish filling the dirt in looks
like<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.870> water<00:03:20.049> settled<00:03:20.469> pretty<00:03:20.620> good<00:03:20.829> now

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
like the water settled pretty good now

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.069 
like the water settled pretty good now
I'll<00:03:21.189> go<00:03:21.340> ahead<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:21.670> finish<00:03:21.849> filling<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.359> in

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.960 

I'm<00:03:26.079> going<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.349> be<00:03:26.530> real<00:03:26.799> careful<00:03:27.189> not<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.700> bury

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
I'm going to be real careful not to bury

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.869 
I'm going to be real careful not to bury
it<00:03:28.120> too<00:03:28.329> deep<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.900> don't<00:03:29.739> want<00:03:29.950> my<00:03:30.159> soil<00:03:30.519> to<00:03:30.730> be

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
it too deep I don't want my soil to be

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.460 
it too deep I don't want my soil to be
any<00:03:31.060> higher<00:03:31.329> than<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.720> top<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.169> existing

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
any higher than the top of the existing

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.460 
any higher than the top of the existing
root<00:03:32.829> ball<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:34.540> we'll<00:03:34.659> just<00:03:34.870> pack<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.109> in

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
root ball and we'll just pack that in

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.879 
root ball and we'll just pack that in
good<00:03:35.709> make<00:03:35.980> sure<00:03:36.159> that<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.459> good<00:03:36.609> and<00:03:36.639> solid

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
good make sure that it's good and solid

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.909 
good make sure that it's good and solid
level<00:03:38.889> it<00:03:39.129> out<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.139> want<00:03:41.349> to<00:03:41.530> it's

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
level it out and if you want to it's

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.830 
level it out and if you want to it's
probably<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> good<00:03:42.400> idea<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:43.359> keep<00:03:43.659> that

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
probably a good idea to to keep that

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.960 
probably a good idea to to keep that
dike<00:03:44.200> intact<00:03:44.769> so<00:03:45.189> the<00:03:45.310> next<00:03:45.459> time<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.760> water

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
dike intact so the next time you water

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.770 
dike intact so the next time you water
you<00:03:46.239> can<00:03:46.389> keep<00:03:46.599> that<00:03:47.819> keep<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:49.000> soil<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.629> keep

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
you can keep that keep the soil and keep

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.379 
you can keep that keep the soil and keep
the<00:03:49.840> water<00:03:50.079> inside<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.919> root<00:03:51.129> zone<00:03:54.389> it

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
the water inside that root zone it

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.759 
the water inside that root zone it
doesn't<00:03:55.690> have<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.870> be<00:03:55.989> much<00:03:56.139> of<00:03:56.169> a<00:03:56.349> dike<00:03:56.560> this

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
doesn't have to be much of a dike this

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.500 
doesn't have to be much of a dike this
time<00:03:56.949> of<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.099> earth<00:03:57.190> once<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.000> fall<00:03:58.209> rains

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
time of the earth once the fall rains

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.539 
time of the earth once the fall rains
start<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.680> don't<00:03:59.859> have<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.129> worry<00:04:00.280> about<00:04:00.400> it

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
start you don't have to worry about it

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.729 
start you don't have to worry about it
too<00:04:00.699> much<00:04:00.729> but<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.090> wouldn't<00:04:01.419> let<00:04:01.659> that<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
too much but I wouldn't let that the

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.500 
too much but I wouldn't let that the
heavy<00:04:02.949> dew<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.519> light<00:04:03.699> rains<00:04:03.970> fool<00:04:04.329> you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
heavy dew and the light rains fool you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.330 
heavy dew and the light rains fool you
it<00:04:04.810> still<00:04:05.019> needs<00:04:05.260> some<00:04:05.440> water<00:04:05.590> till<00:04:06.040> all<00:04:06.220> the

it still needs some water till all the

it still needs some water till all the
leaves<00:04:06.519> are<00:04:06.729> gone<00:04:06.849> so<00:04:07.979> that's<00:04:08.979> how<00:04:09.129> you<00:04:09.190> plant

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
leaves are gone so that's how you plant

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.180 
leaves are gone so that's how you plant
