00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.390
 the youtube road missing 90 with a 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.400
 new video equal friends on this occasion 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.020
 As you can see we have the unboxing of 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.240
 a microphone of the brand that there 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.490
 multimedia that appears here below this 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.990
 model there is rock mick and good microphones 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.830
 to the tip that has special or for what 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.869
 it serves 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.240
 I think with this microphone it 's a 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.090
 microphone 100% compatible with 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.199
 the iphone the ipod touch and the ipad as 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.970
 can appreciate here in what is the 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.080
 front box shows us a little bit about 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.550
 of what the adapter is like 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.410
 connected just north showed us a 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.640
 little about this too here we can 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.800
 see the iphone that we're going to a 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.000
 application let's see in the part 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.410
 side here shows us more 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.750
 applications that are available for 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.640
 use with this type of microphone in the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.050
 back we can see some 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.000
 specifications something that is not already 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.219
 included this microphone is a microphone 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.629
 condenser and in the advantage that 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.070
 it's one-way energy that's going to 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.559
 receiving hate this top 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.660
 and even if there are people talking to one side 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.190
 of you are supposed to get more 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.990
 your voice that is entering this part 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.850
 being a condenser it is understood that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.410
 the pill you have is going to catch a 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.180
 better sound and good all that to listen 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.380
 super super better as I can see in the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.789
 part of here includes what is the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.890
 adapter that is connected to the iphone 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.940
 directly ipod touch and ipad which 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.980
 has an exit to show it 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.960
 in this adapter to be able to put a 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.520
 pedestal and also a cover to be able 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.990
 save it or be the back of the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.510
 box where we can see good 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 is 7 to be able to sing in karaoke for 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.800
 be able to record instruments to be able 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 record a band do interviews of 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.860
 make podcasts or even to occupy it 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.750
 to record video with the application 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.130
 native and good will record with what is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.320
 the microphone and let's proceed to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.320
 open it to not take away much of your 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.600
 time with this one box and you can see what 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.720
 that includes us let's open the points 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.930
 in this part ok 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.460
 and I think this 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.820
 let's get it out 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.650
 it seems to me to take everything 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.690
 If you want to clarify the box , include us 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.370
 nothing else so we're going to put him here 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.350
 to one side and let's proceed to check what 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.640
 which is the microphone itself we are going to remove 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.040
 that also we are going to put a side 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.040
 here in the back it includes us 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.900
 some things as we can see we have 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.209
 take this out 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.430
 It is a small adapter which here 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.069
 power the embedded microphone and this goes 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.629
 connected to a pedestal to be a 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.220
 client of the company to be able to 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.799
 be fixed this is going to be pretty 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.769
 let's put it here next too we 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.989
 includes a small leather touch case 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.159
 or skin to be able to save it when not 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.569
 we are using since good everything 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.459
 type of electronics like microphones 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.340
 tend to deteriorate a lot with the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.439
 dust is good that this to be able 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.439
 save what we are going to put here also at 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.690
 side and has what the manual 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.610
 instructions 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.190
 same let's read again to check to see 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.740
 what is included in this microphone 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.780
 let's also put this here to a 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.480
 side and we will proceed to take what 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.830
 it announces its packaging and the 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.140
 true is a microphone with a very body 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.240
 complete or it feels strong it 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.890
 feels very professional microphone the 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.360
 material that is made this is like a 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.650
 kind of 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.770
 of iron I do not know is very very resistant in 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.930
 the top is also metallic the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.160
 truth is very very good something that I do not 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.510
 liked that I'm seeing is that the cable 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.600
 it looks very thin in this part of here 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.010
 but we assume that all this gives you a 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.720
 kind of support to what is the cable 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.980
 which is very interesting in the part 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.530
 from here we can see a selection of 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.570
 selector which with this we are going to 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.490
 regulate the power we want in 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.750
 letter the microphone in case of 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.430
 you are going to record outdoors where 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.290
 there is a lot of noise, it is advisable 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.180
 put it to a minimum so that art 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.500
 only your voice and do not catch all the 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.730
 environmental sound that they will have and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.350
 well we can see here that is the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.260
 first we are going to connect to our 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.520
 iphone is connected in this way and 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.440
 when ready from here you can already 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.550
 record either with the native application or 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.800
 downloading the applications that we 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.570
 provide this company to use their 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.770
 something very interesting mic that like 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.940
 I told you in this part of here 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.620
 has to be able to connect to a hearing aid 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.450
 so you can be listening and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.190
 monitoring how your audio is entering 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.720
 before I can record it and good friends
