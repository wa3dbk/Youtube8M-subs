00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello how about youtube friends if sergio 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.279
 Moreno and in this new video tutorial 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.460
 let's learn how to download and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.990
 install the game of boost a group me 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 it seems that it is pronounced 2 for psp 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.000
 originally from playstation 1 but in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 debut format 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 bp which means that the piece and what can 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.300
 read good the game is in Spanish not 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.630
 sorry it's in english yes i think it 's 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630
 in English 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.970
 I already said but point bp pp is divided into 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.199
 two parts the first one is 150 megas the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.570
 second 88 megabytes and uploaded to mega and 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.540
 Well the only problem that the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.590
 game is that it is a little out of phase 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.090
 the game I say the forgiveness of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.950
 the audio the music 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.690
 but well I do not think it 's much 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.490
 Still, you can enjoy the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.639
 game so good let's start 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.639
 [Music] 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 ok the first thing we're going to do if we 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.200
 help the description of the good video 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 there will be two links the first for the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.340
 first part and logically the second 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.439
 for the second part I will show how 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.180
 download with the first part nothing more 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.619
 because it 's the same process for both 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.439
 links so good is we go to the link 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.140
 the first link let's say and we're going to have 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.240
 this page from the fly where we have to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.189
 expected to run out 5 seconds 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.200
 once the five seconds run out 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.320
 we'll see this button that says jump 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.869
 advertising is a yellow and good button 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.640
 we're going to give you a click we want to click 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.380
 will begin to load what is the page of 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.390
 mega as we are seeing 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.030
 and well here we have to wait for 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.860
 load if it sticks in 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.680
 our part only authorizes on the page 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.920
 that sometimes is not to say problem of 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.110
 the page or equal of your internet to me 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.700
 before I stayed stuck right now 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.700
 I know it has not happened to me 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.460
 but good once you load the page 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.460
 we will see download the file 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.640
 be back that is let's say the brief of everything 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.500
 Game 2 and part sergio well under 1 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.470
 part 2 depends on the part that 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.470
 download and good in this case the part 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.620
 1 that is 150 megabytes I already said that the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.110
 second part weighs 88 to download is 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.650
 very easy we just click on the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.650
 button says download and eye if they do not have 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.410
 an account if they are not with your grant 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.120
 initiated will ask you to accept some 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.510
 terms and conditions simply 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.980
 palomean the option and ready to 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.900
 download and start what 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.900
 automatically download 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.480
 I pass it good he canceled it because I already 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.250
 I have obviously and good so they have to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.020
 do with both parties 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.520
 once you download both parts you 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.080
 they go where they have saved them in my 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.080
 case and here I have them in a folder 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:18.620
 and we will see vav2 well under sergio punto 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.560
 part 1 and part 2 as I said 150 and 88 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.590
 it varies a little bit when what follows 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.850
 then it is to select both the 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.430
 two files as you are seeing in 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.800
 dale screen and right click 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.360
 any of these two selected 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.430
 obviously we must have the winrar 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.470
 installed if they do not have it then they 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.620
 I recommend that you look for a tutorial in 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.780
 youtube or just go to the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.600
 wincom dotcom page and download 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.420
 it's not a big deal and well let's give 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.790
 extract files or extract here from 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.710
 extract files to select a 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.510
 destination 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.210
 which in this case puts the writer 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.290
 jacques and let's hope selection to 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.540
 desk and accept 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.450
 and start what is the extraction of the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.120
 game as you will see extracting 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.040
 and here the boot point ppp obviously 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.129
 we must wait for it to reach 100% is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.450
 something very fast it takes almost nothing and 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.450
 well let's wait 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.169
 I just fine and what is the extraction 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.199
 of the game now what follows 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:28.000
 next is to find the destination of the 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.000
 extraction in my case from the desktop 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.470
 and we will find a good folder here 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.940
 in the eye of the helghast bears know 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:46.090
 good killzone is a folder called s 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:49.240
 lp m 86 21 9 that is to say so a 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.580
 code of the game code and good for 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.110
 the installation good before if we open the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.470
 binder 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.770
 we will see some kind of fish of 243 megawatts 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.500
 ok here for the installation is the most 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.960
 important to pay attention we must 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.240
 copy all this folder in the folder 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.000
 with the name do not change the name or 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.880
 nothing like this as they are going to copy it to 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.790
 the game folder of your pbi speed that 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.790
 it would be more or less leave a copy 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.060
 name 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:26.690
 and let's see a notepad 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.150
 and well the game route would be more or 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.860
 unless we say that the memory of his 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.860
 g foot is the letter that AJE 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.860
 spears 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.880
 and here in the game let's not say that this 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.750
 would be the route of 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.360
 to copy 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.210
 I think it's inside the track folder 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.770
 but well this would be all if they have 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.919
 some doubt because you already know where 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.719
 contact me by facebook by youtube 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.159
 one of the two channels that I have 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.800
 I leave the other in the description of the video 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.449
 and also by skype 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.949
 and I leave everything there in the description 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.180
 of the video along with my twitch link 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:12.289
 tv point tweets 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.030
 Justin TV is the same and every once in a while 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.880
 I make live broadcasts for who 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.950
 like to see me and good 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.140
 when I'm going to do live missions 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.090
 what's public on my facebook page at 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.460
 just like every new video that I upload like this 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.990
 that I recommend that you like it 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.660
 that are aware of all the 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.160
 videos now if they have any game in 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.569
 especially if you want a game 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.819
 special or some request 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:39.839
 that necessarily I have to 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:42.330
 ask for facebook or else by skype but 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:44.039
 for youtube he did not accept any this is 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.929
 very important since if you 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.659
 comment in this video on some other 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:50.270
 video or send me a private message or 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:53.189
 public in a comment on my channel 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.889
 asking me for a game I'm not even going 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:58.379
 to answer with all the pain but good 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.629
 it's a rule that I have to be a 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.689
 little more organized so if 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.550
 they want a game obviously 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:07.830
 obligatorily sorry for facebook or 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.599
