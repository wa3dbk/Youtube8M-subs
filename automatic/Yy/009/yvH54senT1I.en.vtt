from<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.750> old<00:01:27.869> classic<00:01:28.229> cars<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.799> very

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
from the old classic cars which is very

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.800 
from the old classic cars which is very
very<00:01:29.250> cool<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:30.119> there's<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.479> but

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
very cool I think there's one or two but

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.210 
very cool I think there's one or two but
in<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.229> because<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> logs<00:01:31.740> wasn't<00:01:32.100> quite

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
in this because the logs wasn't quite

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.550 
in this because the logs wasn't quite
also<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.210> or<00:01:33.360> two<00:01:33.390> BOTS<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
also put like one or two BOTS in on the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.080 
also put like one or two BOTS in on the
enemy<00:01:34.710> team<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:35.909> dude

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
enemy team so if you see like one dude

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.609 
enemy team so if you see like one dude
it's<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.360> normal<00:01:36.509> name<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.290> course<00:01:37.409> that

like team deathmatch just paying on the
brand<00:01:46.770> new<00:01:46.890> map<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.310> also<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> little

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
brand new map and you also see a little

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
brand new map and you also see a little
bit<00:01:48.090> gameplay<00:01:48.570> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.840> exploring<00:01:49.229> most<00:01:49.619> of

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
bit gameplay kind of exploring most of

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.620 
bit gameplay kind of exploring most of
this<00:01:50.130> area's<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> try<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.000> kind<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> good

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this area's I try to kind of get a good

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.149 
this area's I try to kind of get a good
look<00:01:51.780> around<00:01:51.990> most<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> different<00:01:52.950> parts

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
look around most of the different parts

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.830 
look around most of the different parts
of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> map<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> see<00:01:54.240> how<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
of the map just kind of see how it

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120 
of the map just kind of see how it
compares<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.560> course<00:01:55.770> their<00:01:55.950> most

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
compares and of course their most

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
compares and of course their most
interesting<00:01:56.520> part<00:01:56.729> was<00:01:56.790> how<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> spawns<00:01:57.540> type

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
interesting part was how the spawns type

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.209 
interesting part was how the spawns type
is<00:01:57.899> still<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> same<00:01:58.170> at<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.979> part<00:01:59.189> right

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
is still the same at this part right

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.560 
is still the same at this part right
here<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.030> still<00:02:00.180> hop<00:02:00.420> up

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
here you can see you can still hop up

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.030 
here you can see you can still hop up
onto<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.500> walk<00:02:01.680> around<00:02:01.829> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
onto there and kind of walk around to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.620 
onto there and kind of walk around to
the<00:02:02.070> cranes<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.790> very<00:02:03.060> cool<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.509> about

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the cranes it's very cool to be about

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.940 
the cranes it's very cool to be about
that<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.229> you've<00:02:04.380> been<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.770> like

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
that it is you've been there in like

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.709 
that it is you've been there in like
years<00:02:05.250> since<00:02:05.399> I've<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.729> more<00:02:05.909> fair<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
years since I've a more fair to but the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.119 
years since I've a more fair to but the
crane<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:06.930> still<00:02:07.229> actually<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> exact

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
crane is still actually like the exact

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.919 
crane is still actually like the exact
same<00:02:08.340> same<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> used<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.780> can

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
same same how it used to be and you can

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.420 
same same how it used to be and you can
I<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.410> way<00:02:10.470> down<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.920> there's<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
I go all the way down it there's that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.710 
I go all the way down it there's that
kind<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.670> connecting<00:02:12.090> claimed<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.420> course<00:02:12.629> for

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
kind of connecting claimed of course for

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.880 
kind of connecting claimed of course for
the<00:02:12.840> excesses<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.440> makes

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the excesses it makes

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
the excesses it makes
a<00:02:13.920> lot<00:02:14.250> more<00:02:14.460> easier<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.150> even<00:02:15.480> still<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.140> can

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
a lot more easier and even still you can

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.870 
a lot more easier and even still you can
actually<00:02:16.530> climb<00:02:16.740> even<00:02:17.040> higher<00:02:17.220> onto<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
actually climb even higher onto the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.100 
actually climb even higher onto the
crane<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.209> can<00:02:18.360> climb<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.690> these<00:02:18.810> little

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
crane you can climb up these little

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.559 
crane you can climb up these little
wires<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.010> go<00:02:20.160> very<00:02:20.670> very<00:02:20.790> high<00:02:21.420> you

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
wires and you can go very very high you

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.390 
wires and you can go very very high you
can<00:02:21.720> actually<00:02:21.870> look<00:02:22.140> down<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.680> entire<00:02:23.160> map

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
can actually look down on the entire map

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.070 
can actually look down on the entire map
which<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.700> crazy<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.600> really<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:24.930> how

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
which is crazy and I really like how

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.390 
which is crazy and I really like how
they<00:02:25.200> left<00:02:25.410> this<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.010> ding<00:02:26.160> kind<00:02:26.340> of

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
they left this in and ding kind of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.190 
they left this in and ding kind of
change<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.540> actually<00:02:27.660> get<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.900> very

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
change it so you can actually get a very

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.050 
change it so you can actually get a very
advantageous<00:02:28.530> split<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.280> advantageous<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.970> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
advantageous split is advantageous for a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
advantageous split is advantageous for a
little<00:02:30.240> while<00:02:30.420> until<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.080> shoot<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.380> couple

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
little while until you shoot a couple

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.470 
little while until you shoot a couple
times<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.490> you'll<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.850> here<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.420> I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
times and like you'll see here and I

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
times and like you'll see here and I
just<00:02:33.600> get<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.810> few<00:02:33.930> shots<00:02:34.020> off<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.590> wasn't<00:02:34.920> really

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
just get a few shots off I wasn't really

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.680 
just get a few shots off I wasn't really
sniping<00:02:35.490> all<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.820> grows<00:02:36.060> missing<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> lot<00:02:36.570> of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
sniping all that grows missing a lot of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.300 
sniping all that grows missing a lot of
shots<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.050> but<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:37.920> eventually<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.280> got

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
shots and but then eventually I got

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.740 
shots and but then eventually I got

the exit is very very easy to kind of

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.090 
the exit is very very easy to kind of
hop<00:03:06.660> up<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:06.840> which<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.410> cool<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.860> see<00:03:07.980> in

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
difficult like feat to actually walk all

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.930 
difficult like feat to actually walk all
the<00:03:13.950> way<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.190> building<00:03:14.519> but<00:03:14.580> now<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.760> can

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
the way on the building but now you can

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.550 
the way on the building but now you can
kind<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.150> EXO<00:03:15.450> boost<00:03:15.660> around<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.350> makes<00:03:16.470> it

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
kind of EXO boost around so it makes it

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770

because<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.000> course<00:03:51.239> obviously<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.720> map<00:03:51.840> is

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
because of course obviously the map is

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.660 
because of course obviously the map is
about<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.620> same<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:53.250> got<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.519> air

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
about is that the same you got the air

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.430 
about is that the same you got the air
kind<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.000> not<00:03:54.299> really<00:03:54.329> made<00:03:54.660> people<00:03:54.780> spawn<00:03:55.200> in

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
kind of not really made people spawn in

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.810 
kind of not really made people spawn in
the<00:03:55.530> outside<00:03:55.920> which<00:03:56.130> kind<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.340> sucks<00:03:56.549> for<00:03:56.700> her

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
the outside which kind of sucks for her

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.759 
the outside which kind of sucks for her
eyes<00:03:57.000> everything<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.720> great<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.560> lot<00:03:58.739> of

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
eyes everything that great for a lot of

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.890 
eyes everything that great for a lot of
arrows<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.310> skill<00:03:59.880> tree<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.269> can<00:04:00.420> reminds<00:04:00.690> me

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
arrows a skill tree so it can reminds me

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.140 
arrows a skill tree so it can reminds me
of<00:04:01.049> trying<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.709> get<00:04:01.980> nukes<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.459> moral<00:04:02.850> fed<00:04:03.000> too

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
of trying to get nukes in moral fed too

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.550 
of trying to get nukes in moral fed too
and<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.480> when<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:03.780> get<00:04:03.930> your<00:04:03.959> harriers<00:04:04.440> you

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
and like when you get your harriers you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.590 
and like when you get your harriers you
know<00:04:04.650> tropicana<00:04:05.070> 8130<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:06.209> reminds<00:04:06.510> me

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
know tropicana 8130 this reminds me

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.660 
know tropicana 8130 this reminds me
exactly<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:07.350> same<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.769> getting<00:04:08.010> 8<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.250> 30<00:04:08.519> and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
exactly the same of getting 8 on 30 and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.400 
exactly the same of getting 8 on 30 and
everyone's<00:04:09.030> inside<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:10.019> just<00:04:10.200> crazy

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
everyone's inside and it's just crazy

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.860 
everyone's inside and it's just crazy
how<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.890> advanced<00:04:11.250> warfare<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:11.790> far<00:04:12.120> past<00:04:12.359> more

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
how in advanced warfare so far past more

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.030 
how in advanced warfare so far past more
or<00:04:13.019> fair<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.470> can<00:04:13.620> still<00:04:13.829> get<00:04:13.950> that

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
or fair to you can still get that

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.650 
or fair to you can still get that
feeling<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.459> had<00:04:14.670> back<00:04:14.910> during<00:04:15.120> warfare<00:04:15.390> two

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
feeling you had back during warfare two

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.479 
feeling you had back during warfare two
so<00:04:15.840> read<00:04:16.049> does<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.769> same<00:04:16.979> feeling<00:04:17.010> and

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
so read does have that same feeling and

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.890 
so read does have that same feeling and
of<00:04:17.579> course<00:04:17.789> there<00:04:18.000> are<00:04:18.120> no<00:04:18.239> windows<00:04:18.479> on<00:04:18.750> that

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
of course there are no windows on that

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.390 
of course there are no windows on that
side<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.350> did<00:04:19.590> really<00:04:19.680> get<00:04:19.859> too<00:04:20.010> many<00:04:20.130> kills

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
side so I did really get too many kills

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.159 
side so I did really get too many kills
when<00:04:20.850> they're<00:04:21.030> all<00:04:21.209> inside<00:04:21.630> they<00:04:21.870> again<00:04:22.080> you

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
when they're all inside they again you

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.140 
when they're all inside they again you
can<00:04:22.320> see<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.710> Paladin<00:04:23.070> as<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.700> exactly<00:04:24.030> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
can see the Paladin as in exactly the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.760 
can see the Paladin as in exactly the
same<00:04:24.210> way<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.810> would<00:04:24.840> expect<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.560> and

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
same way that you would expect it to and

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.620 
same way that you would expect it to and
just<00:04:26.190> like<00:04:26.310> an<00:04:26.490> 8130<00:04:27.030> from

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
just like an 8130 from

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.750 
just like an 8130 from
modern<00:04:27.930> warfare<00:04:28.080> 2<00:04:28.470> but<00:04:28.920> it's<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.310> lot<00:04:29.400> darker

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
modern warfare 2 but it's a lot darker

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.310 
modern warfare 2 but it's a lot darker
and<00:04:30.090> like<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.360> seems<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.810> be<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.930> little<00:04:31.170> bit

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
and like it seems to be a little bit

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.510 
and like it seems to be a little bit
smaller<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.710> course<00:04:31.920> there's<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.160> excesses

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
smaller of course there's the excesses

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.760 
smaller of course there's the excesses
exits<00:04:33.390> make<00:04:33.570> every<00:04:33.960> map<00:04:34.110> seem<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.440> lot<00:04:34.740> smaller

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
exits make every map seem a lot smaller

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.320 
exits make every map seem a lot smaller
because<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.400> can<00:04:35.580> boost<00:04:35.730> around<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.180> can

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
because you can boost around you can

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.970 
because you can boost around you can
boost<00:04:36.480> forward<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.170> of<00:04:37.260> course<00:04:37.290> vertically

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
boost forward and of course vertically

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.650 
boost forward and of course vertically
as<00:04:38.100> well<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.490> kind<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.730> like<00:04:38.880> makes<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.390> lot

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
as well it kind of like makes that a lot

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.360 
as well it kind of like makes that a lot
less<00:04:39.810> than<00:04:40.020> obstacle<00:04:40.470> like<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.040> older

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
less than obstacle like in the older

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.860 
less than obstacle like in the older
games<00:04:41.550> it<00:04:41.760> was<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.910> lot<00:04:42.060> more<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.360> big<00:04:42.510> deal<00:04:42.540> if

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
games it was a lot more of a big deal if

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.540 
games it was a lot more of a big deal if
you're<00:04:43.020> on<00:04:43.200> top<00:04:43.500> of<00:04:43.680> lucker<00:04:43.890> if<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.220> had<00:04:44.310> some

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
you're on top of lucker if you had some

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.280 
you're on top of lucker if you had some
verticality<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.210> people<00:04:45.510> if<00:04:45.630> you're<00:04:46.050> higher

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
verticality and people if you're higher

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.750 
verticality and people if you're higher
up<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.500> definite<00:04:46.890> had<00:04:46.980> an<00:04:47.070> advantage<00:04:47.340> we're

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
up you definite had an advantage we're

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.670 
up you definite had an advantage we're
in<00:04:47.820> this<00:04:47.940> game<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.600> can't<00:04:48.930> redo<00:04:49.260> that<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.530> kind

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
in this game you can't redo that it kind

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.810 
in this game you can't redo that it kind
of<00:04:49.710> goes<00:04:49.860> along<00:04:50.010> with<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.220> whole<00:04:50.340> camping

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
of goes along with the whole camping

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.670 
of goes along with the whole camping
kind<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.150> scheme<00:04:51.450> as<00:04:51.600> well<00:04:51.780> because<00:04:52.140> you<00:04:52.470> can't

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
kind of scheme as well because you can't

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.350 
kind of scheme as well because you can't
really<00:04:52.800> camp<00:04:53.100> as<00:04:53.250> much<00:04:53.490> in<00:04:53.700> advance<00:04:53.790> of<00:04:54.060> all<00:04:54.180> if

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
really camp as much in advance of all if

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.670 
really camp as much in advance of all if
you<00:04:54.510> do<00:04:54.630> someone's<00:04:55.050> really<00:04:55.230> going<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.530> boost

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
you do someone's really going to boost

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.380 
you do someone's really going to boost
around<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.400> where<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.670> are<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.000> someone's

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
around to where you are and someone's

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.490 
around to where you are and someone's
really<00:04:57.570> going<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.810> outcome<00:04:58.140> from<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.380> new

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
really going to outcome from the new

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.770 
really going to outcome from the new
view<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:58.920> can<00:04:59.010> doesn<00:04:59.580> t<00:04:59.700> work<00:04:59.880> out<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.330> the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
view so you can doesn t work out and the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.630 
view so you can doesn t work out and the
same<00:05:01.200> goes<00:05:01.230> for<00:05:01.620> come<00:05:01.740> out<00:05:01.830> camping<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.400> very

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
same goes for come out camping in very

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.280 
same goes for come out camping in very
high<00:05:02.850> spots<00:05:03.210> like<00:05:03.390> you'll<00:05:03.570> see<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:04.110> may<00:05:04.230> be

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
high spots like you'll see you may be

weapon to myself as quite a surprise we
didn't<00:05:48.060> get<00:05:48.210> one<00:05:48.390> I<00:05:48.540> thought<00:05:48.870> was<00:05:49.020> kind<00:05:49.110> of<00:05:49.200> an

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
didn't get one I thought was kind of an

didn't get one I thought was kind of an
expected<00:05:49.740> thing<00:05:49.920> that<00:05:50.070> we'd<00:05:50.190> get<00:05:50.340> a<00:05:50.370> new

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
expected thing that we'd get a new

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.370

weapon<00:05:50.850> every<00:05:51.120> single<00:05:51.390> time<00:05:51.570> but<00:05:51.990> i<00:05:52.020> guess<00:05:52.230> the

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
weapon every single time but i guess the

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.020 
weapon every single time but i guess the
m<00:05:52.500> on<00:05:52.650> irons<00:05:53.010> was<00:05:53.250> there<00:05:53.550> kind<00:05:53.730> of<00:05:53.760> like<00:05:53.910> the

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
m on irons was there kind of like the

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.970 
m on irons was there kind of like the
best<00:05:54.210> thing<00:05:54.450> they<00:05:54.780> could<00:05:54.840> do<00:05:55.080> about<00:05:55.230> free<00:05:55.620> DLC

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
best thing they could do about free DLC

best thing they could do about free DLC
weapon<00:05:56.100> which<00:05:56.400> was<00:05:56.580> pretty<00:05:56.760> cool<00:05:56.880> the

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360

Alliance<00:05:57.600> is<00:05:57.810> definitely<00:05:58.170> a<00:05:58.200> good<00:05:58.380> weapon<00:05:58.530> but

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
Alliance is definitely a good weapon but

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.680 
Alliance is definitely a good weapon but
hopefully<00:05:59.220> dlc<00:05:59.610> for<00:05:59.820> will<00:06:00.090> expect<00:06:00.420> another

hopefully dlc for will expect another

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.110 
hopefully dlc for will expect another
