going to need to get the straps on you a

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.360 
going to need to get the straps on you a
lot<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.300> people<00:02:19.420> will<00:02:19.570> squat<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.920> straps

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
lot of people will squat with straps

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.100 
lot of people will squat with straps
down<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.910> their<00:02:22.030> suits<00:02:22.239> powerlifters<00:02:22.959> will

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.920 
down on their suits powerlifters will
sometimes<00:02:23.530> do<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:25.570> little<00:02:25.810> bit

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
sometimes do that it's a little bit

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.070 
sometimes do that it's a little bit
easier<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.500> maintain<00:02:26.680> proper<00:02:27.430> form<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.900> the

straps down because the tension on your

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.699 
straps down because the tension on your

you're very strong and flexible I'm not
strong<00:02:49.060> or<00:02:49.299> flexible<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:49.959> I'm<00:02:50.470> going<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.739> click

this<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> j-hook<00:02:52.930> I'm<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.860> try<00:02:54.010> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
this on a j-hook I'm going to try and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.940 
this on a j-hook I'm going to try and
split<00:02:54.430> my<00:02:54.670> arm

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
split my arm

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.980 
split my arm

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.440 

like<00:03:04.990> so

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
like so

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.300 
like so
I<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> be<00:03:07.349> careful<00:03:07.770> these<00:03:07.860> suits<00:03:08.099> aren't

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
I have to be careful these suits aren't

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130 
I have to be careful these suits aren't
cheap<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.510> don't<00:03:09.660> want<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.840> rip<00:03:10.020> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
cheap and you don't want to rip the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.070 
cheap and you don't want to rip the
material<00:03:10.560> either<00:03:10.709> so<00:03:11.480> we<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.840> kind<00:03:12.959> of

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
material either so we have to be kind of

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.580 
material either so we have to be kind of
careful<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:15.720> do<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.900> same<00:03:16.110> thing<00:03:16.349> on<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
careful to do the same thing on the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:30.920 
careful to do the same thing on the
other<00:03:16.620> side

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.640 

there<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.620> go<00:03:31.709> now<00:03:32.189> if<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.730> had<00:03:33.170> some<00:03:34.170> help<00:03:34.379> here

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
there you go now if I had some help here

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.580 
there you go now if I had some help here
I<00:03:35.000> would<00:03:36.000> probably<00:03:36.120> work<00:03:36.450> at<00:03:37.200> getting<00:03:37.349> these

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
I would probably work at getting these

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.490 
I would probably work at getting these
straps<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.069> little<00:03:38.280> bit<00:03:38.400> more<00:03:38.519> comfortably

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
straps a little bit more comfortably

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.280 
straps a little bit more comfortably
fitted<00:03:40.500> on<00:03:40.620> my<00:03:40.799> shoulders<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:42.260> having<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
fitted on my shoulders but having the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.209 
fitted on my shoulders but having the
straps<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.519> does<00:03:44.730> out<00:03:44.939> a<00:03:44.969> lot<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:46.219> the

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:47.219 
straps on really does out a lot to the

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.110 
straps on really does out a lot to the

going to give you and when I say

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.220 
going to give you and when I say
transverse<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.739> mean<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:54.090> support<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.900> giving

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
transverse I mean the support is giving

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.789 
transverse I mean the support is giving
you<00:03:56.090> across<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.420> plain<00:03:57.780> throughout<00:03:58.620> your

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
on one thing that you're going to notice

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.339 
on one thing that you're going to notice
is<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:05.879> there's<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.269> lot<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.569> pressure<00:04:07.019> here

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
is that there's a lot of pressure here

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.860 
is that there's a lot of pressure here
in<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.500> stomach<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.129> in<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.879> hips<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.450> in

third button now when I take this suit
off<00:04:15.510> you're<00:04:16.440> going<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.650> see<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:17.160> lot<00:04:17.579> of

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
off you're going to see a lot of

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.120 
off you're going to see a lot of
markings<00:04:18.329> probably<00:04:18.900> made<00:04:19.410> by<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.650> suit<00:04:20.009> the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
markings probably made by the suit the

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.920 
markings probably made by the suit the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
up where the seams are and that's just

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.749 
up where the seams are and that's just
evidence<00:04:25.800> that<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.250> suit<00:04:26.460> is<00:04:26.580> actually

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
evidence that the suit is actually

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.510 
evidence that the suit is actually
provided<00:04:27.419> you're<00:04:27.509> some<00:04:27.690> kind<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:27.960> support<00:04:28.520> as

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
provided you're some kind of support as

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.850 
provided you're some kind of support as
you<00:04:29.729> go<00:04:29.880> down<00:04:30.030> with<00:04:30.330> your<00:04:30.419> squat<00:04:30.780> you're<00:04:31.740> going

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
you go down with your squat you're going

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.460 
you go down with your squat you're going
to<00:04:31.919> feel<00:04:32.099> a<00:04:32.160> lot<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.460> tension<00:04:33.120> in<00:04:33.990> through<00:04:34.349> this

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
to feel a lot of tension in through this

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.000 
to feel a lot of tension in through this
abdominal<00:04:35.099> hip<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:36.000> glue<00:04:36.570> region<00:04:37.169> now

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
abdominal hip and glue region now

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.279 
abdominal hip and glue region now
without<00:04:38.430> any<00:04:38.639> weight<00:04:38.940> this<00:04:39.300> is<00:04:39.720> about<00:04:39.930> as<00:04:40.080> low

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
without any weight this is about as low

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.120 
without any weight this is about as low
as<00:04:40.470> i<00:04:40.620> could<00:04:40.680> probably<00:04:41.039> go<00:04:42.560> without<00:04:43.560> breaking

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
as i could probably go without breaking
