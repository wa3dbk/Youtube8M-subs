the workshop and help sometimes that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.190 
the workshop and help sometimes that
annoyed<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.439> adults<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:30.329> saw<00:01:30.570> how<00:01:30.869> things

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
annoyed the adults but we saw how things
