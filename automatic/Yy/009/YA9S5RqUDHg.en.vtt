that's the important part about this

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.080 
that's the important part about this
that<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.040> go<00:00:38.129> out<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.280> play<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.879> game

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that you can go out and play this game

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150 
but I think it was too late for him
because<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.600> three<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.440> five<00:00:46.739> who
