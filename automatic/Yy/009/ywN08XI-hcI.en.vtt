meeting is where annually decisions are
made<00:00:16.970> about<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.390> way<00:00:17.509> in<00:00:17.660> which<00:00:17.689> tuna

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
made about the way in which tuna

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.779 
made about the way in which tuna
fisheries<00:00:18.679> have<00:00:18.890> run<00:00:19.039> and<00:00:19.220> managed<00:00:19.550> in<00:00:19.699> this

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
fisheries have run and managed in this

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.730 
fisheries have run and managed in this
region<00:00:20.240> so<00:00:20.689> what<00:00:20.779> we're<00:00:20.900> hoping<00:00:20.929> that<00:00:21.410> we<00:00:21.560> can

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
region so what we're hoping that we can

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.769 
region so what we're hoping that we can
do<00:00:21.949> is<00:00:22.160> feed<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.820> evidence<00:00:23.240> that<00:00:23.449> we<00:00:23.539> gather

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
do is feed the evidence that we gather

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.380 
do is feed the evidence that we gather
on<00:00:24.019> this<00:00:24.230> trip<00:00:24.500> into<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:24.859> IOT<00:00:25.339> sea<00:00:25.580> in<00:00:25.880> the

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
on this trip into the IOT sea in the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.150 
on this trip into the IOT sea in the
hope<00:00:26.539> that<00:00:26.570> more<00:00:27.109> effective<00:00:27.560> decisions<00:00:28.039> are

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
hope that more effective decisions are

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.710 
hope that more effective decisions are
made<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.880> support<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.330> long-term

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
made to support the long-term

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.359 
made to support the long-term
sustainability<00:00:29.929> of<00:00:30.529> tuna<00:00:30.829> fisheries<00:00:31.160> in<00:00:31.279> the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
sustainability of tuna fisheries in the

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.480 
sustainability of tuna fisheries in the
region<00:00:32.470> and<00:00:33.470> we're<00:00:33.650> not<00:00:33.710> anti<00:00:34.100> fishing

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.950 
region and we're not anti fishing
actually<00:00:34.820> what<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.030> want<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.300> see<00:00:35.450> is<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.600> tuna

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
actually what we want to see is a tuna

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.480 
actually what we want to see is a tuna
fishing<00:00:36.230> industry<00:00:36.710> that<00:00:36.860> is<00:00:36.980> sustainable

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
fishing industry that is sustainable

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.060 
fishing industry that is sustainable
into<00:00:37.880> the<00:00:37.910> into<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.750> long<00:00:38.930> term<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.740> unless

into the into the long term and unless
we<00:00:40.250> make<00:00:40.400> some<00:00:40.610> changes<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.270> way<00:00:41.330> the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
we make some changes to the way the

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.970 
we make some changes to the way the
fishing<00:00:41.810> is<00:00:41.930> currently<00:00:42.500> happening<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:42.890> the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.940 

we<00:00:55.000> started<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.480> day<00:00:55.630> really<00:00:55.900> well<00:00:56.170> we've<00:00:56.680> got

a heli flight up in the morning

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.270 
a heli flight up in the morning
pretty<00:00:58.600> soon<00:00:58.840> spotted<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.560> cluster<00:01:00.010> of<00:01:00.070> Sri

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
pretty soon spotted a cluster of Sri

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.070 
pretty soon spotted a cluster of Sri

Vinson Decker yeah there are very many
kind<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> distant<00:01:20.220> water<00:01:20.430> fishing<00:01:20.940> nations

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
kind of distant water fishing nations

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.510 
kind of distant water fishing nations
that<00:01:22.110> are<00:01:22.140> fishing<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.800> Indian<00:01:23.130> Ocean<00:01:23.220> and

that are fishing in the Indian Ocean and
they're<00:01:23.670> taking<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> tuner<00:01:24.479> Azores<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
they're taking the tuner Azores and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.350 
they're taking the tuner Azores and
other<00:01:25.110> fish<00:01:25.410> species<00:01:25.979> out<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.909> region

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
other fish species out of this region

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.750 
other fish species out of this region
into<00:01:27.510> wealthier<00:01:27.960> distant<00:01:28.350> markets

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
into wealthier distant markets

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.460 
into wealthier distant markets
increasingly<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.970> coastal<00:01:30.390> states<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.290> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
increasingly the coastal states in and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.719 
increasingly the coastal states in and
around<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.830> Indian<00:01:32.070> Ocean<00:01:32.220> will<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
around the Indian Ocean will have to

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.310 
around the Indian Ocean will have to
take<00:01:32.910> ownership<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.509> fact<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.110> moment

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
take ownership the fact is at the moment

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.590 
take ownership the fact is at the moment
they<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.250> realizing<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.060> value<00:01:36.210> from

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
they are not realizing the value from

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
they are not realizing the value from
their<00:01:36.810> own<00:01:36.930> tuna<00:01:37.410> resource<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.280> live

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
their own tuna resource you know we live

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.490 
their own tuna resource you know we live
on<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:41.580> planet<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.479> predominantly<00:01:43.200> blue

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
on a planet which is predominantly blue

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.340 
on a planet which is predominantly blue
and<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.880> slowly<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.539> surely<00:01:45.570> being<00:01:46.110> emptied

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and it slowly but surely being emptied

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.980 
and it slowly but surely being emptied
for<00:01:47.039> commercial<00:01:47.580> interest<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.869> know

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
for commercial interest and you know

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
for commercial interest and you know
unlike<00:01:49.259> forest<00:01:49.680> destruction<00:01:50.119> where<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> can

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
unlike forest destruction where you can

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.180 
unlike forest destruction where you can
see<00:01:51.660> that<00:01:51.869> destruction<00:01:52.440> happening<00:01:52.800> so<00:01:53.130> much

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
see that destruction happening so much

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.800 
see that destruction happening so much
of<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.610> destruction<00:01:53.940> happens<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> oceans

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
of the destruction happens in the oceans

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.800 
of the destruction happens in the oceans
it<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.200> hidden<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.500> can't<00:01:55.860> see<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.660> it<00:01:57.660> will

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
it is hidden you can't see it it will
