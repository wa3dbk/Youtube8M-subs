00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.870
 explain how to make a cake 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.930
 dried 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.720
 for that we need semolina 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.119
 precise wheat we need a little bit 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.940
 of olive oil a little bit of salt a 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.130
 little bit of water black seed and 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.470
 his men but it is not required that 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.430
 have them for that I need a roll 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.439
 a fork and a dish of earth and 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.230

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.570
 can be done in a small pan 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.140
 tefal but it will not be the same 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.000
