00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I was kind of confused when I was

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
I was kind of confused when I was
looking<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.420> there<00:01:18.420> were<00:01:18.479> other<00:01:18.720> things

that said like wet brush but it wasn't

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
that said like wet brush but it wasn't
like<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> brand<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
like the brand so I think I got the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.870 
like the brand so I think I got the
correct<00:01:24.869> brand<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.920> says<00:01:26.159> wet<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.850> a

correct brand just says wet with like a
little<00:01:27.060> swoop<00:01:27.420> D<00:01:27.630> thing<00:01:27.840> around<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.909> there

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
little swoop D thing around it there

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
little swoop D thing around it there
were<00:01:30.030> different<00:01:30.360> colors<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.990> different

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
were different colors and different

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.940 
were different colors and different
kinds<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.930> wet<00:01:34.110> brush<00:01:34.350> Pro

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
kinds this one is the wet brush Pro

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.300 
kinds this one is the wet brush Pro
there<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.500> little<00:01:38.040> ball

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
there was one with like little ball

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
there was one with like little ball
things<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> end<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.600> were<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.930> with

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
things at the end there were one with

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.530 
things at the end there were one with
shorter<00:01:40.619> bristles<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.369> bigger<00:01:41.909> bowl<00:01:42.180> things

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
shorter bristles and bigger bowl things

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.210 
shorter bristles and bigger bowl things
but<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> feel<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.560> already<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.130> many

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
but I feel like I already have so many

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
but I feel like I already have so many
brushes<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.479> has<00:01:45.659> really

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
brushes like that this one has really

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.200 
brushes like that this one has really
thin<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.950> long<00:01:47.189> bristles<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:48.000> like

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
thin really long bristles with like

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.450 
thin really long bristles with like
little<00:01:48.810> tiny<00:01:49.110> plastic<00:01:49.439> ball<00:01:49.860> things<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.310> top

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
little tiny plastic ball things on top

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.910 
little tiny plastic ball things on top
so<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> does<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:54.860> instead<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
so I think what this does is instead of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.609 
so I think what this does is instead of
combing<00:01:56.759> through<00:01:57.149> knots<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.320> kind<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
combing through knots it just kind of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.940 
combing through knots it just kind of
like<00:01:59.360> brushes<00:02:00.360> them<00:02:00.570> aside<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.710> gets

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
like brushes them aside and then gets

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.789 
like brushes them aside and then gets
them<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> second<00:02:02.790> or<00:02:02.880> third<00:02:02.909> pass<00:02:03.360> around

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
them on the second or third pass around

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.870 
them on the second or third pass around
where<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.950> opposed<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.630> thicker

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
where as opposed to thicker

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.240 
where as opposed to thicker
Bristol's<00:02:08.780> probably<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.890> anchor

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
Bristol's probably like anchor

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.340 
Bristol's probably like anchor
themselves<00:02:10.789> in<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.060> knot<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:12.200> you

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
themselves in the knot and then you

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.050 
themselves in the knot and then you
can't<00:02:12.560> pull<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.770> through<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.490> think<00:02:13.700> that's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
can't pull it through so I think that's

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.870 
can't pull it through so I think that's
what<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.780> will<00:02:15.020> do<00:02:15.170> one<00:02:16.010> thing<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.370> was<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.550> little

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
what it will do one thing I was a little

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.790 
what it will do one thing I was a little
put<00:02:17.120> off<00:02:17.209> by<00:02:17.270> risking<00:02:17.959> price<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.739> was<00:02:20.410> 1199<00:02:21.410> I

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
put off by risking price it was 1199 I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.280 
put off by risking price it was 1199 I
don't<00:02:22.459> typically<00:02:23.270> buy<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.569> lot<00:02:23.840> hairbrushes

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
don't typically buy a lot hairbrushes

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.440 
don't typically buy a lot hairbrushes
but<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.709> feel<00:02:24.950> like<00:02:25.040> that's<00:02:25.310> pretty<00:02:26.120> expensive

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
but I feel like that's pretty expensive

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.979 
but I feel like that's pretty expensive
for<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:27.050> hairbrush<00:02:27.410> um<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.239> hope<00:02:29.600> it's<00:02:29.810> worth

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
for a hairbrush um so I hope it's worth

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.030 
for a hairbrush um so I hope it's worth
it<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.470> like<00:02:30.920> science<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.910> gonna<00:02:32.090> do<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> fair

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
it I like science so I'm gonna do a fair

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.080 
it I like science so I'm gonna do a fair
test<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.660> I'm<00:02:35.660> going<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.840> brush<00:02:36.020> my<00:02:36.260> hair

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
test of this I'm going to brush my hair

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.370 
test of this I'm going to brush my hair
part<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.239> literally<00:02:38.750> right<00:02:39.050> down<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.350> middle

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
part it literally right down the middle

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.460 
part it literally right down the middle
and<00:02:40.569> we're<00:02:41.569> going<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:41.959> control<00:02:42.440> group

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
and we're going to have a control group

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.080 
and we're going to have a control group
and<00:02:42.890> we're<00:02:43.340> going<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.519> have<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.670> wet<00:02:43.880> brush

does<00:03:10.790> turn<00:03:10.819> out<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.330> be<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:12.170> best<00:03:12.290> thing<00:03:12.530> ever

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
does turn out to be the best thing ever

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.990 
does turn out to be the best thing ever
I'm<00:03:12.980> still<00:03:13.220> going<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.459> use<00:03:13.579> leaving

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
I'm still going to use leaving

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.940 
I'm still going to use leaving
conditioner<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.420> because<00:03:14.870> it's<00:03:15.590> awesome

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
conditioner just because it's awesome

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.569 
conditioner just because it's awesome
for<00:03:16.130> your<00:03:16.190> hair<00:03:17.320> now<00:03:18.320> I<00:03:18.380> will<00:03:18.799> do<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.010> time-lapse

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
for your hair now I will do a time-lapse

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.110 
for your hair now I will do a time-lapse
of<00:03:20.150> each<00:03:20.450> side<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.140> see<00:03:21.560> which<00:03:21.769> one<00:03:22.280> takes<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
of each side and see which one takes the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.259 
of each side and see which one takes the
longest<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.690> do<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:25.250> afterward<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:26.000> will

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
longest to do and then afterward I will

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.539 
longest to do and then afterward I will
provide<00:03:26.570> some<00:03:26.870> commentary<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:27.590> what<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.280> think

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
provide some commentary on what I think

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:45.300 
provide some commentary on what I think
this<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.209> let's<00:03:30.200> start

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.390 

okay<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.209> say<00:03:46.600> this<00:03:46.840> side<00:03:47.050> is<00:03:47.400> successfully

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
okay I say this side is successfully

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.120 
okay I say this side is successfully
unknotted<00:03:49.240> so<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.380> let's<00:03:50.650> try<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.950> other

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
unknotted so now let's try the other

00:03:51.130 --> 00:04:05.660 
unknotted so now let's try the other
side

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.400 

so<00:04:06.670> my<00:04:06.819> theory<00:04:07.180> was<00:04:07.390> correct<00:04:07.660> the<00:04:08.260> long

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
so my theory was correct the long

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.380 
so my theory was correct the long
bristles<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:09.130> kind<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.459> like<00:04:09.640> sweep<00:04:10.060> across

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
bristles just kind of like sweep across

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.320 
bristles just kind of like sweep across
the<00:04:10.510> hair<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.530> when<00:04:12.489> they<00:04:12.610> come<00:04:12.790> across<00:04:12.910> and

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
the hair and when they come across and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.050 
the hair and when they come across and
not<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.780> they<00:04:13.959> can't<00:04:14.200> anot<00:04:14.590> they<00:04:15.010> just<00:04:15.220> kind

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
not that they can't anot they just kind

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.150 
not that they can't anot they just kind
of<00:04:16.090> go<00:04:16.209> like<00:04:16.239> this<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.109> as<00:04:17.290> opposed<00:04:17.980> to

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
of go like this to it as opposed to

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.460 
of go like this to it as opposed to
getting<00:04:18.400> anchored<00:04:18.940> in<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.480> tugging<00:04:20.290> on<00:04:20.440> your

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
getting anchored in and tugging on your

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.190 
getting anchored in and tugging on your
hair<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.040> breaking<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.910> so<00:04:22.169> I'm<00:04:23.169> pretty

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
hair and breaking it so I'm pretty

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.130 
hair and breaking it so I'm pretty
impressed<00:04:23.590> by<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.120> it's<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.300> simple<00:04:25.690> concept

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
impressed by this it's a simple concept

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.060 
impressed by this it's a simple concept
but<00:04:26.650> it<00:04:26.830> seems<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.550> work<00:04:27.730> and<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:29.320> think<00:04:29.680> it's<00:04:29.830> as

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
but it seems to work and I think it's as

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.730 
but it seems to work and I think it's as
effective<00:04:30.820> if<00:04:31.030> not<00:04:31.060> more<00:04:31.300> effective<00:04:31.740> than

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
effective if not more effective than

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.250 
effective if not more effective than
using<00:04:32.980> a<00:04:33.220> comb<00:04:33.460> which<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.210> thinner<00:04:34.600> so<00:04:35.110> it

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
using a comb which is thinner so it

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.500 
using a comb which is thinner so it
takes<00:04:35.590> longer<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.250> go<00:04:36.400> through<00:04:36.510> individual

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
takes longer to go through individual

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.590 
takes longer to go through individual
parts<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.020> hair<00:04:38.229> so<00:04:39.240> I'm<00:04:40.240> pretty

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
parts of the hair so I'm pretty

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.630 
parts of the hair so I'm pretty
impressed<00:04:40.810> by<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.229> I'd<00:04:41.860> say<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.370> worth<00:04:42.580> the

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
impressed by it I'd say it's worth the

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.950 
impressed by it I'd say it's worth the
price<00:04:44.340> alright<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.610> here's<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.940> knot<00:04:46.210> so<00:04:46.479> I'm

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
price alright so here's a knot so I'm
