00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.450
 Hello, we are going to prepare burritos 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.270
 northern style for that we are going to occupy 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.700
 put a pan of preference of 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.700
 Teflon and we are going to add oil 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.849
 in turn it is enough to escape to laugh 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.220
 and we're going to put ground beef on 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.220
 this case put 500 grams 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.049
 we arrange it well in the pan so that 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:12.049
 is cut by even and more management 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.430
 and we will be late 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.230
 occasionally they should also uncover what 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.740
 to check how the cooking is going and 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.740
 move it 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.590
 and return 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.250
 as they see the meat is going to drop juice 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.049
 can get to be balls if you pass 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.439
 this so that they thing well they have to 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.819
 with a shovel or what they have 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.820
 press it to be separated in 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.740
 the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.729
 Ground beef just as it is 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.729
 they give the capita 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.910
 when the game that you released is being 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.650
 drying uncovers and moves 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.350
 constantly to avoid sticking 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.420
 or burn because the meat is golden 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.730
 Mexican tin sauce or 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.380
 Natural Mexican force jitomate 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.380
 green chile onion and cilantro 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.400
 and here how we put Mexican salsa 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.940
 tota look let's add add 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.940
 modified 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.219
 or not 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.200
 5 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.129
 and the fresh lot 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 it can also be betrayed stage and it 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.610
 it gives you a few minutes since it's a bit 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.580
 drier we lower the fire and we go to 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.680
 add slices of cheddar cheese 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.780
 which you want or if we like 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.780
 they do not put that final taste 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.989
 since they were added they are going to stir 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.989
 along with all the food 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.230
 if they like to facilitate they can cover the pot 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:40.069
 for a few moments to make it more 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.069
 easy to return it 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.220
 as it comes we are talking then more 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.380
 easy to stir it you just have to 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.020
 wait for it to melt completely and 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.910
 it's ready 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.000
 since the food is ready we are going to 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.400
 prepare a dressing of sour cream and 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.830
 mustard to add the tortilla before 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.840
 of the food then you know of cream and 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.220
 a demonstration you can adjust each 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.080
 who because much turning likes the 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.080
 mustard then you can stay here
