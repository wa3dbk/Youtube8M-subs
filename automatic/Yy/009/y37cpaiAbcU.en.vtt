00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 gentlemen exactly today in this bright 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.990
 May 9 holiday is a day of victory when 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.240
 our grandfathers and great-grandfathers really 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.830
 defended our right to life I wanted 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.630
 definitely congratulate you on this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 wonderful holiday wish you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.680
 best weekend and talk 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.230
 a little related to this holiday 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.779
 topic topic is called patriotism 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.699
 unconditionally now in May days we 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.260
 you are seeing a deliberately external 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.939
 manifestation of patriotism which 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.550
 reflected in colorful pictures 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.529
 TV and everyone is definitely filming 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.079
 Any relevant thematic 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.390
 videos each tries to somehow prove something 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.430
 that he is a patriot 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.950
 however, let's think about it all the same 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.930
 patriotism is much more internally 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.620
 the phenomenon of each person than him 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.780
 externally that is when i see hummer on 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.760
 all the back glass is written 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.980
 huge letters thank you grandfather for winning 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 and at this very moment this hummer 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.180
 down the main street with a plus 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 cities trying not to miss those deliberately 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.199
 veterans crossing the street 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.719
 pedestrian crossing I certainly understand 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.820
 that by and large this clowning is also 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.890
 like huge banners stuck in the roof 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.680
 car which are often in size 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.900
 exceed the size of the car itself when 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.090
 same person immediately deliberately throws 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.009
 butt glass showing full 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 neglect of oneâ€™s own homeland 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.689
 because it is in his own head 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.210
 should and sendei then the realization that this is his 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.759
 the earth and he is on it and he must 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.880
 protect her in every way even if he is 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.500
 desperate cattle on an alcoholic making 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.659
 it please in the places where it is 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.880
 no one sees you and no one will judge but 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.829
 if you are in society all the more 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.960
 on such days the more he decorated his 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.180
 vehicle possible clothing 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.340
 St. George ribbon so work 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.530
 please observe at least the minimum 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.820
 rules of decency at least created and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.369
 the appearance of what you really 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.590
 patriot because a patriot is the man 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.810
 who will not wash the car on the shore 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.299
 lakes is the man who will put out for 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.100
 a bonfire and that will take away 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.020
 banks and this is the person who 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 really body and soul 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.570
 radeet for their homeland and in their very 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 simple human manifestations wants 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.890
 do so in the place where he is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.840
 lives began to live a little better 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.530
 man will not go by the wayside 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.810
 cork 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.580
 he will not be with the numbers a and quack 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.080
 break through the same traffic jam 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.940
 neglects their own 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.610
 compatriot and because such 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.569
 man is not a patriot it is just 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.940
 fucking clown 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.340
 just a sincere patriot of course not 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.080
 will take bribes and of course will not 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.150
 give them because it's all very 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.250
 negatively affects the state of everything 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.459
 society and naturally that side where 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.770
 he lives so let's not only May 9 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.959
 but every ordinary day to think about 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.540
 the fact that we still have to be in the shower 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.250
 patriots of their country they are only 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.100
 show some external signs 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.530
 this patriotism certainly they need 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.690
 surely these external signs of it and 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.510
 there is something that tells our children that we 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.760
 respect is certainly the same 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.739
 and using these symbols of victory and 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.350
 tells everyone else that we are still 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.660
 kept in the shower this memory of those people about 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.910
 grandfathers and great-grandfathers who are really 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.250
 laid down their lives for our homeland and 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.459
 surely they wanted our homeland 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.890
 looked a little better than now 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.269
 I'm not saying that everything is so bad but I believe 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.549
 what are we really now 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.739
 rejected those remnants of the 90s when we 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.750
 unconditionally were the finished cattle and 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.980
 already climbed that step when 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.260
 really we can now 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.730
 take care not only of yourself but this 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.280
 the country in which we live 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.709
 and all together better relate to each other 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.230
 and make our own country better 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.470
 so I have one huge for you 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.260
 please stay good people if 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.510
 you go on vacation take the trash 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.910
 if you get stuck in traffic do not drive on 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.459
 side by side respect those who are nearby 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.739
 with you and then you really will become 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.840
 a patriot in the very meaning of it 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.760
 word which is true 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.500
 they are just a clown with St. George 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.959
 ribbon on the rearview mirror 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.880
 which at the first situation will give 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.850
 one and all for the sake of his momentary 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.010
 I want this profit again 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.140
 congratulate you on the holiday and let's 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.630
 finally get on those rails when 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.690
 patriot really is a patriot 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.850
 that's when our grandfathers and great-grandfathers 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.489
 really fought not in vain to all 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.590
 thank you so much good luck everyone again with 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.090
 this holiday and indeed we 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.090
 won bye
