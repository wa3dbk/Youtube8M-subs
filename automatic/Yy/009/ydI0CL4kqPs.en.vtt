doing<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.510> we<00:00:45.510> rebuild<00:00:46.019> all<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> parts<00:00:46.860> from

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
doing here we rebuild all the parts from

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.689 
doing here we rebuild all the parts from
the<00:00:47.400> engine<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:47.940> basically<00:00:48.629> suspension

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
the engine back basically suspension

steering brakes and any other bits and
pieces<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.820> between<00:00:54.150> so<00:00:54.960> every<00:00:55.170> component<00:00:55.470> has

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
pieces in between so every component has

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.649 
pieces in between so every component has
a<00:00:55.769> different<00:00:56.100> life<00:00:56.250> span<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:57.089> these<00:00:57.269> parts

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
a different life span with these parts

calipers<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.560> usually<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> bit<00:01:26.009> shorter

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
calipers are usually a bit shorter

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
calipers are usually a bit shorter
they're<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.969> bit<00:01:27.149> more<00:01:27.359> sort<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
they're a bit more sort of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
they're a bit more sort of
life-threatening<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.189> most<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.670> these<00:01:29.850> if

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
life-threatening or most of these if

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.440 
life-threatening or most of these if
they<00:01:30.329> don't<00:01:30.509> work<00:01:30.659> properly<00:01:30.719> so<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.560> try<00:01:32.310> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
they don't work properly so we try and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.630 
they don't work properly so we try and
service<00:01:33.450> them<00:01:33.659> quite<00:01:34.289> really<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.249> year<00:01:35.520> it's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
service them quite really this year it's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.160 
service them quite really this year it's
going<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.939> hard<00:01:36.179> to<00:01:36.299> try<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.630> figure<00:01:37.020> out

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
going to be hard to try and figure out

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.679 
going to be hard to try and figure out
bits<00:01:37.770> needs<00:01:38.280> service<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> at<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.359> but

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
bits needs service and at what time but

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.330 
bits needs service and at what time but
we<00:01:40.109> sort<00:01:40.289> of<00:01:40.409> trying<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.799> around<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.189> now

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
we sort of trying to get around it now

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.899 
we sort of trying to get around it now
so<00:01:41.759> we've<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> good<00:01:42.990> basic<00:01:43.469> idea<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.820> you

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
so we've got a good basic idea have you

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.459 
so we've got a good basic idea have you
ever<00:01:45.090> pulled<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> component<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:45.929> the<00:01:46.079> car<00:01:46.289> and

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
ever pulled a component off the car and

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.279 
ever pulled a component off the car and
torchy's<00:01:46.859> that's<00:01:47.130> pretty<00:01:47.880> close<00:01:48.179> to<00:01:48.539> to

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
torchy's that's pretty close to to

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.499 
torchy's that's pretty close to to
exploiting<00:01:49.829> well<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.850> really<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
exploiting well you don't really want to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.410 
exploiting well you don't really want to
get<00:01:51.689> them<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.109> far<00:01:52.429> we<00:01:53.429> try<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:54.149> try

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
get them to that far we try and we try

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.620 
get them to that far we try and we try
and<00:01:55.340> service<00:01:56.340> them<00:01:56.520> reasonably<00:01:57.090> early<00:01:57.149> we've

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
and service them reasonably early we've

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.330 
and service them reasonably early we've
got<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.140> understanding<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:59.069> what<00:01:59.189> the

got a good understanding of what the
parts<00:01:59.670> do<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.749> we<00:02:01.229> try<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> far

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
parts do so we try and not get that far

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.349 
parts do so we try and not get that far
because<00:02:03.539> it's<00:02:03.869> obviously<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.319> life<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
because it's obviously a life can be a

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.450 
because it's obviously a life can be a
life-changing<00:02:06.990> operation<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> driver

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
life-changing operation if the driver

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.190 
life-changing operation if the driver
has<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> crash<00:02:09.030> because<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.509> component<00:02:09.840> break

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
has a crash because of a component break

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.550 
has a crash because of a component break
and<00:02:10.619> also<00:02:11.250> too<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.850> try<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:13.260> know<00:02:13.350> make

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and also too we try and you know make

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.869 
and also too we try and you know make
sure<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:14.099> parts<00:02:14.430> are<00:02:14.549> quite<00:02:14.730> serviceable

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
sure the parts are quite serviceable

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.699 
sure the parts are quite serviceable
we've<00:02:16.879> got<00:02:17.090> sort<00:02:17.390> of<00:02:17.420> long<00:02:17.629> long<00:02:18.079> races<00:02:18.319> come

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
we've got sort of long long races come

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.459 
we've got sort of long long races come
up<00:02:18.859> we<00:02:19.310> need<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.519> make<00:02:20.000> sure<00:02:20.030> it's<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.140> piece<00:02:21.319> on

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
up we need to make sure it's a piece on

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.979 
up we need to make sure it's a piece on
the<00:02:21.530> car<00:02:21.799> are<00:02:21.920> quite<00:02:22.129> good<00:02:22.629> have<00:02:23.629> you<00:02:23.719> had<00:02:23.900> to

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
the car are quite good have you had to

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.630 
the car are quite good have you had to
start<00:02:24.230> again<00:02:24.379> with<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.920> nests<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.189> ultimus

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
start again with the nests and ultimus

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.009 
start again with the nests and ultimus
to<00:02:25.790> know<00:02:25.879> exactly<00:02:26.030> how<00:02:26.480> long<00:02:26.629> things<00:02:26.840> are

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
to know exactly how long things are

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.809 
to know exactly how long things are
going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> last<00:02:27.349> well<00:02:28.099> yeah<00:02:28.340> it's<00:02:28.489> been<00:02:28.609> quite

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
going to last well yeah it's been quite

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.539 
going to last well yeah it's been quite
difficult<00:02:29.030> actually<00:02:29.560> we've<00:02:30.560> got<00:02:30.769> basically

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
difficult actually we've got basically

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.000 
difficult actually we've got basically
there's<00:02:32.329> probably<00:02:32.780> about<00:02:32.959> three<00:02:33.590> minor

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
there's probably about three minor

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.399 
there's probably about three minor
components<00:02:34.849> sort<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.090> sort<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.359> stepped<00:02:36.260> over

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
components sort of sort of stepped over

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.559 
components sort of sort of stepped over
from<00:02:36.709> last<00:02:36.859> year<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.519> everything<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.150> year

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
from last year so everything this year

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.830 
from last year so everything this year
has<00:02:39.170> been<00:02:39.439> brand<00:02:39.769> new<00:02:40.329> it's<00:02:41.329> been<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.569> real

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
has been brand new it's been a real

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.800 
has been brand new it's been a real
steep<00:02:42.530> learning<00:02:42.829> curve<00:02:43.040> for<00:02:43.250> us<00:02:43.639> so<00:02:43.939> but<00:02:44.540> you

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
steep learning curve for us so but you

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.349 
steep learning curve for us so but you
know<00:02:44.959> we're<00:02:45.469> sort<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.680> with<00:02:46.010> its<00:02:46.359> two-thirds

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
know we're sort of with its two-thirds

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:48.970 
know we're sort of with its two-thirds
away<00:02:47.569> through<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> season<00:02:48.290> now<00:02:48.439> so<00:02:48.500> we've<00:02:48.829> got

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
away through the season now so we've got

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.849 
away through the season now so we've got
a<00:02:49.010> quite<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.849> good<00:02:50.090> basic<00:02:50.569> idea<00:02:51.379> of<00:02:51.409> what<00:02:51.739> we

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
a quite a good basic idea of what we

00:02:51.859 --> 00:03:00.460 
a quite a good basic idea of what we
need<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.400> do
