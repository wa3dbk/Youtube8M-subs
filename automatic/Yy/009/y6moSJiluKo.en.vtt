00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.820

 Well, it's everyone that's true 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.470

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.450
 a new clash of clan video 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.160
 today rather special video 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.750
 since I introduced myself a player finally 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.250
 rather a clan had players from 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.870
 pretty awesome teeth is 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.700
 completely what the fuck 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.200
 do not forget to break at a small lake in 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.590
 start of video it's still great 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.570
 pleasure 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.220
 I hope we will have the 400 inches blue 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.570
 it's really fun 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.460
 here is a big thank you to all those who 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.890
 click on this little blue button 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.629
 today so new enough video 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.720
 impressive you will see a clan 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.210
 paranormal say it like that so a 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.740
 clan go i'll show you this so they 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.750
 are called we will pack it up 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.030
 right now it's called the red line 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.550
 So here is a name until there enough 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.659
 traditional the red line voice and site 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:22.520
 so here's a clan a mission of nine 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:24.409
 so why did not he go by 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.290
 which I badly type is no wrinkle 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.900
 with the red line it will not do it if 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.970
 I am badly typing so the red line veil 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.280
 attacks which are so the red line they 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.220
 are nine so it's this clancy and its 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.090
 egg and they have 90 trophy so a 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.510
 many trophies 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.870
 pile hair at 90 ca anyway already 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.270
 ladle 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.020
 then they need to either we need 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.520
 65 thousand trophy roses for power 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.750
 get into that good clan now on 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.190
 know it's thanks to the jailbreak and 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.420
 it's that they manage to do acts 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.490
 like that but hey it's still 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.280
 impressive for the glory with that and 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.110
 So then the 5 internationally but 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.850
 look at the chelou figures already 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.380
 cadence is in this description 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.360
 clanche you nap at 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.070
 editing it's really impressive 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.270
 see signs like that so we 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.750
 do not understand where they come from 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.879
 simply 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.170
 and then we'll look a little bit at 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.220
 the players then the players all 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.800
 just will start by looking 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 their low profile already more globally 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190
 so already the players have all 20 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.430
 trophies are all level-5 had all the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.470
 world 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.819
 the nine people who are in clans have 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.200
 few of them are up the day before 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.790
 5 and then they all have the same name on 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.739
 same name as the clan also good we 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.240
 go see them their profile we can see 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.860
 so they simply have 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.040
 their gold reserves to improve at 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.020
 level 4 that day in all who has it 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.300
 won if gay 6 stars on the map 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.520
 goblins and then he has the soul and 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.520
 improve the city hall at this level 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.290
 at level 3 so he at this profile but 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.410
 we look at the second player he has the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.030
 same profile 4 6 3 is exactly the same 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.410
 look at the third player you go 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.660
 see it's pretty impressive 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.940
 they were going the same profile the same 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.680
 technical characteristics that both 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.360
 first players and that's it for everyone 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.990
 the players for the nine players of this 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.940
 clan 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.920
 it's just awesome now 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.470
 go see them a little villages six 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 players there then it's done the villages 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.580
 just where he has a shape 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.930
 a little weird here he is asked is fast 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.430
 does his troops one these buildings that 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.140
 had it early in the game while he asked 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.270
 suddenly and then here we are from south to 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.400
 decided to simply stop 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.640
 play I do not think that's it but hey 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.500
 we imagine so we suppose there he to his 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.260
 city hall that pays for level 3 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.190
 he has nothing max and hilary has risen apart 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.340
 its gold reserves and reserves exr il 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.080
 did not even mount these mini these huts 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.630
 happily neither his 15 years nothing and and 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.060
 hurried to mount his repair 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.830
 his castle clan at level 1 for 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.050
 able to join his clan enough 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.350
 paranormal a completely walter clan 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.230
 finck 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.940
 so this player there is how we go 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.350
 see the second player and I think that 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.400
 you doubt it of course 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.740
 you are not going you are you are not 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.300
 not to be of course that's what 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.310
 second player has exactly the same 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.500
 village that first try this for 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.150
 all the players we'll see them that's 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.080
 exactly the same, for example 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.120
 the fifth 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.830
 we will see his village he has the same 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.510
 village of course they do not have 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.140
 mingle them falls in the same place it's 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.310
 no gold hackers either but that's it 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.440
 they have the same village and that's when 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.060
 even pretty impressive on this 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.739
