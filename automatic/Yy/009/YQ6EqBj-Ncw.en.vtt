we just figured out what the favorite

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.150 
we just figured out what the favorite
color<00:00:01.800> of<00:00:01.890> all<00:00:02.340> life<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:03.389> universe<00:00:03.629> is

planets the answer based on its findings

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.500 
planets the answer based on its findings
is<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:39.000> 20%<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.770> five<00:00:41.430> stars<00:00:41.940> here

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
is about 20% so one in five stars here

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
is about 20% so one in five stars here
in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> Milky<00:00:43.110> Way<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.710> planets<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.370> are

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
in the Milky Way have planets that are

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.160 
in the Milky Way have planets that are
about<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> size<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.420> Earth<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
about the size of Earth with a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900 
about the size of Earth with a
temperature<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.039> support<00:00:47.340> life<00:00:47.430> now

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
temperature that can support life now

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.369 
temperature that can support life now
depending<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.450> source<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.989> estimate

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
depending on the source we estimate

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.709 
depending on the source we estimate
we've<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:49.800> between<00:00:50.010> 100<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.030> 400<00:00:51.300> billion

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
we've got between 100 and 400 billion

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.270 
we've got between 100 and 400 billion
stars<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.530> our<00:00:52.620> little<00:00:52.829> corner<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
stars here in our little corner of the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.779 
stars here in our little corner of the
universe<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> means<00:00:54.350> 20<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.890> 80<00:00:56.219> billion

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
universe so that means 20 to 80 billion

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.220 
universe so that means 20 to 80 billion
of<00:00:57.120> those<00:00:57.329> stars<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:58.260> earth-like<00:00:59.190> planets

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
of those stars have earth-like planets

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.779 
of those stars have earth-like planets
whoa<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.980> let's<00:01:02.160> get<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> brass<00:01:02.670> tacks

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
whoa so let's get down to brass tacks

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
whoa so let's get down to brass tacks
how<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.930> which<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.010> life

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
how do we know which of those have life

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.010 
how do we know which of those have life
well<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.060> might<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> color<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> its

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
well it might be the color of its

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.760 
well it might be the color of its
surface

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
surface

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
surface
so<00:01:08.040> some<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> first<00:01:08.640> living<00:01:08.970> things<00:01:09.180> on

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so some of the first living things on

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.359 
so some of the first living things on
earth<00:01:09.420> were<00:01:09.780> bacteria<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.560> covered<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
earth were bacteria that covered the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.950 
earth were bacteria that covered the
planet's<00:01:11.760> surface<00:01:11.939> about<00:01:12.270> 3<00:01:12.570> billion<00:01:12.750> years

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
planet's surface about 3 billion years

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
planet's surface about 3 billion years
ago<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.439> long<00:01:13.619> after<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.189> other<00:01:14.460> life<00:01:14.760> dies

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
ago and long after all other life dies

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
ago and long after all other life dies
out<00:01:15.299> similar<00:01:16.140> organisms<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.950> probably<00:01:17.490> be

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
out similar organisms will probably be

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.330 
out similar organisms will probably be
the<00:01:17.700> last<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.119> standing<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.780> those<00:01:18.930> bacteria

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the last one standing and those bacteria

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
the last one standing and those bacteria
were<00:01:20.340> purple<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.090> new<00:01:21.509> report<00:01:21.869> by<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960 
Institute of astrophysics of the Canary
Islands<00:01:25.020> wondered<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.009> could<00:01:26.100> find<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.909> way

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
Islands wondered if you could find a way

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
Islands wondered if you could find a way
to<00:01:27.360> detect<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.380> purple<00:01:28.799> color<00:01:28.829> from<00:01:29.250> far<00:01:29.520> off

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
to detect that purple color from far off

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
to detect that purple color from far off
say<00:01:30.150> from<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> our<00:01:31.020> telescopes<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.799> they

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
say from one of our telescopes so they

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.499 
say from one of our telescopes so they
ran<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.280> computer<00:01:32.729> models<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:33.360> earth-like

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
ran some computer models of earth-like

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.539 
ran some computer models of earth-like
planets<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.380> found<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.400> the

signal<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.340> all<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.610> we've<00:01:47.700> got<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> new

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
signal at all but we've got a new

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.149 
signal at all but we've got a new
telescope<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.990> James<00:01:49.350> Webb<00:01:49.680> Space<00:01:49.710> Telescope

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
telescope the James Webb Space Telescope

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.179 
telescope the James Webb Space Telescope
going<00:01:50.970> up<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.149> 2018<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.500> could<00:01:52.740> detect

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
going up in 2018 and it could detect

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.999 
going up in 2018 and it could detect
those<00:01:53.640> signals<00:01:54.149> from<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.450> planet<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.530> long<00:01:55.770> as

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
those signals from a planet so long as

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
those signals from a planet so long as
the<00:01:56.189> star<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> planet<00:01:57.240> orbits<00:01:57.600> isn't

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the star that the planet orbits isn't

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
the star that the planet orbits isn't
too<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:58.469> brighter<00:01:58.860> than<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.460> from<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
too much brighter than it is from the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.730 
too much brighter than it is from the
telescope's<00:02:00.570> point<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> view<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.619> know

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
telescope's point of view so we know

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.499 
telescope's point of view so we know
which<00:02:01.890> planets<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:02.460> candidates<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.299> just

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
which planets are candidates and in just

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.899 
which planets are candidates and in just
a<00:02:03.600> few<00:02:03.750> years<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.680> could<00:02:04.860> find<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.280> which<00:02:05.549> ones

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
a few years we could find out which ones

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.350 
a few years we could find out which ones
