00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
the part that basically takes the
longest<00:01:31.829> time<00:01:31.950> unfortunately<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.850> us<00:01:32.930> just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
longest time unfortunately for us just

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.179 
longest time unfortunately for us just
basically<00:01:34.320> getting<00:01:34.590> through<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:34.979> I'm<00:01:35.040> going

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
basically getting through here I'm going

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.590 
basically getting through here I'm going
to<00:01:35.250> skip<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> cutscene<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> comes<00:01:36.450> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
to skip the cutscene that comes in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.050 
to skip the cutscene that comes in
through<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.400> walk<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:38.759> here

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
through here just as we walk down here

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
through here just as we walk down here
and<00:01:39.390> i'm<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> show<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.049> guys<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
fastest way to do this mission you could

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.109 
fastest way to do this mission you could
hear<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.220> i'm<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> in

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
hear see here now i'm going to do it in

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
hear see here now i'm going to do it in
slower<00:01:45.570> or<00:01:45.869> real<00:01:46.140> time<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
slower or real time and we are going to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.359 
slower or real time and we are going to
go<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.210> basically<00:01:48.840> skip<00:01:49.380> pretty<00:01:50.100> much

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
go and basically skip pretty much

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.219 
go and basically skip pretty much
everything<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.360> mission<00:01:51.570> there's<00:01:51.869> very

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
everything in this mission there's very

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080 
everything in this mission there's very
minimal<00:01:52.829> bobs<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.939> actually

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
minimal bobs that you have to actually

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.840 
minimal bobs that you have to actually
kill<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:55.320> make<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.710> work<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.189> i'll<00:01:56.520> kill<00:01:56.820> a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
kill to make this work and i'll kill a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
kill to make this work and i'll kill a
couple<00:01:57.149> extra<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.110> most<00:01:58.290> part<00:01:58.409> i'll

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
couple extra but for the most part i'll

couple extra but for the most part i'll
show<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> guys<00:01:58.979> exactly<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.119> to

going to keep on going through here big
and<00:02:17.880> hugely<00:02:18.300> important<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.810> jump<00:02:19.200> over<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and hugely important to jump over the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.990 
and hugely important to jump over the
thrall<00:02:19.830> there<00:02:20.040> because<00:02:20.310> they<00:02:20.460> do<00:02:20.520> do<00:02:20.760> quite<00:02:20.970> a

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
thrall there because they do do quite a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
thrall there because they do do quite a
bit<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.240> damage<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.350> want<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.530> jump<00:02:22.680> over

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
bit of damage so we want to jump over

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.040 
bit of damage so we want to jump over
them<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.310> do<00:02:23.520> not<00:02:23.940> want<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.450> go<00:02:24.570> anywhere

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
near that thrall that is going to

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.970 
near that thrall that is going to
explode<00:02:27.210> there<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.870> believe<00:02:28.470> their<00:02:28.740> card

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
explode there I believe their card

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.560 
explode there I believe their card
called<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> infected<00:02:30.060> through<00:02:30.090> all<00:02:30.360> there

right up through here try to go

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.430 
right up through here try to go

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
actually have to kill a specific amount

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.699 
actually have to kill a specific amount
of<00:02:57.300> these<00:02:57.420> mobs<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.140> think<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:58.530> pretty

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
of these mobs and I think it's pretty

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.800 
of these mobs and I think it's pretty
much<00:02:58.920> every<00:02:59.430> single<00:02:59.670> mob<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.480> make<00:03:00.630> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
much every single mob here to make that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.199 
much every single mob here to make that
door<00:03:01.020> open<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.280> other<00:03:02.310> mobs<00:03:02.850> come

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
door open and have the other mobs come

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.490 
door open and have the other mobs come
out<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.600> here<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:03.959> we're<00:03:04.020> going<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.230> keep<00:03:04.350> on

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
out of it here so we're going to keep on

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
out of it here so we're going to keep on
going<00:03:04.739> ahead<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:04.980> doing<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.400> can

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
going ahead and doing that you can

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.940 
going ahead and doing that you can
remember<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> wizard<00:03:07.230> here<00:03:07.830> so

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
remember that there is a wizard here so

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.530 
remember that there is a wizard here so
we're<00:03:08.070> going<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.250> go<00:03:08.280> ahead<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.640> kill<00:03:09.330> this

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
we're going to go ahead and kill this

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.690 
we're going to go ahead and kill this
chosen<00:03:09.810> wizard<00:03:10.290> again<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.830> level<00:03:11.160> 12<00:03:11.459> and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
chosen wizard again it is level 12 and

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.240 
chosen wizard again it is level 12 and
with<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.930> pretty<00:03:12.930> much<00:03:13.140> fully<00:03:13.410> maxed<00:03:13.800> out<00:03:13.890> Soros

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
with a pretty much fully maxed out Soros

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.520 
with a pretty much fully maxed out Soros
regime<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.060> not<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> difficult<00:03:15.810> task<00:03:16.260> at

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
regime that is not a difficult task at

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.289 
regime that is not a difficult task at
all<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.160> can<00:03:17.280> see<00:03:17.400> right<00:03:17.430> now<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:18.120> is

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
all so you can see right now this is

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.820 
all so you can see right now this is
unnecessary<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.989> kill<00:03:19.200> these<00:03:19.350> mobs<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:19.799> I

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
unnecessary to kill these mobs but I

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.289 
unnecessary to kill these mobs but I
just<00:03:20.010> happen<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.400> my<00:03:20.610> super<00:03:20.940> ready<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.269> I

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
just happen to have my super ready so I

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.780 
just happen to have my super ready so I
figured<00:03:21.600> why<00:03:22.170> not<00:03:22.200> why<00:03:22.799> not<00:03:22.830> just<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.430> right<00:03:23.610> on

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
figured why not why not just go right on

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.640 
figured why not why not just go right on
ahead<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.150> use<00:03:24.750> my<00:03:24.959> super<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.320> kill<00:03:25.470> those

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
ahead and use my super to kill those

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.470 
ahead and use my super to kill those
mobs<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.190> then<00:03:26.670> when<00:03:26.820> i<00:03:26.850> get<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.209> top<00:03:27.360> of

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
mobs and then when i get to the top of

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.180 
mobs and then when i get to the top of
the<00:03:27.540> stairs<00:03:27.750> here<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.080> start<00:03:28.350> thinking<00:03:28.410> wow

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the stairs here I start thinking wow

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.430 
the stairs here I start thinking wow
there's<00:03:29.760> twice<00:03:30.150> as<00:03:30.209> many<00:03:30.540> mobs<00:03:30.810> here<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.350> it

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
there's twice as many mobs here and it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.170 
there's twice as many mobs here and it
probably<00:03:31.680> would<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.010> been<00:03:32.130> an<00:03:32.310> alright<00:03:32.489> idea

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
probably would have been an alright idea

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.880 
probably would have been an alright idea
for<00:03:33.480> me<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.600> use<00:03:33.870> my<00:03:33.900> super<00:03:34.380> here<00:03:34.560> instead

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
for me to use my super here instead

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.789 
for me to use my super here instead
uh-huh<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.000> kind<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.720> regretted<00:03:37.380> using<00:03:37.769> a

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
uh-huh so I kind of I regretted using a

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:38.690 
uh-huh so I kind of I regretted using a
little<00:03:38.010> bit<00:03:38.130> early<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.400> what<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.640> would

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
little bit early and what I would

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.970 
little bit early and what I would
recommend<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:39.390> guys<00:03:39.600> do<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.110> maybe<00:03:40.500> save

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
recommend that you guys do is maybe save

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.220 
recommend that you guys do is maybe save
your<00:03:41.310> super<00:03:41.940> for<00:03:42.150> this<00:03:42.269> area<00:03:42.570> here<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:43.079> can

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
your super for this area here you can

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
your super for this area here you can
see<00:03:43.380> again<00:03:43.590> it's<00:03:43.769> not<00:03:43.890> really<00:03:44.100> that

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
see again it's not really that

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.940 
see again it's not really that
challenging<00:03:44.760> because<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.150> do<00:03:45.209> have<00:03:45.360> my<00:03:45.950> ability

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
challenging because I do have my ability

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.340 
challenging because I do have my ability
set<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.579> maximum<00:03:48.329> recovery<00:03:48.630> rate<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.230> do

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
set to maximum recovery rate so I do

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.590 
set to maximum recovery rate so I do
recharge<00:03:49.920> my<00:03:50.160> health<00:03:50.459> very<00:03:50.850> very<00:03:51.060> quickly<00:03:51.360> and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
recharge my health very very quickly and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.210 
recharge my health very very quickly and
I<00:03:51.900> recommend<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.500> when<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.739> guys<00:03:52.829> are<00:03:53.010> doing

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
I recommend that when you guys are doing

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.500 
I recommend that when you guys are doing
speed<00:03:53.459> runs<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:53.940> guys<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.329> same

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
speed runs that you guys do the same

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.380 
speed runs that you guys do the same
thing<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:55.200> all<00:03:55.530> about<00:03:55.560> having<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.790> recovery

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
thing it's all about having the recovery

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.800 
thing it's all about having the recovery
rate<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:58.290> fast<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.600> can<00:04:00.720> see

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
rate as fast as you can so you can see

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.900 
rate as fast as you can so you can see
here<00:04:01.019> we<00:04:01.140> ended<00:04:01.320> up<00:04:01.380> picking<00:04:01.590> up<00:04:01.799> one<00:04:02.340> rocket

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
here we ended up picking up one rocket

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.300 
here we ended up picking up one rocket
one<00:04:03.870> rocket<00:04:04.290> isn't<00:04:04.500> going<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.709> do<00:04:04.799> us<00:04:04.829> too<00:04:05.130> much

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
one rocket isn't going to do us too much

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.680 
one rocket isn't going to do us too much
here<00:04:05.640> but<00:04:05.670> you<00:04:05.850> can<00:04:05.880> see<00:04:06.180> it's<00:04:06.329> good<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.570> have

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
here but you can see it's good to have

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.690 
here but you can see it's good to have
better<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.079> have<00:04:07.170> at<00:04:07.440> least<00:04:07.500> one<00:04:07.680> rocket<00:04:08.190> then

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
better to have at least one rocket then

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.699 
better to have at least one rocket then
no<00:04:09.000> rockets<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.690> we're<00:04:09.840> hoping<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.320> pick<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.500> a

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
no rockets and we're hoping to pick up a

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.949 
no rockets and we're hoping to pick up a
couple<00:04:10.829> extra<00:04:11.100> here<00:04:11.549> between<00:04:12.090> these<00:04:12.480> Wizards

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
couple extra here between these Wizards

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.720 
couple extra here between these Wizards
and<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.350> various<00:04:13.920> mobs<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.280> we're<00:04:14.459> killing

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
and the various mobs that we're killing

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.099 
and the various mobs that we're killing
here<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.060> we're<00:04:15.480> going<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:15.660> keep<00:04:15.750> on<00:04:15.870> going

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
here so we're going to keep on going

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.539 
here so we're going to keep on going
ahead<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.620> i'm<00:04:16.769> just<00:04:16.919> going<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.100> switch<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.430> my

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
ahead and i'm just going to switch to my

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.590 
ahead and i'm just going to switch to my
series<00:04:17.820> here<00:04:18.030> because<00:04:18.239> again<00:04:18.419> these<00:04:18.540> are

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
series here because again these are

grenade it kind of the chosen through
all<00:04:39.920> didn't<00:04:40.220> really<00:04:40.370> want<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.610> walk<00:04:41.060> through

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
all didn't really want to walk through

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.360 
all didn't really want to walk through
that<00:04:41.410> part<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.590> door<00:04:42.800> there<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.250> actually

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
that part of the door there to actually

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.100 
that part of the door there to actually
start<00:04:43.700> killing<00:04:43.970> them<00:04:44.060> here<00:04:44.240> but<00:04:44.660> again<00:04:44.750> it's

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
start killing them here but again it's

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.050 
start killing them here but again it's
not<00:04:45.260> really<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.010> big<00:04:46.190> deal<00:04:46.250> at<00:04:46.550> all<00:04:46.640> you<00:04:46.760> can<00:04:46.910> see

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
not really a big deal at all you can see

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.240 
not really a big deal at all you can see
that<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:48.200> Knights<00:04:48.470> have<00:04:48.650> now<00:04:48.800> spawn<00:04:49.100> and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
that the Knights have now spawn and

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.530 
that the Knights have now spawn and
we're<00:04:49.370> going<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.520> try<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.880> kill<00:04:50.180> these<00:04:50.330> nights

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
we're going to try to kill these nights

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.150 
we're going to try to kill these nights
before<00:04:50.750> they<00:04:50.960> get<00:04:51.050> up<00:04:51.170> top<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.560> again<00:04:51.980> that's

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
before they get up top and again that's

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.410 
before they get up top and again that's
just<00:04:52.220> kind<00:04:52.460> of<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.580> time-saving<00:04:53.030> thing<00:04:53.270> because

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
just kind of a time-saving thing because

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.520 
just kind of a time-saving thing because
if<00:04:53.510> we<00:04:53.570> can<00:04:53.690> do<00:04:53.810> that<00:04:53.960> then<00:04:54.140> we<00:04:54.260> don't<00:04:54.350> have<00:04:54.440> to

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
if we can do that then we don't have to

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.470 
if we can do that then we don't have to
chase<00:04:54.830> them<00:04:55.070> down<00:04:55.100> and<00:04:55.490> we<00:04:55.880> don't<00:04:55.970> have<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.240> get

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
chase them down and we don't have to get

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.300 
chase them down and we don't have to get
in<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.900> line<00:04:57.230> of<00:04:57.410> fire<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.950> other<00:04:58.070> mobs

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
in the line of fire of the other mobs

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.830 
in the line of fire of the other mobs
that<00:04:58.430> pop<00:04:58.670> up<00:04:58.850> there<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.540> can<00:04:59.660> see

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
that pop up there and you can see

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.330 
that pop up there and you can see
because<00:05:00.050> there<00:05:00.350> are<00:05:00.440> only<00:05:00.530> level<00:05:00.890> 12<00:05:01.100> we<00:05:01.220> were

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
because there are only level 12 we were

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.710 
because there are only level 12 we were
able<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.760> go<00:05:01.880> ahead<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.240> do<00:05:02.330> that<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.570> it

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
able to go ahead and do that and it

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.970 
able to go ahead and do that and it
wasn't<00:05:02.960> any<00:05:03.110> kind<00:05:03.230> of<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.410> challenge<00:05:03.740> at<00:05:03.830> all

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
wasn't any kind of a challenge at all

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.470 
wasn't any kind of a challenge at all
for<00:05:04.310> us<00:05:04.400> here<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.940> we're<00:05:05.060> going<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.240> keep<00:05:05.330> on

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
up top here in order to spawn the next

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.510 
up top here in order to spawn the next
round<00:05:09.530> you<00:05:09.740> can<00:05:09.830> see<00:05:09.920> the<00:05:10.010> next<00:05:10.190> round<00:05:10.340> is

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
round you can see the next round is

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.490 
round you can see the next round is
about<00:05:10.670> to<00:05:10.970> spawn<00:05:11.180> here<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:11.690> they're<00:05:12.260> going<00:05:12.410> to

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
about to spawn here and they're going to

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.290 
about to spawn here and they're going to
come<00:05:12.710> from<00:05:12.980> up<00:05:13.280> here<00:05:13.730> so<00:05:13.910> we're<00:05:14.000> going<00:05:14.090> to<00:05:14.180> try

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
come from up here so we're going to try

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.030 
come from up here so we're going to try
to<00:05:14.420> position<00:05:14.960> ourselves<00:05:15.200> so<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.650> we<00:05:15.800> can

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
to position ourselves so that we can

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.460 
to position ourselves so that we can
again<00:05:16.820> take<00:05:16.880> as<00:05:17.270> many<00:05:17.570> out<00:05:17.840> before<00:05:18.260> they<00:05:18.350> get

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
again take as many out before they get

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.800 
again take as many out before they get
down<00:05:18.650> here<00:05:18.980> as<00:05:19.070> possible<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.670> again<00:05:20.120> it's

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
down here as possible and again it's

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.570 
down here as possible and again it's
only<00:05:21.260> because<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.830> whole<00:05:22.010> purpose<00:05:22.280> of<00:05:22.520> this

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
only because the whole purpose of this

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.450 
only because the whole purpose of this
is<00:05:22.910> to<00:05:22.970> finish<00:05:23.570> the<00:05:23.780> Vanguard<00:05:24.650> bounty<00:05:25.040> tell

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
much what I what I'm guessing is going

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.430 
much what I what I'm guessing is going
to<00:06:06.860> be<00:06:06.980> pretty<00:06:07.220> much<00:06:07.490> leveled<00:06:07.790> up<00:06:08.060> because

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
to be pretty much leveled up because

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.870 
to be pretty much leveled up because
50,000<00:06:09.440> exp<00:06:09.860> is<00:06:10.010> a<00:06:10.040> lot<00:06:10.370> for<00:06:10.610> a<00:06:10.669> piece<00:06:10.850> of

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
50,000 exp is a lot for a piece of

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.610 
50,000 exp is a lot for a piece of
equipment<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.570> I'm<00:06:11.960> hoping<00:06:12.290> that<00:06:12.350> that's

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
equipment and I'm hoping that that's

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.310 
equipment and I'm hoping that that's
pretty<00:06:13.040> much<00:06:13.190> going<00:06:13.400> to<00:06:13.460> take<00:06:13.700> me<00:06:13.880> to<00:06:14.060> the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
pretty much going to take me to the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.600 
pretty much going to take me to the
maximum<00:06:15.320> level<00:06:15.470> because<00:06:16.160> that<00:06:16.340> would<00:06:16.490> be

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
maximum level because that would be

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.770 
maximum level because that would be
awesome<00:06:16.730> you<00:06:16.940> could<00:06:17.120> see<00:06:17.270> right<00:06:17.419> here<00:06:17.600> now

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
awesome you could see right here now

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.180 
awesome you could see right here now
we've<00:06:17.990> cleared<00:06:18.290> all<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.770> mobs<00:06:18.950> that<00:06:19.040> we

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
we've cleared all the mobs that we

and<00:06:21.260> I'm<00:06:21.380> kind<00:06:21.620> of<00:06:21.650> taking<00:06:21.740> shots<00:06:22.100> a<00:06:22.160> little

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
and I'm kind of taking shots a little

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.860 
and I'm kind of taking shots a little
bit<00:06:22.430> too<00:06:22.550> fast<00:06:22.790> there<00:06:23.030> I<00:06:23.180> should<00:06:23.510> have<00:06:23.600> taken<00:06:23.690> a

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
bit too fast there I should have taken a

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.850 
bit too fast there I should have taken a
little<00:06:23.960> bit<00:06:24.110> more<00:06:24.200> time<00:06:24.440> for<00:06:24.620> one<00:06:24.710> of<00:06:24.800> those

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
little bit more time for one of those

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.930 
little bit more time for one of those
shots<00:06:25.130> there<00:06:25.340> and<00:06:25.490> it<00:06:25.550> would<00:06:25.669> have<00:06:25.790> actually

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
shots there and it would have actually

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.390 
shots there and it would have actually
ended<00:06:26.360> up<00:06:26.419> killing<00:06:26.990> him<00:06:27.320> fully<00:06:27.680> with<00:06:27.980> a<00:06:28.010> lot

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400
