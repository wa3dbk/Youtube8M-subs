is<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.230> good<00:03:23.440> choice<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.040> lap<00:03:24.370> after<00:03:24.579> lap

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
is a good choice and just lap after lap

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.250 
is a good choice and just lap after lap
the<00:03:25.120> course<00:03:25.359> was<00:03:25.540> getting<00:03:25.810> better<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.109> better

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the course was getting better and better

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.220 
the course was getting better and better
I<00:03:26.530> was<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:26.890> able<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.280> pull<00:03:27.630> riders<00:03:28.630> back<00:03:28.840> and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230
