 He compared that experience 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.570
 here has no release date either 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.450
 said finely-tuned our goal is just a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.940
 expectation one point is all anxious 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.850
 what will be the end of the story of 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.310
 emily harper beautiful fountain also known 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.730
 like the girl from nowhere 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.310
 but more important than all 12 and 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.110
 12 is as good as passing 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.209
 started and second book we have not 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.470
 requires of everything that happened the first 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.200
 I'll just talk really cool 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.850
 clever as if they were verses 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.989
 that tells the story of the 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.120
 characters 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.030
 I love all the games of 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.860
 the format that develops and makes ifa a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.750
 brief contextualization of everything that 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.700
 happened to the characters at the end of the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.230
 last battle in the passage and here it is 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.870
 Time travel back to the year 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.250
 zero as soon as the hood virus and the population 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.290
 began to panic because he did not 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.170
 knew what was happening and there 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.970
 people will follow three 50's and 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.920
 60 struggle to survive and all 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.230
 His back is sinking and one thing 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.810
 I liked very much appreciate and know how 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.760
 was that civilization from the point of view 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.590
 them is something that even has a 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.989
 fascination to know who the man is who 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.430
 humanity loses hope and this is 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.769
 very worked on in this book 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.049
 basically is something that in the passage to 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.080
 people see very much how it was 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.260
 civilization here and the profound many 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.799
 points of joy and pride 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.049
 free pass and feats of galley 10 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.420
 We go back to the future only five 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.329
 years after the end of the first book 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.980
 facing the history of mp will have garbage 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.540
 and we now believe in douma and 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.120
 know what's going on with them 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.699
 basically the guys who survived the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.680
 meeting with one of the 12 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.380
 and at this point of course we already know 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.810
 Who are the 12 and 12 first 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.090
 infected those prisoners who 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.160
 were victims in the experience and that 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.880
 escaped and began infecting the population 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.340
 they have a master status or 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.699
 all infected always follow one of the 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.250
 12 when one of the twelve dies all 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.229
 infected who followed him also die 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.820
 in the previous book we met a 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.820
 them black hawk né 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.199
 in this book now we follow 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.150
 find out who the other 11 that 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.490
 people know that these health options 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:00.479
 what he is doing with these 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.039
 z plane basically left the entire 12 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.910
 Army is behind them too. 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.310
 destroyed 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.410
 simple but so do not because 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.840
 15 years have passed since the last 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.750
 book ended and they did not have another 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.440
 sign of any of the other 11 the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.560
 11 out of 12 to play on it will be the masters 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.860
 that the pharaohs more than worry 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.410
 only with the 11 that is left is he 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.690
 talk about a new threat that has arisen 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.740
 not a simple threat are monsters 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.289
 even worse are humans and imbeciles and 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.760
 this is more than a battle 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.680
 against the monsters to 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.690
 human survival is a battle 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.599
 against the English also ask that 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:45.539
 humanly and sincerely recorded 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:48.000
 There is not much to talk about because the 12 is 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.010
 the typical second book of a trilogy and 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.889
 the one that bridges the beginning of the 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.370
 history its end but this makes the 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.229
 bad book of course not because you have a 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.539
 writer like days phone and bossy 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.610
 stop the result obviously but not 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.120
 satisfactory and not confess that 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.010
 had a little bit of average 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.110
 the story did not develop so much 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.060
 which are book stopped and dragged but 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.050
 Miguel was founded on the book is very 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:16.300
 good and he has a story that follows 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.060
 far and ways that do not 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.940
 I was waiting but I was satisfied and 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.800
 which in the end gives a lot of loose end 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.510
 for us to want the third book I 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.669
 At least I want to, then, serve the people of 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.919
 selling the new characters you leave 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.470
 the characters already thinking about the book of 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.660
 one side but has not done anything else is 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.490
 unfounded and the new characters so 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.260
 very cool dynamics are also in the 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.210
 relationship of love and hate that we feel 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.520
 by the characters remain worthy of 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.260
 note and many many points of joy 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.690
 to discover that the 12 and 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.220
 bis different one of the monsters have a 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.560
 high level of society that I 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.930
 sincerely does not like and left 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.430
 to know what the third book will look like 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.919
 I hope that a house as beautiful as 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.539
 this edition of grace I have so much 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.820
 american hardcover vs brazilian 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:03.130
 recently launched from the archer to 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.199
 jean head but I particularly found it 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.180
 beautiful and english but did some 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:08.860
 comparisons of a key moment some 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.530
 expressions and could tell that the translation 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.780
 also good and will house also maintains 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.270
 us dramatic photography now a 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.400
 Curiosity The passage was released as 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.620

 buy just to have my heart and I confess 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.849
 I like to think they changed the cover 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.010
 of the passage because I compared it to 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:33.490
 cabin in my previous review 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:35.080
 yes heavens laughs but the suspense remains 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.590
 attention to the new 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:41.410
