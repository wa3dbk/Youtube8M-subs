00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
top of me you know and once I do that I

injury time let's take let's take Bob to
get<00:02:25.340> out<00:02:25.490> or<00:02:26.090> that's<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.510> neutral<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.410> don't

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
get out or that's a neutral so I don't

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.320
