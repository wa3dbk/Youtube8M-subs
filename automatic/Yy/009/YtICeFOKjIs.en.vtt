critical<00:00:24.739> aspect<00:00:25.250> when<00:00:25.730> you<00:00:25.820> take<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:26.119> shoe

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
critical aspect when you take the shoe

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.939 
critical aspect when you take the shoe
away<00:00:26.330> moving<00:00:27.109> towards<00:00:27.380> more<00:00:27.560> minimalistic

design you lose that built in rocker

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.390 
design you lose that built in rocker
effect<00:00:30.289> so<00:00:30.529> it's<00:00:30.679> even<00:00:30.859> more<00:00:30.980> critical<00:00:31.130> that

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
effect so it's even more critical that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.100 
effect so it's even more critical that
we<00:00:31.580> have<00:00:31.730> range<00:00:31.970> of<00:00:32.150> motion<00:00:32.419> at<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:32.629> ankle<00:00:32.989> and

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
we have range of motion at the ankle and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.140 
we have range of motion at the ankle and
the<00:00:33.320> big<00:00:33.470> toe<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.309> if<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:34.580> lack<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:34.850> ability

floor alternate back and forth well this
may<00:03:15.490> seem<00:03:15.730> challenging<00:03:15.760> it's<00:03:16.540> not<00:03:16.750> an<00:03:16.810> issue

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
may seem challenging it's not an issue

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.430 
may seem challenging it's not an issue
with<00:03:17.230> strength<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:17.800> more<00:03:17.980> coordination<00:03:19.440> so

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
with strength it's more coordination so

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.080 
with strength it's more coordination so
when<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.620> talk<00:03:20.800> about<00:03:20.970> stabilization<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
when you talk about stabilization of the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.670 
when you talk about stabilization of the
foot<00:03:22.300> it's<00:03:22.810> important<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.230> think<00:03:23.350> what

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
foot it's important to think what

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.530 
foot it's important to think what
structures<00:03:24.070> are<00:03:24.190> working<00:03:24.490> inside<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.330> foot

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
structures are working inside the foot

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.100 
structures are working inside the foot
when<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.350> curl<00:03:26.650> your<00:03:26.800> toes<00:03:27.180> okay<00:03:28.180> when<00:03:28.900> we<00:03:28.990> see

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
when you curl your toes okay when we see

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.390 
when you curl your toes okay when we see
this<00:03:29.230> joint<00:03:29.500> bend<00:03:29.680> we're<00:03:29.860> actually<00:03:29.980> seeing<00:03:30.280> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
this joint bend we're actually seeing a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.490 
this joint bend we're actually seeing a
muscle<00:03:30.700> activate<00:03:31.150> this<00:03:31.270> in<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.630> shin<00:03:31.960> okay

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
muscle activate this in the shin okay

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.620 
muscle activate this in the shin okay
not<00:03:32.950> necessarily<00:03:33.370> in<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.760> foot<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.510> only

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
not necessarily in the foot you only

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.630 
not necessarily in the foot you only
have<00:03:34.900> Lex<00:03:35.440> really<00:03:35.680> have<00:03:36.070> two<00:03:36.310> structures

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
have Lex really have two structures

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.610 
have Lex really have two structures
they're<00:03:37.000> actually<00:03:37.360> inside<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:38.290> foot<00:03:38.500> that

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
they're actually inside the foot that

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.410 
they're actually inside the foot that
stabilize<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.430> medial<00:03:39.790> longitudinal<00:03:39.910> arch

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
stabilize the medial longitudinal arch

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.600 
stabilize the medial longitudinal arch
okay<00:03:41.170> one<00:03:41.800> of<00:03:41.860> them<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.040> your<00:03:42.160> plantar<00:03:42.400> fascia

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
okay one of them is your plantar fascia

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.430 
okay one of them is your plantar fascia
your<00:03:43.330> plantar<00:03:43.540> fascial<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:43.990> nice<00:03:44.140> structure

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
your plantar fascial is a nice structure

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.770 
your plantar fascial is a nice structure
it<00:03:44.800> tends<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.220> bind<00:03:46.030> down<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.510> give<00:03:46.600> support

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
it tends to bind down and give support

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.870 
it tends to bind down and give support
instruction<00:03:47.740> of<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.890> foot<00:03:48.100> but<00:03:48.610> doesn't

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
instruction of the foot but doesn't

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.390 
instruction of the foot but doesn't
actually<00:03:49.270> serve<00:03:49.600> to<00:03:49.840> maintain<00:03:50.500> motion

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
actually serve to maintain motion

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.070 
actually serve to maintain motion
between<00:03:51.700> your<00:03:51.940> forefoot<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.630> rear<00:03:52.750> foot<00:03:52.930> or

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
the torsion or twisting motion that you

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.670 
the torsion or twisting motion that you
have<00:03:54.790> so<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.510> want<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.750> basically<00:03:55.900> teach<00:03:56.350> you

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
have so you want to basically teach you

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.770 
have so you want to basically teach you
how<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:56.980> activate<00:03:57.520> muscles<00:03:57.760> inside<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.570> feet

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
how to activate muscles inside the feet

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.840 
how to activate muscles inside the feet
the<00:03:59.290> only<00:03:59.620> muscle<00:03:59.800> you<00:04:00.070> have<00:04:00.100> it<00:04:00.370> stabilizes

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
the only muscle you have it stabilizes

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.760 
the only muscle you have it stabilizes
the<00:04:00.910> arch<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:01.330> Claira<00:04:01.630> flexor<00:04:02.050> houses<00:04:02.410> brevis

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
the arch is Claira flexor houses brevis

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.680 
the arch is Claira flexor houses brevis
it<00:04:03.370> runs<00:04:03.580> from<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.850> back<00:04:04.060> side<00:04:04.300> of<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.510> heel

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
it runs from the back side of the heel

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.650 
it runs from the back side of the heel
to<00:04:05.500> just<00:04:06.460> in<00:04:06.550> front<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.940> ball<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.480> foot

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
to just in front of the ball of the foot

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.840 
to just in front of the ball of the foot
and<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.410> what<00:04:08.500> want<00:04:08.650> to<00:04:08.740> do<00:04:08.860> is<00:04:09.130> train<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.640> to

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
and so what want to do is train you to

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.660 
and so what want to do is train you to
isolate<00:04:10.390> a<00:04:10.680> motion<00:04:11.680> which<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:11.950> just<00:04:12.250> moving

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
isolate a motion which is just moving

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.670 
isolate a motion which is just moving
the<00:04:13.240> ball<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.660> foot<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.110> not<00:04:14.290> actually

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
the ball of the foot and not actually

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.510 
the ball of the foot and not actually
curling<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:16.239> end<00:04:16.450> of<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.630> big<00:04:16.810> toe<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.370> do

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
curling the end of the big toe so to do

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.230 
curling the end of the big toe so to do
this<00:04:18.700> you<00:04:19.359> can<00:04:19.510> take<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:20.700> binder<00:04:21.700> piece<00:04:22.090> of

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
this you can take a binder piece of

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240 
this you can take a binder piece of
cardboard<00:04:22.630> plastic<00:04:22.810> you're<00:04:23.740> going<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.100> stick

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
cardboard plastic you're going to stick

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.430 
cardboard plastic you're going to stick
it<00:04:24.280> right<00:04:24.550> under<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.150> big<00:04:25.510> toe<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.110> basically

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
it right under the big toe so basically

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.980 
it right under the big toe so basically
comes<00:04:26.650> up<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:26.980> base<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.370> foot<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
comes up to the base of the foot the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.270 
comes up to the base of the foot the
important<00:04:29.410> thing<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.650> you<00:04:29.770> want<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.950> keep<00:04:30.130> the
