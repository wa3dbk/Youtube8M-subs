gorgeous

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
gorgeous

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.050 
gorgeous
when<00:01:08.910> I<00:01:08.940> say<00:01:09.270> absolutely<00:01:09.750> gorgeous<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.650> mean

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
when I say absolutely gorgeous I mean

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.830 
when I say absolutely gorgeous I mean
tangle-free<00:01:11.390> i<00:01:11.990> have<00:01:12.619> had<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> little

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
tangle-free i have had a little

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.630 
tangle-free i have had a little
little<00:01:14.109> bit<00:01:14.289> of<00:01:14.380> shedding<00:01:14.649> but<00:01:15.280> very<00:01:15.549> very

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
little bit of shedding but very very

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.819 
little bit of shedding but very very
minimum<00:01:16.270> shedding<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.259> I<00:01:17.409> think<00:01:17.679> it's

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
minimum shedding and I think it's

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.580 
minimum shedding and I think it's
because<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.280> cut<00:01:18.520> my<00:01:18.640> West<00:01:19.079> when<00:01:20.079> I<00:01:20.140> got<00:01:20.320> around

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
because I cut my West when I got around

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.459 
because I cut my West when I got around
to<00:01:21.100> doing<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.549> top<00:01:21.789> of<00:01:22.060> my<00:01:22.359> hair<00:01:22.659> so<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.229> think

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469 
to doing the top of my hair so I think

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.200 
to doing the top of my hair so I think
that's<00:01:23.920> where<00:01:24.219> the<00:01:24.280> minimum<00:01:24.700> shedding<00:01:25.090> is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
that's where the minimum shedding is

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.870 
that's where the minimum shedding is
coming

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
coming

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:36.850
