00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and man United but we argue with Arsenal

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.200 
and man United but we argue with Arsenal
as<00:01:42.600> they<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> highest<00:01:44.399> average<00:01:44.610> best

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
as they do have the highest average best

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
as they do have the highest average best
out<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.659> those<00:01:45.869> three<00:01:45.930> clubs<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.619> their

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
out of those three clubs with their

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.719 
out of those three clubs with their
players<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.880> starting<00:01:48.479> lineup<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.729> then

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
players in this starting lineup and then

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
players in this starting lineup and then
we<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.320> highest<00:01:52.979> attacking<00:01:53.670> player<00:01:53.939> as

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
we do have a highest attacking player as

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
we do have a highest attacking player as
Daniel<00:01:55.229> Sturridge<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> same

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
Daniel Sturridge and that is the same

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.219 
Daniel Sturridge and that is the same
with<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> highest<00:01:57.329> defending<00:01:57.840> player<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
with the highest defending player of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.280 
with the highest defending player of
course<00:01:58.439> both<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.680> those<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.299> 101<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.570> their

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
course both of those with a 101 as their

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
course both of those with a 101 as their
stat<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> now<00:02:02.850> we<00:02:02.909> will<00:02:03.240> move<00:02:03.299> first<00:02:03.840> into

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
stat so now we will move first into

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
stat so now we will move first into
these<00:02:04.619> subs<00:02:05.009> before<00:02:05.759> we<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.969> into<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> actual

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
these subs before we get into the actual
