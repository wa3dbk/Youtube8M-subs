pretty<00:01:49.409> small<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:51.390> actually<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:51.960> two

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
pretty small and we actually have two

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.179 
pretty small and we actually have two
things<00:01:52.770> let<00:01:53.220> me<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.610> show<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.000> now<00:01:55.189> one

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
things let me just show you that now one

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.440 
things let me just show you that now one
end<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.329> open<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.119> we<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.329> need

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
end we can open this up and we just need

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.969 
end we can open this up and we just need
to<00:02:00.509> slide<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:02.329> like<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.560> opens

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
to slide this like this and this opens

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
to slide this like this and this opens
the<00:02:05.070> USB<00:02:05.640> 2<00:02:05.820> port<00:02:05.850> using<00:02:06.689> which<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:06.990> can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the USB 2 port using which you can

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.800 
the USB 2 port using which you can
connect<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.829> computer<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
connect it to your computer and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.110 
connect it to your computer and
and<00:02:09.930> if<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.560> hit<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.400> go<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.940> way

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and if you just hit this and go this way

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.590 
and if you just hit this and go this way
this<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.990> microUSB<00:02:13.400> port<00:02:14.450> using<00:02:15.450> which

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
this is the microUSB port using which

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.880 
this is the microUSB port using which
you<00:02:15.630> can<00:02:15.780> directly<00:02:16.200> connect<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.740> your

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
you can directly connect it to your

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.090 
you can directly connect it to your
Android<00:02:17.190> phone<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.700> suppose<00:02:17.970> USB<00:02:18.390> OTG

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.310 
Android phone if it's suppose USB OTG
you<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.760> like<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.600> this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
you just like this like this and this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.030 
you just like this like this and this
pushes<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:24.050> pretty<00:02:25.050> convenient<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.830> have

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
pushes so pretty convenient we have

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.040 
pushes so pretty convenient we have
these<00:02:26.250> covers<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.570> secure

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
these covers like this and we can secure

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.770 
these covers like this and we can secure
it<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.800> pretty<00:02:32.010> tiny

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
it like this so it's a pretty tiny

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.810 
it like this so it's a pretty tiny
device<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.080> let<00:02:34.770> me<00:02:34.920> now<00:02:35.070> connect<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
device so let me now connect it to the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.820 
device so let me now connect it to the
computer<00:02:36.270> transfer<00:02:36.720> some<00:02:37.110> files<00:02:37.350> do<00:02:37.620> some

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
computer transfer some files do some

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.680 
computer transfer some files do some
speed<00:02:38.280> test<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.760> see<00:02:38.850> how<00:02:38.880> fast<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
speed test and see how fast is the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050 
speed test and see how fast is the
stripe<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.140> later<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.890> we'll<00:02:41.460> test<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.880> with

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
stripe and later on we'll test it with

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.850 
stripe and later on we'll test it with
an<00:02:42.180> Android<00:02:42.570> device<00:02:42.840> regarding<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.380> USB<00:02:43.740> OTG

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
an Android device regarding the USB OTG

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.410 
an Android device regarding the USB OTG
support<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.980> drive<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.370> pre<00:02:47.580> formatted<00:02:47.850> into

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
support the drive is pre formatted into

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.380 
support the drive is pre formatted into
fat32<00:02:48.900> format<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.040> did<00:02:50.250> some<00:02:50.459> tests<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
fat32 format and I did some tests and I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.690 
fat32 format and I did some tests and I
could<00:02:51.540> copy<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.930> 1<00:02:52.230> GB<00:02:52.440> file<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.040> around<00:02:53.400> 1

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
could copy a 1 GB file in around 1

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.910 
could copy a 1 GB file in around 1
minute<00:02:53.880> 58<00:02:54.390> seconds<00:02:54.990> or<00:02:55.170> so

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
minute 58 seconds or so

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.710 
minute 58 seconds or so
so<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.550> write<00:02:56.730> speeds<00:02:57.090> were<00:02:57.240> not<00:02:57.450> that

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
so the write speeds were not that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.780 
so the write speeds were not that
impressive<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.770> did<00:02:58.950> some<00:02:59.190> benchmarking

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
impressive and I did some benchmarking

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.150 
impressive and I did some benchmarking
so<00:03:00.000> here<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> results<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.650> terms<00:03:01.890> of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
so here are the results and in terms of

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.130 
so here are the results and in terms of
write<00:03:02.760> speeds<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.270> was<00:03:03.420> getting<00:03:03.720> around<00:03:03.930> six

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
write speeds I was getting around six

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.110 
write speeds I was getting around six
point<00:03:04.380> five<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.740> seven<00:03:05.100> Meg<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.520> read<00:03:05.790> were

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
point five to seven Meg and read were

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.050 
point five to seven Meg and read were
around<00:03:06.390> 16<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.930> 17<00:03:07.260> megabytes<00:03:08.010> so<00:03:08.370> these<00:03:08.850> are

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
around 16 to 17 megabytes so these are

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.180 
around 16 to 17 megabytes so these are
not<00:03:09.270> bad<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> expected<00:03:10.470> slightly<00:03:10.950> better

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
not bad but I expected slightly better

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.910 
not bad but I expected slightly better
results<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.850> can<00:03:12.060> copy<00:03:12.270> around<00:03:12.890> 1gb<00:03:13.890> of

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
results so you can copy around 1gb of

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.509 
results so you can copy around 1gb of
file<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.430> around<00:03:14.820> 2<00:03:15.060> minutes<00:03:15.269> or<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.070> now<00:03:17.070> let's

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
file in around 2 minutes or so now let's

you<00:04:46.350> do<00:04:46.620> get<00:04:46.830> USB<00:04:47.310> OTG<00:04:47.430> cables<00:04:48.150> like<00:04:48.390> this<00:04:48.420> I

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
you do get USB OTG cables like this I

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.360 
you do get USB OTG cables like this I
was<00:04:49.020> earlier<00:04:49.350> using<00:04:49.650> something<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:50.160> this

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
was earlier using something like this

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.790 
was earlier using something like this
and<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.330> attach<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.990> normal<00:04:52.350> pendrive

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
and you can attach the normal pendrive

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.310 
and you can attach the normal pendrive
to<00:04:52.980> these<00:04:53.130> USB<00:04:53.550> OTG<00:04:53.670> cables<00:04:54.330> but<00:04:54.750> it's<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:55.110> very

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
to these USB OTG cables but it's a very

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.590 
to these USB OTG cables but it's a very
clunky<00:04:55.680> solution<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.400> would<00:04:56.460> say<00:04:56.670> this<00:04:57.120> is<00:04:57.300> more

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
clunky solution I would say this is more

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.260 
clunky solution I would say this is more
of<00:04:57.840> a<00:04:58.290> very<00:04:58.530> elegant<00:04:58.920> solution<00:04:59.220> now<00:04:59.940> let<00:05:00.150> me

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
of a very elegant solution now let me

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.020 
of a very elegant solution now let me
also<00:05:00.390> try<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:00.930> one<00:05:01.470> more<00:05:01.710> device<00:05:02.040> so<00:05:02.760> let<00:05:02.910> me

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
also try it on one more device so let me

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.190 
also try it on one more device so let me
take<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.390> out<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:04.160> I'll<00:05:05.160> use<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:06.180> Nexus<00:05:06.960> 5

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
take this out and I'll use this Nexus 5

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.300 
take this out and I'll use this Nexus 5
the<00:05:07.710> Nexus<00:05:08.160> 5<00:05:08.400> has<00:05:08.430> USB<00:05:09.270> OTG<00:05:10.080> support<00:05:10.440> but<00:05:11.190> the

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
the Nexus 5 has USB OTG support but the

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.310 
the Nexus 5 has USB OTG support but the
thing<00:05:11.460> is<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.790> by<00:05:12.060> default<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.750> does<00:05:13.110> not

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
thing is that by default it does not

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.380 
thing is that by default it does not
mount<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.950> files<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:14.850> have<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.240> use<00:05:15.360> a

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
mount the files so you have to use a

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.690 
mount the files so you have to use a
third<00:05:15.690> party<00:05:15.720> app<00:05:16.170> called<00:05:16.620> Nexus<00:05:17.130> media

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
third party app called Nexus media

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.530 
third party app called Nexus media
manager<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.570> I<00:05:19.380> have<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:19.770> installed<00:05:20.280> and

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
manager and I have that installed and

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.390 
manager and I have that installed and
you'll<00:05:21.540> see<00:05:21.720> that<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.470> automatically<00:05:23.010> fires

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
you'll see that it automatically fires

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.930 
you'll see that it automatically fires
up<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:23.880> detects<00:05:24.480> our<00:05:25.380> drive<00:05:26.160> and<00:05:26.460> here<00:05:26.790> are

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
up and detects our drive and here are

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.940 
up and detects our drive and here are
the<00:05:27.060> contents<00:05:27.360> of<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.660> drive<00:05:27.840> from<00:05:28.140> example<00:05:28.860> I

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.670 
the contents of the drive from example I
selected<00:05:29.430> the<00:05:29.550> videos<00:05:30.020> for<00:05:31.020> example<00:05:31.560> I<00:05:31.620> don't

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
selected the videos for example I don't

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.470 
selected the videos for example I don't
have<00:05:31.860> any<00:05:32.010> photos<00:05:32.250> so<00:05:32.790> these<00:05:32.910> are<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.180> videos

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480
