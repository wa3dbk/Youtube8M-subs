shells<00:01:32.399> for<00:01:32.700> defense<00:01:33.029> he'll<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.990> people

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
shells for defense he'll it's the people

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.349

they going to stores now and ask for the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.959 
they going to stores now and ask for the
carjacker<00:01:37.200> gun<00:01:37.529> because<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.399> just<00:01:38.609> become

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
carjacker gun because it's just become

think<00:01:41.520> something<00:01:41.789> like<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.179> close<00:01:42.359> range

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
think something like that at close range

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.029 
think something like that at close range
and<00:01:43.259> when<00:01:43.439> we're<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.740> shoot<00:01:43.889> it<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
and when we're going to shoot it a

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.889 
and when we're going to shoot it a
