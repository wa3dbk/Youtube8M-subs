see-through case back is also in
sapphire<00:00:42.149> crystal<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.780> also<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
sapphire crystal I also really like the

front<00:00:44.730> face<00:00:44.910> dial<00:00:45.239> layout<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> watch<00:00:46.129> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
front face dial layout to this watch the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.979 
front face dial layout to this watch the
dial<00:00:47.370> manages<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> create<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.390> balanced

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
dial manages to create this balanced

look<00:00:49.200> despite<00:00:49.829> being<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.329> asymmetrical<00:00:51.329> I

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
look despite being very asymmetrical I

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.229 
look despite being very asymmetrical I
like<00:00:52.949> how<00:00:53.129> glossy<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.730> paid<00:00:53.969> close<00:00:54.210> attention

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
like how glossy to paid close attention

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.689 
like how glossy to paid close attention
to<00:00:54.750> detail<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.559> date<00:00:55.739> window<00:00:55.949> because

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
to detail with the date window because

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
to detail with the date window because
it's<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.149> curved<00:00:57.420> line<00:00:57.449> separating<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it's got this curved line separating the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's got this curved line separating the
numbers

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
numbers

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
numbers
this<00:00:59.699> makes<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> watch<00:01:00.270> face<00:01:00.510> appear<00:01:00.930> less

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this makes the watch face appear less

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.100 
this makes the watch face appear less
harsh<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:02.760> dialer<00:01:03.359> reminds<00:01:03.719> me<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> lot<00:01:04.049> of
