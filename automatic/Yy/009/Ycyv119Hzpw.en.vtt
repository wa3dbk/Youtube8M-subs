 followed by the guy who knows the way of this 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.330
 year amy was that and the third question is 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.950
 What is your favorite character and which one? 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.140
 is the one that less likes the character who 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.910
 more like edward razek commit crimes 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.110
 brotherhood who is a character who 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.820

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.830
 delicate and after he had a 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.510
 problem with his brother with 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.489
 taxation that was recurring 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.470

 need a single platform but 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.269
 very difficult to choose only one 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.700
 expensive which were several but at its most 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.890

 stop at each moment, but at the back 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.310
 since it also made me give more 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.650

 I woke up at dawn and only lost one 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.530
 The only face that the night we used to make 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.270
