00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
think you should I saw a video piece

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.059 
think you should I saw a video piece
that<00:02:28.480> said<00:02:28.750> maybe<00:02:29.110> 30<00:02:29.470> feet<00:02:29.680> from<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
that said maybe 30 feet from the

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.940 
that said maybe 30 feet from the
building<00:02:30.250> would<00:02:31.120> be<00:02:31.269> a<00:02:31.300> good<00:02:31.599> distance<00:02:32.470> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
building would be a good distance and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.430 
building would be a good distance and
that<00:02:33.130> would<00:02:33.280> make<00:02:33.430> sense<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.849> us<00:02:34.090> because<00:02:34.900> we

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
that would make sense to us because we

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.410 
that would make sense to us because we
don't<00:02:35.620> want<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.800> attract<00:02:36.130> stink<00:02:36.640> bugs<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
don't want to attract stink bugs to the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.490 
don't want to attract stink bugs to the
building<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:37.959> don't<00:02:38.110> want<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.290> hanging

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
building so we don't want it hanging

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.680 
building so we don't want it hanging
right<00:02:38.769> off<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.069> corner<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.670> building<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:40.599> we

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
right off the corner of a building if we

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.360 
right off the corner of a building if we
think<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.930> makes<00:02:41.110> more<00:02:41.319> sense<00:02:41.379> to<00:02:41.739> hang<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.190> out

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
think it makes more sense to hang it out

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
think it makes more sense to hang it out
on<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.760> perimeter<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.019> really

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
on the perimeter so if it's really

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.320 
on the perimeter so if it's really
effective<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.190> really<00:02:45.580> pulls<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.940> lot<00:02:46.120> of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
effective and it really pulls a lot of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.860 
effective and it really pulls a lot of
stink<00:02:47.019> bugs<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.709> then<00:02:48.370> they'll<00:02:49.329> be<00:02:49.630> pulled

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
stink bugs to it then they'll be pulled

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.330 
stink bugs to it then they'll be pulled
away<00:02:49.989> from<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.769> building<00:02:51.130> itself<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:54.099> also

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
away from the building itself so it also

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.319 
away from the building itself so it also
comes<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.940> combo<00:02:55.420> pack<00:02:55.660> that<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.959> bought<00:02:56.230> for

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
comes the combo pack that I bought for

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.410 
comes the combo pack that I bought for
$43.99<00:02:58.380> also<00:02:59.380> comes<00:02:59.709> with<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.430> seven-week

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
provide a light source we know that

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.599 
provide a light source we know that
stink<00:03:39.730> bugs<00:03:39.970> are<00:03:40.150> attracted<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:41.319> lights<00:03:42.100> so

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
stink bugs are attracted to lights so

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.240 
stink bugs are attracted to lights so
inside<00:03:43.420> at<00:03:43.870> night<00:03:44.139> when<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> other<00:03:44.950> lights

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.300 
inside at night when the other lights
are<00:03:45.489> off<00:03:45.639> it<00:03:46.299> makes<00:03:46.540> sense<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.139> stink<00:03:48.130> bugs

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
are off it makes sense that stink bugs

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.330 
are off it makes sense that stink bugs
would<00:03:48.489> be<00:03:48.609> attracted<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.329> this<00:03:49.450> trap<00:03:49.840> based<00:03:50.590> on

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
would be attracted to this trap based on

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.699 
would be attracted to this trap based on
the<00:03:51.730> fact<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.359> the<00:03:52.720> pheromone<00:03:53.200> lures<00:03:53.470> are

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
the fact that the pheromone lures are

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.740 
the fact that the pheromone lures are
inside<00:03:54.099> and<00:03:54.430> also<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.880> fact<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.540> would

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
inside and also the fact that it would

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.030 
inside and also the fact that it would
be<00:03:55.930> lit<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.910> what<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:57.940> thought<00:03:58.180> I'd<00:03:58.359> do<00:03:58.599> is

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
be lit so what I thought I'd do is

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.150 
be lit so what I thought I'd do is
secure<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.190> to<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:01.060> branch<00:04:01.660> of<00:04:02.019> this<00:04:02.319> tree

just<00:04:06.160> with<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.489> twisties

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.500 

and<00:04:10.610> we'll<00:04:11.180> let<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.390> hang<00:04:11.720> here<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:13.240> we<00:04:14.240> will

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
and we'll let it hang here and we will

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.690 
and we'll let it hang here and we will
keep<00:04:14.690> an<00:04:14.930> eye<00:04:15.080> on<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.530> I'll<00:04:15.680> be<00:04:16.130> sure<00:04:16.340> to<00:04:16.370> check

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
keep an eye on it I'll be sure to check

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.560 
keep an eye on it I'll be sure to check
it<00:04:16.820> every<00:04:16.910> day<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:19.090> we<00:04:20.090> will<00:04:20.239> let<00:04:20.420> you<00:04:20.540> know
