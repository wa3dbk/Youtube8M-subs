00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
wasn't all that risky but at least the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.210 
wasn't all that risky but at least the
tunes<00:03:48.780> were<00:03:48.990> a<00:03:49.050> bit<00:03:49.260> catchy<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:49.800> all<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220
