00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
self-explanatory this is a rushing class

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.370 
self-explanatory this is a rushing class
light<00:02:46.450> weight<00:02:46.630> it's<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:46.930> gonna<00:02:47.050> make<00:02:47.230> us

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
light weight it's just gonna make us

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.320 
light weight it's just gonna make us
move<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.680> lot<00:02:47.950> quicker<00:02:48.190> especially<00:02:48.670> with<00:02:49.270> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
move a lot quicker especially with the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.880 
move a lot quicker especially with the
submachine<00:02:49.840> gun<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.170> allows<00:02:50.530> us<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.800> move

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
submachine gun it allows us to move

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.770 
submachine gun it allows us to move
faster<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.430> low-profile<00:02:52.300> so<00:02:52.330> we<00:02:52.600> can<00:02:52.690> be

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
faster and low-profile so we can be

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.570 
faster and low-profile so we can be
invisible<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.260> UAVs<00:02:53.620> track<00:02:53.860> arounds<00:02:54.130> an<00:02:54.220> EXO
