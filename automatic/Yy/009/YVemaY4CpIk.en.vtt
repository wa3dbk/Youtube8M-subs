00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.719
 hello dear friends with you today 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:11.309
 simple is not the topic of today's discussion 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.330
 how economical is the installation 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.150
 gas equipment 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.160
 I specifically do my duty in the program 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 especially as electronic tables 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 you for what you see you can 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.050
 download it at the link below 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.359
 accordingly now try with 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.090
 using her to count and see 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 how much does it make sense 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 installation of such equipment 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.309
 why I decided the plan was on installation 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.589
 I have long talked about this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:47.010
 the only thing that happened before 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.589
 before that, however, we did not wish 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 finance now 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.100
 used to brush right decision then what 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.070
 install and if weekly gas 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.339
 turnover was worth 24,000 could average 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.939
 put on the Samara regions then 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.299
 Now prices have risen and 25 and 27 and 29 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:08.400
 there is even why we will consider today 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.220
 all the same expediency there such 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.670
 turnover and then every man for himself 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 will decide it is worth putting such 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.710
 back or not what i did here here in 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 let us not this box 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.859
 the quality of what you catch a couple of dirty tricks 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.990
 we have a car mileage in 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.329
 thousands of kilometers respectively here 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.869
 on fuel costs of gasoline and 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.499
 gas 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.079
 they are based on fuel consumption per 100 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:43.200
 kilometers and consequently the prices prices 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.090
 on gasoline and gas and afterwards from above 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.270
 the price of gas equipment itself 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.720
 dependences who stand up stand here 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.330
 here is this tick sign and total 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.049
 total, that is, in this column will be 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.759
 be considered just how profitable for them 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.750
 unfavorable further in 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.750
 the decree is equipped there are a number 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.459
 additional then which I think that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.620
 worth including in costs because it 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.180
 not standard equipment usually long 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.819
 in any keys will be against will 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.850
 it is not necessary to pass here yet 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.000
 undergo addition for gas filter replacement 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.110
 but if you eat yours yours 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.100
 respectively here on every ten 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:34.910
 thousands still one and a half thousand is added 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:38.010
 The past is well that prices are equipped 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.959
 By the way, I was looking for a company that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.280
 I put at a discount and did not find 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:47.670
 so I will put completely for 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.680
 the full amount is well further out and on will 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.720
 keep track of our not nickname we will 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.680
 telling what we got to 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.299
 turned out and so the price of a turnover of 26,000 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.760
 There are 25 well there in a number of requirements 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.360
 we pushes more spray can 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.070
 it turns out 26 to see us immediately minutes 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.049
 twenty six thousand seeing nothing 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.500
 drove because the price of fuel prices 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.090
 2 it is necessary and already immediately calculate the minus 26 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.549
 . 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.930
 price for 1 liter of petrol today in our 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:23.050
 region 32 rubles per 1 thread and 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.790
 cool here the price of gas still show 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.580
 help his veteran lyamchik 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.360
 the price for gas is now 17 new 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.720
 18 will be the remote control and 18 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.880
 average fuel consumption of 9 liters we 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.340
 we get that after twenty thousand 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:45.520
 considering even that 2 who we are, we begin 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.610
 already saving fuel accordingly 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.900
 we leave on the level the same 26 pieces 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.640
 Well, as if earned 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.580
 speaking roughly forty-two thousand 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.860
 broke for the owners in whom who 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.460
 10-15 mileage harness of course it is true 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.400
 I have a car for another year 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.040
 already 23 hectares of walking respectively end 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.670
 almost 30 years will be respectively for 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.490
 me this is such an essential question or 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.410
 what am I going to let's play with numbers 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.040
 I would also add here 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.380
 gas we have a little fuel consumption 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.580
 more but the usual a little bit more here 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.000
 there is a gasoline 9 by the way in the winter even 10 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.010
 liters more consumption 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.120
 Accordingly, the higher the level 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:40.390
 payback and here I would add more 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:45.940
 so plus 10 plus 20 percent to the expense 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:47.970
 gas, that is, we need to add more 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.540
 it's better flow 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.550
 t t t t t t t t t t let's do so 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.730
 on gas 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.730
 here here we do gas consumption 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:11.680
 equals this number plus 20 percent 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:16.540
 men on the same number here that is if 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:19.840
 put here 9 there be 208 and here 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.710
 here is the place here these tsiferki 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.990
 green little 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.410
 fuel consumption per 100 kilometers 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:30.370
 on gas, we just put this stage 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:38.530
 tsiferku here and, respectively, and 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:41.490
 I'll duplicate here 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.870
 the picture will be more correct i 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:48.090
 suppose 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:51.460
 here is the payback period of 25 thousand mileage 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.250
 so here we have got that is 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.830
 not to disguise not to say something 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.330
 there very quickly pays for 25,000 from 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.070
 normal services there when its time 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.590
 when I put on the Volga term there 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.960
 payback was 70,000 mileage because 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.539
 that the price for gas was worth 7 rubles in my 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.319
 gasoline 15 but almost born malika 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:16.509
 again who rides me his stupa and there 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:22.069
 that will be more fun but if you have an expense 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:23.720
 smaller for example 8 by the way is very possible 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:24.889
 pull if you have about 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.819
 machine has 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:32.229
 it can be put there grow 2 liters but 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:36.050
 term of 16 thousand if you remains tha on 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:39.319
 consumption of 22 liters, respectively, here 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:43.550
 general conversation even carry anything because 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:44.860
 that the general ball is such a file 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.860
 you right now throw off 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.800
 use consider see how much 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.349
 it will be convenient for you i will try to fill it in 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.580
 online we get a generally great 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:59.150
 thank you for your attention 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:03.200
 our calculation myself saturday 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.730
 December 6 going to put so Goble 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.010
 that subscribe to our channel follow 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.710
 for the news of which we will have everything 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.820
 it will turn out we are with you was evgeny 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.820
 simple opinion so far
