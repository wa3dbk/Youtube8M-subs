00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.950
 besides seeing 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.019
 brought a new product that I'm sure 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.970
 will fascinate you but when you 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.250
 is projecting the theme homes 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.110
 grills and everything else was something that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 Sometimes you had to hide it because it was a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.519
 maybe dirty messy place with this 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.860
 that we are going to present to you that you have to 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.500
 see with the construction industry 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.070
 this are finished products to look 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.529
 designed and with perfect use 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.410
 about pins were with Miguel 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.040
 they come to occupy an empty niche until today 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 empty look carefully and look over 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.050
 all the images 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.050
 let's go with Miguel 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.080
 good miguel to see contame that is 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.750
 grills pointed out what a beautiful question 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 pins to point is the creation of the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.580
 passion and the inspiration of the owners 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.710
 from saturday to glock to that is a 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.989
 metallurgical of great Buenos Aires 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.790
 Lomas de Zamora, which was founded 40 years ago 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.950
 years by thrown another parent or fell and his 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.710
 sons rafael and gerardo take them 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.170
 go forward very successfully because they use 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.600
 cutting edge technologies and so on and I say the 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.009
 passion because these creators of this of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.640
 these grills are the owners themselves 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.740
 Saturday for crazy people who love 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.830
 meet friends make meals 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.899
 cook and it 's that passion to cook them 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.580
 thus leading to design a system of 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.100
 doers that is much more than a 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.380
 grill is a cooking center because 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.630
 you can cook what you like there 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.970
 is you can cook meats you can cook 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.130
 types of meat like fish you can 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.320
 cooking vegetables you can cook paellas 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.470
 and be able to cook 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.150
 until grilled pizzas that is to say one 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.100
 when you think about all of that, I already know 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.220
 is making your mouth water this is 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.380
 really a very good cooking center 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.380
 when I see him as a professional I see 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.300
 that have occupied a niche until today are 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.790
 occupied by nobody but they have also 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.880
 solved a problem for both 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.550
 client as for the professional yes yes 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.610
 I believe that yes this has been designed with 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.990
 a very high quality level is thinking 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.330
 in the final client but also 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.950
 thinking about the intermediate agent that is 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.010
 the professional the architect the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.020
 builder who often wants 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.120
 bring the latest technology to your 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.430
 customers and through this that we 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.150
 we do with a very complete instructions 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.680
 with a series of elements that allow 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.540
 complement and even using 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.930
 technology like autocad or cut cam 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.489
 the architect can accompany this 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.470
 within their works and make a good 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.390
 recommendation for the client to have 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.630
 a proper grill system 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.340
 we only have two ways to sell it one 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.069
 which is the premium system that in 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.469
 reality is something strictly tailored 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.560
 of the plan that the client possesses of what 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.870
 wants to discover and then from 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.719
 all that creation were designed the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.329
 modular systems in measures of 150 150 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:01.269
 180 and 210 that although they are not exactly 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.370
 the measure adapt to that kind of this 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.889
 space that the client has available 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.560
 with the same product quality with the 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.269
 same completion of works very well I 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.340
 I imagine that is already reducing 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.590
 costs is already reducing time today 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.599
 clearly reduces costs not only in 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.120
 regarding the material because it has 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.760
 industrialized but that facilitates a lot 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.870
 the installation through a system of 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.870
 installation of pre frames both in the 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.090
 hollow from the hunter's part itself as 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.230
 in the low one one arrives with the system 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.030
 Modular can install it and 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.489
 perfectly has it at noon 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.919
 working without problems well we are 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.409
 watching images of grills with steel 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.329
 stainless with cast iron to see 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:42.280
 what are those are the big two 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.260
 are in the variants are those not 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.840
 we believe that inflexible is a thing 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.699
 very noble very very clean and on the other hand 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.349
 we do not stop addressing the iron issue 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.200
 because we have to try to follow the 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.110
 architectural styles of each 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.450
 iron to be painted after to BE ABLE 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.099
 give a finish on the finish that 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.650
 one wants good that's going to allow 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.349
 maintain the architectural style of the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.440
 work in question in good question 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.480
 aesthetically about nice if 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.610
 really people call your attention 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.430
 this we all like and well as I say 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.410
 it was thought it was done and it's still 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.380
 permanently improved because the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.260
 combination of doing the firewood with some 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.639
 gas module also allows this and 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.430
 I say this especially for the 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.260
 Ladies, this is to prevent you from having 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.690
 to be in the kitchen and inside this 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.250
 cooking center without odors in its 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.530
 kitchen the husband can help her 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.419
 cooking other kinds of things this 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.389
 they will come out very rich also good and 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.300
 what makes today the holy faith good we 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.050
 we designed a few months ago with 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.900
 the owners of the company a program of 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.550
 support and development to distributors 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.040
 the distributors that like in this case 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.690
 besides, it is a company that already 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.150
 know with a shoe for I think it does 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.860
 weather 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.200
 and that are very representative for 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.510
 us in santa fe 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.950
 has the exclusive distribution are the 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.800
 only ones that are going to market this type 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.110
 of products but we thought that in addition 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.510
 of doing fairs and exhibitions we had 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.950
 that we approach personally to know 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.450
 each of the places understand the 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.760
 culture and understand the need for 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.350
 sector that's why we designed this 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.170
 program of visits and I am in charge 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.030
 of them and I'm walking inside 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.860
 of the country in different cities and in this 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.450
 opportunity have the pleasure and taste 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.690
 be here in santa fe with the friends of 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.690
 to assemble
