00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
out great wasn't a great week for me but

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310 
out great wasn't a great week for me but
that<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.030> nice<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.600> finish<00:00:48.719> up<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> week

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
with the Steelers with that amount of

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.970 
with the Steelers with that amount of
rest<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.600> always<00:00:51.840> liked<00:00:52.020> Mike<00:00:52.260> Tomlin<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.800> Ben

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
Roethlisberger under the primetime

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
Roethlisberger under the primetime
lights<00:00:54.899> as<00:00:55.140> an<00:00:55.260> underdog<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.309> got<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
lights as an underdog and they got the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.540 
lights as an underdog and they got the
job<00:00:56.850> done<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.420> thought<00:00:57.570> Karen<00:00:58.020> Carolina<00:00:58.620> after

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
job done I thought Karen Carolina after

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
job done I thought Karen Carolina after
maybe<00:00:59.879> being<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> little<00:01:00.300> bit<00:01:00.600> undervalued

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
maybe being a little bit undervalued

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.020 
maybe being a little bit undervalued
early<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> season<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.670> probably<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
early in the season was probably a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
early in the season was probably a
little<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.300> overrated<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.320> game<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
little bit overrated in that game I

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.140 
little bit overrated in that game I
didn't<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:05.400> deserve<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> three

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
didn't think they deserve to be a three

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.820 
didn't think they deserve to be a three
and<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.299> half<00:01:06.330> point<00:01:06.720> favorite<00:01:07.170> sure<00:01:07.619> enough

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and a half point favorite sure enough

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.740 
and a half point favorite sure enough
Pittsburgh<00:01:08.610> gets<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> victory<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.540> think

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
Pittsburgh gets the victory but I think

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.380 
Pittsburgh gets the victory but I think
this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> good<00:01:10.229> spot<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:11.640> Ravens<00:01:12.060> here

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
this is a good spot for the Ravens here

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.050 
this is a good spot for the Ravens here
who<00:01:13.049> were<00:01:13.140> again<00:01:13.439> off<00:01:13.619> 10<00:01:13.860> days<00:01:14.070> rest<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.549> now

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
who were again off 10 days rest and now

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.609 
who were again off 10 days rest and now
Carolina<00:01:15.540> has<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> road<00:01:16.380> they've

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
Carolina has to go on the road they've

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.499 
Carolina has to go on the road they've
played<00:01:16.860> what<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> three<00:01:18.030> games<00:01:18.060> at

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
played what two out of three games at

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.450 
played what two out of three games at
home<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> other<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.250> not

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
home and I think the other one was not

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
home and I think the other one was not
far<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:20.970> home<00:01:21.210> at<00:01:21.450> Tampa<00:01:21.750> Bay<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.500> now

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
far from home at Tampa Bay so now

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.980 
far from home at Tampa Bay so now
they're<00:01:23.040> going<00:01:23.220> out<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> whole<00:01:24.299> new<00:01:24.570> set<00:01:24.960> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
against Pittsburgh but you know I think

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.660 
against Pittsburgh but you know I think
that<00:02:33.450> was<00:02:33.570> more<00:02:33.810> Pittsburgh<00:02:34.670> Carolina's

a defensive team for many years so I

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.360 
a defensive team for many years so I
think<00:02:43.260> that's<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.530> possibility<00:02:44.270> and<00:02:45.270> then<00:02:46.370> gosh

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
think that's a possibility and then gosh

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.830 
think that's a possibility and then gosh
losing<00:02:47.790> my<00:02:47.910> train<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.150> thought<00:02:48.270> here<00:02:48.570> but<00:02:48.750> you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
before it goes 2-3 and a half I really

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.140 
before it goes 2-3 and a half I really
feel<00:03:52.800> it's<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> right<00:03:53.070> side<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.610> what<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.910> not

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150

a<00:03:54.180> good<00:03:54.450> spot<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.170> power<00:03:55.350> ratings<00:03:55.860> I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
a good spot but the power ratings I

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.340 
a good spot but the power ratings I
think<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.580> absolutely<00:03:57.120> dominate<00:03:57.720> here<00:03:57.959> for

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
think just absolutely dominate here for

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
Carolina's defense who I think is going

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.700 
Carolina's defense who I think is going
to<00:04:20.820> continue<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.299> show<00:04:21.600> up<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.530> brought

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
up the under I mean that that might be

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.950 
up the under I mean that that might be
an<00:04:24.390> angle<00:04:24.720> for

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
an angle for

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.930 
an angle for
that<00:04:25.050> one<00:04:25.259> there<00:04:25.440> Baltimore's<00:04:26.039> offense<00:04:26.460> shaky

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
that one there Baltimore's offense shaky

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
Carolina's defense good may not get a

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.529 
Carolina's defense good may not get a
lot<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.160> scoring<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.639> this<00:04:29.729> game<00:04:29.789> my<00:04:30.389> only

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
when you take a look at this division i

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.710

think<00:05:02.610> since<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:02.970> is<00:05:03.090> really<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.419> only<00:05:03.509> team

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
think since that is really the only team

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.749 
think since that is really the only team
we<00:05:03.840> can<00:05:03.960> agree<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.199> has<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:05.039> pretty<00:05:05.669> good

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
we can agree that has a pretty good

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.060 
we can agree that has a pretty good
offense<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.330> go<00:05:06.449> along<00:05:06.660> with<00:05:06.690> that<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.199> makes<00:05:07.949> a

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
offense to go along with that so makes a

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.740 
offense to go along with that so makes a
lot<00:05:08.190> of<00:05:08.220> sense<00:05:08.340> as<00:05:08.849> long<00:05:09.000> as<00:05:09.030> we<00:05:09.150> got<00:05:09.240> aj<00:05:09.539> green
