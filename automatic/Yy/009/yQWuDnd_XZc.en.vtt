00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
in their next line of macbook pros that

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
technology appears ready to go so I

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.789 
technology appears ready to go so I
would<00:03:48.090> really<00:03:48.690> think<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.139> we<00:03:49.290> will<00:03:49.410> see<00:03:49.650> an

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
update to the macbook pro I would say

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.259 
update to the macbook pro I would say
within<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.349> month<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:53.519> then<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:53.760> next<00:03:53.910> four

I<00:05:12.680> don't<00:05:13.340> think<00:05:13.370> Apple<00:05:13.700> is<00:05:13.760> going<00:05:13.790> to<00:05:13.940> take

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
I don't think Apple is going to take

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.460 
I don't think Apple is going to take
that<00:05:14.180> lying<00:05:14.360> down<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.600> think<00:05:14.750> we<00:05:14.960> are<00:05:15.140> going<00:05:15.350> to

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
that lying down I think we are going to

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.900 
that lying down I think we are going to
see<00:05:15.650> an<00:05:15.740> update<00:05:16.040> to<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.220> macbook<00:05:16.610> air<00:05:16.790> and

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
see an update to the macbook air and

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.890 
see an update to the macbook air and
this<00:05:16.970> is<00:05:17.090> one<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.360> computers<00:05:17.750> where<00:05:17.870> I

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
this is one of the computers where I

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.510 
this is one of the computers where I
think<00:05:18.110> we<00:05:18.200> are<00:05:18.350> going<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.830> full<00:05:19.190> page

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
think we are going to see a full page

think we are going to see a full page
redesign<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.360> don't<00:05:21.080> think<00:05:21.320> any<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.680> other

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
redesign I don't think any of the other

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.230 
redesign I don't think any of the other
models<00:05:22.190> are<00:05:22.280> going<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.490> see<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.640> complete

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
models are going to see a complete

models are going to see a complete
redesign<00:05:23.420> other<00:05:24.410> than<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.130> macbook<00:05:25.640> air<00:05:25.910> and

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
redesign other than the macbook air and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.850 
redesign other than the macbook air and
it<00:05:26.120> will<00:05:26.270> probably<00:05:26.480> see<00:05:26.750> an<00:05:26.840> extra<00:05:27.110> USB<00:05:27.230> port

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
it will probably see an extra USB port

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.640 
it will probably see an extra USB port
and<00:05:28.010> definitely<00:05:28.970> a<00:05:29.060> slimmed-down<00:05:29.660> desire<00:05:30.410> to

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
and definitely a slimmed-down desire to

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.770 
and definitely a slimmed-down desire to
keep<00:05:30.830> up<00:05:31.070> with<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.520> adamo<00:05:31.790> XPS<00:05:31.910> which<00:05:32.600> took

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
keep up with the adamo XPS which took

keep up with the adamo XPS which took
the<00:05:32.930> crown<00:05:33.140> is<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.470> world's<00:05:33.740> thinnest<00:05:34.010> laptop

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
the crown is the world's thinnest laptop

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.840 
the crown is the world's thinnest laptop
we<00:05:35.270> may<00:05:35.420> see<00:05:35.480> a<00:05:35.750> maybe<00:05:36.260> a<00:05:36.380> core<00:05:36.920> i3<00:05:37.430> chip<00:05:37.700> in

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
we may see a maybe a core i3 chip in

we may see a maybe a core i3 chip in
there<00:05:38.030> or<00:05:38.300> maybe<00:05:38.930> a<00:05:39.080> more<00:05:39.230> powerful<00:05:39.470> ultra<00:05:40.220> low

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
there or maybe a more powerful ultra low

gigs<00:05:43.580> of<00:05:43.730> RAM<00:05:43.910> perhaps<00:05:44.690> a<00:05:44.870> reduced<00:05:45.200> cost<00:05:45.260> and<00:05:45.830> a

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
gigs of RAM perhaps a reduced cost and a

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.920 
gigs of RAM perhaps a reduced cost and a
little<00:05:46.820> bit<00:05:46.910> better<00:05:47.000> performance<00:05:47.600> overall

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
little bit better performance overall

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.170

I'm<00:05:48.890> a<00:05:48.980> big<00:05:49.160> fan<00:05:49.310> of<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.490> macbook<00:05:49.820> air<00:05:49.970> and<00:05:50.150> I

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
I'm a big fan of the macbook air and I

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.430 
I'm a big fan of the macbook air and I
think<00:05:50.450> that<00:05:50.570> wants<00:05:50.750> to<00:05:50.840> get<00:05:50.960> an<00:05:51.110> upgrade<00:05:51.260> to

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
think that wants to get an upgrade to

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.490 
think that wants to get an upgrade to
that<00:05:51.800> that<00:05:52.700> may<00:05:52.880> become<00:05:53.300> my<00:05:53.330> laptop<00:05:54.020> of<00:05:54.200> choice

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
that that may become my laptop of choice

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.320 
that that may become my laptop of choice
