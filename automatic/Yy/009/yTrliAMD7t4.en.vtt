like it flexes better and is easier to
slip<00:01:54.530> on<00:01:54.770> so<00:01:55.640> here<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:56.030> see<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.510> got<00:01:56.690> a

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
slip on so here you can see it's got a

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.170 
slip on so here you can see it's got a
clean<00:01:57.020> finish<00:01:57.470> this<00:01:57.650> is<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.860> soft<00:01:58.280> touch<00:01:58.580> finish
