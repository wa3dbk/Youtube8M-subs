00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.750
 This is the entrepreneur state 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.040
 family signed themselves at sbs 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.040
 ten years 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:11.289
 in other states 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.599
 are players 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.509
 grandmaster 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.890
 there saw 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.380
 trade unions ab 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.220
 they start with nothing 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.220
 been a while like this 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.399
 the building plans of a building 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:27.499
 during the game 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:28.979
 first areas 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:30.439
 to conquer 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.789
 they must forbid 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.440
 to buy 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.820
 can continue to fall that way 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.220
 also unload a building 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.060
 and the goal is ultimately 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.740
 if you are during the first instance it is not 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.690
 the building blocks is the fifteenth time 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.050
 stick there 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.399
 we live in the municipality 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.970
 enschede 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 With that they can share their findings 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.250
 but turn 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 the intention is to have five players on one of the players 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 so we are then 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.480
 this has 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.500
 then it's over 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.950
 in a different city 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.830
 different things happen 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.920
 so you can 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 see you in a different color 6 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.780
 where they just 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.370
 then you can be the superpower 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.020
 city ​​buildings 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.470
 you can get the wholesale 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.910
 if you all because if you have someone who 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.240
 placed as 12 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.430
 so one for every superpower happens 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.920
 from neurons counts 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.170
 building where also the art of others on a free market or the property's house 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.590
 to sell 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.530
 the most influential and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.450
 that they no longer take to the streets 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.970
 anything can happen there 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.220
 game rules 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.750
 between 60 and 90 minutes 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.260
 for the grand masters will try to balance the interests of each other 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.890
 another city has won the Dutch game prize for the year 2005 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.360
 in style for everyone 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.260
 have fun with other people's money
