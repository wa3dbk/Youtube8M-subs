at this volume the key is down to

absolute logistical precision each car
is<00:02:22.930> different<00:02:23.260> each<00:02:24.220> tire<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:25.150> each<00:02:25.390> wheel

is different each tire and each wheel

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
is different each tire and each wheel
for<00:02:26.170> example<00:02:26.220> has<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> different<00:02:27.850> size<00:02:28.120> and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
for example has a different size and

for example has a different size and
therefore<00:02:29.770> it's<00:02:30.100> necessary<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:31.360> build<00:02:31.660> the

therefore it's necessary to build the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.550 
therefore it's necessary to build the
right<00:02:32.590> wheel<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.910> right<00:02:34.150> car<00:02:34.480> at<00:02:34.930> the

right wheel for the right car at the

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
right time in the right place yeah with

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.580 
right time in the right place yeah with
the<00:02:38.800> right<00:02:38.980> quality<00:02:39.840> sometimes<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.020> sounds<00:02:41.230> so

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
the right quality sometimes it sounds so

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.130 
the right quality sometimes it sounds so
easy<00:02:41.620> yeah<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:42.730> it's<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.150> real<00:02:43.360> challenge<00:02:43.390> each

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
easy yeah but it's a real challenge each

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.229 
easy yeah but it's a real challenge each
day<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.800> music<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.520> know<00:02:45.910> people

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
day it's like music you know people

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.180 
day it's like music you know people
think<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:46.660> easy<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.110> write<00:02:47.290> simple<00:02:47.650> songs

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
think it's easy to write simple songs

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.729 
think it's easy to write simple songs
and<00:02:49.060> they're<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.360> most<00:02:49.480> difficult<00:02:49.870> songs<00:02:50.440> to

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
and they're the most difficult songs to

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.729 
and they're the most difficult songs to
write<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.459> I'm<00:02:51.640> sure<00:02:51.850> dr.<00:02:52.320> Ferdinand<00:02:53.320> Porsche

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
write and I'm sure dr. Ferdinand Porsche

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.759 
write and I'm sure dr. Ferdinand Porsche
would<00:02:54.160> have<00:02:54.280> been<00:02:54.430> proud<00:02:54.820> even<00:02:55.209> him<00:02:55.660> who<00:02:56.590> was<00:02:56.739> a
