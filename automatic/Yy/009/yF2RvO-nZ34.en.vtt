00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.810 
ultra-low noise the thing that really
got<00:00:54.120> me<00:00:54.270> excited<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.640> optional<00:00:56.640> AC

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
got me excited was the optional AC

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.660 
got me excited was the optional AC
adapter<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.289> pretty<00:00:58.469> bummed<00:00:58.770> about<00:00:58.980> PB

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
adapter and I was pretty bummed about PB

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.389 
adapter and I was pretty bummed about PB
not<00:01:00.300> including<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> unfeeling<00:01:01.890> HD

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
not including it with the unfeeling HD

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.520 
not including it with the unfeeling HD
and<00:01:03.530> if<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.489> wanted<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.990> have<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.170> purchase

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and if you wanted you have to purchase

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.990 
and if you wanted you have to purchase
it<00:01:08.070> separately<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:10.260> costs<00:01:10.680> around<00:01:10.860> $30<00:01:11.760> so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
it separately and it costs around $30 so

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.109 
it separately and it costs around $30 so
yeah<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.760> would<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:14.939> been<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
yeah just I think it would have been a

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.020 
yeah just I think it would have been a
better<00:01:15.360> deal<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.380> included<00:01:16.790> but<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
better deal if it was included but you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.649 
better deal if it was included but you
know<00:01:18.299> companies<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.380> their<00:01:19.560> own<00:01:19.619> thing<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.659> now

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
know companies do their own thing so now

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.950 
know companies do their own thing so now

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
TV sticker that I thought it was a nice

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.880 
TV sticker that I thought it was a nice
touch<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.700> include<00:01:48.409> like<00:01:49.409> any<00:01:49.710> other

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
companies for example Apple Alice has

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.289 
companies for example Apple Alice has
stickers<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.950> her<00:01:56.070> products<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.030> thought

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
stickers with her products so I thought

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
stickers with her products so I thought
it<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.750> nice<00:01:58.070> alright<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.280> let<00:01:59.610> me

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it was really nice alright now let me

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.050 
it was really nice alright now let me
move<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> box<00:02:00.420> outside<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.640> let's<00:02:02.909> talk

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
move the box outside and now let's talk

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.289 
move the box outside and now let's talk
about<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.479> amp<00:02:03.659> kit<00:02:03.840> itself<00:02:05.030> because<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
about the amp kit itself because of the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.690 
about the amp kit itself because of the
size<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.320> amp<00:02:07.500> kit<00:02:08.060> it's<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.360> small<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.700> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
size of the amp kit it's so small and it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.730 
size of the amp kit it's so small and it
doesn't<00:02:11.879> weigh<00:02:12.300> anything<00:02:12.660> at<00:02:12.870> all

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
doesn't weigh anything at all

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.500 
doesn't weigh anything at all
makes<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.100> portable<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.820> easier<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.270> carry

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
makes it portable and easier to carry

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.190 
makes it portable and easier to carry
around<00:02:15.740> when<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.860> travel<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:17.610> when<00:02:18.200> your
