food and for sale skill moves which I

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.500 
food and for sale skill moves which I
think<00:04:27.710> he<00:04:27.800> should<00:04:27.950> have<00:04:28.190> five<00:04:28.790> star<00:04:29.120> weak<00:04:29.270> foot

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.910 
think he should have five star weak foot
because<00:04:29.720> his<00:04:29.840> left<00:04:30.050> foot<00:04:30.200> is<00:04:30.350> absolutely

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
because his left foot is absolutely

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.980 
because his left foot is absolutely
amazing<00:04:31.280> in<00:04:31.670> real<00:04:31.970> life<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.450> let's<00:04:32.840> have<00:04:32.960> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
in fact chemistry and I think if you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.070 
in fact chemistry and I think if you
change<00:04:51.830> my<00:04:52.040> Jewish<00:04:52.250> position<00:04:53.090> from<00:04:53.210> cam2cam

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080

you go to 97 but I think our debt has
got<00:04:56.660> seven<00:04:57.050> chemistry<00:04:57.500> because<00:04:57.650> he<00:04:58.100> pays<00:04:58.340> for

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
got seven chemistry because he pays for
