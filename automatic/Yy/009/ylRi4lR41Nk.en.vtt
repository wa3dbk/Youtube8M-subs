00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.099
 All colors that come to be found eventually or at least for fear 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:14.779
 of course 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.269
 and everyone has their own way to make our clothes dirty 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.230
 I am standing here on the bike cross track the low mare of every healthy mother 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.540
 we are again 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.410

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.700

 sinking and that may also be blood but I am not 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.170
 per year you use around 17 kilos of detergent per person 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.570
 and they all unfortunately end up in nature 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.130
 the good news 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.159
 the environmental impact of detergents 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.159
 has fortunately declined in recent years 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 we have chosen these three detergents and those are for a start 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.310
 the ruby ​​radiant white washing powder 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.330

 Must meet the Mongolian in the Himalayas and the sea flows in Saponin 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.580
 now only hope that our back then did not do their best 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.870
 that is the manual 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.000
 you need the four or five of those guys you need in 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.060
 the documents that are with him 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.210

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:03.630

 what do you find important 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.899
 when it was a little not too much to use 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.449
 second that it work 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.889

 novum four people 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.419
 much more benefits 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.339
 so probably less sopot 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.949
 but it is very special that it looks like it looks good 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.949
 feet 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.250

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.589
 the cells was needed 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.229
 although feyenoord 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:49.339

 that's it a garage in Brussels 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.999

 won by women 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.039
