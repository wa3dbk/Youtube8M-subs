able to just roll it up there without a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.000 
able to just roll it up there without a
whole<00:00:34.980> lot<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.280> effort<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.680> if<00:00:37.680> something

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
whole lot of effort and if something

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
whole lot of effort and if something
happens<00:00:38.040> then<00:00:38.579> it'll<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.450> even<00:00:39.660> more

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
happens then it'll be an even more

00:00:39.809 --> 00:01:32.219 
happens then it'll be an even more
interesting<00:00:40.079> video

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.480 

well<00:01:33.229> as<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.470> can<00:01:33.619> see<00:01:33.799> I<00:01:33.829> really<00:01:34.100> didn't<00:01:34.340> need

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
well as you can see I really didn't need

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.980 
well as you can see I really didn't need
the<00:01:34.610> other<00:01:34.729> plank<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.329> bed<00:01:35.630> was<00:01:35.810> low<00:01:35.960> enough

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
the other plank the bed was low enough

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.929 
the other plank the bed was low enough
that<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.469> could<00:01:36.530> just<00:01:36.770> push<00:01:37.250> it<00:01:37.369> up<00:01:37.460> most<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.850> the

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
that I could just push it up most of the

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.690 
that I could just push it up most of the
way<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.240> then<00:01:38.840> hop<00:01:39.049> up<00:01:39.340> but<00:01:40.340> what<00:01:40.520> really

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
way and then hop up but what really

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.690 
way and then hop up but what really
helped<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.179> situation<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:43.130> long<00:01:43.369> boards

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.029 

since<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.880> incline<00:01:50.240> wasn't<00:01:50.659> very<00:01:50.780> steep<00:01:51.170> it

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
since the incline wasn't very steep it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.859 
since the incline wasn't very steep it
was<00:01:52.189> really<00:01:52.429> easy<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.789> push<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.240> bike<00:01:53.390> up<00:01:53.600> into

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
was really easy to push the bike up into

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.710 
was really easy to push the bike up into
the<00:01:53.960> truck<00:01:56.229> thanks<00:01:57.229> for<00:01:57.350> watching
