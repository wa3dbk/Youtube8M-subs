00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
in Southern California's where I did

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.679 
in Southern California's where I did
most<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.810> hunting<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.609> since<00:00:24.510> I've

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
most of my hunting and then since I've

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.980 
most of my hunting and then since I've
lived<00:00:25.289> out<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.680> east<00:00:25.800> valley<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.990> about

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
lived out in the east valley for about

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.150 
lived out in the east valley for about
two<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> half<00:00:28.289> years<00:00:28.590> I've<00:00:28.769> been<00:00:28.800> working

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
two and a half years I've been working

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.630 
two and a half years I've been working
to<00:00:29.250> try<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> get<00:00:30.560> Fox<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.800> active<00:00:32.189> up<00:00:32.340> out

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
to try to get Fox have active up out

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
to try to get Fox have active up out
here<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.880> guess<00:00:33.120> actually<00:00:33.809> it's<00:00:33.930> active<00:00:34.290> again

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
here I guess actually it's active again

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.830 
here I guess actually it's active again
because<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.950> used<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.489> fairly<00:00:35.850> active<00:00:36.270> of

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because it used to be fairly active of

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.490 
because it used to be fairly active of
it<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.079> since<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.559> died<00:00:37.739> down<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.320> goal

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

normal yeah II like you XD for pretty
frequency<00:02:16.410> 2<00:02:16.560> meters<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.950> what<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.430> for

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
frequency 2 meters is what this one for

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.590 
frequency 2 meters is what this one for
let's<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:20.330> 146<00:02:21.330> 420<00:02:23.300> frequency<00:02:24.300> 6<00:02:24.630> for<00:02:25.110> 20

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
let's see 146 420 frequency 6 for 20

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.520 
let's see 146 420 frequency 6 for 20
turn<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.660> volume<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.140> little<00:02:28.319> bit<00:02:28.410> it's

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
turn the volume up a little bit it's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.500 
turn the volume up a little bit it's
making<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.860> tone<00:02:29.069> if<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.850> stronger<00:02:30.269> when<00:02:30.300> I'm

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
making a tone if it is stronger when I'm

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.699 
making a tone if it is stronger when I'm
pointing<00:02:30.720> towards<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> signal<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.470> kind<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
pointing towards the signal is kind of

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.210 
pointing towards the signal is kind of
small<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.160> type<00:02:32.370> room<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.100> is

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
small in this type room that one is

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.559 
small in this type room that one is
telling<00:02:35.400> me<00:02:35.489> it's<00:02:35.580> generally<00:02:36.000> miss<00:02:36.150> Russian

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569

something that looks a lot like a

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.500 
something that looks a lot like a
transmitter<00:02:54.890> but<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.430> sure<00:02:58.300> yeah<00:02:59.300> so

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
transmitter but just to be sure yeah so

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.470 
transmitter but just to be sure yeah so
that's<00:02:59.780> definitely<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.290> on<00:03:00.410> 642<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.940> i'll

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
that's definitely the one on 642 so i'll

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.820 
that's definitely the one on 642 so i'll
press<00:03:02.750> my<00:03:02.780> luck<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.260> see<00:03:03.350> if<00:03:03.410> i<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.590> find<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
press my luck and see if i can find the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:16.660 
press my luck and see if i can find the
one<00:03:03.950> on<00:03:04.660> 6460

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.450 

I<00:03:20.600> thing<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.780> went<00:03:21.900> out<00:03:22.020> there<00:03:22.170> about<00:03:23.160> these

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
I thing just went out there about these

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:31.900 
I thing just went out there about these
things<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.820> like<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.030> 60-percent<00:03:24.780> duty<00:03:25.020> cycle

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.150 

normal<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:33.030> this<00:03:33.120> area<00:03:33.510> notorious<00:03:34.160> after

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
normal in this area notorious after

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.110 
normal in this area notorious after
hundreds<00:03:35.670> too<00:03:35.820> big<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.240> antenna<00:03:36.570> which

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
hundreds too big for this antenna which

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:47.420 
hundreds too big for this antenna which
people<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.270> just<00:03:39.480> snip<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.900> out<00:03:40.020> with<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:46.430> think

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
people can just snip it out with I think

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.840 
people can just snip it out with I think
I<00:03:47.490> see<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> little<00:03:47.970> piece<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.930> black<00:03:49.850> antenna

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850
