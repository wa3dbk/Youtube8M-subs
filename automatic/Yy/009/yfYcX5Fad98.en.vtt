00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 ah 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 hi friends with this bmw k 1600 gtl 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.939
 we are facing what is possibly the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.890
 best luxury tourism motorcycle that 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.860
 there are nowadays with the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.960
 Wave permission Goldwing 1800 and is 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.510
 for load capacity comfort and over 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 all for benefits 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.920
 and in my modest opinion the great 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.840
 protagonist this motorcycle is your motor as 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.790
 as I said in the presentation of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
 South Africa seems like a damn 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.559
 marvel this six cylinders online 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 because it is a super compact motor 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.580
 only measures 500 55 millimeters sideways 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.080
 beside what he assumes is the engine of 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.390
 Great tourism of a thousand cubic centimeters 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.720
 more compact and lightweight manufactured up to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.740
 date yields 160 horses to 7,750 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.420
 revolutions 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.420
 you will not allow me to start it 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.270
 if there is something to do well are the six 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.940
 Cylinders in line does not vibrate nothing seems 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.460
 an electric motor and the best thing is that 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.590
 yields 70 percent of its pair to so 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.620
 only 1,500 revolutions is the most engine 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.560
 Elastic that exists 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.260
 they also adopt the latest developments 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.880
 of bmw motorrad although they are not new 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.120
 exclusive of this model as are the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.100
 braking system with combined abs 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.800
 also adopts the system that of 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.510
 suspension we can choose between 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.430
 different types of cargo we both go 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.890
 alone with passenger as with suitcases 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.350
 loaded and all in regulation 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.420
 electronics has automatic control of 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.820
 cruise that is optional also has 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.680
 system to measure the pressure of the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.450
 tires that is also optional and what 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.040
 that yes that is an authentic novelty is 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.230
 who carries a driving with lights 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.810
 adaptive is also optional of such 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.880
 way in the turns in the parabola 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.440
 rotate inside the lighthouse and point them 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.600
 always the beam of light towards the site 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.200
 where it gives us better visibility 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.520
 life on board on this bike is almost 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.240
 typical of a maharajah of the tales of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.240
 a thousand and one night 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.310
 as good grand luxury tourism have 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.599
 a magnificent load capacity has 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.549
 your two suitcases that fits in cases 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.110
 integral in either of the two and a 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.290
 rear chest also of good capacity 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.560
 that here also two integral cases 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.079
 this of 93 1600 gtl is a big motorcycle 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.030
 but it is a motorcycle that weighs 348 kilos in 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.189
 Marching order not too exaggerated 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.260
 for this type of motorcycle once in 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.420
 March is handled quite easily 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.430
 and it's a more agile bike than you 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.409
 it may seem at first in our 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.480
 Operating regime is between 1,500 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.819
 and 5,000 revolutions for example to 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.579
 four thousand laps intake we go to 140 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.470
 kilometers of cruise speed something 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.970
 very normal on this type of motorcycle then 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.040
 it's not so normal anymore, with this 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.840
 engine you can go up to 8000 and in 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.040
 Straight and clear stretches of course 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.980
 No speed limit like 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.569
 German motorways can go from 250 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.299
 kilometers hour thing that in this to the 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.750
 reach of many motorcycles like propulsion 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.939
 final I will tell you that for me it is here 1600 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.439
 gtl is perhaps the only motorcycle on the market 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.840
 that is able to plant face of you to 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.430
 you to the mythical golvin maybe some 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.989
 users we expected from this 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.500
 product a bigger bike more 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.329
 majestic largest of the lords b9 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.040
 they have preferred 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.260
 make a motorbike dynamically better 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.280
 endowed with a performance first 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.900
 level are not 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.790
 if you want to know many more things 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.600
 this bike you do not have to stop reading 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.600
