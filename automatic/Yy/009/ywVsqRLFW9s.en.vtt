know<00:06:17.130> what<00:06:17.280> the<00:06:17.430> deal<00:06:17.640> is<00:06:17.670> with<00:06:17.940> these<00:06:18.120> hogs

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
know what the deal is with these hogs

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.590 
know what the deal is with these hogs
since<00:06:19.410> that's<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:19.680> only<00:06:19.830> one<00:06:19.950> I<00:06:20.010> got<00:06:20.100> on<00:06:20.310> on<00:06:20.760> on
