okay<00:00:00.810> well<00:00:01.110> the<00:00:01.410> initial<00:00:01.920> impressions<00:00:02.879> of

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay well the initial impressions of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.560 
okay well the initial impressions of
this<00:00:03.240> car<00:00:04.279> are<00:00:05.279> that<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.990> it<00:00:06.990> lacks<00:00:07.649> power<00:00:08.570> now

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
this car are that it it lacks power now

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.879 
this car are that it it lacks power now
it's<00:00:09.750> more<00:00:09.929> obvious<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.620> vehicle

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
it's more obvious for this vehicle

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.890 
it's more obvious for this vehicle
simply<00:00:11.580> because<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.059> size<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.780> mean

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
simply because of the size of it I mean

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.939 
simply because of the size of it I mean
it<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> very<00:00:13.440> large<00:00:13.679> car<00:00:15.109> but<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.710> coming

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it is a very large car but just coming

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.760 
it is a very large car but just coming
off<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> motorway<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:18.750> really<00:00:19.170> see

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
off the motorway now I can really see

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.040 
off the motorway now I can really see
how<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.609> would<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.910> important<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.750> car

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
how it would be important for this car

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.800 
how it would be important for this car
to<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> bigger<00:00:22.680> engine<00:00:23.240> it's<00:00:24.240> not<00:00:24.480> by<00:00:24.630> any

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
to have a bigger engine it's not by any

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.019 
to have a bigger engine it's not by any
means<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.619> slow<00:00:26.460> sluggish<00:00:27.240> car<00:00:28.220> but<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.640> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
means a slow sluggish car but it just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.080 
means a slow sluggish car but it just
doesn't<00:00:31.219> obvious<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> start<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
doesn't obvious from the start it's a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.299 
doesn't obvious from the start it's a
big<00:00:33.270> car<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.469> hasn't<00:00:34.649> got<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.920> big<00:00:35.100> enough

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
big car and it hasn't got a big enough

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.139 
big car and it hasn't got a big enough
engine<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.309> seems<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> struggle

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
engine it just it just seems to struggle

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
engine it just it just seems to struggle
to<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.629> get<00:00:39.809> anywhere<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.469> mean<00:00:40.649> once

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
