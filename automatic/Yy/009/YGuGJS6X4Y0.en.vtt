just like really text with this kit I've

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.810 
just like really text with this kit I've
done<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> few<00:00:43.920> other<00:00:43.980> kids<00:00:44.250> never<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.640> any

done a few other kids never had any
issue<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.300> uh<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:46.410> particular<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:46.950> been

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
issue but uh this particular one been

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
issue but uh this particular one been
kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> problem<00:00:49.640> 87<00:00:50.640> has<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.390> split<00:00:51.899> lug

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
kind of a problem 87 has the split lug

that's full-on you know Remo tech right
there<00:03:50.340> very<00:03:51.300> 80s<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:52.769> also<00:03:52.890> note<00:03:53.160> on<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> 14

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
there very 80s you also note on the 14

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.630 
there very 80s you also note on the 14
it's<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> little<00:03:54.989> bit<00:03:55.080> later<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.560> model<00:03:55.920> I

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
it's a little bit later of a model I

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.880 
it's a little bit later of a model I
think<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.480> maybe<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.900> session<00:03:58.320> series<00:03:58.680> or

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
think it's maybe the session series or

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
think it's maybe the session series or
the<00:03:58.920> I<00:03:59.220> don't<00:03:59.370> think<00:03:59.489> it's<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.700> session

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
the I don't think it's this session

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.460 
the I don't think it's this session
elite<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.300> think<00:04:00.570> it's<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.780> top-line<00:04:01.170> birch

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
elite I think it's the top-line birch

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.680 
elite I think it's the top-line birch
but<00:04:02.310> you'll<00:04:02.519> notice<00:04:02.820> the<00:04:03.140> black<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:06.510> black

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
but you'll notice the black the black

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.479 
but you'll notice the black the black
hardware<00:04:07.260> inside<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.830> shell<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.250> not

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
hardware inside the shell it's not

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.160 
hardware inside the shell it's not
painted<00:04:08.850> that's<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> original<00:04:09.540> color<00:04:09.900> that

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
painted that's the original color that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.449 
painted that's the original color that
stuff<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.590> then<00:04:10.680> if<00:04:10.860> you<00:04:10.950> look<00:04:11.040> at<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.250> floor

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
stuff and then if you look at the floor

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.290 
stuff and then if you look at the floor
tom<00:04:12.440> you've<00:04:13.440> got<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.790> know<00:04:14.820> like<00:04:15.150> the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
tom you've got the you know like the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.810 
tom you've got the you know like the
galvanized<00:04:15.720> looking<00:04:16.140> stuff<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.859> also<00:04:17.700> have

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
galvanized looking stuff I also have

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.979 
galvanized looking stuff I also have
moon<00:04:18.030> gel<00:04:18.239> on<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.450> lot<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.600> these<00:04:18.750> shelves

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
moon gel on a lot of these shelves

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.020 
moon gel on a lot of these shelves
because<00:04:19.200> they're<00:04:19.320> very<00:04:19.440> ringing<00:04:20.030> especially

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
because they're very ringing especially

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.610 
because they're very ringing especially
the<00:04:21.090> snare<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.359> 12<00:04:21.720> actually<00:04:22.020> sounds<00:04:22.289> fine

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the snare the 12 actually sounds fine

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.560 
the snare the 12 actually sounds fine
without<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.250> think<00:04:24.030> he<00:04:24.090> gets<00:04:24.180> played<00:04:24.419> on

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
without it I think he gets played on

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.790 
without it I think he gets played on
more<00:04:24.780> than<00:04:24.900> any<00:04:25.020> other<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.440> head<00:04:25.590> some

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
more than any other so the head some

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.120 
more than any other so the head some
probably<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.130> little<00:04:26.220> bit<00:04:26.370> more<00:04:26.400> dead

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
probably a little bit more dead

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.110 
probably a little bit more dead
now<00:04:28.130> put<00:04:28.310> this<00:04:28.430> in<00:04:28.580> my<00:04:30.250> crappy<00:04:31.250> little<00:04:31.400> stand

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
now put this in my crappy little stand

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.000

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010
