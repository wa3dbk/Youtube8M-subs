looking so we get into it right away

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.549 
looking so we get into it right away
right<00:00:35.100> now<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.540> see<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.930> he<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
right now as you can see here he is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.100 
right now as you can see here he is
sporting<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.340> nice-looking<00:00:38.850> hood<00:00:39.090> obviously<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
sporting a nice-looking hood obviously a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
sporting a nice-looking hood obviously a
little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.379> bigger<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.160> everyone's<00:00:41.520> liking

little bit bigger for everyone's liking

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
little bit bigger for everyone's liking
but<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.390> why<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:42.719> incorporated<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
but I see why they incorporated it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.010 
but I see why they incorporated it
because<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> comic<00:00:44.610> book<00:00:44.789> he<00:00:44.940> has<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
because of the comic book he has it in a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.619 
because of the comic book he has it in a
comic<00:00:46.350> book<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.180> too<00:00:48.360> big

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
comic book but just a little bit too big

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.400 
comic book but just a little bit too big
so<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.950> least<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.370> actually<00:00:50.730> gave<00:00:50.910> us<00:00:51.410> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
so at least they actually gave us the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.139 
so at least they actually gave us the
ability<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.219> off<00:00:53.370> -<00:00:53.579> that's<00:00:53.850> really

job<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.539> good<00:02:09.929> job<00:02:10.080> by<00:02:10.229> Mattel<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:11.370> doing

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670

job of a good job by Mattel for doing
that<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> only<00:02:12.209> gripe<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.599> did<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.959> with<00:02:13.080> this

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that the only gripe I did have with this

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.520 
that the only gripe I did have with this
figure

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
figure

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
figure
probably<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.220> head<00:02:14.370> school<00:02:14.670> I'm<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> big

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
probably the head school I'm not a big

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.170 
probably the head school I'm not a big
fan<00:02:15.540> when<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:17.100> figures<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.670> collect<00:02:17.970> have

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
fan when the figures I collect have

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.870 
fan when the figures I collect have
specific<00:02:18.870> expressions<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.680> their<00:02:19.800> face<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.280> see

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
specific expressions on their face I see

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.460 
specific expressions on their face I see
why<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.209> did<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.450> obviously<00:02:21.900> from<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> comic

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
why they did it obviously from the comic

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.710 
why they did it obviously from the comic
books<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.370> my<00:02:23.730> opinion<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.300> like<00:02:24.330> them<00:02:24.630> to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
books but in my opinion I like them to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.070 
books but in my opinion I like them to
have<00:02:24.870> more<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.290> grim<00:02:26.060> serious<00:02:27.060> look<00:02:27.300> just

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
have more of a grim serious look just

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.190 
have more of a grim serious look just
like<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.500> one<00:02:29.540> now<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.569> like<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.900> one<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.110> lot

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
like this one now I like this one a lot

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.620 
like this one now I like this one a lot
better<00:02:31.440> because<00:02:31.650> he<00:02:31.860> has<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> wider<00:02:32.489> jaw<00:02:32.880> no

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
better because he has a wider jaw no

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.340 
better because he has a wider jaw no
smile<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.560> also<00:02:34.770> doesn't<00:02:35.370> have<00:02:35.550> any<00:02:35.730> pupils

smile and also doesn't have any pupils

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.590 
smile and also doesn't have any pupils
seen<00:02:37.350> right<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.670> he<00:02:38.819> looks<00:02:39.000> more<00:02:39.180> more

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600

seen right there so he looks more more
powerful<00:02:39.989> looking<00:02:40.350> in<00:02:40.470> my<00:02:40.590> opinion<00:02:41.040> more<00:02:41.250> like

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
powerful looking in my opinion more like

a<00:02:41.459> god<00:02:41.760> which<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.180> pretty<00:02:42.540> cool<00:02:42.810> looking

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
a god which is pretty cool looking

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.860 
a god which is pretty cool looking
there's<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.890> lot<00:02:44.069> more<00:02:44.220> powerful<00:02:44.600> like<00:02:45.600> kind<00:02:45.780> of

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
there's a lot more powerful like kind of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.949 
there's a lot more powerful like kind of
looks<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.790> giving<00:02:47.790> looking<00:02:48.450> at<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> figures

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
looks but giving looking at the figures

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.470 
looks but giving looking at the figures
themselves<00:02:49.080> also<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.130> do<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> more<00:02:51.209> the

new<00:02:52.110> 52<00:02:52.410> modern<00:02:53.040> version<00:02:53.430> because<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.850> looks

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
new 52 modern version because it looks

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.180 
new 52 modern version because it looks
more<00:02:54.090> powerful<00:02:54.660> compared<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.350> one<00:02:55.620> this

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190

screams God in my opinion like he has a

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.040

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
bit bigger also but getting into the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.420 
bit bigger also but getting into the
paint<00:03:21.570> schemes<00:03:21.989> like<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.680> said<00:03:23.010> looking<00:03:23.280> at

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
paint schemes like I said looking at

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.670 
paint schemes like I said looking at
them<00:03:23.610> side<00:03:24.090> by<00:03:24.120> side<00:03:24.299> as<00:03:24.720> their<00:03:25.049> own<00:03:25.200> figures

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
them side by side as their own figures

them side by side as their own figures
the<00:03:26.280> paint<00:03:26.519> schemes<00:03:26.790> work<00:03:27.060> fine<00:03:27.420> no<00:03:28.350> real

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the paint schemes work fine no real

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.560 
the paint schemes work fine no real
problem<00:03:29.100> there<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.850> only<00:03:30.060> problem<00:03:30.390> with<00:03:30.450> this

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
problem there the only problem with this

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.910 
problem there the only problem with this
one<00:03:30.780> probably<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:32.269> black<00:03:33.269> lines<00:03:33.660> on<00:03:34.049> the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
one probably is the black lines on the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.009 
one probably is the black lines on the
Batman<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.640> Superman<00:03:35.820> figure<00:03:36.480> they<00:03:36.690> actually

Batman and Superman figure they actually

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.840

you don't really care about it when you
look<00:03:43.230> at<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.470> from<00:03:43.590> far<00:03:43.650> away<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.130> don't

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
look at it from far away you don't

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.319 
look at it from far away you don't
really<00:03:44.519> notice<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.090> or<00:03:45.209> care<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.630> much<00:03:47.329> now

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
really notice it or care that much now

looking<00:03:51.120> at<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.359> capes<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.440> gold<00:03:52.709> on

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
looking at the capes I like the gold on

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.400 
looking at the capes I like the gold on
this<00:03:53.310> figure<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> lot<00:03:53.910> better<00:03:54.180> just<00:03:54.930> overall

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
this figure a lot better just overall

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.750 
this figure a lot better just overall
through<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.769> whole<00:03:55.890> body<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.250> gold<00:03:56.549> looks<00:03:56.700> a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
through the whole body the gold looks a

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.300 
through the whole body the gold looks a
lot<00:03:56.880> nicer<00:03:57.170> this<00:03:58.170> one<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> more<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:58.980> a<00:03:59.070> dull

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
lot nicer this one is a more of a dull

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.440 
lot nicer this one is a more of a dull
gle.a<00:03:59.850> dull<00:04:00.600> color<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.609> it<00:04:02.609> fits<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.120> figure

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
gle.a dull color and it fits the figure

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.210 
gle.a dull color and it fits the figure
but<00:04:03.720> if<00:04:04.230> you're<00:04:04.380> comparing<00:04:04.709> both<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.130> them

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
but if you're comparing both of them

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.849 
but if you're comparing both of them
this<00:04:05.310> one<00:04:05.489> looks<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.700> lot<00:04:05.820> better<00:04:06.000> now<00:04:06.859> getting

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
this one looks a lot better now getting

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.229 
this one looks a lot better now getting
to<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.250> back<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.760> cape

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
to the back of the cape

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.060 
to the back of the cape
now<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.450> capes<00:04:09.750> are<00:04:09.930> pretty<00:04:10.140> nice<00:04:10.350> overall<00:04:10.799> I

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
now the capes are pretty nice overall I

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.610 
now the capes are pretty nice overall I
do<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.299> prefer<00:04:12.630> just<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> lot<00:04:13.320> more

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
do like and prefer just one a lot more

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.740 
do like and prefer just one a lot more
this<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.280> nice<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.030> small<00:04:15.269> details

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
this is nice I like the small details

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.900 
this is nice I like the small details
over<00:04:15.959> here<00:04:16.350> look<00:04:16.560> pretty<00:04:16.590> good<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.310> don't<00:04:17.640> like

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
over here look pretty good I don't like

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.759 
over here look pretty good I don't like
the<00:04:18.000> material<00:04:18.150> it's<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.900> lot<00:04:19.109> stiffer<00:04:19.500> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
the material it's a lot stiffer and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.620 
the material it's a lot stiffer and
harder<00:04:20.390> don't<00:04:21.390> like<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:22.909> but<00:04:23.909> this<00:04:24.210> one<00:04:24.419> even

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
harder don't like that but this one even

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.820 
harder don't like that but this one even
though<00:04:24.840> it's<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.110> little<00:04:25.289> bit<00:04:25.380> bigger<00:04:25.620> and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
though it's a little bit bigger and

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.970 
though it's a little bit bigger and
heavier

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
heavier

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.890 
heavier
actually<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> lot<00:04:27.730> better<00:04:28.000> quality<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.600> lot

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
actually is a lot better quality a lot

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.810 
actually is a lot better quality a lot
more<00:04:29.140> softer<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:29.740> actually<00:04:30.610> has<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.760> little

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
more softer and actually has a little

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.440 
more softer and actually has a little
bit<00:04:30.940> more<00:04:31.120> give<00:04:31.420> for<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.380> move<00:04:32.560> around<00:04:32.680> now

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
bit more give for it to move around now

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.570 
bit more give for it to move around now
which<00:04:34.450> I<00:04:34.540> like<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.750> lot<00:04:34.920> now<00:04:35.920> looking<00:04:36.280> at<00:04:36.430> the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
actually really nice and actually fits

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.750 
actually really nice and actually fits
in<00:05:43.180> pretty<00:05:43.300> well<00:05:43.600> of<00:05:43.690> this<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:45.070> could<00:05:45.370> pose<00:05:45.550> them

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
in pretty well of this I could pose them

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.630 
in pretty well of this I could pose them
two<00:05:45.940> together<00:05:46.090> I<00:05:46.360> had<00:05:46.570> no<00:05:46.750> problem<00:05:47.140> honestly

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
two together I had no problem honestly

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.460 
two together I had no problem honestly
even<00:05:48.640> though<00:05:48.820> he<00:05:48.940> has<00:05:49.090> more<00:05:49.330> of<00:05:49.450> a<00:05:49.630> yellow<00:05:50.110> look

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
even though he has more of a yellow look

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.520 
even though he has more of a yellow look
than<00:05:50.710> gold<00:05:52.110> still<00:05:53.110> looks<00:05:53.260> pretty<00:05:53.380> nice<00:05:53.910> and

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
than gold still looks pretty nice and

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.290 
than gold still looks pretty nice and
even<00:05:56.530> these<00:05:57.220> two<00:05:57.280> match<00:05:57.640> up<00:05:57.820> pretty<00:05:57.970> nicely

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
even these two match up pretty nicely

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.180 
even these two match up pretty nicely
also<00:05:58.780> because<00:05:59.140> they're<00:05:59.440> about<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.710> same<00:05:59.860> size

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
also because they're about the same size
