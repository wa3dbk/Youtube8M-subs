mediums one of the advantages of these
soft<00:00:37.379> tools<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:37.980> they're<00:00:38.250> made<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.520> a

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
soft tools is that they're made out of a

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.350 
soft tools is that they're made out of a
very<00:00:38.879> dense<00:00:39.239> small<00:00:39.989> pour<00:00:40.460> foam<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.940> what<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
very dense small pour foam and what that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.970 
very dense small pour foam and what that
does<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.870> lets<00:00:43.199> you<00:00:43.469> pick<00:00:43.710> up<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
does is that lets you pick up the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
does is that lets you pick up the
material<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> surface<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:46.079> soak<00:00:46.530> up

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
material on the surface and not soak up

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
things you can see is that the material

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.350 
things you can see is that the material
is<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.860> down<00:01:08.040> very<00:01:08.070> thin<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.090> very

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is going down very thin and with very

is going down very thin and with very
little<00:01:09.920> marks<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.159> brush<00:01:11.369> strokes<00:01:11.930> when<00:01:12.930> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
little marks or brush strokes when you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
little marks or brush strokes when you
when<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> need<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.100> change<00:01:14.250> colors<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.790> this

when you need to change colors with this

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
when you need to change colors with this
tool<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.540> wash<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.710> pot<00:01:17.220> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
tool you can wash it off in a pot of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.649 
tool you can wash it off in a pot of
water<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.420> bit<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
water it's going to take a little bit of

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.020 
water it's going to take a little bit of
time<00:01:19.079> to<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> color<00:01:20.280> outside<00:01:20.729> I'd

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
time to get the color outside I'd

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.399 
time to get the color outside I'd
recommend<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.420> using<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> opposite<00:01:22.229> edge

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
recommend just using the opposite edge

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.880 
recommend just using the opposite edge
of<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> or<00:01:22.890> another<00:01:23.430> tool<00:01:30.409> you<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.860> of

of it or another tool you can see one of

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.289 
of it or another tool you can see one of
the<00:01:32.009> advantages<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.909> really

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the advantages is that you really

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.550 
the advantages is that you really
there's<00:01:33.479> no<00:01:33.659> brush<00:01:33.840> strokes<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.439> you're

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
there's no brush strokes and you're

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
there's no brush strokes and you're
using<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> paints<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:36.000> very

similar marks to a brush however there's
no<00:03:27.989> brush<00:03:28.169> strokes<00:03:28.530> at<00:03:28.709> all<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.220> what's

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
no brush strokes at all and what's

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.330 
no brush strokes at all and what's
really<00:03:30.239> nice<00:03:30.419> about<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:31.139> by<00:03:31.590> angling<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
really nice about this is by angling the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.720 
really nice about this is by angling the
tool<00:03:32.519> slightly<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:33.870> actually<00:03:34.290> go<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.620> and

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
tool slightly you can actually go in and

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.420 
tool slightly you can actually go in and
almost<00:03:35.730> erase<00:03:36.090> or<00:03:36.419> push<00:03:36.720> some<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.169> paint

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
almost erase or push some of the paint

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.580 
almost erase or push some of the paint
to<00:03:38.430> create<00:03:38.730> some<00:03:38.970> defined<00:03:39.660> definitions<00:03:40.380> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
to create some defined definitions and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.729 
to create some defined definitions and
highline's<00:03:40.980> highlights<00:03:42.440> next<00:03:43.440> thing<00:03:43.650> I'm

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
highline's highlights next thing I'm

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:44.900 
highline's highlights next thing I'm
going<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.919> do<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.099> go<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.370> with<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.549> different

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
going to do is go in with a different

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.039 
going to do is go in with a different
color<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.560> on<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:47.060> dry<00:03:48.060> surface<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.750> can<00:03:48.870> see

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
color on on a dry surface so you can see

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:59.340 
color on on a dry surface so you can see
how<00:03:49.169> that<00:03:49.349> works

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.660 

you<00:04:00.350> get<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.500> little<00:04:00.770> bit<00:04:00.890> more<00:04:01.040> opaque<00:04:01.340> mark

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
you get a little bit more opaque mark

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.720 
you get a little bit more opaque mark
mark<00:04:02.270> making<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:03.440> watercolor<00:04:04.340> can<00:04:04.550> be

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
mark making the watercolor can be

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.310 
mark making the watercolor can be
controlled<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.450> bit<00:04:05.630> more<00:04:05.840> like<00:04:06.020> tube

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
controlled a bit more like tube

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.540 
controlled a bit more like tube
watercolor<00:04:06.800> straight<00:04:07.640> off<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.940> pan<00:04:12.550> then

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
watercolor straight off the pan then

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.800 
watercolor straight off the pan then
again<00:04:13.820> just<00:04:14.000> by<00:04:14.120> adding<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.450> little<00:04:14.630> bit<00:04:14.720> of

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
again just by adding a little bit of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.000 
again just by adding a little bit of
water<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.080> it<00:04:15.260> you<00:04:15.350> can<00:04:15.500> loosen<00:04:15.680> up<00:04:15.860> the

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
water to it you can loosen up the

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.539 
water to it you can loosen up the
surface<00:04:16.600> move<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.720> material<00:04:18.140> around<00:04:18.549> the

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
surface move the material around the

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.099 
surface move the material around the
edge<00:04:19.670> of<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.940> edge<00:04:20.209> of<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.420> tool<00:04:20.600> works<00:04:20.840> right

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
edge of the edge of the tool works right

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.450 
edge of the edge of the tool works right
like<00:04:21.290> a<00:04:21.320> squeegee<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.859> almost<00:04:22.130> cuts<00:04:22.340> the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460
