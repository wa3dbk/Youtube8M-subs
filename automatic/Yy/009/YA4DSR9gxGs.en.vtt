personal opinion on these two products

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.140 
personal opinion on these two products
right<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> PlayStation<00:00:11.250> Move<00:00:11.429> was

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
right so the PlayStation Move was

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.690 
right so the PlayStation Move was
announced<00:00:12.570> at<00:00:12.660> e3<00:00:12.780> 2010<00:00:13.530> however<00:00:14.280> they<00:00:14.639> were

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
announced at e3 2010 however they were

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.330 
announced at e3 2010 however they were
there<00:00:15.120> were<00:00:15.360> some<00:00:15.719> rumors<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.500> around<00:00:16.920> on

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
there were some rumors going around on

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.730 
there were some rumors going around on
the<00:00:17.490> internet<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.480> Sony<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the internet that Sony was going to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
the internet that Sony was going to
release<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:21.350> motion-sensing<00:00:22.350> controller<00:00:22.800> so

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
release a motion-sensing controller so

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.570 
release a motion-sensing controller so
it<00:00:23.880> uses<00:00:24.029> light<00:00:24.420> tracking<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.109> bluetooth<00:00:25.580> has

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it uses light tracking and bluetooth has

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.120 
it uses light tracking and bluetooth has
an<00:00:26.789> internal<00:00:27.180> gyroscope<00:00:27.750> today<00:00:28.349> detect<00:00:28.920> all

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
an internal gyroscope today detect all

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.820 
an internal gyroscope today detect all
axes<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> motion<00:00:30.000> especially<00:00:30.779> depth<00:00:31.140> which<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
axes of motion especially depth which is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.190 
axes of motion especially depth which is
easy<00:00:32.189> access<00:00:32.340> now<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.750> had<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> few

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
easy access now the we had a few

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.100 
easy access now the we had a few
problems<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:36.480> Sony's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
problems with this and I think Sony's

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.709 
problems with this and I think Sony's
learned<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> address<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.399> i<00:00:39.300> think<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
learned to address it and i think the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.030 
learned to address it and i think the
gaming<00:00:40.140> experience<00:00:40.620> would<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.770> much<00:00:41.010> better

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
gaming experience would be much better

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.150 
gaming experience would be much better
with<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.820> gyroscope<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.260> depth<00:00:43.590> axis

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
with the gyroscope and the depth axis

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.630 
with the gyroscope and the depth axis
has<00:00:45.059> an<00:00:45.360> accelerometer<00:00:46.340> location<00:00:47.340> tracking

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
has an accelerometer location tracking

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
has an accelerometer location tracking
and<00:00:48.000> log<00:00:48.270> triggers<00:00:48.690> eight<00:00:49.020> buttons<00:00:49.410> including

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and log triggers eight buttons including

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.510 
and log triggers eight buttons including
a<00:00:50.309> d-pad<00:00:51.090> analog<00:00:51.660> stick<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:53.010> also<00:00:53.219> can

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a d-pad analog stick and it also can

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
a d-pad analog stick and it also can
support<00:00:53.879> multiple<00:00:54.149> players<00:00:54.750> which<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.230> quite

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
support multiple players which is quite

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.630 
support multiple players which is quite
an<00:00:55.800> advantage<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> features<00:00:58.199> are

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
an advantage so the features are

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.520 
an advantage so the features are
basically<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.850> has<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.420> light<00:01:00.719> bulb<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.260> top

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
basically it has this light bulb on top

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.020 
basically it has this light bulb on top
as<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> image<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> right

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
as you can see in the image on the right

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.810 
as you can see in the image on the right
is<00:01:03.350> involved<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> tracking<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
is involved in the tracking the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
is involved in the tracking the
PlayStation<00:01:06.450> Eye<00:01:06.600> camera<00:01:07.280> detects<00:01:08.280> light

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
PlayStation Eye camera detects light

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.030

that<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.540> emitted<00:01:09.750> from<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.409> light<00:01:10.619> bulb<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
that is emitted from this light bulb and

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.440 
that is emitted from this light bulb and
it<00:01:11.850> uses<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.409> for<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.530> tracking<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:15.180> comes

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it uses it for the tracking it comes

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
it uses it for the tracking it comes
with<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> side<00:01:15.930> remote<00:01:16.229> similar<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> wind

with a side remote similar to the wind
nunchuck<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.560> buttons

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
nunchuck and as you can see the buttons

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.520 
nunchuck and as you can see the buttons
are<00:01:19.979> priests<00:01:20.220> paired<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.330> optimum<00:01:21.990> gaming

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
are priests paired up for optimum gaming

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.810 
are priests paired up for optimum gaming
and<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.530> however<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.159> PlayStation

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and to use this however a PlayStation

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.170 
and to use this however a PlayStation
Eye<00:01:26.939> detector<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.540> required<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.000> see

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
Eye detector is required as you can see

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
Eye detector is required as you can see
the<00:01:30.360> analog<00:01:30.780> stick<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.590> d-pad<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the analog stick and the d-pad and the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.359 
the analog stick and the d-pad and the
various<00:01:32.880> buttons<00:01:33.470> make<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.860> somewhat

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
various buttons make it a somewhat

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.830 
various buttons make it a somewhat
complete<00:01:36.299> gaming<00:01:37.049> controller<00:01:38.090> because<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
complete gaming controller because the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.450 
complete gaming controller because the
normal<00:01:40.140> PlayStation<00:01:40.650> controller<00:01:41.009> has<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
normal PlayStation controller has this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.719 
normal PlayStation controller has this
almost<00:01:42.150> exactly<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.689> same<00:01:42.840> controls<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
almost exactly the same controls and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.580 
almost exactly the same controls and
that<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.540> means<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.960> Sony<00:01:46.290> wants

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that I think that means that Sony wants

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.520 
that I think that means that Sony wants
to<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.860> something<00:01:47.100> extra<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.530> gaming

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to do something extra with this gaming

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.910 
to do something extra with this gaming
controller<00:01:49.920> maybe<00:01:50.909> make<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.740> mainstream<00:01:52.740> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
controller maybe make it mainstream I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.749 
controller maybe make it mainstream I
guess<00:01:53.720> anyway<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> need<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
guess anyway so to use it you need the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.760 
guess anyway so to use it you need the
PlayStation<00:01:57.270> Eye<00:01:57.450> detector<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.110> according

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
PlayStation Eye detector and according

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.920 
PlayStation Eye detector and according
to<00:01:58.920> gamers<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.430> reviewers<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.540> extremely

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to gamers and reviewers it's extremely

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.620 
to gamers and reviewers it's extremely
precise<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> responsive<00:02:02.549> has<00:02:03.119> an<00:02:03.270> excellent

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
precise and responsive has an excellent

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530 
precise and responsive has an excellent
design<00:02:04.159> to<00:02:05.159> allow<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.369> optimum<00:02:06.090> gaming

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
design to allow for optimum gaming

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.320 
design to allow for optimum gaming
conditions<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.380> basically<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.149> means

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
conditions and basically what that means

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.290 
conditions and basically what that means
is<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.649> buttons<00:02:11.069> are<00:02:11.280> easy<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.879> access

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
is that the buttons are easy to access

going<00:06:36.240> to<00:06:36.390> be<00:06:36.600> a<00:06:36.870> super<00:06:37.440> hit<00:06:37.590> I<00:06:37.800> think<00:06:38.160> it's

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
going to be a super hit I think it's

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
going to be a super hit I think it's
going<00:06:38.490> to<00:06:38.610> be<00:06:38.670> um<00:06:39.560> just<00:06:40.580> average<00:06:41.580> you<00:06:41.910> know<00:06:42.060> it

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
going to be um just average you know it

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.530 
going to be um just average you know it
i<00:06:42.660> think<00:06:42.720> in<00:06:43.050> my<00:06:43.290> opinion<00:06:43.320> it's<00:06:44.070> gonna<00:06:44.340> be<00:06:44.640> just

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
i think in my opinion it's gonna be just

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.090 
i think in my opinion it's gonna be just
average<00:06:45.990> you<00:06:46.200> know<00:06:46.230> it's<00:06:46.620> going<00:06:46.800> to<00:06:46.890> sell<00:06:47.070> a

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
average you know it's going to sell a

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.860 
average you know it's going to sell a
few<00:06:47.310> million<00:06:47.520> units<00:06:47.970> and<00:06:48.150> that's<00:06:48.300> about<00:06:48.450> it<00:06:48.570> I

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
few million units and that's about it I

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.360 
few million units and that's about it I
don't<00:06:49.110> think<00:06:49.140> it's<00:06:49.380> going<00:06:49.530> to<00:06:49.590> be<00:06:49.650> super<00:06:49.950> 8<00:06:50.190> but

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
don't think it's going to be super 8 but

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.970 
don't think it's going to be super 8 but
I<00:06:50.550> may<00:06:50.730> be<00:06:50.790> wrong<00:06:51.090> since<00:06:51.720> because<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.530> kinect

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
I may be wrong since because the kinect

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.440 
I may be wrong since because the kinect
doesn't<00:06:53.340> really<00:06:53.580> have<00:06:53.790> a<00:06:53.820> strong<00:06:54.120> games

doesn't really have a strong games

ways have been sold so far so one of

ways have been sold so far so one of
these<00:07:25.170> game<00:07:25.440> developers<00:07:26.010> can<00:07:26.190> get<00:07:26.370> lucky<00:07:26.760> and

these game developers can get lucky and
I<00:07:27.360> think<00:07:27.630> they're<00:07:27.870> going<00:07:27.990> to<00:07:28.050> hit<00:07:28.170> the<00:07:28.320> jackpot

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.910 
I think they're going to hit the jackpot
anyways<00:07:30.390> my<00:07:30.960> opinion<00:07:31.380> the<00:07:31.470> move<00:07:31.650> will<00:07:31.800> be<00:07:31.890> a

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:31.920 
anyways my opinion the move will be a

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.680 
anyways my opinion the move will be a
super<00:07:32.160> hit<00:07:32.400> however<00:07:32.910> I<00:07:33.000> may<00:07:33.360> be<00:07:33.420> biased

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
super hit however I may be biased

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.950 
super hit however I may be biased
