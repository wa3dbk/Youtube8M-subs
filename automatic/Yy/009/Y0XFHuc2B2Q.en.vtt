00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
to set the maps I'm pretty sure like

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.320 
to set the maps I'm pretty sure like
every<00:00:24.060> map<00:00:24.289> every<00:00:25.289> war<00:00:25.470> zone<00:00:25.710> map<00:00:25.920> at<00:00:26.130> least<00:00:26.430> I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
every map every war zone map at least I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
every map every war zone map at least I
haven't<00:00:27.930> actually<00:00:28.050> no<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.039> don't<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.400> it's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
haven't actually no I don't think it's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.339 
haven't actually no I don't think it's
an<00:00:29.880> existing<00:00:30.570> robot<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.019> I've<00:00:31.109> never

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
an existing robot but I've never

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.340 
an existing robot but I've never
actually<00:00:31.529> played<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.430> tactician<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.269> in<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
actually played the tactician on in the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.229 
actually played the tactician on in the
other<00:00:34.470> game<00:00:34.680> types<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.519> you<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> play

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
other game types but you have to play

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.670 
other game types but you have to play
the<00:00:36.420> tactician<00:00:36.780> class<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.410> right<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the tactician class so right the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.829 
the tactician class so right the
tactician<00:00:38.070> class<00:00:38.519> is<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.030> only<00:00:39.150> class<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
tactician class is the only class and

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.260 
tactician class is the only class and
capture<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.530> tactical<00:00:41.399> spawn<00:00:41.670> point<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.149> these

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
capture a tactical spawn point on these

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
capture a tactical spawn point on these
maps<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.469> picked<00:00:43.649> Corinth<00:00:43.890> River<00:00:44.160> just

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
maps so we picked Corinth River just

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
maps so we picked Corinth River just
because<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.910> was<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.300> map<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:46.350> most

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
because it was the map that I was most

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040 
because it was the map that I was most
familiar<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> time<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.050> it's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
familiar with at the time and it's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.450 
familiar with at the time and it's
actually<00:00:49.350> good<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.860> Ray<00:00:50.010> at<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> start

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
actually good this is Ray at the start

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.250 
actually good this is Ray at the start
of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> match<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.239> we're<00:00:51.809> gonna<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.230> here

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
of the match so we're gonna go up here

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.930 
of the match so we're gonna go up here
to<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.829> top<00:00:53.129> right

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to this top right

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.020 
to this top right
tactical<00:00:54.719> spawn<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.770> we're<00:00:56.730> gonna<00:00:56.820> see

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
tactical spawn point and we're gonna see

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.610 
tactical spawn point and we're gonna see
if<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.329> grab<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.600> before<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.500> any

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
if we can grab it before we see any

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.150 
if we can grab it before we see any
enemies<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.610> here<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.780> don't<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> any<00:01:01.920> support

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
enemies up here I don't have any support

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.060 
enemies up here I don't have any support
we<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> enemy<00:01:02.879> XO<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.539> other<00:01:03.719> side<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
we got the enemy XO on the other side so

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.770 
we got the enemy XO on the other side so
hopefully<00:01:05.550> we<00:01:05.670> don't<00:01:05.759> run<00:01:05.910> into<00:01:05.970> any<00:01:06.180> guys<00:01:06.450> but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
while we capture the spawn point so

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:18.919 
while we capture the spawn point so
