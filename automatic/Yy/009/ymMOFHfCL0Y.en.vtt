nerf<00:00:05.240> recon<00:00:06.340> here's<00:00:07.340> the<00:00:07.460> opened<00:00:08.179> up<00:00:08.360> freak<00:00:08.840> on

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
nerf recon here's the opened up freak on

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.500 
nerf recon here's the opened up freak on
and<00:00:09.380> in<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.190> last<00:00:10.220> video<00:00:10.520> I<00:00:10.940> forgot<00:00:11.360> to

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
and in the last video I forgot to

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.980 
and in the last video I forgot to
mention<00:00:11.540> that<00:00:11.870> there's<00:00:12.260> two<00:00:12.500> screws<00:00:12.800> the<00:00:13.430> top

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
mention that there's two screws the top

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.509 
mention that there's two screws the top
cocking<00:00:14.990> mechanism<00:00:16.659> so<00:00:18.039> you<00:00:19.039> just<00:00:19.249> unscrew

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
cocking mechanism so you just unscrew

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.899 
cocking mechanism so you just unscrew
those<00:00:19.880> two<00:00:20.150> and<00:00:20.390> it'll<00:00:20.539> come<00:00:20.869> out<00:00:21.019> fine<00:00:21.909> so

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:22.909 
those two and it'll come out fine so

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.929 
those two and it'll come out fine so
then<00:00:23.089> to<00:00:24.099> disassemble<00:00:25.099> it<00:00:25.220> what<00:00:25.400> you<00:00:25.519> do<00:00:25.669> is

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
then to disassemble it what you do is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.540 
then to disassemble it what you do is
you<00:00:26.150> talk<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:26.989> thing<00:00:27.199> out<00:00:27.349> like<00:00:28.039> this<00:00:28.249> and

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
you talk this thing out like this and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.689 
you talk this thing out like this and
you'll<00:00:28.819> get<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:28.999> spring<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:30.460> then<00:00:31.460> you'll<00:00:31.640> be

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
you'll get the spring and then you'll be

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.420 
you'll get the spring and then you'll be
able<00:00:31.939> to<00:00:32.180> take<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:32.450> part<00:00:32.689> out<00:00:33.219> then<00:00:34.219> what<00:00:34.370> you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
able to take this part out then what you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.349 
able to take this part out then what you
do<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:34.579> you<00:00:35.149> it<00:00:35.180> back<00:00:35.530> like<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.100> then

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
do is you it back like so and then

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.000 
do is you it back like so and then
you<00:00:38.359> will<00:00:38.510> be<00:00:38.750> able<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.050> just<00:00:39.260> pull<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:39.769> out

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
you will be able to just pull this out

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.299 
you will be able to just pull this out
and<00:00:41.260> that<00:00:42.260> won't<00:00:42.440> really<00:00:42.559> matter<00:00:42.800> because

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
and that won't really matter because

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.889 
and that won't really matter because
you're<00:00:43.820> going<00:00:43.969> to<00:00:44.090> figure<00:00:44.449> out<00:00:44.570> how<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.750> do

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
you're going to figure out how to do

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.439 
you're going to figure out how to do
this<00:00:45.019> too<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:46.670> should<00:00:46.910> look<00:00:47.059> like<00:00:47.120> this

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
this too so and it should look like this

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.079 
this too so and it should look like this
and<00:00:47.750> when<00:00:48.649> you<00:00:48.739> fire<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.010> will<00:00:49.399> just<00:00:49.489> go<00:00:49.910> like

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
and when you fire it will just go like

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.939 
and when you fire it will just go like
that<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.480> push<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.989> era<00:00:51.109> and<00:00:51.350> push<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.739> dirt

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
that and push the era and push the dirt

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.169 
that and push the era and push the dirt
so<00:00:52.820> what<00:00:53.629> it<00:00:53.749> will<00:00:54.289> look<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:55.179> it'll

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
so what it will look like is it'll

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.150 
so what it will look like is it'll
you'll<00:00:56.420> have<00:00:56.629> a<00:00:56.660> little<00:00:56.929> airstrip<00:00:57.859> dirt

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
you'll have a little airstrip dirt

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.009 
you'll have a little airstrip dirt
inside<00:00:58.460> of<00:00:58.640> here<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.329> we<00:00:59.480> do<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.870> you<00:00:59.960> just

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
inside of here and we do is you just

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.669 
inside of here and we do is you just
find<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.409> drill<00:01:00.649> bit<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.859> fit<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:02.409> inside<00:01:03.409> this

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
find a drill bit to fit the inside this

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.950 
find a drill bit to fit the inside this
perfectly<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.120> just<00:01:05.269> drill<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.720> thing

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
perfectly and you just drill that thing

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.570 
perfectly and you just drill that thing
completely<00:01:06.440> out<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.100> should<00:01:07.310> look

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
completely out and it should look

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.370 
completely out and it should look
completely<00:01:08.210> like<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.950> completely<00:01:10.030> Hollow

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
completely like that completely Hollow

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.310 
completely like that completely Hollow
so<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.910> then<00:01:13.910> here<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:14.990> trigger

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
so and then here this is the trigger

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.300 
so and then here this is the trigger
mechanism<00:01:16.480> this<00:01:17.480> is<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.750> trigger<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.350> as<00:01:19.220> you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
mechanism this is the trigger and as you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.930 
mechanism this is the trigger and as you
can<00:01:19.430> see<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.580> painted<00:01:20.030> mine<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:22.430> what'd<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:22.790> do

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
can see I painted mine so what'd you do

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.570 
can see I painted mine so what'd you do
to<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.510> just<00:01:24.500> comes<00:01:24.650> apart<00:01:24.770> like<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.070> there

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
to it just comes apart like this there

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.430 
to it just comes apart like this there
will<00:01:25.820> also<00:01:26.120> be<00:01:26.330> another<00:01:26.780> piece<00:01:27.050> that<00:01:27.080> goes

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
will also be another piece that goes

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.340 
will also be another piece that goes
right<00:01:27.800> in<00:01:27.980> here<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:29.600> piece<00:01:29.870> is<00:01:30.140> not

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
right in here and that piece is not

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.780 
right in here and that piece is not
needed<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.070> can<00:01:31.220> just<00:01:31.340> pull<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.640> out<00:01:31.760> and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
needed and you can just pull it out and

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.970 
needed and you can just pull it out and
throw<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:32.240> away<00:01:32.300> because<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.500> don't<00:01:33.680> need<00:01:33.800> it

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
throw it away because you don't need it

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.960 
throw it away because you don't need it
whatsoever<00:01:35.890> all<00:01:36.890> right<00:01:37.070> then<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.670> reassemble

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
whatsoever all right then to reassemble

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.150 
whatsoever all right then to reassemble
it<00:01:38.390> what<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:38.630> do<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.960> your<00:01:39.110> first<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.950> put

this<00:01:40.310> part<00:01:40.580> back<00:01:40.730> on<00:01:40.940> here<00:01:41.840> with<00:01:42.830> this<00:01:43.040> little

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
this part back on here with this little

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.950 
this part back on here with this little
square<00:01:43.640> thing<00:01:43.700> pushing<00:01:44.330> up<00:01:44.450> against<00:01:44.810> that

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
square thing pushing up against that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.260 
square thing pushing up against that
like<00:01:45.290> that<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.860> then<00:01:46.820> you're<00:01:46.910> going<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.060> line

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
like that and then you're going to line

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.660 
like that and then you're going to line
up<00:01:47.420> there's<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.720> hole<00:01:47.930> here<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.620> there's<00:01:49.580> a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
up there's a hole here and there's a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.120 
up there's a hole here and there's a
little<00:01:49.940> tag<00:01:50.150> on<00:01:50.360> here<00:01:50.680> so<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.770> know<00:01:51.920> line

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
little tag on here so you know line

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.540 
little tag on here so you know line
those<00:01:52.340> up<00:01:52.370> and<00:01:53.090> put<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:54.380> into<00:01:54.590> there<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:54.950> then

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
those up and put it into there and then

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.080 
those up and put it into there and then
you're<00:01:55.640> going<00:01:55.790> to<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.270> forward<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.880> push

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you're going to it forward and push

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.130 
you're going to it forward and push
that<00:01:59.240> all<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.510> way<00:01:59.600> forward<00:01:59.870> like<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:02.140> then

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
you going to do your talking mechanisms

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.240 
you going to do your talking mechanisms
so<00:02:06.790> you're<00:02:07.790> gonna<00:02:07.940> put<00:02:08.539> this<00:02:08.720> thing<00:02:08.989> in<00:02:09.250> like

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
so you're gonna put this thing in like

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.280 
so you're gonna put this thing in like
that<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.880> might<00:02:11.120> be<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.300> little<00:02:11.660> bit<00:02:11.870> harder<00:02:12.260> to

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
that it might be a little bit harder to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.150 
that it might be a little bit harder to
get<00:02:12.530> out<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.830> might<00:02:12.950> have

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
get out you might have

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.070 
get out you might have
lift<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.520> up<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:14.000> little<00:02:14.150> bit<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.960> it

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
lift that up just a little bit and it

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.580 
lift that up just a little bit and it
should<00:02:15.230> slide<00:02:15.470> in<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.950> like<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:17.590> then

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
should slide in just like that and then

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.190 
should slide in just like that and then
the<00:02:18.710> trigger<00:02:18.980> goes<00:02:19.430> right<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:19.880> here<00:02:20.180> like<00:02:20.960> this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
the trigger goes right in here like this

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.020 
the trigger goes right in here like this
and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:21.890> push<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.280> spring<00:02:22.580> into<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
and then you just push the spring into a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.080 
and then you just push the spring into a
little<00:02:23.210> hole<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.980> will<00:02:25.070> fit<00:02:25.190> all<00:02:25.220> nice<00:02:25.880> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
little hole and it will fit all nice and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.280 
little hole and it will fit all nice and
snug<00:02:26.300> like<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:27.310> then<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.430> take<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.790> piece

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
snug like that then you take this piece

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.830 
snug like that then you take this piece
which<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.830> fires<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.180> put<00:02:32.810> it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
which is the fires it and you put it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.860 
which is the fires it and you put it
into<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.560> slot<00:02:33.830> right<00:02:34.070> here<00:02:34.480> put<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.600> spring

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
into the slot right here put the spring

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.580 
into the slot right here put the spring
facing<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.410> way<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> bottom<00:02:38.590> after

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
facing that way and on the bottom after

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.010 
facing that way and on the bottom after
that<00:02:40.010> you're<00:02:40.220> pretty<00:02:40.520> much<00:02:40.580> done<00:02:40.970> but<00:02:41.810> you'll

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
that you're pretty much done but you'll

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.890 
that you're pretty much done but you'll
have<00:02:42.430> up<00:02:43.430> here<00:02:43.880> you'll<00:02:44.120> have<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.660> little

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
have up here you'll have this a little

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.530 
have up here you'll have this a little
piece<00:02:45.170> up<00:02:45.350> here<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:46.730> when<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:49.210> put<00:02:50.210> the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
piece up here for when you put the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.420 
piece up here for when you put the
tactical<00:02:51.080> route<00:02:51.230> rail<00:02:51.680> on<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.190> there'll<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.340> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
tactical route rail on and there'll be a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.920 
tactical route rail on and there'll be a
little<00:02:52.700> spring<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.450> put<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.810> in

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
little spring and you just put that in

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.050 
little spring and you just put that in
there<00:02:55.420> up<00:02:56.420> here<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.500> then<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.550> finish<00:02:58.730> putting

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
there up here and then to finish putting

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.210 
there up here and then to finish putting
it<00:02:59.210> back<00:02:59.300> together<00:02:59.480> you<00:03:00.320> put<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.620> spring<00:03:01.040> back

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
it back together you put the spring back

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.140 
it back together you put the spring back
on<00:03:01.430> like<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.890> then<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.220> pop<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
on like that and then you just pop the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.760 
on like that and then you just pop the
top<00:03:05.300> on<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:07.610> oh<00:03:08.600> yeah<00:03:09.140> well<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.680> have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
top on and oh yeah well you have to have

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.620 
top on and oh yeah well you have to have
them<00:03:09.890> lined<00:03:10.070> up<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:10.730> find<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.150> easiest<00:03:11.390> if

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
them lined up so I find it easiest if

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.270 
them lined up so I find it easiest if
you<00:03:11.720> push<00:03:11.900> them<00:03:12.050> forward<00:03:12.290> because<00:03:12.980> then<00:03:13.160> you

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
you push them forward because then you

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.390 
you push them forward because then you
can<00:03:13.430> line<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:13.880> up<00:03:14.090> pretty<00:03:14.270> good<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.900> then<00:03:15.740> you

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
can line it up pretty good and then you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.770 
can line it up pretty good and then you
line<00:03:16.640> it<00:03:16.670> up<00:03:16.880> like<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:20.180> should<00:03:20.480> fit

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
line it up like that and it should fit

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.120 
line it up like that and it should fit
nice<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.790> easily<00:03:23.560> but<00:03:24.560> if<00:03:24.770> you<00:03:24.920> have

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
nice and easily but if you have

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.070 
nice and easily but if you have
something<00:03:25.400> wrong<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.940> won't<00:03:26.060> fit<00:03:26.300> good<00:03:26.570> so<00:03:27.020> you

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
something wrong it won't fit good so you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.720 
something wrong it won't fit good so you
just<00:03:27.350> have<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.680> make<00:03:27.830> sure<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.160> have<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.459> in

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
just have to make sure you have it in

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.600 
just have to make sure you have it in
right<00:03:29.090> like<00:03:29.480> this<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.560> all<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.430> little

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
right like this is in and all the little

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.730 
right like this is in and all the little
pieces<00:03:31.910> are<00:03:32.209> pushed<00:03:32.420> all<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.600> way<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.650> you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
pieces are pushed all the way in so you

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.790 
pieces are pushed all the way in so you
just<00:03:33.770> line<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.190> up<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.320> should<00:03:36.560> pop<00:03:36.590> right

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
just line it up and it should pop right

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.100 
just line it up and it should pop right
back<00:03:37.010> together<00:03:37.490> and<00:03:37.760> then<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.270> just<00:03:38.480> screw<00:03:38.990> in

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
back together and then you just screw in

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.320 
back together and then you just screw in
all<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.350> screws<00:03:39.880> you're<00:03:40.880> in<00:03:40.970> this<00:03:41.090> little

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
should shoot an extra 10 15 feet it's

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.800
