00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
i go into extra function like it told me

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.929 
i go into extra function like it told me
to<00:02:17.980> no<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:19.450> at<00:02:19.569> all<00:02:19.659> oh<00:02:20.459> well<00:02:21.459> there<00:02:21.819> is

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
supposed to be an extra function where

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.420 
supposed to be an extra function where
you<00:02:23.620> can<00:02:24.010> oh<00:02:25.290> wait<00:02:26.290> hang<00:02:26.469> on<00:02:26.560> based<00:02:27.129> on<00:02:27.280> its

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you can oh wait hang on based on its

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.270 
you can oh wait hang on based on its
charge<00:02:27.670> level<00:02:27.939> so<00:02:28.030> if<00:02:28.120> i<00:02:28.180> go<00:02:28.299> see<00:02:28.510> now<00:02:28.750> nope

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
charge level so if i go see now nope

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.789 
charge level so if i go see now nope
okay<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.400> was<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.519> nice<00:02:30.670> try<00:02:30.879> if<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.989> are<00:02:32.170> only

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
okay that was a nice try if you are only

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.550 
okay that was a nice try if you are only
using<00:02:33.480> equivalent<00:02:34.480> exchange<00:02:34.629> i<00:02:34.989> think<00:02:35.319> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
using equivalent exchange i think the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.890 
using equivalent exchange i think the
key<00:02:36.220> configuration<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.299> push<00:02:37.450> see<00:02:37.750> to

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
key configuration just to push see to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.140 
key configuration just to push see to
make<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.200> ice<00:02:38.379> around<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.889> be<00:02:39.040> frozen<00:02:39.310> so

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
make the ice around you be frozen so

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.050 
make the ice around you be frozen so
even<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:41.469> better<00:02:41.799> than<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.159> 0<00:02:42.790> ring

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
even then it's better than the 0 ring

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.179 
even then it's better than the 0 ring
just<00:02:43.510> by<00:02:43.659> itself<00:02:44.139> like<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.650> can<00:02:44.769> make<00:02:44.889> it<00:02:45.010> run

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
just by itself like you can make it run

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.640 
just by itself like you can make it run
fast<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.760> can<00:02:45.879> freeze<00:02:46.150> stuff<00:02:46.650> assumingly

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
fast so you can freeze stuff assumingly

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.629 
fast so you can freeze stuff assumingly
and<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.450> forth<00:02:49.750> now<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.139> i<00:02:50.260> right<00:02:50.859> click<00:02:50.889> here

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
and so forth now if i right click here

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.390 
and so forth now if i right click here
with<00:02:51.909> a<00:02:51.939> full<00:02:52.329> charge<00:02:52.540> bar<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.220> makes<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.370> very

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
with a full charge bar it makes a very

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.619 
with a full charge bar it makes a very
very<00:02:55.150> very<00:02:55.299> large<00:02:56.079> section<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.739> water<00:02:57.629> which

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
very very large section of water which

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.110 
very very large section of water which
can<00:02:58.659> be<00:02:59.049> quite<00:02:59.290> annoying<00:02:59.560> probably<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:00.909> don't

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
can be quite annoying probably but don't

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.759 
can be quite annoying probably but don't
worry<00:03:01.329> we<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.629> fix<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:01.959> later<00:03:02.109> I<00:03:02.379> promise

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
worry we can fix this later I promise

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
anyway now on to the vulcanite amulet so

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.559 
anyway now on to the vulcanite amulet so
if<00:03:37.329> we<00:03:37.479> do<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.750> our<00:03:37.900> function<00:03:38.349> of<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.590> one

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
if we do the our function of this one

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.920 
if we do the our function of this one
look<00:03:40.569> at<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:41.489> it<00:03:42.489> has<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.940> ability<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.419> get

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
look at that it has the ability to get

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.159 
look at that it has the ability to get
rid<00:03:44.169> of<00:03:44.199> water<00:03:45.359> which<00:03:46.359> can<00:03:46.389> make<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.019> whole

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
rid of water which can make the whole

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.770 
rid of water which can make the whole
area<00:03:47.440> look<00:03:47.769> quite<00:03:48.099> ugly<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.849> i<00:03:48.879> recommend<00:03:49.449> not

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
area look quite ugly so i recommend not

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.089 
area look quite ugly so i recommend not
doing<00:03:49.840> it<00:03:50.199> to<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.349> ocean<00:03:50.680> if<00:03:50.859> you're

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
doing it to the ocean if you're

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.289 
doing it to the ocean if you're
particularly<00:03:51.669> invested<00:03:52.389> in<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.810> ocean<00:03:54.299> yes

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
particularly invested in the ocean yes

particularly invested in the ocean yes
anyway<00:03:56.849> there<00:03:57.849> is<00:03:58.090> not<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.449> only<00:03:58.479> function

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
anyway there is not the only function

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.819 
anyway there is not the only function
now<00:03:59.709> pressing<00:04:00.430> our<00:04:00.699> will<00:04:00.909> shoot<00:04:01.180> projectiles

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
isn't the right kind of fuel so that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.970 
isn't the right kind of fuel so that
meat<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:51.200> may<00:04:51.410> be<00:04:51.440> why<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.770> ice<00:04:52.520> wasn't<00:04:52.850> i

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
there while I've got fuel you can see

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.620 
there while I've got fuel you can see
use<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:11.090> one<00:05:11.300> redstone<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:12.020> create<00:05:12.440> it<00:05:12.590> and

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
use that one redstone to create it and

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.560 
use that one redstone to create it and
it<00:05:14.630> can<00:05:15.020> make<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.620> rather<00:05:16.310> bigger<00:05:17.180> mess<00:05:17.540> than

it can make a rather bigger mess than
what<00:05:18.110> this<00:05:18.290> one<00:05:18.440> can<00:05:18.590> create<00:05:20.169> yeah<00:05:21.280> there's<00:05:22.280> a

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
what this one can create yeah there's a

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.740 
what this one can create yeah there's a
shell<00:05:22.550> down<00:05:22.700> there<00:05:22.850> maybe<00:05:23.120> it<00:05:23.240> did<00:05:23.330> bent<00:05:23.510> it<00:05:23.630> if

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
shell down there maybe it did bent it if

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.370 
shell down there maybe it did bent it if
right<00:05:24.290> anyway<00:05:25.510> it<00:05:26.510> consumes<00:05:26.930> one<00:05:27.169> redstone

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
right anyway it consumes one redstone

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.380 
right anyway it consumes one redstone
dust<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:28.190> will<00:05:28.729> use<00:05:29.390> hang<00:05:30.350> on<00:05:30.470> if<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:32.180> right

if<00:06:19.640> you<00:06:19.729> charge<00:06:19.970> it<00:06:20.030> up<00:06:20.150> it<00:06:20.330> increases<00:06:20.960> the

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
if you charge it up it increases the

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.260 
if you charge it up it increases the
water<00:06:21.410> vaporizing<00:06:22.039> effect<00:06:22.370> so<00:06:22.669> now<00:06:22.880> if<00:06:23.090> I<00:06:23.240> go

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
water vaporizing effect so now if I go

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.610 
water vaporizing effect so now if I go
like<00:06:23.660> this

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
like this

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.219
