figured<00:00:09.660> it's<00:00:09.809> just<00:00:10.019> something<00:00:10.320> fun<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.650> do

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
figured it's just something fun to do

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.690 
figured it's just something fun to do
for<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.490> spring<00:00:11.820> semester<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:13.519> the<00:00:14.519> weather

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
for the spring semester and the weather

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.220 
for the spring semester and the weather
is<00:00:14.849> getting<00:00:14.969> nice<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.450> what<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> hell<00:00:15.929> why<00:00:16.199> not

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
is getting nice so what the hell why not

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.950 
is getting nice so what the hell why not
a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> my<00:00:17.490> friends<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:17.970> into<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a lot of my friends are into this so I

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.240 
a lot of my friends are into this so I
figure<00:00:19.500> it'd<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.770> fun<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> group<00:00:20.640> I

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
figure it'd be fun to do as a group I

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.700 
figure it'd be fun to do as a group I
picked<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.580> online<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.260> 30

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
picked this up online if I think like 30

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.640 
picked this up online if I think like 30
bucks<00:00:25.859> which<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.119> surprised<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:27.779> it's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
bucks which I was surprised because it's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.319 
bucks which I was surprised because it's
a<00:00:28.830> different<00:00:29.580> model<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.410> it<00:00:31.410> comes<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.740> just

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
a different model and it comes with just

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.680 
a different model and it comes with just
different<00:00:33.329> colored<00:00:33.899> darts<00:00:35.270> really<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> big

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
different colored darts really not a big

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.830 
different colored darts really not a big
deal<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.649> I've<00:00:38.219> seen<00:00:38.520> these<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:38.940> way<00:00:39.570> more

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
deal but I've seen these go way more

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360 
deal but I've seen these go way more
than<00:00:40.020> thirty<00:00:40.260> five<00:00:40.469> dollars<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.010> because

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
than thirty five dollars just because

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.810 
than thirty five dollars just because
there's<00:00:42.270> sort<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> rare<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.469> find<00:00:43.730> they<00:00:44.730> don't

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
there's sort of rare to find they don't

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
there's sort of rare to find they don't
land<00:00:45.030> lean<00:00:45.300> manufactured<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.230> many<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.710> then

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
land lean manufactured so many and then

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.760 
land lean manufactured so many and then
they<00:00:47.399> stop<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.140> something<00:00:49.379> cool

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
they stop so this is just something cool

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.279 
they stop so this is just something cool
and<00:00:50.329> something<00:00:51.329> that'll<00:00:51.600> distinguish<00:00:52.110> me

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and something that'll distinguish me

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.439 
and something that'll distinguish me
from<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.890> group<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.879> our<00:00:54.030> guns<00:00:54.210> don't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
from the group so that our guns don't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.760 
from the group so that our guns don't
really<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.809> mixed<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.260> or<00:00:55.410> anything

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
really get mixed up or anything

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.670 
really get mixed up or anything
and<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:58.140> also<00:00:59.090> modified<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.750> many<00:01:00.989> ways<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and I also modified it in many ways I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.820 
and I also modified it in many ways I
added<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:03.739> dollar<00:01:04.739> store<00:01:05.720> flashlight

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
added a dollar store flashlight

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.929 
added a dollar store flashlight
originally<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.890> bought<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.700> didn't

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
originally I bought this and I didn't

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
originally I bought this and I didn't
really<00:01:09.119> expect<00:01:09.479> much<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> but<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.950> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
really expect much out of it but this is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
really expect much out of it but this is
like<00:01:11.400> amazing<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.240> didn't<00:01:12.510> realize<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:12.960> first

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
like amazing I didn't realize at first

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.980 
like amazing I didn't realize at first
that<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.890> laser<00:01:14.250> pointer<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.780> it's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that this has a laser pointer it so it's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
that this has a laser pointer it so it's
like<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.140> laser<00:01:16.409> sight<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.909> really

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
like a laser sight and then a really

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.740 
like a laser sight and then a really
bright<00:01:18.540> LED<00:01:18.990> flashlight<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:21.540> paid

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
bright LED flashlight and I paid

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
bright LED flashlight and I paid
spray-painted<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.799> fluorescent<00:01:23.400> orange

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
spray-painted at the fluorescent orange

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.210 
spray-painted at the fluorescent orange
to<00:01:23.790> make<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> blend<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:25.560> looks<00:01:25.799> pretty<00:01:26.009> cool

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
to make it blend in it looks pretty cool

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.179 
to make it blend in it looks pretty cool
I<00:01:26.520> think<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:28.400> removed<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.640> air<00:01:29.790> restrictor<00:01:30.420> i

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.640 

reinforced<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> spring<00:01:36.020> by<00:01:37.020> stretching<00:01:37.439> it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
reinforced the spring by stretching it

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.080 
reinforced the spring by stretching it
out<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.570> also<00:01:39.570> added<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.320> power<00:01:40.590> stock<00:01:41.090> because

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
out I also added a power stock because

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
out I also added a power stock because
when<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> cocked<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.259> cut<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.829> off<00:01:44.070> here

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
when this is cocked I cut this off here

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.179 
when this is cocked I cut this off here
so<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.000> actually<00:01:45.680> juts<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.829> whenever

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
so that this actually juts out whenever

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.550 
so that this actually juts out whenever
you<00:01:47.250> call<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.560> this

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you call it when you it and this

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.440 
you call it when you it and this
extra<00:01:50.040> spring<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:51.090> adds<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> little

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
extra spring I think just adds a little

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.730 
extra spring I think just adds a little
bit<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.689> power<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
bit more power to it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.819 
bit more power to it
I<00:01:52.920> also<00:01:53.729> padded<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.899> plunger<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
I also padded the plunger so that it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.920 
I also padded the plunger so that it
doesn't<00:01:56.310> break<00:01:56.430> by<00:01:56.850> putting<00:01:58.670> adhesive<00:01:59.930> foam

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
doesn't break by putting adhesive foam

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.560 
doesn't break by putting adhesive foam
on<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.850> end<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> tube<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:05.570> modified

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
on the one end of the tube I modified

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.249 
on the one end of the tube I modified
the<00:02:06.780> clip<00:02:07.049> lock<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.710> modify<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> jamb<00:02:08.640> door<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the clip lock I modify the jamb door I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.860

I<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:13.160> that's<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:14.440> but<00:02:15.730> what<00:02:16.730> I'm<00:02:16.819> trying<00:02:17.569> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
I think that's it but what I'm trying to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.750 
I think that's it but what I'm trying to
do<00:02:18.020> in<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.319> future<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:20.950> modify<00:02:21.950> these<00:02:22.010> into

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
do in the future is modify these into

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.920 
do in the future is modify these into
the<00:02:22.940> gun<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.720> was<00:02:24.620> thinking<00:02:25.240> either<00:02:26.240> modified

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
the gun I was thinking either modified

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.650 
the gun I was thinking either modified
into<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.319> actual<00:02:27.650> handle<00:02:28.190> or<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.970> was<00:02:29.600> gonna

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
into the actual handle or I was gonna

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.370 
into the actual handle or I was gonna
put<00:02:30.050> some<00:02:30.290> neodymium<00:02:31.130> magnets<00:02:31.580> on<00:02:31.730> these<00:02:31.910> and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
put some neodymium magnets on these and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.220 
put some neodymium magnets on these and
then<00:02:33.380> add<00:02:33.800> some<00:02:33.830> other<00:02:34.400> ones<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:34.970> here<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.200> that

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
then add some other ones on here so that

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.790 
then add some other ones on here so that
it<00:02:36.860> will<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.010> stick<00:02:37.340> there<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:38.380> if<00:02:39.380> my<00:02:39.590> gun

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
it will just stick there and if my gun

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.340 
it will just stick there and if my gun
jams<00:02:40.220> or<00:02:40.580> if<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.209> run<00:02:41.420> out<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.569> ammo<00:02:41.989> at<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.170> bad

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
jams or if I run out of ammo at a bad

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.790 
jams or if I run out of ammo at a bad
time<00:02:42.380> I<00:02:42.950> have<00:02:43.730> these<00:02:44.060> two<00:02:44.269> pistols<00:02:44.720> which<00:02:45.590> I

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
time I have these two pistols which I

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.100 
time I have these two pistols which I
also<00:02:45.950> modified<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:47.110> rotated<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:50.110> priming

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
also modified I rotated the priming

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.430 
also modified I rotated the priming
handle<00:02:51.530> here<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.489> it's<00:02:52.640> facing<00:02:53.390> me<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.019> I

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
handle here so that it's facing me and I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.810 
handle here so that it's facing me and I
just<00:02:54.470> thought<00:02:54.800> that's<00:02:55.040> easier<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.550> it<00:02:55.640> looks

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
just thought that's easier and it looks

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.870 
just thought that's easier and it looks
better<00:02:56.030> actually<00:02:56.269> also<00:02:57.370> took<00:02:58.370> out<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.760> air

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
better actually also took out the air

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.309 
better actually also took out the air
restrictors<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.810> modified<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.590> plunger<00:03:04.190> by

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
restrictors and modified the plunger by

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.620 
restrictors and modified the plunger by
wrapping<00:03:06.319> teflon<00:03:07.220> tape<00:03:07.430> which<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.390> stuff

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
wrapping teflon tape which is the stuff

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.370 
wrapping teflon tape which is the stuff
here<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.890> used<00:03:10.069> for<00:03:10.310> plumbing<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:11.350> create<00:03:12.350> a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
here it's used for plumbing to create a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.670 
here it's used for plumbing to create a
better<00:03:12.530> seal<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.850> you<00:03:14.209> just<00:03:14.620> kind<00:03:15.620> of

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
better seal and you you just kind of

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.470 
better seal and you you just kind of
roll<00:03:15.829> it<00:03:16.010> into<00:03:16.160> like<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.430> little<00:03:16.519> string<00:03:17.120> here

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
roll it into like a little string here

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.289 
roll it into like a little string here
and<00:03:17.600> then<00:03:18.260> put<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.620> where<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.250> o-ring<00:03:19.640> was<00:03:19.910> and

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
and then put it where the o-ring was and

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.210 
and then put it where the o-ring was and
then<00:03:20.870> put<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.140> o-ring<00:03:21.470> on<00:03:21.590> top<00:03:21.829> of<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.100> to

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
then put the o-ring on top of it to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.759 
then put the o-ring on top of it to
secure<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.450> creates<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:24.140> better<00:03:24.320> seal

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
secure it and that creates a better seal

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.180 
secure it and that creates a better seal
and<00:03:25.130> a<00:03:25.280> more<00:03:25.959> powerful<00:03:26.959> blast<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:28.010> air

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
and a more powerful blast of air

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.710 
and a more powerful blast of air
whenever<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:28.940> pull<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.269> trigger<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:32.239> can

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
whenever you pull the trigger so you can

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.740 
whenever you pull the trigger so you can
see<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.340> the<00:03:34.610> seal<00:03:34.910> is<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.329> good<00:03:35.570> now

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
see that this the seal is so good now

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.500 
see that this the seal is so good now
that<00:03:36.470> when<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.620> prime<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.160> there's<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.239> vacuum

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
that when I prime it there's a vacuum

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.830 
that when I prime it there's a vacuum
that<00:03:38.720> sucks<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.440> dart<00:03:40.160> into<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:41.209> chamber<00:03:41.630> so

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
that sucks the dart into the chamber so

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.440 
that sucks the dart into the chamber so
it<00:03:42.680> works<00:03:42.859> real<00:03:43.070> well<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.459> these<00:03:44.000> things<00:03:44.180> are

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
it works real well and these things are

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.569 
it works real well and these things are
ridiculously<00:03:45.230> powerful<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:48.579> that's

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
ridiculously powerful so that's

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:50.920 
ridiculously powerful so that's
something<00:03:49.820> I<00:03:50.030> want<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.269> just<00:03:50.480> carry<00:03:50.780> around

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
something I want to just carry around

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.400 
something I want to just carry around
with<00:03:51.320> me<00:03:52.030> because<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.420> way<00:03:53.570> our<00:03:53.600> campus<00:03:54.140> plays

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
with me because the way our campus plays

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.710 
with me because the way our campus plays
or<00:03:54.890> I<00:03:54.950> don't<00:03:55.100> know<00:03:55.160> if<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.430> all<00:03:55.790> hvz<00:03:56.480> games

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
or I don't know if this is all hvz games

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.539 
or I don't know if this is all hvz games
once<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.650> game<00:03:57.829> starts<00:03:59.829> any<00:04:00.829> zombie<00:04:01.250> can<00:04:01.400> get

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
once the game starts any zombie can get

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.340 
once the game starts any zombie can get
you<00:04:01.730> at<00:04:01.820> any<00:04:01.940> time<00:04:02.000> except<00:04:02.900> for<00:04:02.930> there's<00:04:03.200> some

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.080 
you at any time except for there's some
safe<00:04:03.650> zones<00:04:04.010> like<00:04:04.310> they<00:04:04.430> can't<00:04:04.700> come<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.000> the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
safe zones like they can't come to the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.660 
safe zones like they can't come to the
classroom<00:04:05.600> they<00:04:05.900> can't<00:04:06.140> like<00:04:06.769> get<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.519> while

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
when I'm not carrying around this huge

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.920 
when I'm not carrying around this huge
log<00:04:21.260> gun<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:22.039> I've<00:04:22.760> seen<00:04:23.030> people<00:04:23.390> walk<00:04:23.630> around

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.159 
so also the round drum has just a
different<00:04:44.160> design<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.759> it<00:04:44.910> really<00:04:45.840> nothing

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
different design to it really nothing

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.230 
different design to it really nothing
that<00:04:46.289> fancy<00:04:47.750> but<00:04:48.860> 35<00:04:49.860> darts<00:04:50.310> hopefully<00:04:51.210> I

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
that fancy but 35 darts hopefully I

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.730 
that fancy but 35 darts hopefully I
won't<00:04:51.419> be<00:04:51.660> having<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.830> reload<00:04:53.130> too<00:04:53.370> much<00:04:53.580> so

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
won't be having to reload too much so

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.260 
won't be having to reload too much so
that's<00:04:55.740> why<00:04:56.009> I<00:04:56.039> picked<00:04:56.400> up<00:04:56.550> this<00:04:56.759> one<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.000> feel

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
that's why I picked up this one I feel

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.439 
that's why I picked up this one I feel
like<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:58.199> does<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.590> most<00:04:58.910> with<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.120> amount<00:05:00.360> of

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
like it does the most with the amount of

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.510 
like it does the most with the amount of
size<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.020> have<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:02.100> get<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.340> most

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
size that you have and you get the most

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.689 
size that you have and you get the most
a<00:05:02.729> munition<00:05:03.180> which<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.539> what<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:03.840> really<00:05:03.990> need

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
a munition which is what you really need

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.950
