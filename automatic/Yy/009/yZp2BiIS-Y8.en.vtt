 never had the opportunity of what 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.640
 they wanted 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.070
 until the primary in the year elaborated as

 1500 pesos per week what are you doing 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.590
 while you travel these states miguel 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.990
 but you're 16 years young 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.660
 only 16 years traveling around Mexico my 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.360
 question is how do you do to subsist 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.220
 to live I've traveled in the cities 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.220
 veracruz hidalgo and guanajuato 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.390
 right now I am in 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.020
 Guadalajara 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.020
 saying it 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.970
 and 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.680
 it happens in doing something to be able 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.690
 hold on when they are well 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.789
 they're going to see us coming right now 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.669
 can everyone who can work then 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.940
 who works at the most, save one 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:32.350
 quantity 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:35.250
 of what our month earns and can 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.940
 have some business that can give them 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.990
 for more ease of eating 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.460
 with what 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:48.750
 I won I could not do anything like that 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:52.099
 to have a way to be able to live 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.259
 at this point that people who see it 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.840
 the same thing happens to me that we do not 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.280
 let's think and prevent that we are going 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.349
 to make our life in the future 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.060
 because we're all going to get to where 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.729
 you are sitting quietly now 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.400
 a smile I hope the same does not happen to them 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:11.090
 but if it happens to withstand it is 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:16.060
 what are they for? 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.060
 people who did not think like me
