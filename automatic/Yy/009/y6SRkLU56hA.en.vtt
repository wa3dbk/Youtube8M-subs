another session of Dark Souls PvP and
another<00:00:16.350> weapon<00:00:16.529> showcase<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.789> time<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.210> am

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
another weapon showcase this time I am

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.140 
another weapon showcase this time I am
using<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.140> painting<00:00:19.650> guardian<00:00:20.010> sword<00:00:20.310> this

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
using the painting guardian sword this

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.900 
using the painting guardian sword this
little<00:00:21.779> curved<00:00:22.350> sword<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.100> Phasis<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.609> little

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
little curved sword and Phasis on little

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.810 
little curved sword and Phasis on little
for<00:00:24.090> those<00:00:24.180> who<00:00:24.330> cook<00:00:24.539> intel<00:00:24.840> has<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.250> highest

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
for those who cook intel has the highest

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019 
for those who cook intel has the highest
AR<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.599> all<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.320> curved<00:00:28.560> swords<00:00:29.039> however<00:00:29.789> it

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
AR of all the curved swords however it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.880 
AR of all the curved swords however it
is<00:00:30.150> also<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.689> shortest<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.500> guess<00:00:31.650> that's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
is also the shortest and I guess that's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250 
is also the shortest and I guess that's
how<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.189> decided<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.669> balance<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:34.079> also

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
how they decided to balance it it also

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.220 
how they decided to balance it it also
has<00:00:34.710> bleed<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:36.360> cause<00:00:36.540> bleeding<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.140> all

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
has bleed and can cause bleeding and all

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.040 
has bleed and can cause bleeding and all
that<00:00:37.410> good<00:00:37.590> stuff<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.890> goes<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.050> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
that good stuff that goes with it and I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
that good stuff that goes with it and I
mean<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.640> around<00:00:41.850> before<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.360> gold

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
mean it was around before the gold

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.619 
mean it was around before the gold
tracer<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.079> was<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:44.280> fairly<00:00:44.760> decent<00:00:45.090> fairly

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
tracer this was a fairly decent fairly

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.709 
tracer this was a fairly decent fairly
unique<00:00:46.020> weapon<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> still<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> kind<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.480> but

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
unique weapon and still is kind of but

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.940 
unique weapon and still is kind of but
the<00:00:48.840> gold<00:00:49.020> tracer<00:00:49.260> definitely<00:00:49.800> has

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the gold tracer definitely has

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.510 
the gold tracer definitely has
overshadowed<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.440> weapon<00:00:52.770> overall

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
overshadowed it so this weapon overall

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.340 
overshadowed it so this weapon overall
it's<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> few<00:00:54.149> good<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it's got a few good things going for it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's got a few good things going for it
it's<00:00:55.829> got<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> few<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:58.289> really

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
it's got a few well more like one really

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.819 
it's got a few well more like one really
really<00:00:59.399> bad<00:00:59.760> thing<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.440> that's<00:01:01.440> pretty<00:01:01.680> much

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
really bad thing and that's pretty much

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.470 
really bad thing and that's pretty much
the<00:01:01.980> only<00:01:02.039> kind<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> Scott's<00:01:02.609> got<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.059> major

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the only kind of Scott's got one major

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
the only kind of Scott's got one major
flaw<00:01:03.899> I'm<00:01:04.080> guessing<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.589> tell<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
flaw I'm guessing you can tell what it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.480 
flaw I'm guessing you can tell what it
is<00:01:05.309> already<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:07.530> anyway<00:01:07.920> let's<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.189> started

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
is already but anyway let's get started

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.030 
is already but anyway let's get started
with<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.670> basic<00:01:09.150> info<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.020> weapon<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
with some basic info on the weapon the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.980 
with some basic info on the weapon the
painting<00:01:11.610> Guardian<00:01:11.970> sword<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> weighs<00:01:12.600> one

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
painting Guardian sword it weighs one

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.380 
painting Guardian sword it weighs one
and<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> half<00:01:13.320> units<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.100> requires<00:01:14.880> seven

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and a half units here requires seven

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
and a half units here requires seven
strengths<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> twenty<00:01:16.439> dexterity<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.430> order

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
strengths and twenty dexterity in order

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.149 
strengths and twenty dexterity in order
to<00:01:17.850> wield<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.320> an<00:01:19.470> e<00:01:19.619> scaling<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to wield it and it has an e scaling and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
to wield it and it has an e scaling and
strength<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.850> scaling<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.509> dexterity

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
strength and an a scaling and dexterity

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.039 
strength and an a scaling and dexterity
as<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.860> said<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.430> cause<00:01:23.670> bleeding<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
as I said it can cause bleeding so it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.010 
as I said it can cause bleeding so it
does<00:01:25.259> 33<00:01:25.950> per<00:01:26.130> hit<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> bleeds<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.600> one<00:01:27.810> third

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
does 33 per hit and bleeds for one third

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
does 33 per hit and bleeds for one third
of<00:01:28.110> your<00:01:28.170> opponent's<00:01:28.650> total<00:01:28.950> health<00:01:29.130> which<00:01:29.790> is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
of your opponent's total health which is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.020 
of your opponent's total health which is
a<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.570> know<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:30.930> good<00:01:31.170> thing<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
a you know it's a very good thing and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.100 
a you know it's a very good thing and
it's<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> pretty<00:01:33.390> cool<00:01:33.630> moves<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it's got a pretty cool moves that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.770 
it's got a pretty cool moves that
definitely<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:34.979> cool<00:01:35.790> looking<00:01:36.299> move<00:01:36.540> set

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
definitely a very cool looking move set

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
definitely a very cool looking move set
not<00:01:36.930> necessarily<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> most<00:01:37.770> practical<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
not necessarily the most practical so I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.870 
not necessarily the most practical so I
guess<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> does<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.390> cons<00:01:39.630> after<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.880> as

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
guess it does have two cons after all as

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
guess it does have two cons after all as
long<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.210> we're<00:01:42.360> talking<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.780> cons<00:01:43.110> let's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
long as we're talking about cons let's

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.039 
long as we're talking about cons let's
get<00:01:43.619> started<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.430> cons<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> weapon

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
get started with the cons of this weapon

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.190 
get started with the cons of this weapon
now<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> biggest<00:01:47.100> con<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> weapon<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
now the biggest con of the weapon it is

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
now the biggest con of the weapon it is
so<00:01:49.560> stupidly<00:01:50.310> short<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.229> many

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
so stupidly short there are so many

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.469 
so stupidly short there are so many
times<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.860> am<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.610> pressing<00:01:53.939> r1<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.390> I'm

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
times I am just pressing r1 and I'm

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.749 
times I am just pressing r1 and I'm
misjudging<00:01:54.780> my<00:01:55.259> distance<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
misjudging my distance with this thing I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.819 
misjudging my distance with this thing I
just<00:01:57.270> couldn't<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:57.990> used<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> shortness

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
just couldn't get used to the shortness

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.910 
just couldn't get used to the shortness
of<00:01:58.860> its<00:01:59.219> move<00:01:59.460> set<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.270> its<00:02:00.570> reach<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.770> just

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of its move set of its reach of I just

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.109 
of its move set of its reach of I just
couldn't<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> shortness<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
couldn't get you to the shortness of the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.030 
couldn't get you to the shortness of the
weapon<00:02:03.390> there's<00:02:04.100> really<00:02:05.100> nothing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
weapon there's really nothing

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.130 
weapon there's really nothing
other<00:02:06.190> than<00:02:06.370> that<00:02:06.610> that<00:02:07.090> really<00:02:07.420> sort<00:02:08.050> of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
other than that that really sort of

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.410 
other than that that really sort of
stuck<00:02:08.380> out<00:02:08.560> as<00:02:09.310> far<00:02:09.520> as<00:02:09.550> cons<00:02:09.880> are<00:02:10.090> concerned

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
stuck out as far as cons are concerned

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.060 
stuck out as far as cons are concerned
until<00:02:10.960> just<00:02:11.260> now<00:02:11.320> when<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.650> was<00:02:11.680> talking<00:02:11.800> about

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
until just now when I was talking about

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.090 
until just now when I was talking about
its<00:02:12.340> moveset<00:02:12.760> its<00:02:13.510> are<00:02:13.660> twos<00:02:13.930> yes<00:02:14.620> they<00:02:14.920> look

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
its moveset its are twos yes they look

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.630 
its moveset its are twos yes they look
cool<00:02:15.750> they're<00:02:16.750> not<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.350> useful<00:02:17.620> unless<00:02:18.070> you

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
cool they're not that useful unless you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.580 
cool they're not that useful unless you
have<00:02:18.790> someone<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.540> great<00:02:20.050> shield<00:02:20.350> and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
have someone with a great shield and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.760 
have someone with a great shield and
they're<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.630> blocking<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.870> all<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.380> it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
they're just blocking it all and it's

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.320 
they're just blocking it all and it's
racking<00:02:24.160> up<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> bleed<00:02:24.610> damage<00:02:24.880> on<00:02:25.030> them<00:02:25.150> then

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
racking up the bleed damage on them then

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.390 
racking up the bleed damage on them then
it<00:02:25.450> looks<00:02:25.600> cool<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.110> you're<00:02:26.680> doing<00:02:26.950> something

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
it looks cool and you're doing something

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.430 
it looks cool and you're doing something
at<00:02:27.670> least<00:02:27.850> or<00:02:28.630> if<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.110> someone<00:02:29.320> with

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
at least or if you have someone with

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.680 
at least or if you have someone with
zero<00:02:30.130> poise<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.820> stun<00:02:31.060> them<00:02:31.210> with<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.540> and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
zero poise and you stun them with it and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.680 
zero poise and you stun them with it and
yes<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.560> does<00:02:32.590> work<00:02:33.040> however<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.300> chances

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
yes that does work however the chances

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.140 
yes that does work however the chances
of<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.930> happening<00:02:35.580> it's<00:02:36.580> not<00:02:36.790> too<00:02:36.940> useful

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
of it happening it's not too useful

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.020 
of it happening it's not too useful
unfortunate<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:38.350> true<00:02:38.580> really<00:02:39.580> though<00:02:39.790> those

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
unfortunate but true really though those

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.330 
unfortunate but true really though those
are<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.300> only<00:02:40.480> two<00:02:40.840> cons<00:02:41.140> of<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.740> weapon<00:02:42.130> I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
are the only two cons of this weapon I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.880 
are the only two cons of this weapon I
mean<00:02:42.880> if<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.690> weapon<00:02:44.050> was<00:02:44.200> longer<00:02:44.620> than<00:02:44.800> it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
mean if this weapon was longer than it

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.040 
mean if this weapon was longer than it
would<00:02:44.920> be<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.340> buffalo<00:02:45.940> gold<00:02:46.209> tracer<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.870> has

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
would be a buffalo gold tracer that has

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.590 
would be a buffalo gold tracer that has
a<00:02:47.080> higher<00:02:47.350> AR<00:02:47.830> that's<00:02:48.190> pretty<00:02:49.060> much<00:02:49.209> what<00:02:49.420> this

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
a higher AR that's pretty much what this

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.380 
a higher AR that's pretty much what this
weapon<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.020> but<00:02:50.530> short<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:52.120> being<00:02:52.300> said

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
weapon is but short so that being said

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.080 
weapon is but short so that being said
if<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.500> were<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.950> buff<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.430> weapon<00:02:54.820> then<00:02:54.970> you

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
if you were to buff this weapon then you

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.910 
if you were to buff this weapon then you
would<00:02:55.180> essentially<00:02:55.510> have<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.870> brand<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.650> build

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
would essentially have a brand and build

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.960 
would essentially have a brand and build
that<00:02:57.790> just<00:02:58.209> has<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.360> shorter<00:02:58.930> weapon<00:02:59.380> and

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
that just has a shorter weapon and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.640 
that just has a shorter weapon and
causes<00:03:00.970> bleeding<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:01.450> well<00:03:01.630> not<00:03:02.470> necessarily

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
causes bleeding as well not necessarily

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.040 
causes bleeding as well not necessarily
the<00:03:03.100> most<00:03:03.220> useful<00:03:03.730> thing<00:03:03.970> because<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.450> type

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
the most useful thing because that type

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.660 
the most useful thing because that type
of<00:03:05.080> build<00:03:05.470> really<00:03:05.770> relies<00:03:06.100> on<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.400> damage

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
of build really relies on the damage

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.080 
of build really relies on the damage
from<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.970> buff<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:08.050> reach<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.590> has

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
from the buff and the reach that it has

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
from the buff and the reach that it has
you're<00:03:10.090> not<00:03:10.239> going<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.450> bleed<00:03:10.630> someone<00:03:10.930> before

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
you're not going to bleed someone before

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.990 
you're not going to bleed someone before
you<00:03:11.380> end<00:03:11.530> up<00:03:11.620> killing<00:03:11.800> them<00:03:12.100> with<00:03:12.220> your<00:03:12.430> dark

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
you end up killing them with your dark

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.860 
you end up killing them with your dark
moon<00:03:13.269> blade

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
moon blade

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.840 
moon blade
alchun<00:03:14.080> so<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:16.239> what<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.600> anyway

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
alchun so it is what it is anyway

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.180 
alchun so it is what it is anyway
the<00:03:18.850> pros<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.480> weapon<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.920> got<00:03:21.100> the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
the pros of the weapon it's got the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.900 
the pros of the weapon it's got the
highest<00:03:21.370> AR<00:03:21.910> of<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:24.160> curved<00:03:24.489> swords

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
highest AR of the of the curved swords

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.860 
highest AR of the of the curved swords
it<00:03:25.420> has<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:26.130> fairly<00:03:27.130> decent<00:03:27.730> move<00:03:28.150> set<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.660> can

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
it has a fairly decent move set it can

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.610 
it has a fairly decent move set it can
stun<00:03:29.260> pretty<00:03:29.650> well<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.910> has<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.720> decent<00:03:32.170> damage

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
stun pretty well it has a decent damage

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.520 
stun pretty well it has a decent damage
output<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> curved<00:03:34.360> sword<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:35.049> has<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
output for a curved sword this has the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.400 
output for a curved sword this has the
best<00:03:35.830> damage<00:03:36.220> output<00:03:36.549> based<00:03:37.150> purely<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:37.930> it's

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
best damage output based purely and it's

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.520 
best damage output based purely and it's
well<00:03:39.340> victory<00:03:40.269> lands<00:03:40.540> physical<00:03:41.080> damage<00:03:41.380> it's

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
well victory lands physical damage it's

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.770 
well victory lands physical damage it's
got<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.799> best<00:03:41.950> damage<00:03:42.250> output<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.420> really

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
got the best damage output so you really

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.890 
got the best damage output so you really
can't<00:03:43.989> go<00:03:44.110> wrong<00:03:44.290> with<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.480> doesn't

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
can't go wrong with that but it doesn't

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.350 
can't go wrong with that but it doesn't
change<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.170> fact<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.650> it's<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.120> short

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
change the fact that it's it's so short

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.170 
change the fact that it's it's so short
there<00:03:50.200> are<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:50.530> many<00:03:50.620> times<00:03:50.920> where<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.790> if

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
there are so many times where you if

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.270 
there are so many times where you if
you're<00:03:52.450> anything<00:03:52.630> like<00:03:52.900> me<00:03:52.959> will<00:03:53.830> misjudge

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
you're anything like me will misjudge

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.340 
you're anything like me will misjudge
your<00:03:54.459> distance<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.090> it'll<00:03:55.959> get<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.200> in

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
your distance and it'll get you in

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.440 
your distance and it'll get you in
trouble<00:03:57.010> or<00:03:57.280> it'll<00:03:57.670> just<00:03:57.700> make<00:03:57.940> things<00:03:58.180> really

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
trouble or it'll just make things really

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.630 
trouble or it'll just make things really
difficult<00:03:58.570> or<00:03:59.530> make<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.830> fight<00:04:00.010> longer<00:04:00.459> than

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
difficult or make the fight longer than

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.620 
difficult or make the fight longer than
it<00:04:00.850> really<00:04:01.090> needs<00:04:01.269> to<00:04:01.810> be<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:03.489> just<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.120> just<00:04:04.180> is

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
it really needs to be it just it just is

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.970 
it really needs to be it just it just is
the<00:04:04.840> way<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.650> short<00:04:05.890> weapon<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
the way it is it's a short weapon and

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.220 
the way it is it's a short weapon and
you<00:04:07.580> should<00:04:07.819> expect<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.300> going<00:04:08.659> in<00:04:08.840> you're

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
you should expect that going in you're

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.259 
you should expect that going in you're
going<00:04:09.409> to<00:04:09.680> take<00:04:09.950> a<00:04:09.980> while<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.430> get<00:04:10.730> used<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.030> it

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
going to take a while to get used to it

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.339 
going to take a while to get used to it
and<00:04:11.450> be<00:04:12.200> missing<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.650> bunch<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.099> attacks<00:04:13.430> so

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
and be missing a bunch of attacks so

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.170 
and be missing a bunch of attacks so
really<00:04:15.349> that's<00:04:15.590> all<00:04:16.010> I<00:04:16.220> can<00:04:16.370> say<00:04:16.850> about<00:04:16.970> that

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
really that's all I can say about that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.420 
really that's all I can say about that
it's<00:04:17.690> just<00:04:17.810> too<00:04:18.139> short<00:04:18.440> for<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.889> be<00:04:19.010> very

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
it's just too short for it to be very

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.510 
it's just too short for it to be very
useful<00:04:19.790> in<00:04:20.269> PvP<00:04:20.930> unless<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:22.010> course<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:22.340> put<00:04:22.460> a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
useful in PvP unless of course you put a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.040 
useful in PvP unless of course you put a
buff<00:04:22.699> on<00:04:22.910> it<00:04:23.060> but<00:04:23.240> then<00:04:23.389> you'd<00:04:23.600> be<00:04:23.750> better<00:04:23.930> off

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
buff on it but then you'd be better off

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.870 
buff on it but then you'd be better off
with<00:04:24.350> something<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.800> has<00:04:24.949> more<00:04:25.160> range<00:04:25.520> like

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
with something that has more range like

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.900 
with something that has more range like
a<00:04:26.090> FAL<00:04:26.360> Sheehan<00:04:26.660> or<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> scimitar<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:28.160> it<00:04:28.790> is

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
a FAL Sheehan or a scimitar so it is

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.340 
a FAL Sheehan or a scimitar so it is
what<00:04:29.060> it<00:04:29.150> isn't<00:04:29.330> then<00:04:29.780> if<00:04:29.900> you're<00:04:30.020> just<00:04:30.050> going

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
what it isn't then if you're just going

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.170 
what it isn't then if you're just going
for<00:04:30.530> straight<00:04:30.830> bleed<00:04:31.100> damage<00:04:31.520> you're<00:04:31.970> just

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
for straight bleed damage you're just

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.330 
for straight bleed damage you're just
better<00:04:32.600> off<00:04:32.660> with<00:04:32.930> gold<00:04:33.139> tracer<00:04:33.560> because<00:04:33.860> yes

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
better off with gold tracer because yes

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.640 
better off with gold tracer because yes
you've<00:04:34.580> got<00:04:34.850> useless<00:04:35.360> r2<00:04:35.660> still<00:04:36.050> our<00:04:36.290> next

move<00:05:06.770> set<00:05:07.160> maybe<00:05:07.430> but<00:05:08.389> because<00:05:08.840> it's<00:05:09.020> pretty

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
move set maybe but because it's pretty

the weapon it's manageable that's for

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.420 
the weapon it's manageable that's for
sure<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:20.030> has<00:05:20.330> a<00:05:20.510> decent<00:05:21.110> AR<00:05:21.530> can<00:05:21.950> do<00:05:22.099> bleed

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
sure it has a decent AR can do bleed

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.560 
sure it has a decent AR can do bleed
damage<00:05:22.880> but<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.410> preferred<00:05:25.030> nope<00:05:26.060> not<00:05:26.389> in

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
damage but is it preferred nope not in

damage but is it preferred nope not in
the<00:05:26.660> slightest

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
the slightest

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.339 
the slightest
so<00:05:28.000> anyway<00:05:29.000> there<00:05:29.330> is<00:05:29.450> one<00:05:29.660> fight<00:05:29.870> left<00:05:30.080> this

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
so anyway there is one fight left this

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.990 
so anyway there is one fight left this
would<00:05:30.530> be<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.860> last<00:05:31.099> bite<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:31.669> just<00:05:31.910> to
