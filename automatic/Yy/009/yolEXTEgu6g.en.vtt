this<00:00:39.870> way<00:00:40.190> Regular<00:00:41.190> Show<00:00:41.300> used<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.600> drive

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
itself on stupidity and no longer does

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.139

sergeant Craig drives itself when
stupidity<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.809> don't<00:00:49.200> think<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.620> ever

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
stupidity I don't think that will ever

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.150 
stupidity I don't think that will ever
change<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> show<00:00:51.539> does<00:00:51.899> seem<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> drive

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
change the show does seem to drive

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.130 
change the show does seem to drive
yourself<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.610> stupidity<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.629> does<00:00:54.930> keep

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
yourself on stupidity but it does keep

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.990

tone<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.239> but<00:01:00.449> humor<00:01:00.809> down<00:01:00.989> um<00:01:01.609> I<00:01:02.719> do<00:01:03.719> think

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
tone the but humor down um I do think

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
tone the but humor down um I do think
