 hello friends in this video I'll show you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.140
 my top 8 games for sony ericsson and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 He did hear to be honest, I did not 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.570
 they like the top that there is in the good line 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.509
 let's start put 8 street fighter at 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.340
 palante bueno does not have good graphics 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.890
 but since it's from the street saga 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.960
 fighter is good but nothing else has 5 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.380
 characters in arcade mode but they are 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.109
 I recommend post 7 it's about iron man 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.179
 2 landis cap seriously has good 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.160
 graphics but nothing else looks 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.170
 forward does not look to the right or to the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 left or by the devil but they are 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.350
 I recommend posts 6 is the sonic fucking 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.390
 a lease does not have good graphics but 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 it's about the day you're sonic and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.879
 night you are sonning wolf has many 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 levels and I recommend them put 5 you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.199
 it's about 'assassin's creed' one does not have 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.530
 so many graphics but they have many 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.870
 forms of murder I recommend them 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.899
 position 4 is about zombie infection 2 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.539
 it's a zombie game as a resident 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.790
 evil 5 are you and another giving them promo to 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.680

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.060
 well we got to the three finalists 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.070
 32nd place 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.410
 bronze is about 'assassin's creed' 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.570
 3 I explain why he is in this 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.450
 put because nothing else has 7 levels 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.760
 but it's very good I recommend them then 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.580
 all that is the silver one is about gang 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.770
 starr 3 landis cap is a good game 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.660
 a lot of graphics but you do not have any more 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.520

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.500
 for the gold is for so so so so 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.780
 those asins believe revelations is a game 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.750
 it's very good many addictive graphics and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.180
