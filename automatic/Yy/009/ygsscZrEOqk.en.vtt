00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.439
 who get to know the local bird world 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.570
 I would like to start with it in winter 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.259
 because then the number of bird species 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.090
 manageable above all the numerous 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.250
 insectivores are heading south 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.550
 pulled because they no longer food 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.829
 find a bird by its typical 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.530
 recognizing singing is for one 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.120
 beginner difficult but usually 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.760
 Sing the people in the cold 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.260
 not season 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.019
 they start again in the first 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.720
 spring when you mark your territory 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.830
 and attract females 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.589
 in winter it means for the 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.019
 birdwatchers therefore take place 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.489
 hear 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.040
 some of the birds that hibernate here 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.509
 can be with food in the garden 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.509
 or lure on the balcony 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.500
 in freezing temperatures and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.540
 snowfall cozy in the warm 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 Flat to sit and drift on 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 feeding place close up 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.330
 to watch is for a first 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.330
 Get to know our bird world ideally 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.040
 even if there is no snow in the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.020
 winter the food for the birds 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.990
 scarce and they like to come 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.540
 fodder house anyway you can feed 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 do not confuse with species protection because 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.460
 the visitors are by no means from the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.470
 extinction threatens the hustle and bustle 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.930
 Watching is just fun 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:52.500
 and why should one fails to do 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.570
 you want to get home several types 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.640
 the specialized trade offers an attract 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.729
 rich palette of grains and soft 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.729
 butter 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.470
 It is high quality and accurate 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.280
 on the needs of each species 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.280
 Voted 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.599
 the birds do not really care where they are 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.269
 find the food 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.239
 in a self-built cottage or 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.120
 in such special feed columns you 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.890
 accept everything gratefully 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.650
 the advantage of hanging mounts 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.569
 and of futtersilos, however, is that the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
 Birds do not bounce around on the food 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.069
 and therefore can not feed 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:41.269
 is polluted by feces is the 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.739
 Kleiber Gast is so a bit wrong 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.739
 others will benefit from this as well 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.000
 some birds are looking for their food 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.099
 basically on the ground 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.510
 for you there are special in the trade 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.400
 silos very important to everyone 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.069
 Feeding place must be cleaned regularly 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.470
 and spoiled or polluted 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.060
 remove any infectious 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.060
 diseases are transmitted 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.660
 The birds should be right at the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.950
 have a good overview 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.930
 so that they for example one to 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.319
 Creeping cat to discover in time 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.319
 can 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.870
 bushes or trees in the area are 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.130
 However, the birds are important there 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.190
 protection can look for 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.260
 if a sperber on the hunt he is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.180
 finds out quickly that for 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.530
 He ample booty at the forage house 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.660
 It is ideal if you can do that 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.110
 birds also offer a watering hole 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.690
 can 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.060
 the behavior is at a garden pond 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.420
 especially nice when bathing or drinking 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.420
 to observe 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.730
 But what do you have to pay attention to when you are 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.049
 not only observe the birds but 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.750
 also wants to get to know first 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.069
 the size of the body from the woodpecker 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.930
 is about as big as a blackbird and the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.079
 unknown bird with the mighty 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.410
 beak a biter is taller than 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.510
 the well-known but next to it 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.960
 Which of the many types of travel is 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.960
 that 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.900
 and who is looking for everything there on the ground 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.450
 food 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.160
 they are all about the same size often 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.900
 It helps you further if you are 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.860
 The beak form once more accurate 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.510
 considered to have considered for example 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.990
 a cone-shaped granary eater 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.050
 beak times he is very small 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.520
 as at görlitz times strikingly thick and 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.740
 clunky as the Kernbeißer slimmer and 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.320
 acute are the birds beaks of the 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.610
 their food under the tree bark and in the 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.259
 looking for wood 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.389
 or in the summer predominantly of 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.169
 insects and other small creatures 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.169
 feed 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.460
 it seems the easiest one 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.800
 bird after the coloring of its feather 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.689
 to determine 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.219
 agrees with the pure black blackbird cock 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.229
 that too 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:28.020
 but colors alone are not safe 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.659
 feature because depending on lighting can 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.300
 they appear quite different as 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.960
 here the Siskin in the shadow and at 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.960
 full sun 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.050
 besides, the colors are included in the winter 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.879
 many fuck significantly dull while 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.250
 the breeding season in the spring contributes to 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:56.460
 For example, the book will find a male 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:58.529
 much stronger colored hood sometimes 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.050
 also prominent feathering parts help 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:03.270
 continue about the top at the 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.250
 hood travel or the eye-catching 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.909
 colored fields on the wings of the 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.740
 Jay the safest manages the 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:14.690
 Determination if you look at several 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.690
 imprinted marks simultaneously
