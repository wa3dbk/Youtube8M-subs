00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
resolution cords 640 by 480 I think

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.699 
resolution cords 640 by 480 I think
that's<00:02:30.769> right<00:02:30.980> correct<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:31.790> if<00:02:31.849> I'm<00:02:31.970> wrong<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
that's right correct me if I'm wrong and

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.309 
that's right correct me if I'm wrong and
but<00:02:33.709> doesn't<00:02:33.950> have<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.099> built-in<00:02:34.370> mic<00:02:34.579> like<00:02:34.849> the

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
but doesn't have a built-in mic like the

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.899 
but doesn't have a built-in mic like the
eyetoy<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:37.250> will<00:02:37.370> need<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.519> use<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
eyetoy so you will need to use a

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.869 
eyetoy so you will need to use a
separate<00:02:38.239> microphone<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:40.190> overall<00:02:40.489> it's<00:02:40.730> a

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
separate microphone but overall it's a
