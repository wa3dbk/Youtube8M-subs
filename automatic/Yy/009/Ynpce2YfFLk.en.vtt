00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.819
 hello everyone and welcome back in 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.269
 this video be opening four about 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:12.639
 of the expansion of the pokemon tcg with jc x 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.890
 and phantom forces or ghostly forces 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.440
 in Spanish 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.950
 this is the reality the second video in 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.080
 who spoke about the phantom forces can 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.180
 watch the classic videos 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.190
 and well let's start 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.700
 mellinger 15 the representative pokemon 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.700
 of this foreigner 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.699
 stalin 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.090
 two 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.090
 and this is what we do 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.229
 scallop 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.119
 call 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.640
 respite 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.230
 l of time 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.520
 wow 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.520
 I profess the love cic 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.230
 the ski 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.090
 of rivers is a breath that right in 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.149
 this with this one about 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.159
 and the weird thing that if I'm not wrong is another 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.729
 net 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.729
 is a 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.630
 no no no no no no 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.780
 mega gamer and demanding network 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.590
 making and ex secret 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.179
 network is amazing 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.179
 three cycles networks 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.050
 I say 13 that is networks because in videos 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.290
 previous ones I have already left two if 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.250
 you want an opening of a few envelopes is 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.620
 amazing 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.750
 well you can see that it follows the networks 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.050
 because here below says not to know if they are 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.050
 few 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.850
 a little 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.350
 it does not look good but it's 121 of 119 and 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.130
 they have golden power and the text almost 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.120
 Golden 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.120
 excellent tasting 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.270
 is incredible 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.960
 I produce them 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.670
 in the video they also touched me 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.760
 incredible letters relatively for 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.290
 four envelopes and now one yes 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.290
 it is undoubted 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.630
 and just ours with the on Sunday of 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.240
 January 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.630
 our gamer agreement and requires network in 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.980
 about dignity and money 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.680
 we started with week 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.640
 Felix 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.640
 l of time 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.370
 turn 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.370
 luÃ­s moore 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.080
 and then 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.660
 lippert 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.970
 huelva that we earlier on the tables 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:51.520
 and the rare one is a holographic lebanon 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.700
 we go for the third envelope well yes 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.109
 I am very happy for the yes that was 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.079
 incredible too lucky to have 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.980
 to have 35 reais of three different 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.980
 expansions 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.360
 the three points 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.050
 we use with brief 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.800
 today 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.430
 in the mamola 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.930
 whitmore 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.039
 Felix 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.039
 tricky coin 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.459
 if both I am light of how they were produced 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.770
 and again 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:59.569
 The river is a 0-5 train in amount 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.150
 and the rare one is a patxi and his graphic idol 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:05.870
 incredible that a spell will be obeyed 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.870
 but good 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.849
 now with the last one on my gums 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.069
 electric 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.809
 it would not be that he invented that at least we 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.110
 graph to end in the same as 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.110
 we started 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.450
 although honestly with this cycle 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.450
 around 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.550
 all six too much by four 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.550
 envelopes 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.219
 we are with player 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.920
 and not 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.840
 trevi 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.300
 it's lost 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.730
 James 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.860
 Tender 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.270
 red subtitle inferred 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.170
 in the middle 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.770
 the rivers is a ferrer and hator rare in 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.770
 the pse of holographic standards 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:24.519
 and the last weird thing about this video is a 

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:24.519
 club not the graphic good 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.440
 despite not having had any 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.889
 holographic time are very good letters in 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.889
 this video 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.930
 new graphics that are the rare 3 not 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.930
 holographic a figure network 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.129
 in the networks what are 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.180
 the commons are infrequent and rare 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:04.800
 it's good to support myself by giving him 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.800
 like below the video for the amazing 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.550
 you can subscribe with the month image 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:13.400
