00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In the Chelyabinsk Oblast in the Southern Urals, there is a village named Paris

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It is a home to the Nagaybaki people. They were deployed here by Emperor Nicholas I decree in order to guard the Southern borders of the Russian Empire

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The Nagaybaki, despite being Tatars, are not Muslim, but Orthodox Christians. All of them were part of Cossack Force until 1920 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
332 Nagaybak Cossacks took part in the 1813-1814 war campaign, fighting Napoleon’s Grande Armée

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Their village was named Paris in honor of the victory over Napoleon's forces at the Battle of Paris, in 1814

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
In 1999 Nagaybaki people was officially recognized as a specific ethnicity in the Russian Federation

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The Historical Museum of Paris village keeps memories of this small nation of 7,500 people 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Nagaybaki has its own language, though only the elders speak it fluently. But their culture and traditions are still alive

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Why Paris? Almost everyone has asked this question. It is the actual name of our village, which exists for 170 years already

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It all began in 1842, when Russian Emperor Nicholas I has ordered Nagaybaki Cossacks to settle down on this southeastern border of the country along with their families 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They were entitled to protect the state's border

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
In the beginning, all of these 30 villages were identified just by numbers

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But later Vice-general of Orenburg Cossack Force Subtelin has asked for permission to rename these villages after famous victories of Russian Imperial Army

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The museum in Paris was opened in 1989 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But due to repressions against Cossacks in the early years of Soviet rule, some of the facts about the Nagaybaki people were lost forever
