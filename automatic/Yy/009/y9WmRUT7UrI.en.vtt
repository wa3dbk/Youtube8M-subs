sustainability for my family and my kids
future<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.620> would<00:04:44.070> love<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.400> see<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:44.730> this

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
future I would love to see that this

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.200 
future I would love to see that this
trait<00:04:45.660> comes<00:04:45.960> out<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.440> canola<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:47.370> it's

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
trait comes out in the canola that it's

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.110 
trait comes out in the canola that it's
access<00:04:48.750> for<00:04:49.350> producers<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.800> use<00:04:50.160> so<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.000> we

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
access for producers to use so that we

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.660 
access for producers to use so that we
have<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.390> choice<00:04:51.600> I<00:04:51.960> think<00:04:52.410> society<00:04:53.370> as<00:04:53.640> a

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
have the choice I think society as a

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.370 
have the choice I think society as a
whole<00:04:53.820> would<00:04:54.210> jump<00:04:54.600> on<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.900> wholeheartedly

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
whole would jump on this wholeheartedly

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.830 
whole would jump on this wholeheartedly
because<00:04:56.310> it's<00:04:56.520> something<00:04:56.880> that<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:57.300> deters

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
because it's something that just deters

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.400 
because it's something that just deters
the<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.680> bug<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:59.640> go<00:05:00.090> elsewhere<00:05:00.300> then<00:05:01.260> we

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
the the bug to go elsewhere then we

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.320 
the the bug to go elsewhere then we
don't<00:05:01.500> require<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.100> use<00:05:02.220> of<00:05:02.250> insecticides<00:05:02.700> to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
don't require the use of insecticides to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.200 
don't require the use of insecticides to
control<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.840> well<00:05:04.410> as<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.740> producer<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.310> think<00:05:06.090> it

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
control it well as a producer I think it

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.200 
control it well as a producer I think it
shows<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.450> lot<00:05:06.600> of<00:05:06.810> potential<00:05:07.910> anytime<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.090> can

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
shows a lot of potential anytime you can

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.600 
shows a lot of potential anytime you can
reduce<00:05:09.480> your<00:05:09.860> Custis<00:05:10.860> i'd<00:05:11.010> use<00:05:11.280> and

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
reduce your Custis i'd use and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.120 
reduce your Custis i'd use and
especially<00:05:12.300> insecticides<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.320> think<00:05:14.010> it's

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
especially insecticides I think it's

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.180 
especially insecticides I think it's
well<00:05:14.280> worth<00:05:14.460> while<00:05:15.230> being<00:05:16.230> brought<00:05:16.650> into<00:05:16.890> some

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
well worth while being brought into some

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.920 
well worth while being brought into some
of<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.400> state-of-the-art<00:05:17.820> canola<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.750> knot

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
will certainly be a big boost for

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.550 
will certainly be a big boost for
producers<00:05:23.870> although<00:05:24.870> there's<00:05:25.110> much<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.530> be
