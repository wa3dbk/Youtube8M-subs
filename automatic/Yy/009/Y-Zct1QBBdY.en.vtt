00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.499 
this jacket it's not an actual I guess
in-game<00:01:35.189> jacket<00:01:35.640> maybe<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.329> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
in-game jacket maybe it is it's just a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.590 
in-game jacket maybe it is it's just a
really<00:01:36.810> cheap<00:01:37.079> cheaply<00:01:37.680> made<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.340> texture<00:01:39.240> but

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
really cheap cheaply made a texture but

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.109 
really cheap cheaply made a texture but
there's<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.439> light<00:01:40.950> brown<00:01:41.250> jacket<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
there's this light brown jacket and it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.120 
there's this light brown jacket and it
resembles<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.899> Niko<00:01:43.590> Bellic<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.040> what

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
resembles that of Niko Bellic and what

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
resembles that of Niko Bellic and what
he<00:01:44.310> wore<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.790> grand<00:01:45.270> theft<00:01:45.360> auto<00:01:45.659> 4<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.049> his

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
he wore in grand theft auto 4 in his

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.550 
he wore in grand theft auto 4 in his
default<00:01:46.790> outfit<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.149> there's<00:01:48.930> no<00:01:49.140> really

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
default outfit so there's no really

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.859 
default outfit so there's no really
possible<00:01:50.189> confirmation<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.299> whether<00:01:51.540> or<00:01:51.780> not

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
possible confirmation on whether or not

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.530 
possible confirmation on whether or not
this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> Niko<00:01:52.680> Bellic<00:01:52.799> jacket<00:01:53.579> however<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
this is Niko Bellic jacket however it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.859 
this is Niko Bellic jacket however it
does<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> said<00:01:55.740> resemble<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> jacket

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
does like I said resemble the the jacket

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.260 
does like I said resemble the the jacket
I<00:01:58.560> guess<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.090> back

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
I guess from what we can see in the back

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.880 
I guess from what we can see in the back
of<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:00.780> can't<00:02:00.960> see<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> front<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> but

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of but we can't see the front of it but

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.550 
of but we can't see the front of it but
this<00:02:02.430> does<00:02:02.490> indeed<00:02:03.479> look<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:03.899> Niko<00:02:04.439> Bellic

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
this does indeed look like Niko Bellic

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.649 
this does indeed look like Niko Bellic
jacket<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.549> can<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.969> assume<00:02:06.240> that's<00:02:06.479> what

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
jacket so we can just assume that's what

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.479 
jacket so we can just assume that's what
it<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.170> also<00:02:07.320> has<00:02:07.920> some<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.310> evidence

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
it is and it also has some more evidence

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.430 
it is and it also has some more evidence
pointing<00:02:09.300> towards<00:02:09.569> Niko<00:02:09.899> Bellic

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
pointing towards Niko Bellic

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.650

tow truck now cool little fact is that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.150

I guess he was portrayed in that game
with<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.500> navy<00:02:32.770> blue<00:02:32.920> type<00:02:33.520> jacket<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:34.060> and
