so make one with the color piece and one

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.620 
so make one with the color piece and one
with<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> white<00:00:13.110> piece<00:00:14.150> then<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> legs

so you make one with the color piece and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.700 
so you make one with the color piece and
one<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> black<00:00:29.910> piece<00:00:33.290> out<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> top<00:00:34.590> of
