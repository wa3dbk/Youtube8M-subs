that<00:02:55.440> was<00:02:55.560> back<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.980> year<00:02:56.420> 1976<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.680> they

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that was back in the year 1976 so they

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.809 
that was back in the year 1976 so they
haven't<00:02:59.250> made<00:02:59.489> film<00:02:59.849> for<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.150> camera

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
haven't made film for this camera

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.149 
haven't made film for this camera
over<00:03:01.079> 32<00:03:02.079> years<00:03:04.439> so<00:03:05.439> like<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.680> said<00:03:05.889> it's<00:03:06.069> in

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
over 32 years so like I said it's in

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.750 
over 32 years so like I said it's in
rather<00:03:06.340> good<00:03:06.579> condition<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.959> also<00:03:08.079> fairly

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
rather good condition it's also fairly

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.440 
rather good condition it's also fairly
technologically<00:03:09.760> advanced<00:03:10.060> for<00:03:10.239> its<00:03:10.299> time

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
technologically advanced for its time

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.080 
technologically advanced for its time
period<00:03:11.219> you're<00:03:12.219> thinking<00:03:12.549> getting<00:03:12.760> out<00:03:12.999> of

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
period you're thinking getting out of

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.690 
period you're thinking getting out of
the<00:03:13.150> 1800s<00:03:13.659> where<00:03:14.319> they<00:03:14.530> had<00:03:14.680> no<00:03:14.950> frame<00:03:15.310> speeds

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
the 1800s where they had no frame speeds

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.220 
the 1800s where they had no frame speeds
at<00:03:15.819> all<00:03:15.939> this<00:03:16.180> one<00:03:16.420> actually<00:03:16.719> has<00:03:17.049> several

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
at all this one actually has several

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.970 
at all this one actually has several
frame<00:03:17.739> speed<00:03:18.040> settings<00:03:18.489> um<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.989> will<00:03:20.079> go<00:03:20.260> right

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
frame speed settings um it will go right

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.770 
frame speed settings um it will go right
now<00:03:21.129> it's<00:03:21.280> set<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.430> 25<00:03:22.000> but<00:03:22.420> it<00:03:22.510> will<00:03:22.569> go<00:03:22.689> all

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
now it's set to 25 but it will go all

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.349 
now it's set to 25 but it will go all
the<00:03:22.900> way<00:03:22.930> up<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.200> 100<00:03:23.560> frames<00:03:23.799> per<00:03:24.069> second<00:03:24.549> that

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
the way up to 100 frames per second that

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.619 
the way up to 100 frames per second that
means<00:03:25.420> you'll<00:03:26.049> be<00:03:26.109> allowed<00:03:26.379> to<00:03:26.530> smile<00:03:27.629> so

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
means you'll be allowed to smile so

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.179 
means you'll be allowed to smile so
basically<00:03:29.099> once<00:03:30.099> you<00:03:30.189> get<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:30.430> thing<00:03:30.669> open

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
basically once you get this thing open

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.059 
basically once you get this thing open
you<00:03:33.189> use<00:03:33.909> the<00:03:34.090> viewfinder<00:03:34.329> here<00:03:35.049> which<00:03:35.859> has

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
you use the viewfinder here which has

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.000 
you use the viewfinder here which has
little<00:03:36.370> mirrors<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.909> it<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.680> you'll<00:03:38.680> see<00:03:38.859> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
little mirrors in it and you'll see the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.339 
little mirrors in it and you'll see the
person<00:03:39.489> in<00:03:39.699> it<00:03:39.879> and<00:03:40.150> that's<00:03:40.599> how<00:03:40.719> you<00:03:40.780> line<00:03:41.079> up

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
person in it and that's how you line up

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.459 
person in it and that's how you line up
him<00:03:42.189> up<00:03:42.340> her<00:03:42.459> up<00:03:42.669> and<00:03:43.079> then<00:03:44.079> you<00:03:44.199> take<00:03:44.349> this

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:44.469 
him up her up and then you take this

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:45.449 
him up her up and then you take this
it's<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.680> diaphragm

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
it's a diaphragm

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.089 
it's a diaphragm
it<00:03:45.819> pushes<00:03:46.540> air<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:47.049> this<00:03:47.199> little<00:03:47.379> piston<00:03:47.919> here

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
it pushes air on this little piston here

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.390 
it pushes air on this little piston here
and<00:03:48.370> pushes<00:03:49.329> this<00:03:49.480> little<00:03:49.840> piston<00:03:50.829> up<00:03:51.099> and

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
and pushes this little piston up and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.610 
and pushes this little piston up and
pushes<00:03:52.239> this<00:03:52.419> down<00:03:52.659> which<00:03:52.930> actually<00:03:53.530> it's

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
pushes this down which actually it's

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.179 
pushes this down which actually it's
this<00:03:53.769> which<00:03:54.760> opens<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.329> shutter<00:03:56.969> ship<00:03:57.969> here

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
this which opens the shutter ship here

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.170 
this which opens the shutter ship here
so<00:04:00.189> let's<00:04:00.310> see<00:04:00.430> if<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.549> can<00:04:00.669> see<00:04:00.849> it<00:04:00.969> working

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
so let's see if you can see it working

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.789 
so let's see if you can see it working
in<00:04:01.449> there<00:04:03.359> okay

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
in there okay

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:11.159 
in there okay
very<00:04:05.799> fast<00:04:06.189> that's<00:04:06.609> all<00:04:06.759> you<00:04:06.909> need<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:10.169> so

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
very fast that's all you need and so

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.240 
very fast that's all you need and so
here<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:11.769> have<00:04:13.769> actually<00:04:14.769> I'm<00:04:14.829> not<00:04:14.979> sure<00:04:15.129> what

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
here you have actually I'm not sure what

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.300 
here you have actually I'm not sure what
that<00:04:15.280> is<00:04:15.639> I'll<00:04:16.539> find<00:04:16.720> out<00:04:16.870> sometime<00:04:17.310> so

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
that is I'll find out sometime so

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.189 
that is I'll find out sometime so
basically<00:04:19.000> just<00:04:19.120> squeeze<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.870> ball<00:04:20.079> here<00:04:20.639> to

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
basically just squeeze the ball here to

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.140 
basically just squeeze the ball here to
actuate<00:04:23.199> it<00:04:23.349> as<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.250> can<00:04:24.370> see<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.940> piston

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
actuate it as you can see the piston

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.820 
actuate it as you can see the piston
move<00:04:25.509> it<00:04:25.599> off<00:04:25.780> get<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.380> wait<00:04:26.500> for<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.740> to

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
move it off get the wait for it to

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.790 
move it off get the wait for it to
recharge<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.940> takes<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.659> little<00:04:28.810> while<00:04:29.080> on<00:04:29.349> some

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
recharge it takes a little while on some

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.020 
recharge it takes a little while on some
settings<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.389> wait<00:04:31.539> for<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:31.900> then<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:33.030> see

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
settings so you wait for it then you see

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.129 
settings so you wait for it then you see
how<00:04:34.120> it<00:04:34.180> comes<00:04:34.360> up<00:04:35.099> and<00:04:36.099> then<00:04:36.690> all<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.930> goes

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
how it comes up and then all that goes

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.110 
how it comes up and then all that goes
to<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.380> back<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.979> then<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.639> goes<00:04:39.789> into<00:04:39.970> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
to the back and then it goes into the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.189 
to the back and then it goes into the
negative<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.840> light<00:04:42.719> another<00:04:43.719> quick<00:04:43.960> let's

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
negative and light another quick let's

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.040 
negative and light another quick let's
do<00:04:44.380> it<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:46.800> then<00:04:47.969> put<00:04:48.969> it<00:04:49.120> back<00:04:49.150> first<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:49.930> have

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
do it so then put it back first you have

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.830 
do it so then put it back first you have
to<00:04:50.080> drop<00:04:50.349> the<00:04:50.409> viewfinder<00:04:51.099> here

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.070 

then<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.830> squeeze<00:04:55.130> these<00:04:55.580> two<00:04:56.180> levers<00:04:56.720> here

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
then you squeeze these two levers here

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.250 
then you squeeze these two levers here
actually<00:04:57.889> you<00:04:58.310> all<00:04:58.430> cannot<00:04:58.669> yet<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.600> then<00:05:00.050> you

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
actually you all cannot yet and then you

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
actually you all cannot yet and then you
push<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.560> back<00:05:00.710> in<00:05:01.100> side<00:05:01.610> do<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.630> gently<00:05:03.020> so

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
push it back in side do it gently so

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.990 
push it back in side do it gently so
because<00:05:04.280> this<00:05:04.460> is<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.940> thing<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.389> really<00:05:05.660> old

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
because this is this thing is really old

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.300 
because this is this thing is really old
it<00:05:08.000> just<00:05:08.229> compacts<00:05:09.229> quite<00:05:09.620> nicely<00:05:09.889> against

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
it just compacts quite nicely against

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.400 
it just compacts quite nicely against
the<00:05:10.460> wall<00:05:10.639> back<00:05:10.880> there<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:12.199> so<00:05:12.380> that

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
the wall back there and so that

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.350 
the wall back there and so that
accordion<00:05:12.919> shape<00:05:13.040> for<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:13.790> that<00:05:13.940> way<00:05:14.090> will

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
accordion shape for so that way will

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.129 
accordion shape for so that way will
retract<00:05:14.720> back<00:05:14.900> in<00:05:15.290> there<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:16.400> it<00:05:16.610> also<00:05:16.760> blocks

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
retract back in there and it also blocks

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.210 
retract back in there and it also blocks
external<00:05:18.139> light<00:05:18.320> source<00:05:18.590> from<00:05:18.800> getting<00:05:19.070> in

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
external light source from getting in

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.939 
external light source from getting in
and<00:05:19.430> ruining<00:05:19.910> your<00:05:19.970> negative<00:05:20.770> next<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:21.889> take

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
and ruining your negative next you take

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.790 
and ruining your negative next you take
the<00:05:22.639> squeeze<00:05:22.910> ball<00:05:23.150> the<00:05:23.870> ball<00:05:24.080> here<00:05:24.410> the

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
the squeeze ball the ball here the

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.900 
the squeeze ball the ball here the
diaphragm<00:05:25.690> and<00:05:26.690> ya<00:05:27.220> set<00:05:28.220> it<00:05:28.340> up<00:05:28.460> there<00:05:28.639> the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
diaphragm and ya set it up there the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.550 
diaphragm and ya set it up there the
reason<00:05:29.180> why<00:05:29.270> I'm<00:05:29.389> wearing<00:05:29.750> gloves<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.260> so<00:05:30.410> that

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
reason why I'm wearing gloves is so that

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.080 
reason why I'm wearing gloves is so that
way<00:05:30.680> I<00:05:30.710> don't<00:05:30.800> get<00:05:30.979> my<00:05:31.220> oil<00:05:31.250> is<00:05:31.610> all<00:05:31.729> over<00:05:31.880> it

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
way I don't get my oil is all over it

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.969 
way I don't get my oil is all over it
and<00:05:32.900> then<00:05:33.590> next<00:05:33.919> you<00:05:34.250> push<00:05:35.120> down<00:05:35.150> these<00:05:35.510> two

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
and then next you push down these two

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.290 
and then next you push down these two
things<00:05:36.979> here<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:40.400> what<00:05:40.760> that<00:05:40.880> does<00:05:41.060> is<00:05:41.180> it

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
things here and what that does is it

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.270 
things here and what that does is it
pops<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:41.630> lid<00:05:41.870> because<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:42.380> walks<00:05:42.620> opens<00:05:43.070> that

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
pops the lid because it walks opens that

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.890 
pops the lid because it walks opens that
way<00:05:43.400> doesn't<00:05:43.700> flap<00:05:43.970> all<00:05:44.120> over<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.389> place<00:05:44.570> and

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
way doesn't flap all over the place and

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.330 
way doesn't flap all over the place and
then<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:45.650> just<00:05:45.860> close<00:05:46.130> it<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.930> so<00:05:48.289> what<00:05:49.220> that

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
then you just close it like so what that

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:55.650 
then you just close it like so what that
does<00:05:49.520> is<00:05:49.669> it<00:05:49.789> snaps

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.260 

yep<00:05:56.530> it's<00:05:56.980> just<00:05:57.220> like<00:05:57.370> a<00:05:57.400> big<00:05:57.640> version<00:05:58.120> of<00:05:58.210> a

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
yep it's just like a big version of a

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.240 
yep it's just like a big version of a
modern-day<00:05:58.630> pocket<00:05:59.410> camera<00:05:59.770> which<00:05:59.920> is<00:06:00.070> only

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
modern-day pocket camera which is only

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.230 
modern-day pocket camera which is only
about<00:06:00.580> that<00:06:01.540> that<00:06:01.960> tall<00:06:02.640> things<00:06:03.640> about<00:06:03.880> four

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
about that that tall things about four

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.300 
about that that tall things about four
times<00:06:04.510> the<00:06:04.720> size<00:06:05.050> of<00:06:05.260> a<00:06:05.350> modern-day<00:06:05.710> camera<00:06:06.220> of

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
times the size of a modern-day camera of

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.700 
times the size of a modern-day camera of
it<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:07.330> dimensions<00:06:07.690> but<00:06:07.900> looks<00:06:08.170> a<00:06:08.320> lot<00:06:08.500> like

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
it and dimensions but looks a lot like

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.040 
it and dimensions but looks a lot like
fun<00:06:11.850> this<00:06:12.850> is<00:06:13.000> what<00:06:13.180> you<00:06:13.300> use<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:13.540> line<00:06:13.870> your

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
fun this is what you use to line your

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.970 
fun this is what you use to line your
film<00:06:14.610> so<00:06:15.810> it's<00:06:16.810> kind<00:06:17.320> of<00:06:17.440> heavy<00:06:17.620> it's

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
film so it's kind of heavy it's

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.100 
film so it's kind of heavy it's
definitely<00:06:18.340> not<00:06:18.490> like<00:06:18.820> a<00:06:19.480> cell<00:06:19.690> phone<00:06:19.720> see

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
definitely not like a cell phone see

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.360 
definitely not like a cell phone see
output<00:06:20.470> let<00:06:20.830> me<00:06:20.890> take<00:06:21.100> my<00:06:21.280> turn<00:06:21.610> here<00:06:22.950> ya<00:06:23.950> go

phone here yeah the chocolate I don't

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.760 
phone here yeah the chocolate I don't
care<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:30.240> this<00:06:31.240> is<00:06:31.420> a<00:06:31.810> little<00:06:32.290> bit<00:06:32.410> smaller

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
care the this is a little bit smaller

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.430 
care the this is a little bit smaller
than<00:06:33.040> a<00:06:33.100> modern-day<00:06:33.520> camera<00:06:34.210> it<00:06:35.080> does<00:06:35.230> have<00:06:35.350> a

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
than a modern-day camera it does have a

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.310 
than a modern-day camera it does have a
camera<00:06:35.740> on<00:06:35.770> it<00:06:35.890> and<00:06:36.190> like<00:06:37.030> how<00:06:37.210> the<00:06:37.840> size<00:06:38.080> is

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
camera on it and like how the size is

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.000 
camera on it and like how the size is
compared<00:06:39.720> so<00:06:40.720> that<00:06:41.110> gives<00:06:41.290> you<00:06:41.440> a<00:06:41.500> kind<00:06:41.800> of<00:06:41.890> a

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
compared so that gives you a kind of a

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.680 
compared so that gives you a kind of a
visual<00:06:42.400> understanding<00:06:42.520> of<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.210> size<00:06:43.450> of<00:06:43.600> this

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
visual understanding of the size of this

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.660 
visual understanding of the size of this
camera<00:06:45.540> so<00:06:46.540> yeah<00:06:46.720> I<00:06:47.050> don't<00:06:47.560> know<00:06:47.680> a<00:06:47.980> lot<00:06:48.640> about

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
camera so yeah I don't know a lot about

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.390 
camera so yeah I don't know a lot about
the<00:06:48.970> history<00:06:49.770> about<00:06:50.770> it<00:06:52.920> but<00:06:53.920> it's<00:06:54.130> really

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
the history about it but it's really

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.270 
the history about it but it's really
neat<00:06:54.610> to<00:06:54.790> having<00:06:55.090> something<00:06:55.420> that's<00:06:56.410> almost<00:06:56.920> a

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
neat to having something that's almost a

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.400 
neat to having something that's almost a
hundred<00:06:57.430> years<00:06:57.700> old<00:07:00.990> the<00:07:01.990> one<00:07:02.140> other

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
hundred years old the one other

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.190 
hundred years old the one other
interesting<00:07:02.620> about<00:07:03.070> this<00:07:03.220> camera<00:07:03.520> is<00:07:04.200> you

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.200 
interesting about this camera is you

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.130 
interesting about this camera is you
have<00:07:05.380> your<00:07:05.790> standard<00:07:06.790> tripod<00:07:07.030> mount<00:07:07.690> right

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.140 
have your standard tripod mount right

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.160 
have your standard tripod mount right
down<00:07:08.350> there<00:07:08.590> that<00:07:08.620> little<00:07:09.040> hole<00:07:09.220> and<00:07:10.170> that

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
down there that little hole and that

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.290 
down there that little hole and that
mount<00:07:11.380> of<00:07:11.500> the<00:07:11.590> tripod<00:07:12.060> sometimes<00:07:13.060> if<00:07:13.210> you

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
mount of the tripod sometimes if you

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.400 
mount of the tripod sometimes if you
want<00:07:13.480> to<00:07:13.600> get<00:07:13.750> a<00:07:14.080> side<00:07:14.920> shot<00:07:15.480> like<00:07:16.480> on<00:07:16.810> a<00:07:16.870> tall

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
want to get a side shot like on a tall

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.120 
want to get a side shot like on a tall
object<00:07:18.660> you<00:07:19.660> have<00:07:19.690> another<00:07:20.020> tripod<00:07:20.560> mount<00:07:20.890> on

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
object you have another tripod mount on

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.200 
object you have another tripod mount on
the<00:07:21.880> side<00:07:23.490> that's<00:07:24.490> pretty<00:07:24.760> cool

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
the side that's pretty cool

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.560 
the side that's pretty cool
I<00:07:26.010> don't<00:07:27.010> think<00:07:27.160> too<00:07:27.250> many<00:07:27.400> modern<00:07:28.210> cameras

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.570 
I don't think too many modern cameras

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.200 
I don't think too many modern cameras
have<00:07:28.720> that<00:07:29.190> so<00:07:30.190> basically<00:07:30.340> just<00:07:30.700> take<00:07:31.000> it

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
have that so basically just take it

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.090 
have that so basically just take it
mounted<00:07:31.570> on<00:07:31.690> the<00:07:31.840> side<00:07:32.080> and<00:07:32.410> that's<00:07:32.680> it<00:07:32.920> and

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
mounted on the side and that's it and

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:44.120 
mounted on the side and that's it and
then<00:07:33.310> you<00:07:33.460> take<00:07:33.610> a<00:07:33.640> picture<00:07:33.970> like<00:07:34.000> that

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:44.130 

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.650 

so<00:07:45.180> that's<00:07:46.180> it

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:46.660 
so that's it

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:53.400 
so that's it
my<00:07:47.620> dad's<00:07:48.570> 1910<00:07:49.570> Kodak<00:07:50.470> camera
