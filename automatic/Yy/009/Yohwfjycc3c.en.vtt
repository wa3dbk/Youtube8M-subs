 hello users that as you are here 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.389
 we are one more week with a new 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.639
 trick mÃ³nica garcÃ­a has asked us 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.789
 through facebook how do i get to do 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.130
 a picture of the screen of my samsung 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.970
 So easy to look at you grab your mÃ³nica 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:29.190
 samsung you take your camera 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.660
 point and shoot good tests apart 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.070
 to make a screenshot that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.140
 that's what it's called in this type of 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.520
 images will depend on the model that 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.450
 you have imagine that the question comes 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.460
 because you have a new galaxy s 6 and the 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.989
 system is different from other android for 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 do the screenshot in a 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.800
 galaxy is 6 you must press 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.570
 simultaneously the start button that 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.950
 You are below and the power button 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.350
 and there is capture made what happens in the 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.850
 rest of phones with android then 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.500
 there is a procedure that is the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.320
 usual in almost all of them which is 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.479
 press the button simultaneously 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.549
 on and the button to lower the volume 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.229
 for example in these the axis they carry 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.760
 the back buttons what are we going to 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.400
 to do is to press at the same time both 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.850
 buttons and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.670
 there is the same thing, for example with 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.790
 a sony xperia how is this from here the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.140
 z3 that we are going to press simultaneously 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.120
 the power button that has it to the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.550
 right and the volume down and there 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.280
 is the capture made the same if it is 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.770
 any other device a thing 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.140
 interesting about this xperia z3 and is that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.350
 if we pressed the button 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.750
 on we get these two questions 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.130
 or these two options here below draw 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.410
 screen capture that would be what 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.119
 we just made or record the screen 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.340
 with what we will be able to record even 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.800
 a video of everything we do with the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 phone and what happens with the devices 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.760
 of apple because most of you already 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.500
 you will know how the catches of 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.770
 screen both on an ipad and an iphone 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.840
 an ipod toch press the button 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.450
 start and the power button at the same time 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 and when you release there you have capture made with 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.680
 which then we already know how to do 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 screenshots in almost any 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.020
 device I hope you liked it 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.710
