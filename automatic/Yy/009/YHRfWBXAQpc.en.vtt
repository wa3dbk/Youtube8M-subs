00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.650 
started rotating the crank in order to
align<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:15.330> cam<00:00:15.570> marks

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
align the cam marks

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.999

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
over here to make sure these line up you

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.900 
over here to make sure these line up you
can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.290> eye<00:00:49.320> goes<00:00:49.949> I<00:00:50.190> II<00:00:52.820> pretty<00:00:53.820> much

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
can see the eye goes I II pretty much

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.560 
can see the eye goes I II pretty much
goes<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.269> be<00:00:54.540> up<00:00:55.079> there<00:00:55.640> yeah<00:00:56.930> down<00:00:59.449> once<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
goes to be up there yeah down once I

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
goes to be up there yeah down once I
remove<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:02.519> balancer<00:01:03.589> then<00:01:04.640> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
remove this the balancer then this

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
remove this the balancer then this
should<00:01:05.759> also<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.030> another<00:01:06.300> marking<00:01:06.810> down<00:01:07.290> in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
should also be another marking down in

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.640 
should also be another marking down in
here<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.070> line<00:01:08.340> up

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.310 

okay<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.490> before<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.150> remove<00:01:17.600> any<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
okay that before I remove any of the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.790 
okay that before I remove any of the
tensioners<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> little<00:01:20.990> trick<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:21.680> was

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
tensioners I do a little trick that was

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.460 
tensioners I do a little trick that was
mentioned<00:01:22.070> on<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:23.060> audit<00:01:23.330> dotnet<00:01:23.750> or

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
mentioned on the audit dotnet or

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.460 
mentioned on the audit dotnet or
basically<00:01:24.800> you<00:01:25.430> take<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.960> set<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:26.990> present

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
basically you take a set of present

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.690 
basically you take a set of present
wrenches<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.600> there<00:01:29.600> are<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:31.340> can<00:01:31.430> see<00:01:31.610> it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
wrenches and there are you can see it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.590 
wrenches and there are you can see it
right<00:01:31.850> here<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:34.580> cams<00:01:34.850> there<00:01:35.420> are<00:01:35.480> some

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
right here on the cams there are some

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.970 
right here on the cams there are some
flat<00:01:35.810> spots<00:01:36.200> where<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.100> can<00:01:37.190> attach<00:01:37.340> a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
flat spots where you can attach a

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.430 
flat spots where you can attach a
crescent<00:01:39.980> wrench<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.400> you<00:01:41.360> do<00:01:41.510> the<00:01:41.600> same<00:01:41.810> on

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
crescent wrench and you do the same on

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.910 
crescent wrench and you do the same on
the<00:01:42.980> intake<00:01:43.250> cam<00:01:43.580> in<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.060> exhaust<00:01:44.480> cam<00:01:44.920> then

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
the intake cam in the exhaust cam then

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.950 
the intake cam in the exhaust cam then
take<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.210> c-clamp

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.790 

take<00:01:50.500> one<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.950> these<00:01:51.660> basically<00:01:52.660> you're<00:01:53.650> going

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
take one of these basically you're going

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.540 
take one of these basically you're going
to<00:01:53.950> hold<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.090> clamp<00:01:55.300> it<00:01:55.420> right<00:01:55.540> here<00:01:55.960> and

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
to hold it in a clamp it right here and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.039 
to hold it in a clamp it right here and
walk<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.700> cams<00:01:57.970> in<00:01:58.300> place

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.009 

okay<00:02:04.890> now<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:06.030> slackened<00:02:07.580> Mia<00:02:08.720> cam<00:02:09.720> bolts

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
okay now I have slackened Mia cam bolts

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.509 
okay now I have slackened Mia cam bolts
over<00:02:10.349> here<00:02:10.709> I'm<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:10.950> gonna<00:02:11.160> remove<00:02:11.340> them<00:02:11.489> just

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
over here I'm not gonna remove them just

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:12.619 
over here I'm not gonna remove them just
yet

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
yet

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.780 
yet
I<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:14.190> wanted<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.489> loosen<00:02:14.849> them<00:02:14.910> up

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.910 

and<00:02:19.120> also<00:02:19.830> listened<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:22.090> tensioner<00:02:23.080> pulleys

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
and also listened the tensioner pulleys

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.009 
and also listened the tensioner pulleys
over<00:02:24.159> here<00:02:25.500> now<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.879> see<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.150> there's<00:02:28.930> a

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
over here now you can see it there's a

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.250 
over here now you can see it there's a
spring<00:02:29.470> right<00:02:30.069> here<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.640> need<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.330> probably<00:02:32.019> use

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
spring right here I need to probably use

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.930 
spring right here I need to probably use
some<00:02:32.440> needle<00:02:32.650> nose<00:02:32.799> pliers<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.459> wrestle<00:02:33.790> that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
some needle nose pliers and wrestle that

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.369 
some needle nose pliers and wrestle that
off<00:02:34.379> before<00:02:35.379> I<00:02:35.709> can<00:02:36.390> get<00:02:37.390> this<00:02:37.540> tensioner<00:02:38.140> to

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
off before I can get this tensioner to

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.410 
off before I can get this tensioner to
move<00:02:38.980> all<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.280> way<00:02:39.310> back<00:02:39.670> which<00:02:40.060> will<00:02:40.180> give<00:02:40.330> me

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
move all the way back which will give me

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.860 
move all the way back which will give me
enough<00:02:40.629> slack<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.260> remove<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.129> belt

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.910 

okay<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.860> removed<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.519> tensioner<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
okay so I removed the tensioner and the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.260 
okay so I removed the tensioner and the
idler<00:02:50.190> pulley

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.660 

just<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.140> make<00:02:54.650> sure<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:54.860> got<00:02:55.070> everything<00:02:55.250> in

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
just to make sure I got everything in

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.840 
just to make sure I got everything in
place<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.390> went<00:02:57.080> ahead<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.740> went<00:02:58.250> off<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.610> this

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
place I went ahead and went off of this

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.920 
place I went ahead and went off of this
mark<00:02:59.240> over<00:02:59.480> here

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
mark over here

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.090 
mark over here
countered<00:03:00.470> across<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:02.210> my<00:03:02.360> other<00:03:02.510> mark<00:03:03.100> come

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
countered across to my other mark come
