00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.210
 start the new trick for max factor 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.400
 with the user lights that as always 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.500
 initially I'm going to use like 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.450
 corrector and then apply it 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.850
 tapping as always that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.850
 to annul that lighter finger 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.160
 precisely I go tapping on the whole 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.190
 area around the eyes and then go down 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.860
 up to the sides of the nose and then back up 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.109
 towards the time the whole thing vanished and 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.759
 from step to step to safe but this is 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.440
 very light and by a factor of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.649
 protection 30 I recommend boys 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.899
 summer always the protection factor 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.550
 high in the foundation or in the note 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.540
 in the colored cream should be used 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 even in winter but I recommend it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.579
 especially in the summer also used 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.460
 when you don't go to the sea and then I go to 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.160
 fix my own queen with the queen 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.390
 puff with loose powder which is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.190
 very light and I go from here 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 these mega face brush 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.370
 then returned to using the lights on 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.410
 my tiratissimo and the milize this time 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.970
 but I put in a bit more then 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.910
 I make an excerpt a little bit a little 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.100
 more often and I spread it as a primer 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.020
 eye stretches the obligation on everything 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.950
 the eye all over the eyelid up to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.720
 under simple and now step and the former sheen 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.080
 this is a splendid cream eye shadow 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.700
 and very very bright is in short one has 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.920
 a color a finish so wet 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.900
 that's why I like it a lot and I'm going to 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.800
 apply it mayan flesh-colored a lot 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.540
 natural 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.700
 I'm going to apply it from the inner corner 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.180
 up to the outer corner over my whole 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.180
 mobile eyelid 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.670
 then passed instead to an eye shadow in 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.430
 powder this is shimmer and is a 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.140
 pretty light brown then it 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.490
 I only lie in the fold for 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.290
 give a little depth to the 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.290
 look to mark the fold 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.740
 I just go from the outside corner up 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.060
 at the inner corner paying attention to 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.880
 do not go down too much on the eyelid 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.340
 mobile and then I take another ex sheen 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.670
 this however is a splendid black but a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.599
 lot of silver glitter 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.480
 give a little bit of nuance and gray 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.000
 so I'm going to apply this color 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.849
 but always with an angled brush 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.700
 quite broad and I am going to apply a 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:35.540
 only in the outer corner in mine 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:38.390
 then fold with the ex s intense that this 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.110
 is an eyeliner and very black in color and 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.599
 then stand on the lower lashes 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:48.410
 precisely from outside making fading 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.080
 good color with black and then eyeshadow 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.470
 just the eyes cost the corner 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.319
 internal to the tear duct 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.500
 then resumes and eye shadow in black cream 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.230
 but this time with the brush 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.269
 pen and I'm going to fade for good 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.190
 lay line arch just lying so as to 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.220
 make it just a little less strong 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.220
 huh 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.440
 now I'm going to apply eyeliner too 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.320
 inside the eye then in the 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.320
 lower internal rhyme 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.040
 then I pick up the former team the color one 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.400
 I go to the meat and go to apply it 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.200
 a little with a thin brush too 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.019
 at the beginning of my lower lashes 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.209
 blending well with the black of before 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.790
 and now with a clean brush and 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.739
 trim the soft ones I'm going to fade to 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.040
 well the upper part that of the 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.040
 pity 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.819
 now all I have to do is apply 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.370
 the illuminant is also an eye shadow 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.410
 in powder and I go and it is also for the many 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.660
 no i 'm going to spread it just like 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.880
 highlights under my eyebrow now 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.470
 I take lay line from the used lot of 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.940
 sometimes I go back to the high line and I will 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.310
 I also lie along the upper lashes 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.440
 this time starting from a line 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.690
 thin that they want to dress gradually 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.280
 that I go to the outside does not extend 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.680
 too much codeine though because I already have it 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.720
 the outside corner quite dark 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.220
 from the eyeshadow that I leave it like this 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.710
 then step by step the chance but scale and 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.210
 I'm going to apply it lightly 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.370
 applied on the upper lashes ever 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.590
 axtension so I'm going to concentrate 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.840
 especially on the lower peaks like 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.350
 always abound a lot of mascara 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.169
 you know 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.300
 and then eyebrows I go to fill the 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.090
 eyebrows with this pencil that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.500
 the tree you think is just all east 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:06.350
 the various spaces with with my pencil 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.510
 in short, he did not repeat ends 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.419
 stronger are more defined 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.060
 eyebrow and then I'm going to fade with the 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.600
 brush 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.600
 not liked 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.780
 now with unfailing touring always with 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.990
 touring with browsing powder I go 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.539
 just mark my cheekbones always use 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.970
 a really angled brush for the 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.460
 earth that is, I find myself very well and 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.979
 so I'm going to apply the land like this 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.650
 then always faded always well towards the 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.289
 low above all and now I apply a 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.090
 little bit of earth as always also on 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.650
 I really like this too 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.650
 be careful to blend very well 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.879
 and now I just have to go to the blog 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.099
 on this beautiful pink barbie sta 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.659
 very very well with any kind of 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.400
 smokey eye but also with a more makeup 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:03.509
 natural because precisely it is very natural 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.979
 and it's a rose that I like a lot ed 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.319
 it is also very soft but it is anyway 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:10.710
 become like coloring here stand 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:13.080
