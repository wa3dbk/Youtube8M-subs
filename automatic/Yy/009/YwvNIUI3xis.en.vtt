00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
is going to give us a pretty good ripple

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.609 
is going to give us a pretty good ripple
it's<00:01:27.090> really<00:01:27.330> hot<00:01:28.820> just<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> hold<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> in

it's really hot just going to hold it in

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.069 
it's really hot just going to hold it in
for<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.680> few<00:01:31.799> seconds<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:33.350> then<00:01:34.350> release<00:01:36.079> and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.690 
for a few seconds and then release and
hold<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.560> for<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> few<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> bottom

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
hold it in for a few more at the bottom

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950 
hold it in for a few more at the bottom
but<00:01:39.060> we're<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> root

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
but we're not going to go to the root

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.090 
but we're not going to go to the root
because<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.409> might<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.650> too<00:01:40.710> hot<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:43.100> just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
because it might get too hot so just

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.499 
because it might get too hot so just
like<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> nice<00:01:45.210> little

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
like that and you get a nice little

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.690 
like that and you get a nice little
ripple<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:46.979> I'm<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
ripple there so what I'm going to do is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
ripple there so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> finish<00:01:48.180> um<00:01:48.630> my<00:01:49.500> whole<00:01:49.710> head
