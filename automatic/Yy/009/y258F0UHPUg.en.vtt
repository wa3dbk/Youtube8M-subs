that<00:05:44.159> complicated<00:05:44.819> there's<00:05:45.539> a<00:05:45.659> lot<00:05:46.439> of

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
that complicated there's a lot of

it<00:05:48.659> complicated<00:05:48.990> but<00:05:49.979> what<00:05:50.340> I<00:05:50.610> found<00:05:51.270> is

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:51.659 
it complicated but what I found is

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.300 
it complicated but what I found is
really<00:05:51.689> you<00:05:52.229> spend<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.560> little<00:05:52.650> bit<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:52.889> time<00:05:53.099> on

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
really you spend a little bit of time on

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.490 
really you spend a little bit of time on
the<00:05:53.400> water<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:53.969> you'll<00:05:54.090> develop<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.810> feel<00:05:55.169> for

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
the water and you'll develop a feel for

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
where the fish are I mean you'll be able

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.149 
where the fish are I mean you'll be able
to<00:05:57.300> spot<00:05:57.539> this<00:05:57.780> pockets<00:05:58.409> behind<00:05:58.590> boulders

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
to spot this pockets behind boulders

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.760 
to spot this pockets behind boulders
those<00:05:59.759> undercut<00:06:00.300> banks<00:06:00.870> those<00:06:01.289> overhanging

those undercut banks those overhanging
logs<00:06:02.189> and<00:06:03.180> you'll<00:06:03.419> just<00:06:03.599> have<00:06:03.780> this<00:06:03.930> feeling

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
logs and you'll just have this feeling

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.020 
logs and you'll just have this feeling
that<00:06:04.800> there's<00:06:05.039> a<00:06:05.099> fish<00:06:05.340> there<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:05.699> know<00:06:05.819> bass

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
that there's a fish there you know bass

that there's a fish there you know bass
probably<00:06:06.599> on<00:06:06.719> experience<00:06:07.319> just<00:06:08.099> the<00:06:08.189> look<00:06:08.460> of

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
probably on experience just the look of

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.779 
probably on experience just the look of
the<00:06:08.729> spot<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.930> you<00:06:10.530> know<00:06:10.650> that's<00:06:10.919> going<00:06:11.639> to<00:06:11.729> be

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
the spot and you know that's going to be

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.510 
the spot and you know that's going to be
a<00:06:11.849> gut<00:06:12.120> instinct<00:06:12.689> at<00:06:12.780> some<00:06:12.960> point<00:06:13.229> and<00:06:13.620> that's

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
a gut instinct at some point and that's

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:24.110 
a gut instinct at some point and that's
really<00:06:14.819> all<00:06:14.939> it<00:06:14.969> boils<00:06:15.210> down<00:06:15.419> to
