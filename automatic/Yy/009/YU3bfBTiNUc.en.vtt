cables here from the power supply kind

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.349 
cables here from the power supply kind
of<00:00:14.610> bugs<00:00:14.880> me<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:16.260> fact<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:17.090> this<00:00:18.090> power

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
of bugs me and the fact that this power

of bugs me and the fact that this power
supply<00:00:18.750> when<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.050> put<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.500> didn't<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.949> an

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
supply when we put it in didn't have an

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.790 
supply when we put it in didn't have an
a<00:00:20.250> lighted<00:00:20.760> LED<00:00:20.910> fan<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.560> we're<00:00:22.680> going

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
a lighted LED fan so I think we're going

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
a lighted LED fan so I think we're going
to<00:00:22.859> open<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.250> up<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.490> switch<00:00:23.820> fans<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to open that up and switch fans out of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.870 
to open that up and switch fans out of
it<00:00:24.830> and<00:00:25.830> we're<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.340> if<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.699> make

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
it and we're going to see if we can make

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.349 
it and we're going to see if we can make
an<00:00:27.029> enclosure<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:28.289> cover<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.769> wires<00:00:29.359> just

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
an enclosure to cover the wires just

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.630 
an enclosure to cover the wires just
using<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> casing<00:00:31.380> from<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> old<00:00:31.949> power

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
using the casing from the old power

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.350 
using the casing from the old power
supply<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.410> last<00:00:34.739> week<00:00:35.360> so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
supply that we got it out last week so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.790 
supply that we got it out last week so
we're<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.719> start<00:00:36.780> taking<00:00:37.140> some<00:00:37.500> stuff

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
we're going to start taking some stuff

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.490 
we're going to start taking some stuff
apart<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.050> see<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.440> some

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
apart here and see if we can get some

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.639 
apart here and see if we can get some
ideas<00:00:41.010> how<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> put<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.550> together<00:00:42.620> well<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
ideas how to put this together well I

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
ideas how to put this together well I
didn't<00:00:44.040> feel<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.450> redoing<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> cable

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
didn't feel like redoing all the cable

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.770 
didn't feel like redoing all the cable
management<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.600> we

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
management on this just to do it so we

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.569 
management on this just to do it so we
just<00:00:48.930> took<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> mounting<00:00:49.620> screws<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.250> so

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
just took the mounting screws out so

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.549 
just took the mounting screws out so
that<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.879> could<00:00:51.030> slide<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.660> power<00:00:51.840> supply<00:00:52.140> out

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that we could slide the power supply out

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.850 
that we could slide the power supply out
of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> case<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.370> work<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.690> first<00:00:55.559> thing<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
of the case and work on it first thing I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
of the case and work on it first thing I
did<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.190> take<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> grill<00:00:56.820> off<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.379> can

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
did was take the grill off so we can

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
did was take the grill off so we can
unmount<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> fan<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.300> I'm<00:01:00.510> pulling<00:01:00.899> all

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
unmount the fan and then I'm pulling all

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.709 
unmount the fan and then I'm pulling all
the<00:01:01.170> stickers<00:01:01.469> off<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.329> use<00:01:03.510> our

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the stickers off so now we can use our

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
the stickers off so now we can use our
goo<00:01:03.989> gone<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.890> rid<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.519> glue

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.620 
ready to put into the power supply
that's<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:17.130> NZXT<00:01:18.530> 120<00:01:19.610> blue<00:01:20.610> lip<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.299> had<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that's an NZXT 120 blue lip we had to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.179 
that's an NZXT 120 blue lip we had to
cut<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> wires<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.210> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
cut the wires off on it this is the

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
cut the wires off on it this is the
excess<00:01:26.189> wire<00:01:26.460> from<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.659> want

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
excess wire from it we don't really want

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.920 
excess wire from it we don't really want
all<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.439> power<00:01:28.650> supply<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.659> as<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> can

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
all that the power supply and as you can

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.710 
all that the power supply and as you can
see<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.290> connectors<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.369> one

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
see all the connectors on the other one

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
see all the connectors on the other one
they<00:01:33.720> put<00:01:33.960> quite<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.500> wire<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
they put quite a bit of wire on it and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
they put quite a bit of wire on it and
it's<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.530> 3-pin<00:01:37.530> connector<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:39.060> hook<00:01:39.600> up

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it's got a 3-pin connector to hook up

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.990 
it's got a 3-pin connector to hook up
your<00:01:40.560> speed<00:01:40.950> sensor<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> power

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
your speed sensor but on the power

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.990 
your speed sensor but on the power
supply<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.750> no<00:01:42.930> speed<00:01:43.170> sensor<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.820> we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
supply there is no speed sensor so we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.580 
supply there is no speed sensor so we
spliced<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> original<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.350> wire

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
spliced in the original to wire

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.630 
spliced in the original to wire
connector<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.030> power<00:01:48.329> supply<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:50.490> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
connector for the power supply just so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.810 
connector for the power supply just so
we<00:01:50.759> could<00:01:50.909> put<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.119> right<00:01:51.390> into<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.820> stock

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
we could put it right into the stock

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.060 
we could put it right into the stock
plug<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.390> there<00:01:54.659> without<00:01:55.470> having<00:01:55.950> any

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
plug in there without having any

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.069 
plug in there without having any
external<00:01:56.460> wires<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.659> we're<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> go

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
external wires so we're going to go

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.830 
external wires so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.409> mount<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.479> well<00:02:00.479> here's<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
of this mod will be done well we've done

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.420 
of this mod will be done well we've done
some<00:02:11.280> modifications<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:13.069> power<00:02:14.069> supply

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
some modifications to the power supply

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.160 
some modifications to the power supply
the<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.510> old<00:02:15.690> power<00:02:16.590> supply<00:02:16.769> case<00:02:18.170> basically

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the the old power supply case basically

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.070 
the the old power supply case basically
cut<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.530> back<00:02:19.800> piece<00:02:20.099> off<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:21.569> also<00:02:21.720> cut

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
cut the back piece off and we also cut

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.370 
cut the back piece off and we also cut
off<00:02:22.200> one<00:02:22.470> side<00:02:22.830> piece<00:02:23.569> you<00:02:24.569> could<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.170> by

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
off one side piece you could do this by

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.960 
off one side piece you could do this by
making<00:02:25.590> holes<00:02:26.040> through<00:02:26.430> them<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> run<00:02:26.819> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
making holes through them to run the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.309 
making holes through them to run the
cables<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.530> don't<00:02:29.190> feel<00:02:29.340> like

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
cables but I just don't feel like

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.080 
cables but I just don't feel like
redoing<00:02:31.319> all<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.590> wires<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.370> stuff<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.819> there

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
redoing all the wires and stuff in there

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.270 
redoing all the wires and stuff in there
and<00:02:33.269> I'm<00:02:33.540> doing<00:02:33.780> everything<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:35.069> we're<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
and I'm doing everything so we're just

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.309 
and I'm doing everything so we're just
going<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.580> take<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.910> two<00:02:36.090> sides<00:02:36.390> up<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.110> that

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
going to take the two sides up so that

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.000 
going to take the two sides up so that
we<00:02:37.349> can<00:02:37.620> stick<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.220> there<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:39.769> conceal<00:02:40.769> all

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
we can stick it in there and conceal all

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.370 
we can stick it in there and conceal all
the<00:02:41.160> cables<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.819> here<00:02:42.239> without<00:02:42.750> having<00:02:43.319> to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the cables in here without having to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.979 
the cables in here without having to
redo<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.799> whole<00:02:43.830> computer<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.989> so

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
redo the whole computer to do it so

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.830 
redo the whole computer to do it so
we're<00:02:46.319> going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.830> sand<00:02:47.580> this<00:02:47.819> up<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.630> some

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
we're going to sand this up and get some

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.630 
we're going to sand this up and get some
primer<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.849> start<00:02:50.849> paint<00:02:51.680> well<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:52.920> re

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
primer on it and start paint well we re

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.910 
primer on it and start paint well we re
bundled<00:02:54.090> all<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.110> cables<00:02:55.500> make<00:02:55.769> them<00:02:55.890> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
bundled all the cables make them a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.160 
bundled all the cables make them a
little<00:02:56.010> bit<00:02:56.250> tighter<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.480> we<00:02:57.569> can<00:02:57.720> fit<00:02:57.900> them<00:02:57.989> up

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
little bit tighter so we can fit them up

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.250 
little bit tighter so we can fit them up
closer<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.739> power<00:02:58.920> supply<00:03:00.049> here's<00:03:01.049> our

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
closer to the power supply here's our

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.720 
closer to the power supply here's our
piece<00:03:01.620> after<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.340> been<00:03:02.549> painted<00:03:04.519> ready<00:03:05.519> to

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
piece after it's been painted ready to

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.410 
piece after it's been painted ready to
slide<00:03:06.239> in<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.700> we<00:03:08.700> also<00:03:08.850> turned<00:03:09.269> it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
slide in there and we also turned it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.870 
slide in there and we also turned it
with<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.600> notch<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.170> back<00:03:10.440> here<00:03:10.859> so<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.760> we

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
with a notch in the back here so that we

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.849 
with a notch in the back here so that we
could<00:03:12.030> put<00:03:12.239> these<00:03:12.390> front<00:03:12.840> cables<00:03:13.319> through

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
could put these front cables through

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.190 
could put these front cables through
that<00:03:14.040> notch<00:03:14.359> so<00:03:15.359> we<00:03:15.480> should<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.810> able<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.049> fit

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
that notch so we should be able to fit

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.740 
that notch so we should be able to fit
it<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.470> there<00:03:16.500> snugly<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.400> my<00:03:18.090> try<00:03:18.329> to<00:03:18.390> set<00:03:18.660> her

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
it in there snugly so my try to set her

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.099 
it in there snugly so my try to set her
in<00:03:18.810> there<00:03:20.090> okay<00:03:21.090> that's<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.750> looks<00:03:21.930> like

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
in there okay that's what it looks like

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.530 
in there okay that's what it looks like
installed<00:03:22.730> looks<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.850> little<00:03:23.970> bit<00:03:24.180> neater<00:03:24.389> than

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
installed looks a little bit neater than

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.809 
installed looks a little bit neater than
having<00:03:25.079> all<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.470> cables<00:03:26.130> sticking<00:03:26.549> out<00:03:26.700> of

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
having all the cables sticking out of

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.050 
having all the cables sticking out of
there<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.150> even<00:03:27.900> contemplated<00:03:28.799> maybe<00:03:29.670> cutting

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
there I even contemplated maybe cutting

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.020 
there I even contemplated maybe cutting
a<00:03:30.180> hole<00:03:30.359> for<00:03:30.690> another<00:03:31.340> 120<00:03:32.340> millimeter<00:03:32.730> fan

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
a hole for another 120 millimeter fan

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.569 
a hole for another 120 millimeter fan
just<00:03:33.389> to<00:03:33.510> make<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.810> two<00:03:33.959> match<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.280> kind<00:03:35.489> of

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
just to make the two match so it kind of

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.460 
just to make the two match so it kind of
would<00:03:35.700> look<00:03:35.880> like<00:03:36.060> dual<00:03:36.780> power<00:03:36.989> supplies

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
would look like dual power supplies

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.729 
would look like dual power supplies
instead<00:03:37.889> of<00:03:38.130> just<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.400> cover<00:03:38.670> for<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.900> cables

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
instead of just a cover for the cables

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.050 
instead of just a cover for the cables
but<00:03:41.569> it's<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.660> cheap<00:03:42.900> way<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.170> hide<00:03:43.769> them<00:03:44.060> looks

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
but it's a cheap way to hide them looks

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.360 
but it's a cheap way to hide them looks
a<00:03:45.180> little<00:03:45.329> neater<00:03:45.690> predicts<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.650> wires<00:03:46.859> who

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
a little neater predicts the wires who

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.270 
a little neater predicts the wires who
won't<00:03:47.519> get<00:03:47.790> caught<00:03:48.209> into<00:03:48.480> anything<00:03:49.280> we're

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
won't get caught into anything we're

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.590 
won't get caught into anything we're
going<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.459> go<00:03:50.579> ahead<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:50.760> fire<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.239> up<00:03:51.359> and

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
going to go ahead and fire it up and

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.470 
going to go ahead and fire it up and
check<00:03:51.690> on<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:52.549> new<00:03:53.549> fan<00:03:53.850> we<00:03:54.090> put<00:03:54.269> in<00:03:54.389> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
check on that new fan we put in the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.729 
check on that new fan we put in the
power<00:03:54.630> supply<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.079> make<00:03:55.380> sure<00:03:55.410> that's

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
power supply and make sure that's

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.039 
power supply and make sure that's
working<00:03:57.019> alright<00:03:58.019> here<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.530> is<00:03:58.680> all<00:03:58.920> done<00:04:00.049> did

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
working alright here it is all done did

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.110 
working alright here it is all done did
a<00:04:01.079> couple<00:04:01.319> other<00:04:01.590> mods<00:04:02.099> I<00:04:02.370> took<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.700> back<00:04:02.880> out

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
a couple other mods I took it back out

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.900 
a couple other mods I took it back out
and<00:04:03.500> made<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.530> notch<00:04:04.889> in<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.250> back<00:04:05.519> here

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
and made a notch in the back here

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:06.930 
and made a notch in the back here
because<00:04:06.750> they

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
because they

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.670 
because they
was<00:04:07.090> kind<00:04:07.300> of<00:04:07.390> pushing<00:04:07.600> up<00:04:07.900> against<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.440> wires

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
was kind of pushing up against the wires

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.010 
was kind of pushing up against the wires
for<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.130> motherboard<00:04:09.670> just<00:04:10.450> to<00:04:10.540> make<00:04:10.600> sure<00:04:10.750> it

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
for the motherboard just to make sure it

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.420 
for the motherboard just to make sure it
didn't<00:04:11.260> put<00:04:11.410> too<00:04:11.530> much<00:04:11.680> stress<00:04:12.100> on<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
didn't put too much stress on the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.390 
didn't put too much stress on the
connectors<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.530> also<00:04:14.530> made<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.770> notch<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.070> the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
connectors and also made a notch in the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.840 
connectors and also made a notch in the
front<00:04:15.730> here<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.989> run<00:04:17.620> our<00:04:17.799> power<00:04:18.010> out<00:04:18.310> for<00:04:18.670> our

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
front here to run our power out for our

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.390 
front here to run our power out for our
side<00:04:19.150> cover<00:04:19.420> band<00:04:19.810> so<00:04:20.620> we<00:04:20.709> didn't<00:04:20.950> have<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.220> run

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
side cover band so we didn't have to run

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.690 
side cover band so we didn't have to run
it<00:04:21.430> all<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.790> way<00:04:22.030> around<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.390> box<00:04:22.660> but<00:04:23.700> that's

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
it all the way around the box but that's

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.860 
it all the way around the box but that's
it<00:04:24.910> for<00:04:25.180> now<00:04:25.300> that's<00:04:25.690> looks<00:04:26.680> pretty<00:04:26.950> good

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
it for now that's looks pretty good

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.360 
it for now that's looks pretty good
should<00:04:28.870> work<00:04:29.080> efficiently<00:04:29.620> keeping<00:04:30.190> the

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
should work efficiently keeping the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.060 
should work efficiently keeping the
wires<00:04:30.790> all<00:04:31.270> tidied<00:04:31.720> up<00:04:31.890> thanks<00:04:32.890> for<00:04:33.040> watching
