on the cutting edge of new technology
the<00:00:43.140> typical<00:00:43.320> light<00:00:43.739> will<00:00:44.070> need<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the typical light will need a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.240 
the typical light will need a
high-voltage<00:00:45.180> wire<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.050> run<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> because

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
high-voltage wire to run to it because

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.729 
high-voltage wire to run to it because
LEDs<00:00:47.670> are<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.030> efficient<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.440> amount<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
LEDs are so efficient the amount of

LEDs are so efficient the amount of
electricity<00:00:50.100> coming<00:00:50.550> through<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> cable<00:00:51.090> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
electricity coming through a cable that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.240 
electricity coming through a cable that
delivers<00:00:51.780> your<00:00:51.899> internet<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.500> enough<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
delivers your internet is enough to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.209 
delivers your internet is enough to
light<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> house<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
light a house and so we have this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
light a house and so we have this
capacity<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.449> future<00:00:57.510> when

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
capacity here so that in the future when

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
capacity here so that in the future when
that<00:00:58.079> technology<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.680> mature<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.670> take

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that technology is mature we can take

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.270 
that technology is mature we can take
advantage<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.809> also<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.039> great

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
advantage of it also we have great
