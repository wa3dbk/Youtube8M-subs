00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
detail in this thing is phenomenal I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.959 
detail in this thing is phenomenal I
really<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.489> they've<00:00:41.640> done<00:00:41.670> with

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969

really do like what they've done with
this<00:00:42.090> thing<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> few<00:00:44.040> minor

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
this thing there is just a few minor

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.970 
this thing there is just a few minor
quirks<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> articulation<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
quirks with the articulation and if you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.639 
quirks with the articulation and if you
I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.760> quality<00:00:48.450> control<00:00:48.960> flaws<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I think quality control flaws that I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.729 
I think quality control flaws that I
discovered<00:00:50.190> first<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.300> being<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.230> gimpy

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
discovered first one being this gimpy

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.100 
discovered first one being this gimpy
knee<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:54.809> loose

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
knee here it's really just really loose

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
knee here it's really just really loose
and<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.800> don't<00:00:56.039> know<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.910> maybe

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and I just don't know what I can maybe

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
and I just don't know what I can maybe
pop<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.100> if

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
pop that I don't know I don't know if

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.880 
pop that I don't know I don't know if
that's<00:00:59.370> fixable<00:00:59.730> or<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.090> but<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that's fixable or not but and then the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.139 
that's fixable or not but and then the
other<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:02.309> too<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.789> feeling<00:01:02.940> with

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
other thing too when I was feeling with

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.329 
other thing too when I was feeling with
them<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:04.799> gaps<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
them like like you can see some gaps in

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.450 
them like like you can see some gaps in
here<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.299> joints<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> I'm<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.310> don't

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
here in the joints and I'm just I don't

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.219 
here in the joints and I'm just I don't
know<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:08.939> okay<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> mean<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.810> that's<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
know that's okay I mean that's that's to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
know that's okay I mean that's that's to
be<00:01:10.290> expected<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.450> giant<00:01:12.450> gap<00:01:12.630> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
be expected but in here giant gap in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
be expected but in here giant gap in
there<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
there and then you can kind of see it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
there and then you can kind of see it
here<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.689> one's<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:15.900> bad<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.280> was

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
here so that one's not bad and it was

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.249 
here so that one's not bad and it was
some<00:01:17.549> flashing<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.210> there<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> had<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> actually

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
some flashing in there I had to actually

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.700 
some flashing in there I had to actually
peel<00:01:20.250> off<00:01:20.490> too<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.450> annoyed<00:01:22.439> me

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
peel off too so that kind of annoyed me

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
peel off too so that kind of annoyed me
but<00:01:22.920> other<00:01:23.070> than<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.700> figures<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
but other than that this figures is to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
but other than that this figures is to
complete<00:01:24.990> win

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
complete win

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
complete win
you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> understand<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.570> articulation<00:01:28.350> what

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you can understand the articulation what

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.289 
you can understand the articulation what
they<00:01:28.619> were<00:01:28.680> trying<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.430> but

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
they were trying to do with this but

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.600 
they were trying to do with this but
because<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> way<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.860> sculpted<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
because of the way it's sculpted and the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.010 
because of the way it's sculpted and the
armor<00:01:32.909> everything's<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.479> lot<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.720> things<00:01:33.900> are

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
armor everything's a lot of things are

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.130 
armor everything's a lot of things are
hindered<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.860> his<00:01:35.640> ABS<00:01:35.970> abdomen<00:01:36.930> here

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
hindered like in his ABS abdomen here

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.600 
hindered like in his ABS abdomen here
you<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.560> back<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> forth<00:01:38.070> motion

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you got this back and forth motion

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.710 
you got this back and forth motion
there's<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> ball<00:01:39.090> joint<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.630> move

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
there's a ball joint so you can move

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.999 
there's a ball joint so you can move
them<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:40.079> over<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> place<00:01:40.409> spin<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> all

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
them all over the place spin it all

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.609 
them all over the place spin it all
around<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.479> limited<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> crunch

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
around but it is limited for the crunch

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.990 
around but it is limited for the crunch
there<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.369> can't<00:01:44.610> move<00:01:44.820> them

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
there so you really can't move them

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.910 
there so you really can't move them
forward<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> same<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> head

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
forward at all and same with the head

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.039
