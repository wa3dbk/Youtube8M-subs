and Julie think of Subarus Forester at
the<00:00:24.800> moment<00:00:25.100> what<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:25.370> drive<00:00:25.940> discoveries<00:00:26.480> in

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
the moment what you drive discoveries in

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.080 
the moment what you drive discoveries in
the<00:00:26.630> moment<00:00:26.930> yes<00:00:27.590> for<00:00:28.250> your<00:00:28.340> towing<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:28.850> I<00:00:28.880> mean

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
the moment yes for your towing so I mean

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.029 
the moment yes for your towing so I mean
you're<00:00:29.869> coming<00:00:30.140> from<00:00:30.230> if<00:00:30.619> you<00:00:30.740> went<00:00:30.920> for

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
you're coming from if you went for

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:31.900 
you're coming from if you went for
something<00:00:31.160> like<00:00:31.340> this<00:00:31.430> you're<00:00:31.580> coming<00:00:31.789> for

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
something like this you're coming for

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.310 
something like this you're coming for
something<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:32.509> does<00:00:32.689> have<00:00:32.899> that<00:00:33.020> rugged

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
something that does have that rugged

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.920 
something that does have that rugged
four-wheel<00:00:33.860> drive<00:00:34.220> looks<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.540> something<00:00:35.900> that

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
four-wheel drive looks to something that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.020 
four-wheel drive looks to something that
is<00:00:36.320> more<00:00:36.680> car<00:00:36.950> like<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.640> certainly<00:00:37.760> in<00:00:37.970> the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
is more car like and certainly in the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.580 
is more car like and certainly in the
way<00:00:38.120> that<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.390> drives<00:00:38.570> as<00:00:38.720> well<00:00:38.750> in<00:00:39.020> dirt<00:00:39.200> yeah

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
way that it drives as well in dirt yeah

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.770 
way that it drives as well in dirt yeah
that<00:00:39.800> would<00:00:39.920> be<00:00:39.950> a<00:00:40.070> conscious<00:00:40.550> choice<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:41.540> think

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
that would be a conscious choice I think

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.310 
that would be a conscious choice I think
if<00:00:42.370> if<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:43.550> did<00:00:43.730> change<00:00:44.540> from<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:45.050> four

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
if if you did change from the four

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.780 
if if you did change from the four
before<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.710> traditional<00:00:46.280> father<00:00:46.430> file<00:00:46.640> which

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
before the traditional father file which

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.940 
before the traditional father file which
we<00:00:46.940> drive<00:00:47.239> to<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.200> I<00:00:48.440> think<00:00:48.770> you<00:00:48.829> would<00:00:48.920> be

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
we drive to this I think you would be

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.990 
we drive to this I think you would be
doing<00:00:49.220> it<00:00:49.309> for<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.520> reason

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
doing it for a reason

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.760 
doing it for a reason
it's<00:00:50.329> obviously<00:00:50.630> this<00:00:50.840> sits<00:00:51.079> or<00:00:51.200> lower<00:00:51.500> than

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's obviously this sits or lower than

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.490 
it's obviously this sits or lower than
something<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.579> could<00:00:52.730> discovery<00:00:53.200> this<00:00:54.200> is<00:00:54.380> this

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
something I could discovery this is this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.870 
something I could discovery this is this
have<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.829> ground<00:00:55.040> clearance<00:00:55.340> that<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.700> might

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
have the ground clearance that you might

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.600 
have the ground clearance that you might
be<00:00:56.090> this<00:00:56.540> feels<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.260> me<00:00:57.290> like<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:58.160> hugs<00:00:58.370> the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
be this feels to me like it hugs the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.880 
be this feels to me like it hugs the
road<00:00:58.640> better<00:00:59.059> yeah<00:00:59.780> it<00:01:00.110> really<00:01:00.320> does<00:01:00.620> feel

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890
