 It's pretty hard to come out 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.260
 Oh my point of view 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.009
 Get off once and check the position

 Good 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.499

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.460
 Anyway if it parks, it will be repaired even if it is depressed 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.500
 This car has considerable power 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.500
