00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.966
Corel Painter 2016 lets you use audio from your 
computer’s microphone or internal audio

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.766
to modify the look and feel of any brush. 

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.833
For example, your brushstrokes may change 
their appearance

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.833
 in synch with streaming music.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:26.066
Audio Expression allows you to link a variety of 
brush controls to audio input. 

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:34.299
To link brush effects to an audio input, choose 
Window &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Settings Panel.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.299
Enable the "Enable Audio Input" check box.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.599
A pop-up window will appear with more 
information on using  Audio Expression.

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:56.133
Now choose Window &gt; Brush Control Panels, 
and choose any of the following panels

00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.366
which allow you to add Audio Expression.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.533
Size — Opacity —  Angle —  Stroke Jitter —  
Color Variability — Color Expression 

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.966
Dynamic Speckles —  Grain —  Airbrush —  
Liquid Ink — Particles- Common

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.666
Gravity Particles —  Spring Particles.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.232
Select a brush.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:23.199
Select a brush setting that you would like to add 
Audio Expression to, for example, size.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Click the Audio Expression button.

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:32.332
In the Audio Settings panel, move the following 
sliders:

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:36.633
Strength — adjusts the strength of the audio 
signal.

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:39.099
Range — sets the range of the audio 
expression.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.766
Now play your music and get painting!

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:47.866
Color Variability and Size linked to Audio 
Expression.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:02.566
Now using a brush from the Audio Expression 
brush category...

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:14.466
Adjusting the strength of an audio signal, 
controls its impact on a brush. 

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:19.666
If you link brush size to quiet audio, increasing 
the strength will result in wider brushstrokes. 

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:26.366
Conversely, if the audio is loud, decreasing the 
strength will result in narrower brushstrokes.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:37.166
In addition, you can set the range of the audio 
expression to achieve

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.066
a wider range of brushstroke variation 

00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:42.966
(for example, minimum to maximum brush-
stroke width), 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.433
regardless of whether the audio is consistently 
strong, low, or varies.
