without<00:00:18.660> water<00:00:19.430> it's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.840> special<00:00:21.840> issue<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
without water it's a special issue a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.590 
without water it's a special issue a
single<00:00:23.250> topic<00:00:23.430> issue<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.090> we're<00:00:24.210> doing<00:00:24.359> when

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
single topic issue that we're doing when

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.099 
single topic issue that we're doing when
we<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.960> them<00:00:25.289> every<00:00:25.710> couple<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.910> years<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.449> think

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
we do them every couple of years I think

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.130 
we do them every couple of years I think
the<00:00:28.949> thing<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.750> more

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the thing that that we want to do more

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.179

than anything else
in<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.640> issue<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.230> illustrate<00:00:34.230> how

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
in this issue is illustrate how

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.500 
in this issue is illustrate how
incredibly<00:00:35.370> precious<00:00:36.300> water<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:39.210> water

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
incredibly precious water is the water

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.930 
incredibly precious water is the water
issue<00:00:39.950> to<00:00:40.950> me<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> heard<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:41.670> were<00:00:41.700> done

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
issue to me when I heard they were done

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
issue to me when I heard they were done
any<00:00:42.510> showing<00:00:42.750> water<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.989> thought<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
any showing water I thought this is the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.650 
any showing water I thought this is the
best<00:00:43.530> issue<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.610> Jim<00:00:44.850> ever<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.210> ever<00:00:45.420> do

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
best issue that Jim ever can ever do

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.619 
best issue that Jim ever can ever do
this<00:00:45.780> isn't<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.170> an<00:00:46.289> emergency<00:00:47.129> situation

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
this isn't like an emergency situation

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.549 
this isn't like an emergency situation
because<00:00:48.629> then<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.960> traveling<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.500> all

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
because then all the traveling and all

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.770 
because then all the traveling and all
the<00:00:49.590> other<00:00:49.950> stories<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.910> think<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the other stories I do I think that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
the other stories I do I think that
topic<00:00:52.110> comes<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.920> where<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.760> get

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
topic comes up a lot like where they get

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.570 
topic comes up a lot like where they get
in<00:00:53.969> water<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> clean<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> no<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.620> isn't

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
in water and is it clean and no it isn't

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.730 
in water and is it clean and no it isn't
when<00:00:58.150> found<00:00:58.570> her<00:00:58.810> way<00:00:58.990> to<00:00:59.050> these<00:00:59.350> places<00:00:59.620> that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
when found her way to these places that

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.800 
when found her way to these places that
had<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.460> problems<00:01:00.820> nobody's<00:01:01.630> in<00:01:01.720> there

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
had the problems nobody's in there

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.900 
had the problems nobody's in there
solving<00:01:02.140> them<00:01:02.230> so<00:01:03.010> then<00:01:03.160> you<00:01:03.250> get<00:01:03.400> it<00:01:03.490> it's

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
solving them so then you get it it's

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.980 
solving them so then you get it it's
more<00:01:04.120> wrong<00:01:06.120> we're<00:01:07.120> looking<00:01:07.360> at<00:01:07.450> how<00:01:07.600> people

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
more wrong we're looking at how people

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.990 
more wrong we're looking at how people
live<00:01:08.230> and<00:01:08.740> we're<00:01:08.890> sort<00:01:09.010> of<00:01:09.100> checking<00:01:09.550> in<00:01:09.700> at<00:01:09.910> a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000

particular moment in time and trying to

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.780 
particular moment in time and trying to
get<00:01:12.160> people<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.550> big<00:01:12.760> picture<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.310> much<00:01:15.340> of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
get people the big picture so much of

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.150 
get people the big picture so much of
the<00:01:15.880> world's<00:01:16.360> freshwater<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:17.410> locked<00:01:17.710> up<00:01:17.860> in

liters of water a day it's a bad pun but
water<00:01:52.149> can<00:01:52.479> be<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.630> dry<00:01:52.899> subject<00:01:53.229> too<00:01:53.560> if<00:01:53.710> it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
water can be a dry subject too if it

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.300 
water can be a dry subject too if it
just<00:01:53.979> becomes<00:01:54.399> all<00:01:55.229> issues<00:01:56.229> every<00:01:56.710> religion

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
just becomes all issues every religion

just becomes all issues every religion
has<00:01:57.960> something<00:01:58.960> that<00:01:59.250> relates<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.399> water<00:02:00.670> in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
has something that relates to water in

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.820 
has something that relates to water in
the<00:02:01.060> religion<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.440> purifying<00:02:03.420> cleansing

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
blessing sort of way so we wanted to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.999 
blessing sort of way so we wanted to
include<00:02:07.660> that<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.530> issue

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.490 

most<00:02:11.730> freshwater<00:02:12.209> species<00:02:12.510> are<00:02:12.930> incredibly
