00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.380
 asks a question 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 him so good i mean he's good 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.469
 all account 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.080
 and suddenly employers find out what he is looking for 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.699
 the job 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.619
 How does it feel bad? 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.480
 here is a reptile here with us in the country where I am 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.410
 I live a man from you to this bad 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.410
 refers here it depends on what it means 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.680
 big employer or small if 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.690
 the employer is big there everything is so 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 human relations are few there in 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.590
 Basically everything is regulated here is how 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.129
 labor code 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.340
 when the employer is small then it is more 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.590
 it could be more emotional and so 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 further, but in principle, imagine 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.750
 the manager we need gives birth to that someone 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.539
 looking for a job means his manager 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 the task of protecting yourself and your 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.789
 organizing your group 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.920
 from the fact that he suddenly turns out to be 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.979
 the fact that some work needs to be done 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 a person has no he starts someone 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:15.090
 look for example so he except 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.250
 Moreover, he may suspect this world that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.820
 the man who is going to leave he 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.759
 maybe there a little drag copy as 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.799
 there are materials depends on the degree 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.150
 the suspicion of that person or 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:34.980
 the secrets of man I remember my brother in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.320
 Moscow was the head of this it worked 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.820
 in academic and he has such a phrase somehow 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.930
 said the horse is good not yet suffered 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:48.480
 employee is not going to leave here 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.280
 here, too, and this does not apply badly 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.740
 in the sense that here is a country 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.640
 law abiding people and you have 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.280
 the right to leave work at any time when 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.380
 you just want to do it well, just 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.980
 you must understand that there is a difference 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.090
 between law and ethics understand here 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.190
 There are things for which for example in court 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.890
 you can not file but the hand above the measure is not 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.410
 This part is also falling 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.800
 present or say there will call 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.870
 zara affarin is not good for litter we are not 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.200
 we will be there for him to talk there and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.960
 then 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.900
 so there is a legal part and there is 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440
 ethical moral this is necessary 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.450
 understand 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.840
 someone may be offended it depends 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.050
 arrangements that you were to choose 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.720
 this is the only example man came and 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.160
 someone asked for him there 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.950
 playing this kind of person he will 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.140
 he try to go here and he and everything 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.730
 he went to meet that is on the very 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.130
 it may not be necessary 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.870
 fighting took but it just so happened go 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.930
 further explained and he will take 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.840
 spit there and and go get it this too 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.130
 happens and as if well, yes according to circumstances 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.380
 look 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.300
 man does not feel bad because 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.370
 he goes somewhere that if something but if 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.510
 you work somewhere and at the same time 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.790
 well known are you looking for a job 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.340
 this man he can undermine as if 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.800
 the integrity of this collective mood 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.720
 in him he can share with someone from those 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.060
 who does he work with and these people instead 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.940
 to think about work start thinking about 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.460
 the fact that Iâ€™d somehow bring down 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.470
 the manager in the company paid little there 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.240
 there guys worked for twelve 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.330
 thirteen dollars but so there 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.450
 pays and they worked in support for these 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.790
 money I was a testing manager 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.400
 and I was told we will take the guys from 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.800
 our support is good here about them there 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.960
 how many scored gave them a couple of bucks 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.510
 from above so that for motivation and then 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.340
 passed maybe I don't know three or four 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.400
 of the month and one of them 1 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.920
 found a job go out to 35 dollars often 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.570
 smokes packard at $ 35 per hour has passed 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.550
 three months none left all 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.640
 you have gone and everything went to $ 35 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.910
 so 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.550
 it might be destructive you 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.950
 you can say and let them pay more 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.350
 but it's kind of not your business 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.320
 yes they have their own budget and they 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.640
 somehow function and they can be 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 count on and on 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.200
 function and they may have 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.240
 your thoughts why for this job from 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.910
 pay so much or not so much in the market 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.010
 you can easily find people for one and the same 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.680
 the same work is twice as much 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.060
 or there it is two times less so it is on 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.460
 really not your business here they are 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.160
 they live may not love someone for something 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.950
 that here he creates such a situation 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.750
 so of course there may be 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.090
 very negative reaction actually 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.700
 very often very often 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.760
 if they found out that you are looking for a job for you 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.390
 just thrown out of there it often happens 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.980
 just how demoralizes the factor that is 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.669
 the probability of this is quite high 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.669
 is happy
