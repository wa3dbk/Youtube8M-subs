the game I left my defense without the
Christmas<00:00:38.909> design<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.449> have<00:00:39.659> two<00:00:39.839> extra

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
and cut this Christmas tree down just

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.300 
and cut this Christmas tree down just
because<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.100> base

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because it's in the way of my base

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.730 
because it's in the way of my base
design<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> don't<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:34.710> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
design and I don't really need it so I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.310 
design and I don't really need it so I
already<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.219> two<00:01:35.640> or<00:01:36.119> actually<00:01:36.719> three<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
already have two or actually three that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.139 
already have two or actually three that
are<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.530> good<00:01:37.770> position<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.640> we'll<00:01:38.820> cut<00:01:38.969> down

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
are in good position so we'll cut down

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.480 
are in good position so we'll cut down
to<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:39.630> we're<00:01:40.530> gonna<00:01:40.649> see<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.219> get<00:01:41.340> from

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to and we're gonna see what we get from

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.760 
to and we're gonna see what we get from
this<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.750> little<00:01:42.960> sad<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.409> these

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this it's a little sad because these

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.490 
this it's a little sad because these
come<00:01:44.039> only<00:01:44.280> once<00:01:44.609> a<00:01:44.820> year<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.390> understand<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
come only once a year I understand that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.310 
come only once a year I understand that
but<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:48.090> what's<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> fun<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.079> can't

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
but you know what's the fun if you can't

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.130 
but you know what's the fun if you can't

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
this Christmas tree because they have to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.460

make the same stuff but hopefully it's

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.910

something<00:02:57.190> better<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.900> think<00:02:58.900> by<00:02:59.470> far<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.860> is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920

Christmas<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.720> don't<00:04:01.870> know<00:04:01.930> what<00:04:02.109> it<00:04:02.200> is<00:04:02.319> maybe

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
Christmas I don't know what it is maybe

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.319 
Christmas I don't know what it is maybe
it's<00:04:02.829> because<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.220> loot<00:04:03.400> is<00:04:03.609> higher<00:04:04.000> for

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
it's because the loot is higher for

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.720 
it's because the loot is higher for
Christmas<00:04:05.170> but<00:04:05.380> i'm<00:04:05.920> excited<00:04:06.220> i<00:04:06.400> got<00:04:06.430> at<00:04:06.700> least

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
Christmas but i'm excited i got at least

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.530 
Christmas but i'm excited i got at least
one<00:04:07.090> defense<00:04:07.480> when<00:04:07.690> this<00:04:07.810> time

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
one defense when this time

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.449 
one defense when this time
and<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.200> think<00:04:09.260> he<00:04:09.500> messed<00:04:09.709> up<00:04:09.890> just<00:04:10.099> because<00:04:10.219> he

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
and I think he messed up just because he

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.949 
and I think he messed up just because he
spent<00:04:10.730> all<00:04:10.909> his<00:04:10.969> wall<00:04:11.329> breakers<00:04:11.689> in<00:04:11.719> there

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
spent all his wall breakers in there

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.380 
spent all his wall breakers in there
like<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.110> that's<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.680> no-no<00:04:13.060> never<00:04:14.060> do<00:04:14.239> that

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
like that that's a no-no never do that

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.840 
like that that's a no-no never do that
it<00:04:15.049> only<00:04:15.319> takes<00:04:15.650> three<00:04:15.980> wall<00:04:16.220> breakers<00:04:16.579> to<00:04:16.729> get

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
it only takes three wall breakers to get

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.590 
it only takes three wall breakers to get
a<00:04:16.880> blue<00:04:17.090> wall<00:04:17.299> like<00:04:17.509> that<00:04:17.750> if<00:04:17.989> they're<00:04:18.560> maxed

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
a blue wall like that if they're maxed

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.150 
a blue wall like that if they're maxed
and<00:04:20.600> so<00:04:21.049> he<00:04:21.169> spend<00:04:21.410> them<00:04:21.560> all<00:04:21.680> in<00:04:21.889> there<00:04:22.039> and

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
and so he spend them all in there and

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.950 
and so he spend them all in there and
they<00:04:22.220> they<00:04:22.520> all<00:04:22.729> went<00:04:23.000> down<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.449> now<00:04:23.630> he<00:04:23.690> has

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
they they all went down so now he has

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.499 
they they all went down so now he has
his<00:04:24.080> golems<00:04:24.759> blocking<00:04:25.759> all<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.000> weapons<00:04:26.330> with

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
his golems blocking all the weapons with

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.900 
his golems blocking all the weapons with
their<00:04:26.660> face<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.430> they're<00:04:28.430> gonna<00:04:28.550> try<00:04:28.789> and

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
their face and they're gonna try and

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.430 
their face and they're gonna try and
force<00:04:29.090> their<00:04:29.300> way<00:04:29.419> in<00:04:31.419> not<00:04:32.419> a<00:04:32.690> bad<00:04:33.110> strategy

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
force their way in not a bad strategy

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.969 
force their way in not a bad strategy
though<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:33.889> believe<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.960> goal<00:04:35.979> white

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
though I believe this is a goal white

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.850 
though I believe this is a goal white
yeah<00:04:37.699> this<00:04:37.940> go<00:04:38.120> away<00:04:38.320> he's<00:04:39.320> got<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.530> peg<00:04:39.740> is

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
yeah this go away he's got a peg is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.490 
yeah this go away he's got a peg is
going<00:04:40.070> around<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:41.060> that's<00:04:41.270> another<00:04:41.509> area<00:04:42.259> he

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
going around and that's another area he

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.230 
going around and that's another area he
messed<00:04:42.740> up<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.070> he<00:04:43.190> didn't<00:04:43.490> spread<00:04:44.030> out<00:04:44.210> his

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
messed up in he didn't spread out his

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.810 
messed up in he didn't spread out his
golems<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.530> take<00:04:45.710> up<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.979> surrounding<00:04:46.490> areas

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
golems to take up the surrounding areas

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.249 
golems to take up the surrounding areas
so<00:04:47.060> now<00:04:47.210> his<00:04:47.360> heroes<00:04:47.720> are<00:04:47.870> going<00:04:48.020> to<00:04:48.080> work

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
so now his heroes are going to work

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.080 
so now his heroes are going to work
their<00:04:48.440> way<00:04:48.560> around<00:04:48.710> there<00:04:49.520> should<00:04:49.550> be<00:04:49.849> like<00:04:50.030> a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
their way around there should be like a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.510 
their way around there should be like a
whole<00:04:50.419> class<00:04:51.139> in<00:04:51.590> school<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:52.039> this<00:04:52.220> stuff

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
whole class in school of this stuff

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.089 
whole class in school of this stuff
because<00:04:53.389> there's<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.660> lot<00:04:53.690> to<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.830> have<00:04:54.979> to

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
because there's a lot to you have to

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.439 
because there's a lot to you have to
learn<00:04:55.250> about<00:04:55.460> clash<00:04:55.789> of<00:04:55.910> clans<00:04:56.150> if<00:04:56.300> you're

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
learn about clash of clans if you're

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.879 
learn about clash of clans if you're
going<00:04:56.570> to<00:04:56.630> be<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.810> high<00:04:57.020> level<00:04:57.380> gamer<00:04:57.620> and

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
going to be a high level gamer and

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.159 
going to be a high level gamer and
you're<00:04:58.430> going<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.639> be<00:04:58.759> attacking<00:04:59.360> strong

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
you're going to be attacking strong

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.200 
you're going to be attacking strong
bases<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.889> have<00:05:01.039> to<00:05:01.160> know<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.669> ins<00:05:01.849> and<00:05:02.030> outs

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
bases you have to know the ins and outs

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.249 
bases you have to know the ins and outs
and<00:05:02.979> I'm<00:05:03.979> guessing<00:05:04.849> he<00:05:05.509> wanted<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.840> forces

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
and I'm guessing he wanted the forces

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.200 
and I'm guessing he wanted the forces
way<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.620> with<00:05:06.800> all<00:05:06.979> of<00:05:07.099> his<00:05:07.190> golems<00:05:07.669> with<00:05:07.970> him

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
way in with all of his golems with him

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.089 
way in with all of his golems with him
but<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.539> cost<00:05:08.780> him<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.199> now<00:05:09.289> his<00:05:09.530> heroes<00:05:09.860> went

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
but it cost him and now his heroes went

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.700 
but it cost him and now his heroes went
around<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.430> outsides<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:12.080> they<00:05:12.289> might<00:05:12.530> be

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
around the outsides so they might be

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.170 
around the outsides so they might be
able<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:12.919> get<00:05:13.010> the<00:05:13.099> fifty<00:05:13.340> percent<00:05:13.639> but<00:05:14.060> we

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
able to get the fifty percent but we

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.960 
able to get the fifty percent but we
already<00:05:14.330> know<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.630> outcome<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:16.280> clan<00:05:16.940> castle

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
already know the outcome the clan castle

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.149 
already know the outcome the clan castle
troops<00:05:17.270> are<00:05:17.510> gonna<00:05:17.630> take<00:05:17.780> him<00:05:17.930> down<00:05:17.960> and<00:05:18.650> yes
