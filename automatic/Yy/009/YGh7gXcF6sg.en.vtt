00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.130 
of time I mean this creation isn't that
big<00:02:50.710> but<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.340> mean<00:02:51.640> some<00:02:51.970> lot<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.450> time<00:02:52.900> went

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
big but I mean some lot of time went

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.310 
big but I mean some lot of time went
into<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.500> because<00:02:54.000> making<00:02:55.000> water<00:02:55.720> parks<00:02:56.140> is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
into it because making water parks is

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.480 
into it because making water parks is
not<00:02:56.530> an<00:02:56.710> easy<00:02:56.860> job<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.860> now<00:02:59.890> I'm<00:03:00.430> gonna<00:03:00.580> switch

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
not an easy job so now I'm gonna switch

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:13.839 
not an easy job so now I'm gonna switch
to<00:03:03.490> my<00:03:03.520> other<00:03:03.820> world<00:03:06.930> water<00:03:07.930> park

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.550 

so<00:03:14.390> basically<00:03:14.840> we<00:03:15.739> have<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.280> little<00:03:17.560> relaxation

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so basically we have a little relaxation

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.750 
so basically we have a little relaxation
pool<00:03:19.280> thing<00:03:20.269> over<00:03:20.510> here<00:03:20.540> with<00:03:20.689> umbrellas<00:03:21.760> you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
pool thing over here with umbrellas you

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.679 
pool thing over here with umbrellas you
can<00:03:22.909> just<00:03:23.060> come<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.299> chill<00:03:24.370> jump<00:03:25.370> in<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:27.319> then

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:28.689 
can just come and chill jump in and then

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:36.429 
can just come and chill jump in and then
over<00:03:29.689> here<00:03:29.719> you<00:03:29.840> walk<00:03:30.230> up<00:03:30.409> here<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:34.400> then<00:03:35.439> look

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
over here you walk up here and then look

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:45.789 
over here you walk up here and then look
up<00:03:36.620> these<00:03:36.799> steps<00:03:38.170> I'm<00:03:39.170> gonna<00:03:39.439> fly<00:03:39.769> up<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:44.799> up

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
up these steps I'm gonna fly up and up

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.270 
up these steps I'm gonna fly up and up
here<00:03:46.069> you<00:03:46.280> go<00:03:46.609> down<00:03:46.790> nice<00:03:47.419> the<00:03:47.629> lad<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:47.930> want

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
here you go down nice the lad you want

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.339 
here you go down nice the lad you want
I'll<00:03:49.280> go<00:03:49.459> down<00:03:49.639> are<00:03:49.939> don't<00:03:50.659> know<00:03:50.780> which<00:03:50.959> one<00:03:51.139> I

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
I'll go down are don't know which one I

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.569 
I'll go down are don't know which one I
think<00:03:51.409> I'll<00:03:51.650> try<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.889> blue<00:03:52.189> one

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
think I'll try the blue one

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:59.470 
think I'll try the blue one
I<00:03:53.500> like<00:03:57.129> they're<00:03:58.129> actually<00:03:58.459> really<00:03:58.549> slow<00:03:59.000> but

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
I like they're actually really slow but

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.099 
I like they're actually really slow but
I<00:03:59.719> mean<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:01.419> don't<00:04:02.419> know<00:04:02.599> how<00:04:02.719> to<00:04:02.810> make<00:04:02.959> it

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
I mean I don't know how to make it

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.770 
I mean I don't know how to make it
faster<00:04:05.859> go<00:04:06.859> all<00:04:07.669> right<00:04:07.849> that's<00:04:08.209> taking<00:04:08.659> too

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
faster go all right that's taking too

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.189 
faster go all right that's taking too
long

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
long

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:14.319 
long
so<00:04:09.889> then<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:10.760> walk<00:04:11.000> down<00:04:11.599> this<00:04:11.810> way<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:14.180> know

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
so then you walk down this way you know

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.580 
so then you walk down this way you know
over<00:04:14.569> here<00:04:15.849> and<00:04:16.849> then<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.389> walk<00:04:17.660> up<00:04:18.109> these

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
over here and then you walk up these

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.129 
over here and then you walk up these
fittest<00:04:19.099> paths<00:04:19.370> and<00:04:20.289> then<00:04:21.289> keep<00:04:21.889> going<00:04:23.139> and

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
fittest paths and then keep going and

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.960 
fittest paths and then keep going and
then<00:04:24.349> over<00:04:24.680> here<00:04:26.620> okay<00:04:27.620> all<00:04:27.889> right<00:04:28.039> you<00:04:28.729> come

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
then over here okay all right you come

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.219 
then over here okay all right you come
down<00:04:29.120> here<00:04:29.289> and<00:04:30.340> then<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.460> see<00:04:31.699> an<00:04:32.030> ice<00:04:32.479> slide

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
down here and then you see an ice slide

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.310 
down here and then you see an ice slide
and<00:04:33.800> obsidian<00:04:34.460> slide<00:04:34.940> because<00:04:35.750> originally<00:04:36.080> I

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
and obsidian slide because originally I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.689 
and obsidian slide because originally I
made<00:04:36.560> an<00:04:36.680> ice<00:04:36.800> slide<00:04:37.009> to<00:04:37.250> see<00:04:37.400> if<00:04:37.520> it<00:04:37.610> would

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
made an ice slide to see if it would

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.089 
made an ice slide to see if it would
make<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:37.970> go<00:04:38.120> faster<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:39.440> then<00:04:39.560> I<00:04:39.889> think

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
make you go faster and then I think

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.790 
make you go faster and then I think
what's<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.310> opposite<00:04:40.820> of<00:04:40.960> ice<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.620> was

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
what's the opposite of ice and I was

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.360 
what's the opposite of ice and I was
thinking

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
thinking

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.790 
thinking
obsidian<00:04:43.909> because<00:04:44.360> ice<00:04:44.570> is<00:04:44.599> water<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.530> I'm

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
obsidian because ice is water and I'm

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.120 
obsidian because ice is water and I'm
sitting<00:04:46.159> it's<00:04:46.280> kind<00:04:46.460> of<00:04:46.490> like<00:04:46.639> lava<00:04:48.009> and<00:04:49.009> you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
sitting it's kind of like lava and you

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.920 
sitting it's kind of like lava and you
just<00:04:49.250> come<00:04:49.759> down<00:04:49.789> here<00:04:49.970> like<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:50.570> go<00:04:50.720> down

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
just come down here like just go down

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.140 
just come down here like just go down
and<00:04:53.800> then<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.919> just<00:04:54.979> to<00:04:55.460> get<00:04:55.580> back<00:04:55.759> you<00:04:56.000> just

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
and then you just to get back you just

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.209 
and then you just to get back you just
go<00:04:56.389> across<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.780> big<00:04:57.139> bridge<00:04:57.590> thing<00:04:57.979> over<00:04:58.190> here

00:04:58.209 --> 00:04:58.219 
go across a big bridge thing over here

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:06.580 
go across a big bridge thing over here
and<00:05:01.930> then<00:05:02.930> for<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.889> final<00:05:04.570> finalist<00:05:05.590> type

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
and then for the final finalist type

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.360 
and then for the final finalist type
slide<00:05:07.400> this<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:08.509> big<00:05:08.810> one<00:05:09.050> this<00:05:09.349> is<00:05:09.560> what

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
slide this is the big one this is what

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.540 
slide this is the big one this is what
took<00:05:10.520> me<00:05:10.580> most<00:05:11.060> of<00:05:11.360> time<00:05:11.599> on<00:05:11.780> this<00:05:11.870> map<00:05:12.550> other

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
took me most of time on this map other

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.129 
took me most of time on this map other
than<00:05:13.759> making<00:05:13.909> these<00:05:14.120> paths<00:05:14.449> which<00:05:14.870> take<00:05:15.110> a

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
than making these paths which take a

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:15.700 
than making these paths which take a
while

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
while

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.350 
while
I'm<00:05:16.099> sure<00:05:16.280> you<00:05:16.400> guys<00:05:16.490> have<00:05:16.669> seen<00:05:16.699> like<00:05:17.090> little

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
I'm sure you guys have seen like little

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.689 
I'm sure you guys have seen like little
glimpses<00:05:17.750> of<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:18.050> I'm<00:05:18.889> not<00:05:19.130> very<00:05:19.280> good<00:05:19.370> at

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
glimpses of it I'm not very good at

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.930 
glimpses of it I'm not very good at
hiding<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.659> being<00:05:20.840> discreet<00:05:21.229> about<00:05:21.349> it<00:05:21.639> so<00:05:22.639> we

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
hiding it being discreet about it so we

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.080 
hiding it being discreet about it so we
come<00:05:23.330> over<00:05:23.360> here

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
come over here

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.439 
come over here
and<00:05:25.210> we<00:05:25.360> have<00:05:25.570> this<00:05:25.870> big<00:05:26.740> thing<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:28.270> can't

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
and we have this big thing you can't

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.590 
and we have this big thing you can't
tell<00:05:28.630> what<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:28.900> it's<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.110> face<00:05:29.850> look<00:05:30.850> at<00:05:31.000> this

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
tell what it is it's a face look at this

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.760 
tell what it is it's a face look at this
thing<00:05:31.930> it's<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.230> dragon<00:05:34.229> pretty<00:05:35.229> much<00:05:35.380> it's<00:05:35.710> a

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
thing it's a dragon pretty much it's a

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.850 
thing it's a dragon pretty much it's a
dragon<00:05:36.250> slide<00:05:36.720> you<00:05:37.720> go<00:05:38.169> in<00:05:38.320> through<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.650> mouth

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
dragon slide you go in through the mouth

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.730 
dragon slide you go in through the mouth
and<00:05:39.160> you<00:05:39.250> come<00:05:39.550> out<00:05:39.580> through<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.180> tail<00:05:40.740> and

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
and you come out through the tail and
