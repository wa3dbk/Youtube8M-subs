battlefield<00:00:04.980> 3<00:00:05.279> jet<00:00:05.580> loadout<00:00:05.970> for<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.210> today

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
battlefield 3 jet loadout for you today

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.419 
battlefield 3 jet loadout for you today
we've<00:00:07.290> done<00:00:07.470> plenty<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.950> dogfighting

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
we've done plenty of dogfighting

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.980 
we've done plenty of dogfighting
recently<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.360> new<00:00:09.510> air<00:00:09.780> superiority

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
recently in that new air superiority

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.259 
recently in that new air superiority
game-mode<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.550> thought<00:00:11.759> for<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:11.969> one<00:00:12.179> I'd

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
game-mode so I thought for this one I'd

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.419 
game-mode so I thought for this one I'd
switch<00:00:12.540> back<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.139> classic<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.799> use<00:00:14.009> for

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
switch back to a classic and use for

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.250 
switch back to a classic and use for
conquest<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.120> rush<00:00:15.330> 1<00:00:15.929> that's<00:00:16.139> an

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
conquest and rush 1 that's an

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.840 
conquest and rush 1 that's an
air-to-ground<00:00:16.650> loadout<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.730> that

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
air-to-ground loadout just like that

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.730 
air-to-ground loadout just like that
first<00:00:18.150> Strike<00:00:18.690> Fighter<00:00:19.020> load<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.470> opposed

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
first Strike Fighter load that opposed

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.470 
first Strike Fighter load that opposed
to<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.010> part<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.460> new<00:00:20.670> series

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
to this part of this new series

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.900 
to this part of this new series
so<00:00:22.320> today's<00:00:22.619> loadout<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.220> called<00:00:23.519> stealth

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so today's loadout is called stealth

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.529 
so today's loadout is called stealth
bomber

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
bomber

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.759 
bomber
and<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> allow<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.560> perform

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and it's going to allow you to perform

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.980 
and it's going to allow you to perform
strike<00:00:26.340> attacks<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.910> laser<00:00:27.150> designated

posted<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> week<00:00:31.380> or<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.710> back<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.489> probably

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
posted a week or so back it's probably

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
posted a week or so back it's probably
more<00:00:32.940> effective<00:00:33.450> against<00:00:33.870> ground<00:00:34.140> targets

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
more effective against ground targets

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.830 
more effective against ground targets
using<00:00:34.860> those<00:00:35.160> rocket<00:00:35.520> pods<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.480> guided

missile in battlefield 3 is a little bit
weak<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> definitely<00:00:39.629> need<00:00:39.899> some

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the soul plan so while I strike fighter

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
the soul plan so while I strike fighter
loadout<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.399> effective<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:48.360> one's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
loadout it's more effective this one's

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.029 
loadout it's more effective this one's
still<00:00:48.899> lots<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.230> fun<00:00:49.469> where<00:00:49.649> they've<00:00:49.770> been<00:00:49.800> out

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
still lots of fun where they've been out

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.040 
still lots of fun where they've been out
to<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.430> roll<00:00:50.700> play<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.539> pretend<00:00:51.660> you're

to kind of roll play and pretend you're

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.410 
to kind of roll play and pretend you're
flying<00:00:52.320> around<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> those<00:00:53.039> cool<00:00:53.420> f-117

flying around in one of those cool f-117
stealth<00:00:54.449> bombers<00:00:55.170> I've<00:00:56.100> listed<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
stealth bombers I've listed the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.040 
stealth bombers I've listed the
difficulty<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.719> rookie

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
difficulty for this one is rookie

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
difficulty for this one is rookie
because<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.440> are<00:00:58.530> using<00:00:58.739> guided<00:00:59.129> missiles<00:00:59.670> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
because we are using guided missiles so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.310 
because we are using guided missiles so
all<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.750> hold<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.109> jet

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
all you have to do is just hold your jet

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.750 
all you have to do is just hold your jet
on<00:01:01.440> target<00:01:01.829> until<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.340> lock-on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
on target until you get that lock-on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.509 
on target until you get that lock-on
then<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.390> fire<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> forget<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> whole

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
then just fire and forget so the whole

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.219 
then just fire and forget so the whole
theme<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.970> stealth<00:01:06.299> bomber<00:01:06.540> setup<00:01:07.049> is

theme of this stealth bomber setup is
it's<00:01:07.560> an<00:01:07.740> air-to-ground<00:01:08.159> jet<00:01:08.729> loadout<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it's an air-to-ground jet loadout to

it's an air-to-ground jet loadout to
eliminate<00:01:09.780> enemy<00:01:10.110> vehicles<00:01:10.790> whereas<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.970> that

eliminate enemy vehicles whereas in that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
eliminate enemy vehicles whereas in that
Strike<00:01:12.479> Fighter<00:01:12.840> loadout<00:01:13.350> we'd<00:01:13.560> both<00:01:13.770> perform

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
Strike Fighter loadout we'd both perform

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.310 
Strike Fighter loadout we'd both perform

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
that faster lock-on but because we're

once you've got those laser designations

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.420 
once you've got those laser designations
it<00:03:37.780> increases<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.410> damage<00:03:38.530> of<00:03:38.830> your<00:03:38.890> guided

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
it increases the damage of your guided

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.280 
it increases the damage of your guided
missile<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.240> makes<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.510> much<00:03:40.630> easier<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.050> get

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
missile it makes it much easier to get

missile it makes it much easier to get
those<00:03:41.440> disables<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.220> destroys
