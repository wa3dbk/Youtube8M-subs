this year it is a flyer almost like it's
almost<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> dual<00:00:41.790> core<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.360> had<00:00:42.870> its<00:00:43.200> been

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
almost like a dual core it had its been

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.959 
almost like a dual core it had its been
clocked<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.010> mortals<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.579> file<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
clocked to mortals and file on a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.119 
clocked to mortals and file on a
megahertz<00:00:45.260> also<00:00:46.260> known<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.620> home<00:00:46.739> ice<00:00:46.920> fog

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
megahertz also known as home ice fog

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.910 
megahertz also known as home ice fog
occurs<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.960> most<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> dual<00:00:49.410> core<00:00:49.710> tablet

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
occurs and most of the dual core tablet

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.360 
occurs and most of the dual core tablet
is<00:00:50.430> having<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.750> hurt<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:53.070> almost

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
is having to you hurt so it's almost

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
is having to you hurt so it's almost
there<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.910> almost<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.780> tablet

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
there it's almost there but this tablet

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
there it's almost there but this tablet
is<00:00:55.530> probably<00:00:56.250> definitely<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.510> at

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
is probably definitely going to have at

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.920 
is probably definitely going to have at
least<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.410> dual<00:00:58.620> core<00:00:59.270> not<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> quad-core<00:01:00.600> dough

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
least a dual core not a quad-core dough

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.070 
least a dual core not a quad-core dough
but<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.440> dual<00:01:02.280> core<00:01:02.609> front-facing<00:01:03.539> camera

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
but a dual core front-facing camera

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.920 
but a dual core front-facing camera
prolly<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.769> running<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.670> android<00:01:06.030> 3.1

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
prolly and running that the android 3.1

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.520 
prolly and running that the android 3.1
hopefully<00:01:07.890> i<00:01:07.920> mean<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.700> latest<00:01:08.970> one

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
hopefully i mean that's the latest one

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.710 
hopefully i mean that's the latest one
possibly<00:01:10.530> running<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.460> android<00:01:11.880> 2.4<00:01:12.510> it's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
possibly running the android 2.4 it's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.530 
possibly running the android 2.4 it's
going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:14.030> combination<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
going to be a combination on the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.620 
going to be a combination on the
gingerbread<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.830> honeycomb<00:01:17.630> android

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
gingerbread and honeycomb android

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.410 
gingerbread and honeycomb android
operating<00:01:18.900> systems<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.180> don't

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
operating systems so right now we don't

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
operating systems so right now we don't
have<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> much<00:01:22.080> about<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> salad<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.040> know

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
have that much about the salad we know

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
have that much about the salad we know
that<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.670> probably<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.330> running

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that it's probably going to be running

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
that it's probably going to be running
on<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> AT&amp;T<00:01:25.320> network<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> disk<00:01:26.640> tablet

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
on the AT&amp;T network and the disk tablet

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.719 
on the AT&amp;T network and the disk tablet
is<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> tell<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> support<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.320> LTE<00:01:28.729> so

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
is going to tell the support for LTE so

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
is going to tell the support for LTE so
when<00:01:30.030> 18th<00:01:30.420> tee<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> LTE<00:01:31.200> network<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
when 18th tee is LTE network is going to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
when 18th tee is LTE network is going to
be<00:01:32.549> available<00:01:32.820> now<00:01:33.479> call<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> know

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
stuff about this tablet next next month

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.560 
stuff about this tablet next next month
so<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.640> stay<00:01:41.909> tuned<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.329> because

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so you know stay tuned for that because

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
so you know stay tuned for that because
i'm<00:01:42.810> probably<00:01:42.990> made<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.409> videos<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
i'm probably made some videos about it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.940 
i'm probably made some videos about it
then<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.720> seems<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.799> be

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
then it seems like it's going to be

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.149 
then it seems like it's going to be
compatible<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.000> squad<00:01:48.659> pen<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.950> you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
compatible with the squad pen so if you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.460 
compatible with the squad pen so if you
like<00:01:50.520> those<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.259> awesome

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
like those thing is then that is awesome

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
like those thing is then that is awesome
