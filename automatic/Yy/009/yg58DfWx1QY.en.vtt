00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
figure is actually exactly the same as

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.210 
figure is actually exactly the same as
the<00:00:15.299> sculpt<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:15.990> they<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> new

ultimate collection figure also from
bondi<00:00:20.760> america<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.630> virtually<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> same

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
bondi america so it's virtually the same

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.259 
bondi america so it's virtually the same
sculpt<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.460> smaller<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.970> thought<00:00:24.180> that

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
sculpt it's just smaller I thought that

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.269 
sculpt it's just smaller I thought that
was<00:00:24.390> kind<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.600> interesting<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.380> also<00:00:25.890> forgot<00:00:26.160> to

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
was kind of interesting I also forgot to

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
was kind of interesting I also forgot to
mention<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.609> power<00:00:27.180> booster<00:00:27.510> goku<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> eight

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
mention that power booster goku is eight

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.939 
mention that power booster goku is eight
inches<00:00:28.830> tall<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.330> he<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:31.320> fit<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.920> with

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
inches tall so he will not fit in with

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
inches tall so he will not fit in with

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the fact that he does have very very

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.719 
the fact that he does have very very
good<00:01:15.360> paint<00:01:15.750> application<00:01:16.439> there's<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> lot

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
good paint application there's not a lot

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
good paint application there's not a lot
of<00:01:17.909> paint<00:01:18.119> application<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.930> figure

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
of paint application on this figure

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.080

actually<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.860> mean<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.549> plastic<00:01:20.970> is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
actually I mean I think the plastic is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
actually I mean I think the plastic is
actually<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:22.020> orange<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.799> boots<00:01:23.189> are

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
actually actually orange the boots are

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.530 
actually actually orange the boots are
quite<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:23.729> painted<00:01:24.060> even<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> little

quite well painted even the little
yellow<00:01:24.630> tassels<00:01:25.259> are<00:01:25.409> done<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.799> very<00:01:25.860> well

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
of articulation but he certainly has

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
of articulation but he certainly has
some<00:01:41.520> special<00:01:42.110> articulation<00:01:43.110> first<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.189> all

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
some special articulation first of all

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.510

his boots his boots do not move they
stay<00:01:48.030> stationary<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:50.960> moves<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.290> here

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
stay stationary this moves right here

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.020 
stay stationary this moves right here
this<00:01:52.710> cut<00:01:53.009> into<00:01:53.250> his<00:01:53.369> leg<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.700> we'll<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:53.909> to

that in a minute his arms raise or turn
360<00:01:58.790> there's<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> little<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> weird

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
360 there's a little bit of like a weird

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.240 
360 there's a little bit of like a weird
kind<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.079> resistance<00:02:01.560> because<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:01.979> hole

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
kind of resistance because of this hole

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.340 
kind of resistance because of this hole
but<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.549> doesn't<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.630> not<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.810> problem<00:02:04.049> or

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
but it doesn't it it's not a problem or

but it doesn't it it's not a problem or
anything<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.880> his<00:02:06.210> head<00:02:06.509> beside

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
anything like that and his head beside

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.760 
anything like that and his head beside
turned<00:02:07.590> side-to-side<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.459> much<00:02:08.610> his<00:02:09.149> chin

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
turned side-to-side pretty much his chin

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.800 
turned side-to-side pretty much his chin
his<00:02:10.770> chin<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> little<00:02:11.640> too<00:02:11.790> far<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.629> it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
his chin is a little too far down for it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.520 
his chin is a little too far down for it
to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.900 
to
spin<00:02:13.950> all<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> way<00:02:14.190> around<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.700> know<00:02:14.790> his

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
spin all the way around but you know his

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.670 
spin all the way around but you know his
head<00:02:15.030> doesn't<00:02:15.209> spin<00:02:15.480> around<00:02:15.600> in<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.440> show<00:02:16.650> so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
head doesn't spin around in the show so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.320 
head doesn't spin around in the show so
why<00:02:17.250> should<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.490> spin<00:02:17.700> around<00:02:17.790> here

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
why should it spin around here

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.150 
why should it spin around here
the<00:02:18.690> particularly<00:02:19.470> interesting

the particularly interesting

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.210 
the particularly interesting
articulation<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.020> his<00:02:22.200> mane<00:02:22.830> Hooters

they do this there has to be some kind
of<00:03:14.130> good<00:03:14.280> reason<00:03:14.640> there's<00:03:15.239> kind<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.750> good

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
of good reason there's kind of a good

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.479 
of good reason there's kind of a good
reason<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.380> there's<00:03:16.560> kind<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.860> not<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.310> good

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
reason and there's kind of not so good

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.870 
reason and there's kind of not so good
of<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.640> reason<00:03:18.000> let's<00:03:18.630> get<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:20.010> only<00:03:20.190> other

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
of a reason let's get to the only other

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.300 
of a reason let's get to the only other
sort<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.420> articulation<00:03:22.079> this<00:03:22.200> character<00:03:22.590> this

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
sort of articulation this character this

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.949 
sort of articulation this character this
toy<00:03:23.519> has<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.239> think<00:03:24.269> that'll<00:03:24.660> sort<00:03:24.900> of

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
toy has and I think that'll sort of

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.110 
toy has and I think that'll sort of
explain<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.640> pretty<00:03:26.880> much<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
explain it so this is pretty much the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.300 
explain it so this is pretty much the
gimmick<00:03:27.570> for<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> power<00:03:28.110> booster<00:03:28.650> Super

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
gimmick for the power booster Super

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.420 
gimmick for the power booster Super
Saiyan<00:03:29.459> Goku<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.799> don't<00:03:31.980> know<00:03:32.190> if<00:03:32.310> it's

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
Saiyan Goku and I don't know if it's

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.460 
Saiyan Goku and I don't know if it's
necessarily<00:03:32.850> counts<00:03:33.209> as<00:03:33.299> articulation<00:03:34.200> but

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
necessarily counts as articulation but

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.650 
necessarily counts as articulation but
that's<00:03:34.950> what<00:03:35.100> I'm<00:03:35.190> gonna<00:03:35.370> call<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.150> we're

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
that's what I'm gonna call it and we're

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.569 
that's what I'm gonna call it and we're
just<00:03:36.750> gonna<00:03:36.930> go<00:03:37.110> with<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.320> for<00:03:37.680> today<00:03:37.890> says

he said right now I put on the the the
energy<00:03:40.920> shields<00:03:41.900> there<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.019> his<00:03:43.140> arm<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.950> his

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
energy shields there in his arm and his

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.060 
energy shields there in his arm and his
chest<00:03:45.090> right<00:03:45.600> here<00:03:45.630> through<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.140> hole<00:03:46.709> in

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
chest right here through that hole in

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.789 
chest right here through that hole in
his<00:03:47.730> other<00:03:47.880> arm<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.690> see<00:03:48.930> them<00:03:49.109> at<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
his other arm you can see them at the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.390 
his other arm you can see them at the
back<00:03:49.980> here<00:03:50.310> too<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:52.070> now<00:03:53.070> for<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
back here too and now for the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.910 
back here too and now for the
explanation<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.989> very<00:03:55.320> strange

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
explanation on on that very strange

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.000 
explanation on on that very strange
chest<00:03:56.370> piece<00:03:56.579> that<00:03:56.850> we<00:03:56.940> saw<00:03:57.120> earlier<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
chest piece that we saw earlier the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.610 
chest piece that we saw earlier the
reason<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.760> it<00:04:00.060> pushes<00:04:00.359> out<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:01.049> basically

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
reason that it pushes out is basically

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.940 
reason that it pushes out is basically
to<00:04:01.920> get<00:04:02.160> these<00:04:02.670> energy<00:04:03.600> shields<00:04:04.079> out<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.650> guess

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
to get these energy shields out I guess

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.449 
to get these energy shields out I guess
that<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.810> logical<00:04:07.380> explanation<00:04:08.160> that

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
that is the the logical explanation that

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.240 
that is the the logical explanation that
there<00:04:08.640> is<00:04:08.810> for<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.900> being<00:04:10.230> there<00:04:10.440> so<00:04:10.859> okay

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
there is for that being there so okay

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.910 
there is for that being there so okay
I'm<00:04:11.400> going<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.609> attempt<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.120> show<00:04:12.859> how<00:04:13.859> the

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
I'm going to attempt to show how the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.050 
I'm going to attempt to show how the
chest<00:04:14.400> piece<00:04:14.640> pushes<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.340> chest<00:04:17.640> energy

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
chest piece pushes the the chest energy

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.659 
chest piece pushes the the chest energy
shield<00:04:18.419> out<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.049> hope<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.500> this<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.919> at

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
shield out and I hope that this is at

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.620 
shield out and I hope that this is at
all<00:04:21.000> visible<00:04:22.940> okay<00:04:23.940> let's<00:04:24.180> show<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.510> energy

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
all visible okay let's show the energy

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.530 
all visible okay let's show the energy
explosion<00:04:25.380> just<00:04:25.560> one<00:04:26.010> more<00:04:26.190> time<00:04:26.430> for<00:04:26.729> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
explosion just one more time for the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.830 
explosion just one more time for the
oh<00:04:28.640> that<00:04:29.640> was<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.790> good<00:04:30.120> one

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
oh that was a good one

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.940 
oh that was a good one
so<00:04:31.290> my<00:04:32.010> overall<00:04:32.400> assessment<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.210> figure

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
so my overall assessment of the figure

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.230 
so my overall assessment of the figure
you<00:04:34.950> know<00:04:35.070> like<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.490> said<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.760> chest<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.210> arms

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
you know like I said the chest the arms

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.150 
you know like I said the chest the arms
the<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.990> head<00:04:37.200> especially<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.920> head<00:04:38.040> is

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
the the head especially the head is

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.340 
the the head especially the head is
really<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.430> very<00:04:38.850> very<00:04:39.270> very<00:04:39.630> good

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
really a very very very good

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.860 
really a very very very good
Super<00:04:40.890> Saiyan<00:04:41.040> Goku<00:04:41.340> sculpt<00:04:42.090> in<00:04:42.240> my<00:04:42.390> very

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
Super Saiyan Goku sculpt in my very

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.500 
Super Saiyan Goku sculpt in my very
humble<00:04:43.050> opinion<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.860> mean<00:04:44.610> speaking<00:04:45.030> as<00:04:45.180> a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
humble opinion I mean speaking as a

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.240 
humble opinion I mean speaking as a
sculptor<00:04:45.840> frankly<00:04:46.350> it's<00:04:46.590> it's<00:04:46.830> actually<00:04:47.130> very

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
sculptor frankly it's it's actually very

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.230 
sculptor frankly it's it's actually very
very<00:04:47.400> well<00:04:47.790> done

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
very well done

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.570 
very well done
so<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:49.320> me<00:04:49.470> makes<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:49.830> figure<00:04:50.160> worth<00:04:50.340> it

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
so that to me makes this figure worth it

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.210 
so that to me makes this figure worth it
I<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:51.840> that<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.050> gimmick<00:04:52.410> on<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:52.980> very

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
I think that the gimmick on it is very

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.730 
I think that the gimmick on it is very
unfortunate<00:04:53.670> it's<00:04:54.600> very<00:04:54.900> distracting<00:04:55.350> from

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
unfortunate it's very distracting from

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.420 
unfortunate it's very distracting from
what<00:04:55.830> otherwise<00:04:56.520> would<00:04:56.670> be<00:04:56.910> a<00:04:56.970> very<00:04:57.240> nice

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
what otherwise would be a very nice

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.300 
what otherwise would be a very nice
Goku<00:04:59.430> figure<00:04:59.820> I<00:05:00.000> will<00:05:00.510> say<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.890> extra

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
Goku figure I will say the the extra

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.720 
Goku figure I will say the the extra
bulk<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.780> this<00:05:03.990> awful<00:05:04.470> chess<00:05:05.130> piece<00:05:05.430> gives

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
bulk that this awful chess piece gives

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.080 
bulk that this awful chess piece gives
it<00:05:05.910> actually<00:05:06.390> in<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.750> sense<00:05:07.550> helps<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.850> little

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
it actually in a sense helps it a little

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.630 
it actually in a sense helps it a little
bit<00:05:09.270> because<00:05:09.450> Goku<00:05:10.440> in<00:05:10.650> those<00:05:10.830> episodes<00:05:11.400> that

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
bit because Goku in those episodes that

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.990 
bit because Goku in those episodes that
I<00:05:11.700> know<00:05:11.960> this<00:05:12.960> particular<00:05:13.610> Goku<00:05:14.610> was<00:05:14.730> based

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
I know this particular Goku was based

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.550 
I know this particular Goku was based
off<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.420> mean<00:05:15.540> he<00:05:15.660> did<00:05:15.780> have<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.960> huge<00:05:16.200> chest

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
off of I mean he did have a huge chest

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.980 
off of I mean he did have a huge chest
he<00:05:16.860> did<00:05:17.040> look<00:05:17.190> like<00:05:17.250> massively<00:05:18.090> enormous<00:05:18.780> in

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
he did look like massively enormous in

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.050 
he did look like massively enormous in
that<00:05:19.200> area<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.730> kind<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.420> helps<00:05:21.870> but<00:05:22.170> I

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
that area so it kind of helps but I

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.310 
that area so it kind of helps but I
don't<00:05:24.060> know<00:05:24.270> who<00:05:24.480> thought<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:24.870> was<00:05:24.930> a<00:05:25.080> good

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
don't know who thought this was a good

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.410 
don't know who thought this was a good
idea<00:05:25.470> honestly<00:05:25.980> I<00:05:26.340> mean<00:05:26.610> it's<00:05:26.790> it's<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.120> little

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
idea honestly I mean it's it's a little

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.890 
idea honestly I mean it's it's a little
bit<00:05:27.800> it's<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.860> little<00:05:28.890> lewd<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.850> would<00:05:30.120> say<00:05:30.420> it

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
bit it's a little lewd I would say it

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.330 
bit it's a little lewd I would say it
doesn't<00:05:31.169> bother<00:05:31.260> me<00:05:31.500> but<00:05:31.860> it's<00:05:31.980> it's<00:05:32.130> rather

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
doesn't bother me but it's it's rather

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.540 
doesn't bother me but it's it's rather
obscene<00:05:33.060> so<00:05:33.930> yes<00:05:34.169> like<00:05:35.040> I<00:05:35.190> said<00:05:35.370> rather

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
obscene so yes like I said rather

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.360 
obscene so yes like I said rather
unfortunate<00:05:35.940> gimmick<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:37.500> sculpt<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:38.280> the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
unfortunate gimmick the sculpt of the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.650 
unfortunate gimmick the sculpt of the
pants<00:05:38.700> are<00:05:38.820> weird<00:05:39.000> but<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.360> rest<00:05:39.510> of<00:05:39.600> the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
pants are weird but the rest of the

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.270 
pants are weird but the rest of the
sculpt<00:05:39.990> is<00:05:40.080> good

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
sculpt is good

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.280 
sculpt is good
he's<00:05:41.700> a<00:05:41.730> nice<00:05:41.910> display<00:05:42.180> piece<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.780> think<00:05:42.840> I<00:05:43.169> mean

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
he's a nice display piece I think I mean

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.080

parts<00:06:00.570> and<00:06:00.810> you<00:06:01.230> know<00:06:01.320> it's<00:06:01.680> kind<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.890> a<00:06:01.980> nice

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.860

idea<00:06:02.280> of<00:06:02.640> paper<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.180> real<00:06:03.330> thing<00:06:03.570> doesn't

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
idea of paper the real thing doesn't

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.360 
idea of paper the real thing doesn't
quite<00:06:03.990> work<00:06:04.200> that<00:06:04.500> well<00:06:04.740> but<00:06:05.010> you<00:06:05.220> know

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
quite work that well but you know

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.770 
quite work that well but you know
whatever<00:06:05.580> it's<00:06:05.910> kind<00:06:06.000> of<00:06:06.120> a<00:06:06.210> nice<00:06:06.360> idea

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780

whatever it's kind of a nice idea
honestly<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:07.950> think<00:06:08.220> if<00:06:08.550> they<00:06:08.760> had<00:06:09.060> simply<00:06:09.690> done

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
honestly I think if they had simply done

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.150 
honestly I think if they had simply done
done<00:06:11.190> a<00:06:11.220> better<00:06:11.370> job<00:06:11.640> on<00:06:11.669> the<00:06:11.850> pants<00:06:12.140> and<00:06:13.160> kept

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
done a better job on the pants and kept

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.550 
done a better job on the pants and kept
the<00:06:14.310> rest<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.760> sculpt<00:06:15.150> and<00:06:15.360> not<00:06:15.660> had<00:06:15.960> this

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
the rest of the sculpt and not had this

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.740 
the rest of the sculpt and not had this
and<00:06:16.980> not<00:06:17.310> had<00:06:17.580> the<00:06:17.700> energy<00:06:18.030> shields<00:06:18.390> I<00:06:18.510> think

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
and not had the energy shields I think

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.320 
and not had the energy shields I think
this<00:06:18.870> would<00:06:18.990> actually<00:06:19.380> have<00:06:19.470> been<00:06:19.500> a<00:06:19.650> very

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 
talk about the cost he runs for about

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.629 
talk about the cost he runs for about
twenty<00:06:48.569> bucks<00:06:48.799> I've<00:06:49.799> seen<00:06:50.099> him<00:06:50.279> on<00:06:50.399> online

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
twenty bucks I've seen him on online

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.659 
twenty bucks I've seen him on online
vendors<00:06:51.209> for<00:06:51.559> a<00:06:52.559> little<00:06:53.009> bit<00:06:53.129> less<00:06:53.309> than<00:06:53.609> that

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
vendors for a little bit less than that

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.779 
vendors for a little bit less than that
but<00:06:54.119> he<00:06:54.899> generally<00:06:55.319> runs<00:06:55.679> for<00:06:56.039> quite<00:06:56.429> a<00:06:56.459> lot

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
but he generally runs for quite a lot

00:06:56.789 --> 00:07:00.009 
but he generally runs for quite a lot
and<00:06:57.059> I<00:06:57.479> think<00:06:58.259> he's<00:06:58.409> a<00:06:58.439> little<00:06:58.619> overpriced<00:06:59.189> I

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:00.019 
and I think he's a little overpriced I

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:02.329 
and I think he's a little overpriced I
would<00:07:01.019> pay<00:07:01.169> about<00:07:01.289> ten<00:07:01.589> bucks<00:07:01.769> for<00:07:02.069> this<00:07:02.159> I

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:02.339 
would pay about ten bucks for this I

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.419 
would pay about ten bucks for this I
mean<00:07:02.429> he<00:07:02.519> is<00:07:02.669> a<00:07:02.699> large<00:07:03.059> figure<00:07:03.449> he<00:07:03.809> does<00:07:03.959> have

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:04.429 
mean he is a large figure he does have

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:07.579 
mean he is a large figure he does have
some<00:07:05.479> you<00:07:06.479> know<00:07:06.539> he<00:07:06.659> does<00:07:06.809> have<00:07:06.989> the<00:07:07.139> gimmick

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:07.589 
some you know he does have the gimmick

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:08.749 
some you know he does have the gimmick
and<00:07:07.739> everything<00:07:08.069> so<00:07:08.219> that's<00:07:08.279> sort<00:07:08.549> of<00:07:08.609> what

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 
and everything so that's sort of what

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.589
