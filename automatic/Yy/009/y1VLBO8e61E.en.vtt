but<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:03.960> understand<00:01:04.409> what

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but they don't really understand what

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.990 
but they don't really understand what
that<00:01:04.559> means<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.549> understand<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that means they don't understand that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
that means they don't understand that
it's<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.210> percentage<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.960> pure<00:01:07.740> gold<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.700> when

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's a percentage of pure gold so when

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.929 
it's a percentage of pure gold so when
they<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.060> an<00:01:09.450> ounce<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.960> gold<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.830> know

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
they see an ounce of gold is you know

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.460 
they see an ounce of gold is you know
$1,600<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.689> understand<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.320> an

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
$1,600 they don't understand that an

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.490 
$1,600 they don't understand that an
ounce<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.860> 10<00:01:14.100> karat<00:01:14.400> gold<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:14.850> $1,600<00:01:15.840> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
ounce of 10 karat gold is not $1,600 so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.219 
ounce of 10 karat gold is not $1,600 so
people<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:16.950> often<00:01:17.100> upset<00:01:17.580> by<00:01:17.790> how<00:01:18.659> much<00:01:18.840> or

that's<00:06:31.960> where<00:06:32.169> I'll<00:06:32.260> make<00:06:32.470> most

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
that's where I'll make most

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.220 
that's where I'll make most
back<00:06:33.380> so<00:06:34.370> I<00:06:34.730> mean<00:06:35.060> I<00:06:35.150> gave<00:06:35.210> her<00:06:35.630> what<00:06:36.020> I<00:06:36.050> give

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
back so I mean I gave her what I give

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.290 
back so I mean I gave her what I give
about<00:06:36.320> a<00:06:36.680> little<00:06:37.040> over<00:06:37.910> 50%<00:06:38.450> of<00:06:39.260> the<00:06:39.800> value

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
about a little over 50% of the value

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.610 
about a little over 50% of the value
because<00:06:41.300> granted<00:06:41.720> I<00:06:41.840> lose<00:06:42.080> money<00:06:42.290> when<00:06:42.560> I

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
because granted I lose money when I

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.670 
because granted I lose money when I
refund<00:06:43.070> when<00:06:43.160> I<00:06:43.220> give<00:06:43.610> it<00:06:43.700> to<00:06:43.760> the<00:06:43.850> refiner<00:06:44.210> and

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
refund when I give it to the refiner and

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.520 
refund when I give it to the refiner and
one<00:06:45.680> of<00:06:45.740> the<00:06:45.800> biggest<00:06:46.390> pitfalls<00:06:47.390> that<00:06:48.140> you<00:06:48.350> can

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
one of the biggest pitfalls that you can

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.620 
one of the biggest pitfalls that you can
fall<00:06:48.770> into<00:06:48.980> when<00:06:49.490> buying<00:06:49.760> gold<00:06:50.030> and<00:06:50.240> silver

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
fall into when buying gold and silver

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.140 
fall into when buying gold and silver
will<00:06:51.440> not<00:06:51.560> silver<00:06:52.010> but<00:06:52.040> buying<00:06:52.520> gold<00:06:52.790> is<00:06:53.030> the

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
will not silver but buying gold is the

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.770 
will not silver but buying gold is the
purity<00:06:53.510> if<00:06:53.930> something's<00:06:54.890> marked<00:06:55.190> 14k<00:06:55.880> and<00:06:56.120> it

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
purity if something's marked 14k and it

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.670 
purity if something's marked 14k and it
tests<00:06:57.290> fine<00:06:58.100> for<00:06:58.430> 14k<00:06:58.850> with<00:06:59.690> the<00:06:59.810> acids<00:07:00.260> it

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
tests fine for 14k with the acids it

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.190 
tests fine for 14k with the acids it
still<00:07:01.490> may<00:07:01.610> not<00:07:01.760> be<00:07:01.910> 14k<00:07:02.510> because<00:07:02.780> until<00:07:03.080> you

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
still may not be 14k because until you

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.760 
still may not be 14k because until you
get<00:07:03.350> really<00:07:03.650> good<00:07:04.010> at<00:07:04.220> determining<00:07:05.770> the

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
get really good at determining the

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.630 
get really good at determining the
purity<00:07:07.730> and<00:07:07.970> reading<00:07:08.600> the<00:07:08.930> acid<00:07:09.380> tests<00:07:09.770> when

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:10.640 
purity and reading the acid tests when

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.450 
purity and reading the acid tests when
you<00:07:10.730> go<00:07:10.910> to<00:07:10.970> to<00:07:11.890> refine<00:07:12.890> it<00:07:13.100> they're<00:07:13.370> gonna

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
you go to to refine it they're gonna

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.870 
you go to to refine it they're gonna
know<00:07:13.790> so<00:07:14.450> if<00:07:14.600> it's<00:07:14.780> not<00:07:14.960> a<00:07:15.230> perfect<00:07:15.590> clear<00:07:16.250> 14

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
know so if it's not a perfect clear 14

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.840 
know so if it's not a perfect clear 14
and<00:07:17.120> some<00:07:17.540> of<00:07:17.600> it<00:07:17.720> starts<00:07:17.990> to<00:07:18.340> dissolve<00:07:19.340> a

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
and some of it starts to dissolve a

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:22.210 
and some of it starts to dissolve a
little<00:07:19.880> bit<00:07:20.300> they're<00:07:20.930> gonna<00:07:21.080> spy<00:07:21.440> it<00:07:21.500> as<00:07:21.710> 12<00:07:22.010> or

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.220 
little bit they're gonna spy it as 12 or

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.010 
little bit they're gonna spy it as 12 or
10<00:07:22.370> K<00:07:22.640> and<00:07:22.820> you're<00:07:23.150> gonna<00:07:23.270> lose<00:07:23.540> a<00:07:23.570> lot<00:07:23.810> of<00:07:23.930> your

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
10 K and you're gonna lose a lot of your

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.540 
10 K and you're gonna lose a lot of your
profit<00:07:24.410> so<00:07:24.950> you<00:07:25.040> really<00:07:25.220> need<00:07:25.310> to<00:07:25.370> protect

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
profit so you really need to protect

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.300 
profit so you really need to protect
yourself<00:07:25.790> against<00:07:26.390> that<00:07:26.450> you<00:07:27.440> know<00:07:28.040> that's

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310 
yourself against that you know that's

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.310 
yourself against that you know that's
why<00:07:28.490> only<00:07:29.000> dealers<00:07:29.510> can<00:07:29.780> get<00:07:29.930> you<00:07:30.050> know<00:07:30.080> in<00:07:30.260> the

may give you a better rate but for the
most<00:07:49.520> part<00:07:50.170> 50%<00:07:51.170> is<00:07:51.380> on<00:07:51.590> the<00:07:51.830> higher<00:07:52.220> end

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.350

so<00:07:54.350> that<00:07:54.980> was<00:07:55.160> my<00:07:55.310> golden<00:07:55.760> silver<00:07:56.180> bye

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:56.570 
so that was my golden silver bye

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.780 
so that was my golden silver bye
for<00:07:56.870> today<00:07:57.290> I'll<00:07:57.620> let<00:07:58.340> you<00:07:58.460> know<00:07:58.490> I'll
