two wires yeah give me screwdriver again
these<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:32.099> wires<00:00:32.870> I've<00:00:33.870> done<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.350> black<00:00:34.680> one

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
these two wires I've done one black one

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.459 
these two wires I've done one black one
orange<00:00:35.550> again<00:00:36.020> should<00:00:37.020> rather<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.410> in

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
orange again should rather be in

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.040 
orange again should rather be in
color-coordinated<00:00:38.309> buttoned<00:00:38.730> anyway<00:00:39.719> you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
color-coordinated buttoned anyway you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
color-coordinated buttoned anyway you
can<00:00:40.230> see<00:00:40.440> whereabouts<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> EEPROM<00:00:42.059> board

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
can see whereabouts on the EEPROM board

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.410 
can see whereabouts on the EEPROM board
they<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:44.219> you've<00:00:44.340> got<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:44.640> two<00:00:44.700> BIOS

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
they are so you've got these two BIOS

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
they are so you've got these two BIOS
yeah<00:00:46.309> these<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.579> wires<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.870> ENL

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
yeah these two wires go to the ENL

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.979 
yeah these two wires go to the ENL
switch<00:00:50.390> okay<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> ALS<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> ENL<00:00:54.690> switch

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
switch okay so as you ALS the ENL switch

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:06.700 
switch okay so as you ALS the ENL switch
sorry<00:00:56.120> okay<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:03.860> there<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.979> go

let's to the coil as I assure you on the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.920 
let's to the coil as I assure you on the
first<00:02:19.110> video<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.670> you've<00:02:20.790> got<00:02:20.970> one

first video and then you've got one
cable<00:02:22.590> I've<00:02:23.460> done<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.880> white<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.300> this

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
cable I've done it in white in this

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.440 
cable I've done it in white in this
instance<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:26.070> got<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.550> white<00:02:26.820> cable<00:02:27.120> goes

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
instance you got one white cable goes

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.000 
instance you got one white cable goes
from<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> trim<00:02:28.140> pot<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.900> ENL<00:02:31.380> switch<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
from the trim pot to the ENL switch so

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.290 
from the trim pot to the ENL switch so
black<00:02:35.010> knowledge<00:02:35.340> one<00:02:35.550> was<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.820> first<00:02:36.030> to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
black knowledge one was the first to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.550 
black knowledge one was the first to
what<00:02:36.450> we're<00:02:36.540> doing<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:38.580> one<00:02:39.260> goes<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
what we're doing this one goes on the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.270 
what we're doing this one goes on the
bottom<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.640> other<00:02:41.820> side<00:02:44.480> okay<00:02:46.130> bottom<00:02:47.130> of

bottom of the other side okay bottom of

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.540 
bottom of the other side okay bottom of
the<00:02:47.400> other<00:02:47.520> side<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:49.890> one's<00:02:50.220> from<00:02:50.430> the
