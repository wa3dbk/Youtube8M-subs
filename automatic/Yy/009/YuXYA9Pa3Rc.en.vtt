one rabbit tremendous what's the hardest
thing<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.850> just<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.420> standing<00:02:26.810> still<00:02:26.870> yes

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
thing is just not standing still yes

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.729 
thing is just not standing still yes
most<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.550> times<00:02:28.989> are<00:02:29.989> dribbling<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.560> go

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
most of the times are dribbling I go

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.390 
most of the times are dribbling I go
forward

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
forward

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.880 
forward
dear<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.700> have<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.970> stay<00:02:33.150> here<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.709> which<00:02:34.709> is

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
dear you have to stay here on which is

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.710 
dear you have to stay here on which is
more<00:02:35.189> difficult<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.939> lot<00:02:36.120> more<00:02:36.150> difficult

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
more difficult it's a lot more difficult

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.899 
more difficult it's a lot more difficult
and<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.829> think<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.370> more<00:02:38.400> easy<00:02:38.549> for<00:02:38.700> them

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
and I think it's more easy for them

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.759 
and I think it's more easy for them
usually<00:02:39.569> you'd<00:02:39.689> need<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.989> lot<00:02:40.019> quicker<00:02:40.349> yeah

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
usually you'd need a lot quicker yeah

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.069 
usually you'd need a lot quicker yeah
that<00:02:41.010> works<00:02:41.159> our<00:02:41.340> way<00:02:41.390> now<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.659> for<00:02:42.900> I

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
that works our way now it's just for I

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.809 
that works our way now it's just for I
give<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.409> opportunity<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.010> them<00:02:44.159> to<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.670> give

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
give you opportunity to them to to give

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.830 
give you opportunity to them to to give
a<00:02:46.400> you'd<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.579> pee<00:02:47.849> planet<00:02:48.360> fair<00:02:48.569> yeah

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
a you'd be a pee planet fair yeah

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.940 
a you'd be a pee planet fair yeah
perfect

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.010 

so<00:02:57.580> how<00:02:57.790> did<00:02:57.849> he<00:02:58.060> manage<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.390> get<00:02:58.690> through<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
so how did he manage to get through the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.190 
so how did he manage to get through the
course<00:02:59.430> virtually<00:03:00.430> unscathed<00:03:00.930> when<00:03:01.930> Chris

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
course virtually unscathed when Chris

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.630 
course virtually unscathed when Chris
Jana<00:03:02.410> was<00:03:02.560> doing<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.830> test<00:03:03.010> with<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.190> snipers

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
Jana was doing the test with the snipers

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.839 
Jana was doing the test with the snipers

see a lot and very good very impressive
close<00:03:06.849> work<00:03:07.120> with<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.599> ball<00:03:07.810> lot<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.170> skills

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
close work with the ball lot of skills

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:29.960 
close work with the ball lot of skills
on<00:03:08.650> shore

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.690 

he<00:03:30.970> manages<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.780> combine<00:03:31.989> akroy<00:03:32.800> turn<00:03:33.129> with

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
he manages to combine akroy turn with

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.420 
he manages to combine akroy turn with
Rawling<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.540> outside<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.110> his<00:03:35.230> foot<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:36.310> the

Rawling the outside of his foot over the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.610 
Rawling the outside of his foot over the
top<00:03:36.580> of<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.760> ball<00:03:37.200> swiveling<00:03:38.200> background

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
top of the ball swiveling background

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.890 
top of the ball swiveling background
then<00:03:39.010> drops<00:03:39.340> his<00:03:39.519> center<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.819> gravity<00:03:39.910> knocks

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
then drops his center of gravity knocks

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.449 
then drops his center of gravity knocks
the<00:03:41.080> ball<00:03:41.200> from<00:03:41.410> his<00:03:41.470> feet<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.890> accelerates

away<00:03:42.580> leaving<00:03:43.120> his<00:03:43.300> opponent<00:03:43.720> for<00:03:43.840> dead<00:03:44.670> if<00:03:45.670> we

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
away leaving his opponent for dead if we

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.220 
away leaving his opponent for dead if we
watch<00:03:46.030> something<00:03:46.300> such<00:03:46.630> as<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.840> step-over

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
watch something such as the step-over

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.900 
watch something such as the step-over
will<00:03:47.890> see<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.250> timing<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.790> the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
will see that the timing of the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.970 
will see that the timing of the
step-over<00:03:49.239> occurs<00:03:49.690> at<00:03:50.110> just<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> right<00:03:50.739> time

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
step-over occurs at just the right time

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.620 
step-over occurs at just the right time
to<00:03:51.190> make<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.459> opponent<00:03:51.880> think<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.540> he's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
to make the opponent think that he's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.270 
to make the opponent think that he's
going<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.810> move<00:03:52.989> one<00:03:53.170> way<00:03:53.349> before<00:03:53.980> offering

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
going to move one way before offering

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.190 
going to move one way before offering
them<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.459> signal<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:55.030> move<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.630> other<00:03:55.720> but

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
them the signal to move the other but

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.229 
them the signal to move the other but
the<00:03:56.290> key<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.739> that's<00:03:57.160> fast<00:03:57.519> foot<00:03:57.790> movement

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
the key is that's fast foot movement

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.360 
the key is that's fast foot movement
lots<00:03:58.840> of<00:03:58.989> little<00:03:59.140> touches<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.769> keeping<00:04:00.310> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
lots of little touches and keeping the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.030 
lots of little touches and keeping the
ball<00:04:00.400> moving

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.280 

it<00:04:03.549> was<00:04:03.670> really<00:04:04.060> amazing<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.629> see<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.170> he

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
it was really amazing to see that he

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.809 
it was really amazing to see that he
managed<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> perform<00:04:05.980> so<00:04:06.370> well<00:04:06.400> in<00:04:06.760> a

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819

situation<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:07.599> he<00:04:07.959> wouldn't<00:04:08.200> necessarily

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
situation that he wouldn't necessarily

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.860 
situation that he wouldn't necessarily
have<00:04:08.799> been<00:04:09.069> in<00:04:09.250> ever<00:04:09.519> before<00:04:09.969> but<00:04:10.599> he<00:04:10.689> could

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
have been in ever before but he could

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.660 
have been in ever before but he could
still<00:04:10.900> keep<00:04:11.260> control<00:04:11.709> keep<00:04:11.950> his<00:04:12.069> beliefs<00:04:12.400> nice

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
still keep control keep his beliefs nice
