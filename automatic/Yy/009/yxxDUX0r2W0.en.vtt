00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.929
 on the occasion of the springboard for the festival léz'arts scenic group 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.299
 indicates that China on the political scene is paying the price after the 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.349
 group has recently participated in another springboard on a 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.349
 big national chain here is their story 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.569
 started on the ice the postulation 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.209
 on the website but I see there we can participate in this springboard we had 

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.939
 the chance to be selected then after he had to 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.730
 solicit our fans on facebook and all that to vote 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 by the way we thank him only bad we could do the zenith of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.930
 we find there it was a very great experience 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.530
 five minutes short but for 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.940
 really to very emotional is a success over two days and 7 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.760
 hours 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.710
 for more 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.940
 the strong recoil full of things 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.220
 not there we hope to do the following allied to Paris for June 19 to suroît their 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.080
 festival 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.010
 the mistake after that was an hour 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.990
 a very interesting experience because it was something 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.730
 very big it was zenith de lille it was with them so big 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.259
 cameras 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.130
 to of 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.040
 petrus who was wandering over again on stage to the point of filming 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
 for interviews we even saw their employees 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.340
 the industry piece is a springboard for festival-goers it is quite unique 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.430
 still a stepping stone for the last time we also congratulated ourselves for 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.000
 to learn art is it a must when you have a group 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.340
 regional to advance 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.990
 I do not think I have to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.869
 but for his qualities of interesting things for a big because 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.850
 in those 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.300
 the melee reminded one of music styles too because it's rare a 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.600
 springboard to titrate a style of music and blow down 6% -6 the power the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.380
 compare against a jury ofc judged 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.420
 by a jury and the fight is 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.410
 it's always interesting even if they themselves hear group in 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.239
 do not win 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.919
 it's always interesting because you will have a turan asylum that will feel 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.379
 always bigger because in general when tumultuous sharp has 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.119
 won a springboard you know why 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.119
 and suddenly it's inevitably interesting 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.749
 at the approach of the review of the album let's talk about it 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.480
 yes he is so he will go out on time 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.139
 they will be there for the money while 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.429
 with the time difference of the television it will necessarily 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.629
 last night 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.419
 the Islamic regime 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.459
 now no longer in addition you have super season what will be done Monday at 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.110
 two weeks 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.110
 the green team is out of the album was released on May 10 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.759
 bayrou before the 50 best Irish companies already on record 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.929
 Platinum 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.929
 the best proof 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.059
 google health 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.119
 the pc industry 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:32.209
 this album a snake also given here on the internet becomes a big 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.229
 back of vinyl did you make that choice up close to those thousands 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.989
 euros a year the void 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.480
 I am a big fan of summer 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.929
 but we all agree that it should be done 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.989
 for maintenance and 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.579
 a budget also thicker album that is totally self-produced by% 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.339
 while the ball we put on the pink african cinema 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.109
 and for 100 th for the moment 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.659
 she prefers to focus on the release of this album have yielded 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.279
 and all the freedoms the tour that goes with 6 p 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.739
 gold necessarily it makes visible is that nature a vinyl but how 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.549
 it will be here to the surprise 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:44.979
 in québec it's all we love 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.610
 so all we do not like we are not in the district 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.930
 so it can be long we can say we do not like the wheel are even roof 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.819
 the music euros not even the music 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.379
 strictly speaking commercial 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.679
 the same not the music is there to sell but at the same time the music is there 

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:05.560
 to share a mood a message something and so it's 5 amar 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.020
 district will never sign that side 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.319
 we are looking to sell looking to do that by knowing how to look like that 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.319
 try to do what we like and share it with people 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.180
 unfortunately for her behind do not buy another album 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.870
 but also parents 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.939
 for the album according to the snes 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.939
 allow him to steal the shot missed the check mark 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:44.479
 the current account deficit very quickly in this world 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.700
 a bit commercial 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.520
 while keeping our if we do I think we are we all went to 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.889
 mans 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:49.990
 how does he live from blinds 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.800
 how beautiful it is still romandie time plan 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.690
 except that for the next baffo star who the days of this move that there is a 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.770
 year 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.620
 an important marketing system around 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.229
 at first I do not say what I think 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.289
 but here's our world of posts shouting to do what we love hepatitis 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.949
 someone who comes and who tell us here is homogeneous in everything you 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.330
 do but except that we are going to replace pastore torstar investors 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.349
 so far this fight 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:12.330
 no because we do not like 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.559
 laughter and that's it I think we must for idiots and we do not change 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:16.949
 let a little dirty whore 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.949
 main target 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.639
 for more info go on corn country is a little clearer
