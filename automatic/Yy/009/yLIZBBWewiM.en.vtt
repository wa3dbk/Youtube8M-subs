00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.960
 spend this energy lightning too 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.090
 unpredictable what is in your example 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.660
 convinced locomotive driver Sergey 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.469
 eagles 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.169
 in 1985 he was a freight train from 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.769
 Petrozavodsk and suddenly noticed for 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.769
 trees luminous ball for a while 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.949
 the balloon flew parallel to the train and then 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.120
 rushed to the cut structure and hung at 30 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.640
 meters from the driver's cab 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.500
 and father Sergius was instant despite 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.960
 to amazement and fear he tried 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.050
 prevent a collision with the composition 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.550
 luminous ball but his machine is not 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.309
 obeyed 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.140
 I began to press my crane locomotive 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:52.030
 crane clamping the speed grows starting 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:56.230
 inhibit the general did one release like 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:01.440
 set for this composition speed 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.440
 growing well and pulled someone else's power 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.080
 the composition of the seven guests wagons glowing 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.020
 the ball dragged along for almost an hour and a half and 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.170
 overcame during this time about 50 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.730
 kilometers making sure impossible 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.510
 stop the train Sergey contacted 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.510
 emergency services 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.200
 I asked the dispatcher gum as requested 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.240
 stay without any trains go 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.700
 automatic machine on a paid site to either 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.209
 put on a cross to give me 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.679
 pass me clear scales 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:35.390
 emergency at any time could 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.170
 end with a collision with another 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.869
 the composition and death of machinists however 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.020
 the station sands the ball suddenly separated from 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.689
 Locomotive disappeared for weight Sergei translated 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.689
 the spirit but the surprise did not end there 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.480
 at the station we did the fuel metering 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:02.150
 we had a saving of 300 liters of effort 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:04.590
 burned out or either closer 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.390
 small savings i had 300 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.390
 kilograms and to the new 300 kilograms 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.000
 explain this this number is profitable 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.220
 slope can not be because the train moved into 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.930
 the city so after careful 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.130
 case investigations experts were 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.710
 forced to admit 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.560
 the lineup really pulled forward 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.510
 some force in this case 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.510
 fireball ball lightning
