00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.530 
and especially you could tell since I'm
rushing<00:03:25.900> them<00:03:26.049> I<00:03:26.079> get<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> ton<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.190> kills<00:03:27.540> yeah

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
rushing them I get a ton of kills yeah

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.210 
rushing them I get a ton of kills yeah
it<00:03:28.810> looks<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.500> already<00:03:29.590> got<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.829> Harrier

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it looks like you already got a Harrier

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.030 
it looks like you already got a Harrier
in<00:03:30.340> search<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:30.970> I<00:03:31.180> call<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.950> catching<00:03:32.950> them

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
in search so I call it a catching them

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.650 
in search so I call it a catching them
off<00:03:33.190> guard<00:03:33.220> i<00:03:33.610> guess<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:34.120> i<00:03:34.150> would<00:03:34.570> actually

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
off guard i guess that i would actually

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.990 
off guard i guess that i would actually
title<00:03:35.140> this<00:03:35.320> video<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.860> that<00:03:36.070> because<00:03:36.310> all's<00:03:36.790> I

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
title this video is that because all's I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.370 
title this video is that because all's I
constantly<00:03:37.390> do<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.630> catch<00:03:37.780> these<00:03:37.989> people<00:03:38.110> off

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
constantly do is catch these people off

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.720 
constantly do is catch these people off
guard<00:03:38.410> because<00:03:38.829> they<00:03:39.010> don't<00:03:39.190> expect<00:03:39.519> a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
guard because they don't expect a

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.479 
guard because they don't expect a
defender<00:03:40.510> just<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.780> be<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:40.959> your<00:03:40.989> spawn<00:03:41.489> right

would<00:04:04.720> just<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.170> know<00:04:05.230> what<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.769> do<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:06.070> these

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
would just I know what to do in these

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.310 
would just I know what to do in these
types<00:04:06.220> of<00:04:06.579> games<00:04:06.640> like<00:04:07.030> counter-strike<00:04:07.959> there

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
types of games like counter-strike there

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.130 
types of games like counter-strike there
was<00:04:08.410> campers<00:04:08.799> ahoy<00:04:09.100> because<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.820> was<00:04:10.140> exactly

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
was campers ahoy because it was exactly

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.660 
was campers ahoy because it was exactly
like<00:04:11.320> Search<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:11.769> Destroy<00:04:11.799> really<00:04:12.370> but<00:04:12.579> it

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
like Search and Destroy really but it

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.130 
like Search and Destroy really but it
was<00:04:12.850> a<00:04:12.880> lot<00:04:13.000> more<00:04:13.060> slow<00:04:13.390> pace<00:04:13.630> but<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.930> know

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
was a lot more slow pace but I know

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.279 
was a lot more slow pace but I know
check<00:04:14.620> every<00:04:14.920> corner<00:04:15.750> make<00:04:16.750> sure<00:04:16.780> they're<00:04:17.140> not

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
check every corner make sure they're not

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.380 
check every corner make sure they're not
near<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.769> bomb<00:04:17.919> or<00:04:18.250> whatever<00:04:18.400> yeah<00:04:19.060> it's<00:04:19.209> just

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
near the bomb or whatever yeah it's just

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.130 
near the bomb or whatever yeah it's just
I<00:04:19.570> guess<00:04:20.500> it's<00:04:20.680> my<00:04:20.799> history<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.280> gaming<00:04:22.080> see<00:04:23.080> I

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
I guess it's my history of gaming see I

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.630 
I guess it's my history of gaming see I
guess<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.500> was<00:04:23.590> missing<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.070> never<00:04:24.400> played

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
guess I was missing I never played

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.689 
guess I was missing I never played
counterstrike

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
counterstrike

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.370 
counterstrike
when<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:26.759> went<00:04:26.940> from<00:04:27.030> gears<00:04:27.539> of<00:04:27.660> war<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.139> I

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
when I went from gears of war to this I

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.029 
when I went from gears of war to this I
didn't<00:04:28.620> really<00:04:28.800> have<00:04:28.919> any<00:04:29.449> transition<00:04:30.449> and

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
didn't really have any transition and

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.890 
didn't really have any transition and
this<00:04:32.039> game<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:32.430> completely<00:04:32.580> different<00:04:33.120> aside

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
this game is completely different aside

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.320 
this game is completely different aside
from<00:04:34.020> Gears<00:04:34.289> of<00:04:34.380> War<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.650> mean<00:04:34.919> two<00:04:35.430> completely

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
are you more of a fan of call of duty

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.710 
are you more of a fan of call of duty
now<00:04:45.960> it's<00:04:46.530> really<00:04:47.430> up<00:04:47.699> in<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.910> air<00:04:48.000> to<00:04:48.360> me<00:04:48.509> I

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
now it's really up in the air to me I

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.620 
now it's really up in the air to me I
love<00:04:49.380> them<00:04:49.560> both<00:04:49.770> equally<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.520> think<00:04:50.940> it's<00:04:51.389> like

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
love them both equally I think it's like

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.270 
love them both equally I think it's like
Gears<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:51.960> War<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.289> best<00:04:52.650> third<00:04:52.919> person

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
Gears of War is the best third person

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.610 
Gears of War is the best third person
shooter<00:04:53.490> I've<00:04:53.759> ever<00:04:54.120> played<00:04:54.389> and<00:04:54.810> this<00:04:55.500> is

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
shooter I've ever played and this is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.140 
shooter I've ever played and this is
probably<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.979> best<00:04:56.280> first-person<00:04:56.639> shooter

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
probably the best first-person shooter

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.249 
probably the best first-person shooter
I've<00:04:57.240> ever<00:04:57.419> played<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:57.750> really<00:04:57.990> hard<00:04:58.169> to

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
I've ever played it's really hard to

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.600 
I've ever played it's really hard to
choose<00:04:58.470> between<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.830> two<00:04:58.979> but<00:04:59.130> if<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.340> had<00:04:59.580> to

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
choose between the two but if I had to

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.600 
choose between the two but if I had to
choose<00:04:59.789> between<00:05:00.000> one<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:01.620> think<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.430> would

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
choose between one I think I would

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.920 
choose between one I think I would
