00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.970 
screw that's in place so ones that I
have<00:02:12.160> these<00:02:12.310> brackets<00:02:12.700> up<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.990> both<00:02:14.230> sides<00:02:14.590> and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
have these brackets up on both sides and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.420 
have these brackets up on both sides and
I<00:02:15.130> have<00:02:15.340> them<00:02:15.490> located<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> all<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.890> do<00:02:18.040> is<00:02:18.310> I

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
I have them located and all I do is I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.970 
I have them located and all I do is I
take<00:02:18.610> my<00:02:18.670> blinds<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.990> it's<00:02:26.440> probably<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.860> good

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
take my blinds and it's probably a good

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.350 
take my blinds and it's probably a good
idea<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:29.530> these<00:02:29.770> drawn<00:02:30.070> up<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.210> they're

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
idea to have these drawn up so they're

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.100 
idea to have these drawn up so they're
not<00:02:31.570> open<00:02:31.960> all<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.230> way<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:32.920> open<00:02:33.250> somewhat

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
not open all the way but open somewhat

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.780 
not open all the way but open somewhat
and<00:02:35.110> then<00:02:35.230> all<00:02:35.320> I'm<00:02:35.470> going<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.710> do<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.220> lift<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and then all I'm going to do is lift the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.970 
and then all I'm going to do is lift the
top<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:39.390> slide<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.570> into<00:02:40.720> place<00:02:40.960> so<00:02:41.950> that

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
top and slide it into place so that

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
top and slide it into place so that
drops<00:02:42.460> down<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:44.880> push<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.030> all<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> way<00:02:46.360> back

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.620 

and<00:02:49.770> then<00:02:50.770> snap<00:02:51.220> these<00:02:51.490> two<00:02:52.860> levers<00:02:53.860> closed

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and then snap these two levers closed

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.380 
and then snap these two levers closed
and<00:02:55.630> then<00:02:56.230> once<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.680> do<00:02:56.740> that<00:02:56.920> there<00:02:57.730> are<00:02:57.760> some

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
and then once I do that there are some

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.260 
and then once I do that there are some
plastic<00:02:59.050> clips<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.190> will<00:03:00.400> hold<00:03:00.610> this<00:03:00.940> fascia

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
plastic clips that will hold this fascia

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.900 
plastic clips that will hold this fascia
board<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:02.190> place<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.040> finishes<00:03:06.220> off<00:03:06.700> your

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
board in place so it finishes off your

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.800 
board in place so it finishes off your
blind<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.350> gives<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.130> nice<00:03:09.340> clean<00:03:09.820> look<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
that's all there is to it so I'm Tim
