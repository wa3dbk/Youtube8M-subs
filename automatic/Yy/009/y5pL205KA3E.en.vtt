00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
yeah I kind of scary I feel like a ghost

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.620 
yeah I kind of scary I feel like a ghost
but<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.900> can't<00:04:35.169> wait<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.470> see<00:04:35.680> how<00:04:35.949> they<00:04:36.630> glow

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
but I can't wait to see how they glow

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.390 
but I can't wait to see how they glow
tonight<00:04:38.110> actually<00:04:38.380> I<00:04:38.860> made<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.280> mistake

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
tonight actually I made a mistake

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.360 
tonight actually I made a mistake
earlier<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:41.320> box<00:04:41.530> says<00:04:41.710> I<00:04:41.889> glow

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
earlier the box says I glow

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.610 
earlier the box says I glow
they<00:04:42.699> don't<00:04:42.910> glow<00:04:43.120> in<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.330> dark<00:04:43.570> but<00:04:44.229> they

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
they don't glow in the dark but they

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.020 
they don't glow in the dark but they
react<00:04:45.160> under<00:04:46.229> UV<00:04:47.229> like<00:04:47.410> black<00:04:47.889> lights<00:04:48.100> so<00:04:48.550> I

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
react under UV like black lights so I

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.710 
react under UV like black lights so I
guess<00:04:49.270> when<00:04:49.449> I<00:04:49.479> go<00:04:49.660> clubbing<00:04:50.050> I<00:04:51.360> should<00:04:52.360> wear
