00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.599
 and so hello everyone with you maxim and I 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.720
 I start a new segment on my channel 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:25.150
 this is a segment 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:28.169
 Minecraft equipment and I'll start my own 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.419
 let's say a new show channel itself with a given 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.750
 the cornman of this plane is he like 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.809
 see me resource is expensive and built 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.000
 in just 5 minutes it can be 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.410
 shed faster how it goes. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.260
 let's not waste time on 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.379
 chatter and build side by side the same 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:52.749
 as I already did a platform 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:55.019
 this platform is five by three blocks this 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:58.629
 will be the main part 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:02.019
 so these three clouds will be 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.140
 our wings are here and here 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.600
 let's start the wings will 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.190
 involvement in 5 blocks here one two three 4 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.740
 5 Sergey in length as blogs 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.980
 there is the same thing and 5 blocks y so in this 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.980
 same side 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.970
 45 as much 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.260
 here as much and actually here 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.870
 similarly for this i 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.900
 i use green u wool but you can 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.940
 use both yellow and the other 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.640
 wool color because i saw 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.340
 several types of kurnik in different colors 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.520
 I have a bunch of different types for example 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.040
 to the war maker he is here and from 1 sensors 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 and there are those who just dust a youth 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.560
 culture hall corn so does jim 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.690
 on the wool then then put here on the side 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.360
 on the block here and behind us we attach 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.270
 platform is a three-by-three block plot 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.720
 three by three cube 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.060
 then here to this platform here we we 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.459
 we attach that is straight 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.739
 symmetrically you will not symmetrically 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:24.480
 fashion attachment build tail again then 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:28.140
 there is 1 2 3 4 5 1 3 4 5 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 it turns tail also this here 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.810
 beam us beams post don't know who 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.260
 this is generally called we need 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.910
 selling how it looks exactly I donâ€™t 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.280
 can show i would do with 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.890
 pleasure like this basically new 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.300
 it even looks much better 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.810
 skype will be like this 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:00.240
 will immediately do by pillar that is 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:02.459
 we do it so much wrong 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.120
 so little literally 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:10.090
 although it was all right and so so so 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.390
 so he must take another one on one 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:19.890
 block up let's take a stone card now 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 and 22 and then on 2 blocks 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.360
 fine then we need to do 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.769
 make the second tier 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.130
 on the wings that is how many here on 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.890
 Cornman two tiers of wings and myosin 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:38.670
 let 's put it somewhere in two 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:43.200
 life well iron bars iron lattice 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.220
 here and here in a similar way to 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.700
 then and raise 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.730
 one block to god and attach another one 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.400
 it's the same as she is very long 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.540
 provide and pretty 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.340
 Well , hundreds so easily not convenient here 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.280
 so advised iron bars that is 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.140
 are we holding some kind of holders our lives 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:12.570
 wool will be in john and wool so mean 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:15.490
 we start to make the wings 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.290
 embroidery all continue 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.830
 yet exactly but really like 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.010
 known spouse really 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.710
 wings upper wing 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.560
 sticks out a little bit i'm specially convinced 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.790
 This looked some photos 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 Corncob of apple seemed yes I was 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.970
 right that is, I do not exactly rest on 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.770
 two regiments 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:44.190
 12 great we even looking for a place 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.190
 left and here the same thing a day 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:54.630
 fine that is already straight leg what is 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:57.880
 it already turns out pretty cool 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.080
 some invention also let's by 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.510
 center of the sensor 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.340
 she will be our guns again 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.290
 it will be an archer that I do not want to 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.950
 she is an arrow 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.100
 you can now proceed to the wheels plus 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:16.080
 highway better call it 67 in fact 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.080
 so means here we put the block 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:25.360
 black let 's put on the block below here 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:29.940
 so then we take the pale prussia and here 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.980
 in this way we raise the daily and 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.470
 raise we get here such here 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.550
 good highway 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:42.970
 discreet but beautiful from behind 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.900
 In general, let's make such under the bottom 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.900
 here are the identifying 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.919
 1234 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.490
 46 blocks of something informative 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.970
 objects are usually also like wing 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.690
 I go at Kumtor calls visor will not 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.880
 20 details skip the block and here in 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.430
 one good tail put black wool 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.199
 it will have the same chassis as the possible 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.370
 either do you put it 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:16.300
 stone enclosure 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:21.250
 and black wool died on the ears like this and 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.400
 and so take the people themselves around the chassis 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.880
 cg countries the same from this side 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.430
 same here so it turns out here 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.470
 but we are not ready cockpit 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.669
 cockpit is done by the following 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:42.599
 principle we enter here one block 2 3 4 5 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:45.970
 6 7 blocks will go on colors 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:48.580
 the town will be so called here 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:53.490
 do the same 7 blocks 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:58.210
 Rear doing here so for business overlap 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.449
 here we put the glass and now it turns out 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.420
 us 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:06.200
 pilot see everything 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:10.020
 everything is beautiful then one god back down 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:14.220
 the potion does not end specially 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:19.500
 used great so here we are waiting 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.250
 the pilot then we arrive two blocks at 3 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:24.240
 starring 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.070
 cyclone and so close here with us 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.030
 will share here is the second 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.980
 the pilot and in general, here we are 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.180
 turned out such a corncob 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:39.980
 It turned out 1 series of my segment 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:43.970
 The corn dam is very healthy 2 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:47.400
 so we can thank you all for watching 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:49.800
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.550
 big thumbs up comment 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:58.380
 This video what shortcomings offer 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:08:01.340
 What object? What transport? 

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:06.200
 the tool does not build the next video and 

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.200
 oppress everyone good luck everyone
