00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.720
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:09.420
 welcome to apple 5 x 1 and welcome 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.000
 to two simultaneous videos at the same time 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.129
 this video has been uploaded and another one of david 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.629
 that I will leave you in the description as well 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.520
 that David will have left this in his 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.960
 good description are two videos where 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.230
 let's defend two points of view 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.410
 different one because I believe that the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 iphone 6s should mount or I think it's going to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 mount the 2 gb of ram that both 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.759
 it has been rumored in recent weeks 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.980
 months and so on and David is going to defend the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.920
 well opposite point let's start 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.470
 because I think the iphone 6s is going to mount 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.690
 the 2 gigas of ram takes that a series of 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.120
 notes and well I think the first thing 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.560
 would show what benefit it has 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000
 have a good ram good memory 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.100
 mainly be able to run 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.360
 applications in a much more way 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.130
 fluid and above all can be able to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.230
 execute applications also in a way 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.060
 simultaneous that this as you well know is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 one of the novelties for which he is 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.140
 to make two if you mount two gigs of ram 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.820
 you know what there is to do two is going to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.369
 add in ios 9 a function called 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.170
 real multitasking agreement that suits 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 or rather it consists in having two 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.299
 windows that you can move and use at 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.759
 same time according to both I 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.640
 is 9 already going to add functionalities that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.679
 maybe make the iphone in this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.569
 case requires more ram memory 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.270
 especially because of course we know what 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.920
 is going to have ios 9 on the ipad well it's going to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.389
 have important news and I'm 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.770
 sure there are about 9 in the new 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:36.780
 iphone will also have exclusive things 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.639
 a lot has been said about the ford screen 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.649
 touch who tells you that maybe 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:42.689
 the use of technologies in software 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.759
 FORTA display also requires 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.289
 a greater memory I do not know are also 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.009
 coming out games apps every time 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.069
 heavier 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.420
 every time they require more not only from 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.579
 a more powerful processor also of a 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.560
 better memory that everything goes faster 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.790
 faster memories then I think 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.470
 that is also a point to highlight 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.060
 let's see a little competition 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.340
 although ios is an operating system 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.110
 different to android and more efficient than 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.580
 Android let's not forget that in the end and 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.649
 Cape Apple is also compared to the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.530
 apple competition does not care 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.330
 normally a lot because it does not matter 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.160
 much to stand out from the others as soon as 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.750
 to specifications that 's something obvious 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.310
 but yes that is true and every X 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.690
 already a renovation is coming 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.970
 of them we have been since 2012 without renewing 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.760
 the ram memory from specifically from 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.590
 the jump of the iphone 4 is the iphone 5 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.459
 we arrived with a memory giga I think that 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.690
 already touches at least I think so and about 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.580
 everything if we see the competition that already 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.350
 is over 3 gigas of ram in 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.600
 the latest models for example from 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.820
 samsung and other manufacturers no longer just 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.200
 samsung then clear we're going to 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.959
 always be ram power anchored 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.730
 If Apple has already inherited or given the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.320
 possibility of having a device already 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.209
 not of this generation but the generation 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.440
 earlier as seen to make two has 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.390
 given the possibility of mounting two gigas 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.830
 of ram knowing that it was going to be a 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.750
 device that was going to inherit functions 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.430
 to very interesting medium nine I'm 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.800
 sure that from now on the most 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.569
 logical is that apple also mount it in 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.909
 your next 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.290
 and honestly I do not have much more than 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.139
 add on this topic I think that 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.139
 that these points are what I'm going to 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.120
 use to defend this point of view and 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.219
 as I say if you want to know the points 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.530
 of David's view of why apple not 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.599
 should or will not include 2 gigas of ram 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.000
 in the next iphone that I have lived 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.129
 down here so you know how to visit it and 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.870
 nothing has been convinced a like and 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.700
 subscribe if you are not already because 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.739
 you know that this is apple 5 x 1 I am 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.739
 fernando and for the moment to do it goodbye
