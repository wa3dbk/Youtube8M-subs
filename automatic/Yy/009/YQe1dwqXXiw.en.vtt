which these high pros are definitely
known<00:01:45.110> for<00:01:45.140> um<00:01:46.510> capacitor<00:01:47.510> issues<00:01:48.190> they're

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
known for um capacitor issues they're

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.830 
known for um capacitor issues they're
well<00:01:49.430> built<00:01:49.730> power<00:01:49.940> supplies<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:50.570> they<00:01:50.690> have

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
well built power supplies but they have

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.260 
well built power supplies but they have
to<00:01:50.990> pass<00:01:51.140> their<00:01:51.380> problems<00:01:51.800> because<00:01:52.400> they<00:01:52.940> use

one<00:01:58.160> here

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
one here

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.590 
one here
yep<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.540> has<00:01:59.570> tipos<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.230> I<00:02:00.290> can<00:02:00.440> see<00:02:00.710> but<00:02:00.920> um<00:02:01.070> I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
yep it has tipos and I can see but um I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.910 
yep it has tipos and I can see but um I
could<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:02.750> cover<00:02:02.930> off<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:03.260> have<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> real<00:02:03.740> good

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
could just cover off we have a real good

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.370 
could just cover off we have a real good
look<00:02:04.100> inside<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:07.540> okay<00:02:08.540> well<00:02:09.050> we<00:02:09.170> get<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
look inside it okay well we get the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.170 
look inside it okay well we get the
cover<00:02:09.619> off<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.220> we<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:12.520> two<00:02:13.520> bulging

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
cover off and we do have two bulging

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.490 
cover off and we do have two bulging
tipos<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.870> here<00:02:15.610> from<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:16.910> see<00:02:17.500> there's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
tipos in here from what can see there's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.190 
tipos in here from what can see there's
one<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:20.300> get<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.510> camera<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:20.959> can<00:02:21.110> actually

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
one you get the camera we can actually

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.690 
one you get the camera we can actually
see<00:02:22.060> there<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.209> one<00:02:25.959> focus<00:02:26.959> here<00:02:27.520> there's<00:02:28.520> one

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
see there is one focus here there's one

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.280 
see there is one focus here there's one
here<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.959> other<00:02:29.990> is<00:02:31.600> right<00:02:32.600> there<00:02:32.990> if<00:02:33.200> you

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
here and the other is right there if you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.449 
here and the other is right there if you
can<00:02:33.440> see<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:36.590> right<00:02:37.100> here<00:02:37.280> near<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
can see so this one right here near the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.250 
can see so this one right here near the
heatsink<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.060> bulging<00:02:38.360> in<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.780> little<00:02:39.020> over

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
heatsink is bulging in a little over

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.480 
heatsink is bulging in a little over
here<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.440> bulging<00:02:41.740> so<00:02:42.740> those<00:02:42.920> are<00:02:43.040> definite<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
here is bulging so those are definite to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.300 
here is bulging so those are definite to
be<00:02:43.580> replaced<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.450> let<00:02:45.410> me<00:02:45.530> see<00:02:45.830> if<00:02:46.070> I<00:02:46.160> can

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
be replaced and let me see if I can

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.699 
be replaced and let me see if I can
figure<00:02:46.700> out<00:02:46.850> what<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.420> rating<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.560> that

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
figure out what the rating is on that

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.110 
figure out what the rating is on that
capacitor

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.450 

well<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.300> case<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.440> specs<00:02:58.800> are<00:02:59.070> pointing

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
well in this case the specs are pointing

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.070 
well in this case the specs are pointing
it<00:02:59.610> toward<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.030> heatsink<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.690> can't<00:03:00.930> really

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
it toward the heatsink so I can't really

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.350 
it toward the heatsink so I can't really
see<00:03:03.860> as<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.160> tell<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.670> gut<00:03:06.120> by<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
see as you can tell the gut by the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.620 
see as you can tell the gut by the
Gutzon<00:03:06.840> Singh<00:03:07.110> is<00:03:07.290> pretty<00:03:07.770> much<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.920> 201<00:03:08.580> unit

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.440 

though<00:03:12.630> that's<00:03:12.870> built<00:03:13.140> pretty<00:03:14.010> decent<00:03:14.450> the

as<00:03:38.040> we<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.580> tell<00:03:38.760> right<00:03:39.090> here<00:03:39.860> they<00:03:40.860> have

as we can tell right here they have

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.000 
as we can tell right here they have
white<00:03:41.520> capacitors<00:03:42.000> right<00:03:42.180> there<00:03:42.330> on<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.630> AC

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
white capacitors right there on the AC

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.780 
white capacitors right there on the AC
plug<00:03:44.010> oh<00:03:44.690> yeah<00:03:45.690> thanks<00:03:46.080> capacitors<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.980> long

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
plug oh yeah thanks capacitors and long

plug oh yeah thanks capacitors and long
coils<00:03:48.270> on<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.600> board<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:50.540> mean<00:03:51.540> everything<00:03:51.870> is

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
coils on the board I mean everything is

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.450 
coils on the board I mean everything is
polished<00:03:52.350> wise<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:53.510> adequate<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:54.540> 200<00:03:55.200> watts

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
polished wise is adequate for 200 watts

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.130 
polished wise is adequate for 200 watts
it<00:03:56.460> could<00:03:56.610> probably<00:03:56.790> pull<00:03:57.270> out<00:03:57.420> 250<00:03:57.810> watts

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
it could probably pull out 250 watts

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.420 
it could probably pull out 250 watts
okay<00:04:00.650> I'm<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:01.800> going<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.010> replace<00:04:02.250> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
okay I'm not going to replace the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.030 
okay I'm not going to replace the
capacitors<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.090> video<00:04:03.420> but<00:04:03.600> I'm<00:04:04.040> just

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
capacitors in this video but I'm just

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.680 
capacitors in this video but I'm just
wanted<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.400> see<00:04:05.580> what<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.940> issue<00:04:06.060> was<00:04:06.540> with

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
wanted to see what the issue was with

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.540 
wanted to see what the issue was with
this<00:04:06.840> thing<00:04:07.080> and<00:04:09.830> I'll<00:04:10.830> let<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.100> know<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.250> guess

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
this thing and I'll let you know I guess

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.620 
this thing and I'll let you know I guess
what<00:04:11.730> I'll<00:04:11.850> do<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.120> I'll<00:04:12.240> put<00:04:12.450> an<00:04:12.570> annotation

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
what I'll do is I'll put an annotation
