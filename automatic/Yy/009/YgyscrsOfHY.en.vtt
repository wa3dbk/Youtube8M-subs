00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
skate video and for this video i'm going

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.390 
skate video and for this video i'm going
to<00:00:03.720> be<00:00:03.780> talking<00:00:03.990> about<00:00:04.290> old<00:00:04.830> construction

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
to be talking about old construction

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.670 
to be talking about old construction
methods<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.240> also<00:00:06.660> new<00:00:07.080> construction

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
methods and also new construction

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.470 
methods and also new construction
methods<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.250> which<00:00:08.730> one<00:00:08.940> are<00:00:08.970> better<00:00:09.210> for<00:00:09.420> you

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
methods and which one are better for you

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.330 
methods and which one are better for you
to<00:00:09.540> do<00:00:09.780> because<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.650> all<00:00:10.830> know<00:00:10.860> about<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to do because we all know about the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.910 
to do because we all know about the
mahogany<00:00:11.700> tables<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.570> oak<00:00:12.750> dungeon<00:00:13.200> doors

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
mahogany tables the oak dungeon doors

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.279 
mahogany tables the oak dungeon doors
but<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.059> last<00:00:15.240> couple<00:00:15.509> months<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
but in the last couple months the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.960 
but in the last couple months the
aquarium<00:00:16.859> came<00:00:17.070> out<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.580> released<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
aquarium came out and is released a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.460 
aquarium came out and is released a
couple<00:00:18.150> methods<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.810> might<00:00:19.020> actually<00:00:19.199> be

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
couple methods that might actually be

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.710 
couple methods that might actually be
better<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.070> than<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.910> mahogany<00:00:21.119> tables

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
better for you than the mahogany tables

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.230 
better for you than the mahogany tables
or<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.289> oak<00:00:22.470> dungeon<00:00:22.890> doors<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.490> today<00:00:24.060> when

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
or the oak dungeon doors and today when

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.640 
or the oak dungeon doors and today when
it<00:00:24.359> analyzes<00:00:24.810> them<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.109> see<00:00:25.260> which<00:00:25.410> one's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
it analyzes them to see which one's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.620 
it analyzes them to see which one's
better<00:00:25.830> which<00:00:26.099> one's<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.580> for<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.420> it's

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
better which one's not for you if it's

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.120 
better which one's not for you if it's
worth<00:00:27.689> spending<00:00:27.960> maybe<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.529> little<00:00:28.769> bit<00:00:28.980> more

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
worth spending maybe a little bit more

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
worth spending maybe a little bit more
in<00:00:29.460> reaching<00:00:29.670> nice<00:00:29.880> night<00:00:30.119> construction<00:00:30.689> for

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
in reaching nice night construction for

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
in reaching nice night construction for
a<00:00:31.019> faster<00:00:31.380> method<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> be

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
a faster method but I'm going to be

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.740 
a faster method but I'm going to be
starting<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.059> by<00:00:33.210> talking<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
starting up by talking about the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.350 
starting up by talking about the
mahogany<00:00:34.140> tables<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> comparing<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
mahogany tables and comparing it to the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.170 
mahogany tables and comparing it to the
flotsam<00:00:37.430> pawnbroker<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.910> another

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
flotsam pawnbroker which is another

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.340 
flotsam pawnbroker which is another
construction<00:00:40.700> item<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.719> aquarium<00:00:42.989> which

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
construction item in the aquarium which

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
construction item in the aquarium which
can<00:00:43.590> obviously<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:43.980> built<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.670> destroyed<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
can obviously be built and destroyed and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.549 
can obviously be built and destroyed and
built<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> destroyed<00:00:45.960> again<00:00:46.289> for

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
built and destroyed again for

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.410 
built and destroyed again for
construction<00:00:46.890> experience<00:00:47.180> what<00:00:48.180> I've<00:00:48.300> done

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
construction experience what I've done

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
construction experience what I've done
also<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.500> bit<00:00:49.649> easier<00:00:49.680> for

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980

one's better or not so we're going to

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.929 
one's better or not so we're going to
start<00:01:07.890> off<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> mahogany<00:01:08.340> table<00:01:08.640> which

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
start off with the mahogany table which

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
start off with the mahogany table which
has<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> level<00:01:09.330> requirement<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.080> 52

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
has a level requirement of 52

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490 
has a level requirement of 52

it will cost you 15 coins and that has
been<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.530> up<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.740> down<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> has<00:01:20.430> been

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
been going up and down but it has been

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
at the moment it is 15 though and you

at the moment it is 15 though and you
should<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.850> expecting<00:01:27.030> anything<00:01:27.750> around

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
should be expecting anything around

600,000 experience per hour you can

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.770 
600,000 experience per hour you can
easily<00:01:31.439> get<00:01:31.770> up<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> about<00:01:32.040> 700<00:01:32.549> 800<00:01:33.090> thousand

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
easily get up to about 700 800 thousand

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.289 
easily get up to about 700 800 thousand
or<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.710> even<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> bit<00:01:35.729> slower<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
or you could even be a bit slower and

600,000<00:03:12.610> you'll<00:03:12.820> be<00:03:12.880> getting<00:03:13.090> about<00:03:13.240> 800,000

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
600,000 you'll be getting about 800,000

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.590 
600,000 you'll be getting about 800,000
I<00:03:14.350> have<00:03:14.890> been<00:03:15.040> told<00:03:15.430> they<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:15.850> easily<00:03:16.390> get

I have been told they can easily get

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.420 
I have been told they can easily get
over<00:03:16.900> 1<00:03:17.080> million<00:03:17.290> if<00:03:17.530> you're<00:03:17.650> fast<00:03:17.890> enough<00:03:18.040> I

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
over 1 million if you're fast enough I

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.480 
over 1 million if you're fast enough I
did<00:03:19.060> work<00:03:19.240> out<00:03:19.450> by<00:03:20.140> me<00:03:20.590> doing<00:03:20.740> my<00:03:21.040> little<00:03:21.070> rate

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
did work out by me doing my little rate

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.280 
did work out by me doing my little rate
at<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.640> moment<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.690> was<00:03:22.930> getting<00:03:23.140> about

at the moment that I was getting about
eight<00:03:23.500> hundred<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.890> seventy<00:03:24.310> thousand<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:24.940> I

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
eight hundred and seventy thousand so I

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.330 
eight hundred and seventy thousand so I
know<00:03:25.840> pretty<00:03:26.050> slow<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.380> be<00:03:26.470> honest<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:26.800> that's

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
know pretty slow to be honest so that's

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.800 
know pretty slow to be honest so that's
not<00:03:27.490> that<00:03:27.640> bad<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:28.030> be<00:03:28.150> honest<00:03:28.360> it's<00:03:28.540> really

not that bad to be honest it's really

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.390 
not that bad to be honest it's really
good<00:03:28.990> once<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.620> get<00:03:29.740> used<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.220> will

good once you get used to it you will

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.120 
good once you get used to it you will
beginning<00:03:30.670> maybe<00:03:30.910> 800<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:32.320> 900<00:03:32.530> thousand

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
tries you might begin a little bit lower

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.180 
tries you might begin a little bit lower
but<00:03:37.480> besides<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.350> it's<00:03:38.710> not<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:38.950> bad

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
course 6 GP / xB it's really cheap to be

honest for a construction experience so
for<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.680> reason<00:04:14.740> is<00:04:15.070> really<00:04:15.280> decent<00:04:15.610> the

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
for that reason is really decent the

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.700 
for that reason is really decent the
only<00:04:16.390> downside<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:16.930> method<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.500> that<00:04:17.530> you

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
only downside of this method is that you

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.830 
only downside of this method is that you
get<00:04:17.830> a<00:04:17.890> lot<00:04:18.250> less<00:04:18.280> experience<00:04:19.000> you're<00:04:19.540> talking

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
get a lot less experience you're talking

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.590 
get a lot less experience you're talking
at<00:04:19.930> about<00:04:20.700> 430,000<00:04:21.700> experience<00:04:22.060> per<00:04:22.150> hour<00:04:22.300> on

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
at about 430,000 experience per hour on

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.780 
at about 430,000 experience per hour on
average<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:23.350> is<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.830> lot<00:04:24.130> lower<00:04:24.280> and<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> lot

average it is a lot lower and a lot

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.070 
average it is a lot lower and a lot
higher<00:04:24.940> sometimes<00:04:25.419> depending<00:04:25.720> on<00:04:25.810> how<00:04:25.900> fast
