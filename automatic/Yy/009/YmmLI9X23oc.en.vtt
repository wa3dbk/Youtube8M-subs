00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.130
 we are thinking about doing well our 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.320
 work and try to correct the way 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.740
 in the step that we do not carry good 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.869
 We try to work every day trying to 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.939
 improve aspects that we need to 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.830
 are fundamental to finding that 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.360
 balance in all sectors of the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.130
 court and that can give us some 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.360
 movements and in this case harvest 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.460
 points that is the most important thing for 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.670
 get out of the ball we are in matches that 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.439
 they are played differently 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.170
 It has a very large wingspan 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.300
 important for the two of us 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.960
 largest teams in mexico and we have 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.719
 great hobbies that means that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.280
 It is a match that despite you are 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.760
 from above another down because it has been 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.030
 different in other campaigns something similar 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.070
 but vice versa backwards 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.480
 and the parties play and compete 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.190
 death always wants to win because 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 It is in between pride and we want 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.019
 going out to win we will go out to win 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.579
 we have the mentality of winning and makes a 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.250
 good match bananas with personality 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.980
 as as we do 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.570
 we are not going to skimp on the effort 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.210
 much less to be able to come with those 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.140
 three points there I would like to continue 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.570
 happening that our people go and 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.130
 commit as we do them in the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.540
 tribe us on the court to be able to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 give a show that is going to be more what 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.760
 most important that all the people are 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.040
 have fun and that they too 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.090
 enjoy is a special game not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.090
 play against the america 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.490
 to be a hard match a match 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.250
 difficult for us 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.770
 this is very good playing soccer 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.110
 but I think we in the week 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.000
 we are working well also for 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.880
 make a good match as I see you 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.860
 I think here the most important thing for 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.930
 we are to be the 90 minutes 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.790
 concentrated and not leave space to them 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.400
 because they have to have players from 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.840
 quality play is quick up that if you 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.450
 leave space soon you can find 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.479
 here all the matches is important 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.850
 Sometimes winning things do not happen like 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.920
 we want but good now there's that 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.679
 that try to take that out to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.899
 first to give satisfaction the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.899
 hobby of cougars and for us
