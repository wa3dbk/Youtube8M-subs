the closure it actually loosened the

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.129 
the closure it actually loosened the
pattern<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.040> little<00:04:25.310> bit<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:26.090> when<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.540> was<00:04:26.810> like

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139

wet<00:04:27.530> in<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.190> would<00:04:28.340> be<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.790> most<00:04:28.910> frizzy

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
wet in it it would be the most frizzy

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.390 
wet in it it would be the most frizzy
part<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.530> was<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:30.919> know<00:04:31.010> what<00:04:31.160> let<00:04:31.370> me

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850
