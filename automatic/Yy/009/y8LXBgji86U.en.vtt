00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.700
 yes 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:23.060
 let's talk about the chivas or pindó that 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.640
 are the popular sense names is of 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.430
 Guaraní origin that in this palm tree whose 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.800
 scientific name is if agro román its 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.290
 piano but that for us has a 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.460
 Importance not only landscaping 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.760
 but transcendental because because this 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.700
 Palm tree is an indicator of environments 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.670
 all of places of humidity is to say that 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.859
 she is indicating us when she is in 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.829
 the area of ​​natural dispersion or is in 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.109
 its natural habitat is indicating the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.480
 moisture in the soil sheds 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.640
 underground faults in the grounds 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.249
 where the water enters and we can 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.530
 observe in different environments like 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.210
 can be the saw of souls like 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.300
 they can be the ravine of the crows 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.970
 that you can not explain yourself because in the middle 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 of the hillside is occupying this palm tree 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.300
 the place is preponderant and it is due to 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.000
 that the land this one has faults out there 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.260
 the water enters and then these palms 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.780
 that is very demanding they require a lot 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.960
 for its development it is indicating us 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.290
 which are humidity inlets 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 permanent these failures in the field and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.000
 is occupied by this palm tree the same 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.690
 happens in other environments and also that we 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 It also indicates the vegetation that can 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.120
 be associated with this palm tree as you can 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.120
 be for example the case of water and how 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.480
 can be even yerba mate or as 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.610
 can be the other trees of no less 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.820
 importance as it can be the stick of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 buddy but this palm tree we do not 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.130
 only landscaping has a 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.860
 very high value but also in the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.260
 part of feeding this palm tree is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.840
 common especially in this moment that 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.250
 we can say properly that each 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.300
 case and each fruit plume weighs age 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.330
 of fruits 25 kilos of fruit each tuft 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.270
 25 kilos is an interesting fact and is very 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.520
 looked for above all animals 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.470
 wild especially if we 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.240
 let's go to the field 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.520
 or at least to the mountains where 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.980
 there are natural specimens of this 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.370
 palm tree we will be able to observe the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.770
 excrement of in case of fox 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.680
 that are full of this palm tree because 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:47.670
 is a food is a very sought after fruit 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.980
 by the species of foxes that inhabit 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.830
 Our mountains, especially in the mountains 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.490
 of gorges and mount serrano what 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.190
 indicates that we can use them 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.080
 perfectly as a complement to 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.290
 food especially for example for 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.590
 the pigs and especially with the data that you 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.970
 we provide that each piece of 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.090
 Palm tree weighs 25 kilos of fruit and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.010
 characteristic this palm tree justly 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.110
 that its leaves are in n and n 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.480
 that is to say that they are not clapped which is another 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.600
 characteristic to recognize the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.290
 palm trees and that in addition its trunk is smooth 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.360
 gray and leaves no remains of leaves 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.670
 which makes it also easy to 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.019
 identify unlike the one that 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.250
 we had talked to each other in talks 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.100
 previous 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.590
 the last capita is the foliage of this 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.290
 palm tree is a very intense green 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.180
 characteristic and is also very beautiful in 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.000
 reiterated that within the context 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.880
 American this palm tree can reach 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.250
 the 25 and 30 meters high what the 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.630
 makes interesting from the point of view 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.120
 landscaping 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.240
 formerly also this palm tree for 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.500
 give it the importance it deserves and 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.410
 claim it in also in your 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.310
 existence and this palm tree was used in 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.340
 the housing constructions by 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.440
 example we just have to go to the house 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.720
 of culture in the department of in 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.060
 the city ​​of mines and there we will see that 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.090
 the house of lavalleja still has 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.450
 trunks of pindó palm trees used as 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.060
 scissors to hold the roof are data 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.680
 interesting and also that they indicate us of 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.000
 what form and how did our 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.370
 ancestors in this in this country so 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.160
 so much is a species that we 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.380
 we have to consider promoting their 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.310
 cultivation and from various points of view 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.010
 from the point of view 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.140
 from the landscape view point of 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.580
 point of view of biodiversity that 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.190
 it is very important that we have 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.350
 that conserve a lot and also for the 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.870
 association of plant species that 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.140
 They are around this palm in its 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.090
 environment or in its natural habitat as 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.220
 all the palm trees reproduce by 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.290
 seeds without any problem and 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.380
 as the characteristic that we had given 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.900
 in the previous talk this palm tree 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.110
 reproduce by seed and so 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.360
 commonly we call coconut is going to 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.780
 take a long time to germinate delay 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.810
 exactly one year to germinate and then 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.750
 which, like the others, is 2 to 3 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.360
 years with juvenile foliage that is to say with 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.870
 the whole sheet and after that third 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.870
 year there begins to differentiate the sheet 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.120
 in pine trees that are also recognized 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.430
 the other species just for the 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.160
 intense green color and also by the 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.290
 width of the juvenile leaf which is the 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.050
 characteristic to recognize it when 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.270
 we are facing this issue in a 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.280
 nursery we are going to leave for 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.880
 here to not extend not much we're going to 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.940
 continue in the following talks and 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.070
 let's continue talking about vegetables 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.020
 emblematic as for our country by 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.840
 example how we want to refer 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.240
 to the mountain of ombúes citizen and the 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.640
 we left there to create a bit of 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.170
 expectation of what we are going to talk about in 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.170
 in the next talk
