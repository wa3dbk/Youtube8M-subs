same<00:01:07.770> thing<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> nose<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> same

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
same thing with the nose does the same

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.929

thing<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:10.260> makes<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:10.770> responsive<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
thing it makes it more responsive but I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.230 
thing it makes it more responsive but I
think<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> took<00:01:12.630> away<00:01:12.900> pop<00:01:13.430> like<00:01:14.430> quite<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> bit

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
think it took away pop like quite a bit

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.749 
think it took away pop like quite a bit
I<00:01:15.920> want<00:01:16.920> some<00:01:17.040> pop<00:01:17.220> around<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.580> quick

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.440 
I want some pop around there quick
but<00:01:19.509> I<00:01:19.539> didn't<00:01:19.780> get<00:01:19.899> any<00:01:20.049> stress<00:01:20.320> cracks<00:01:20.649> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
but I didn't get any stress cracks and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.819 
but I didn't get any stress cracks and
too<00:01:22.450> much<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.719> scanning<00:01:22.990> didn't<00:01:23.409> really<00:01:23.680> get

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
too much the scanning didn't really get

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.169 
too much the scanning didn't really get
well<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:24.159> got<00:01:24.399> few<00:01:24.729> but<00:01:25.000> really<00:01:25.479> minor<00:01:26.110> nothing

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
really noticeable I think it has good

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.020 
really noticeable I think it has good
epoxy<00:01:32.409> because<00:01:32.979> none<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.549> plies<00:01:33.759> are

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
epoxy because none of the plies are

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.690 
epoxy because none of the plies are

really splitting I'm like there's a few

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.899 
really splitting I'm like there's a few
