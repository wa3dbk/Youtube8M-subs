00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
dag total dag so I'd yeah I didn't think

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.880 
dag total dag so I'd yeah I didn't think
I<00:02:31.239> had<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.390> chance<00:02:31.690> at<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.319> it's<00:02:32.560> kind<00:02:32.860> of

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
I had a chance at it so it's kind of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.490 
I had a chance at it so it's kind of
yeah<00:02:33.400> it's<00:02:33.430> really<00:02:34.090> kind<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.810> humbling<00:02:35.170> what

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
yeah it's really kind of humbling what

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.650 
yeah it's really kind of humbling what
why<00:02:35.739> do<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:35.920> think<00:02:36.040> they<00:02:36.190> picked<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.670> um<00:02:37.000> I

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
why do you think they picked you um I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.140 
why do you think they picked you um I
think<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.470> don't<00:02:38.739> know<00:02:38.980> maybe<00:02:39.549> that's<00:02:39.819> why

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
think I don't know maybe that's why

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.270 
think I don't know maybe that's why
because<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.080> didn't<00:02:41.500> dress<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.069> for

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
because you know I didn't dress up for

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.830 
because you know I didn't dress up for
the<00:02:42.370> auditions<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.850> kind<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.180> went<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:43.510> was

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
the auditions I kind of went in was

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.449 
the auditions I kind of went in was
myself<00:02:44.019> and<00:02:44.530> I've<00:02:44.590> always<00:02:44.709> done<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.430> I

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
myself and I've always done that so I

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.160 
myself and I've always done that so I
guess<00:02:45.819> maybe<00:02:46.330> they<00:02:46.510> were<00:02:46.630> looking<00:02:46.720> for<00:02:46.900> that

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
guess maybe they were looking for that

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.539 
guess maybe they were looking for that
and<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.410> know<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.590> get<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.069> many<00:02:48.220> kind<00:02:48.459> of

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
and you know you get so many kind of

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.460 
and you know you get so many kind of
superficial<00:02:49.209> people<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.840> LA<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.230> think

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
superficial people in LA and I think

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.660 
superficial people in LA and I think
maybe<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.890> pressure<00:02:51.099> for<00:02:51.370> breath<00:02:51.519> of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
maybe it's a pressure for breath of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.740 
maybe it's a pressure for breath of
fresh<00:02:51.790> air<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.030> think<00:02:52.209> that's<00:02:52.360> what<00:02:52.480> they<00:02:52.569> like

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
fresh air I think that's what they like

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.690 
fresh air I think that's what they like
about<00:02:52.930> Australians<00:02:53.560> over<00:02:53.739> there's<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.549> was

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
different I guess usually kind of like

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.560 
different I guess usually kind of like
expect<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.520> yeah<00:04:23.970> you're<00:04:24.120> an<00:04:24.210> adult<00:04:24.510> now

but I guess I've always had a lot of

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.890 
but I guess I've always had a lot of
independence<00:04:26.820> with<00:04:27.000> working<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.660> being

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
independence with working and being
