00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 a lot of people just do not want skinny 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.420
 increase muscle 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.370
 besides all the people who have already lit 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.480
 they find that there is no pajero muscle and 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.150
 fat man ran into a problem 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.140
 that he is already becoming puny sickly 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 thin, narrow-shouldered tank hands tell him 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.710
 yes you lost weight dried up cool but 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 something you have muscle problems once 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.330
 start people already care build up 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.719
 muscles again begin to eat again already 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.920
 put the same vicious circle as 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.410
 many people do not understand what this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.079
 meaning why whiten where he recruited 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.110
 a lot so they obey then they gain mass 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.690
 obey it turns out some of the empty 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.170
 in the empty some kind of vicious circle where 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.680
 pro without a tour is that with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 every pore mass percentage muscle in 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.449
 body fat percentage gets you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.210
 less you type each time 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.500
 trying to gain muscle exactly and every 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.640
 time when you listen you are a builder 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.489
 women knives 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.060
 and muscles for smashing precious muscles a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.119
 because it promotes 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 improved body composition 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.700
 improvement of the residence agreement 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.850
 promotes better health 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 improving the body's ability 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.920
 utilize living cells from fat 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.640
 depot 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 speeds up the process of lipolysis by the same hedgehogs 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.259
 and I would like to talk about how 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.329
 have to recruit 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.490
 It is the wifeâ€™s muscles that should be removed minimally. 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.920
 some kicks and obvious dry victims 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.270
 as if this is not entirely correct of you 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.179
 you will sit down 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.659
 not a simple carbohydrate handler will 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:56.159
 grow muscle mass that is the secret to 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.979
 the fact that it does lest food so 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.539
 so that you do not increase the weight too 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.219
 quickly because you can't 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:08.379
 grow a week more than there even 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.610
 a kilogram of muscle per month to build on 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.549
 in fact it is very much 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.930
 you can increase your weight by 10 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.500
 kilogram per month but it won't 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.620
 muscle mass is completely calm 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.620
 the museum at the expense of fat at the expense of water but for 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.660
 expense of muscles and build up your weight give on 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.739
 kilogram of months is really huge 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.690
 achievement and some athletes 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.900
 who have already reached the limit of almost 600 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.569
 development if they hover from for the year two 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.780
 kilograms of dry muscles it counts 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.549
 incredible success and you start to win 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.420
 at the competition course you are ahead of their 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.860
 opponents will add in kilograms of gold 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.280
 have go to market for a few 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.109
 anecdote bake came to the market speaks from 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.049
 with these 2 kilograms of meat they cut off 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.180
 say 100 dollars but it was not going 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.430
 buy 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.260
 I'm just going to see how much you are 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.810
 a kilo of meat how many masan 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:10.299
 actually so back to our topic 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:16.079
 here's breakfast for muscle gain 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:19.079
 mass is low fat cottage cheese 300 grams 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.079
 prunes 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:30.430
 then pine nuts then low-fat 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:35.650
 kefir and coffee coffee as always without sugar 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:40.329
 and banana i am producing one banana and 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.819
 now still a copy of the mixture in the chamber dry with 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.090
 recent it is necessary to confuse these cheap 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.489
 with him breakfast qi lying sugar 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.159
 spool and under the manufacturers it is pretty 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:55.700
 qualities and under this is really oatmeal 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:04:01.280
 there is only corn flakes 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.890
 flour flakes wheat salt and no 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.660
 sugar and this high is the products 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.019
 quick to manifest which is very important 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:15.620
 sprinkled out of these laurel let's say 100 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:20.320
 grams can be in which 50 it turns out that 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:23.389
 I am here about 100 grams of carbohydrates and 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.400
 about 60 grams of protein, even 6 rent to 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.650
 120 grams of carbohydrate course at work 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.169
 on drying it is very much it is very little 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.990
 calories because proteins can be multiplied 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:36.470
 4 and will turn out and how much 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:40.760
 breakfast strength around 800 x during work 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.770
 on drying it can be touched me 800 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.410
 km that is one and the same person 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.860
 eats differently different welcomes 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.720
 training them eating and so I called 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.120
 the amount of calories here rations 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.010
 carbohydrate makes no sense to another 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.310
 man such a bed even drinking weight 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.919
 eat the same way you should even your 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.560
 working on the mass adjust the size 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.650
 portions twice a week to hang 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.010
 make measurements of his waist defenses by 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:14.060
 live layer look at will increase 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.030
 muscle larva promote such data 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.250
 as the increase in strength in training increases 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.419
 more volume in places where fat 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.400
 postponed less for example framework 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.820
 or you have a big plot and the belly grows a 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.570
 strength in training is not particularly growing 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.100
 in humans and at the same time body weight 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.080
 growing that is 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.360
 protected it grows if power is not 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.070
 increases and muscle volume they are so 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.030
 strongly primastar is more belly 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.430
 of course it sewed water retention well i 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.680
 that you score on it now we will see 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.340
 that the bastard is falling asleep 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.780
 attacked give 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:55.420
 and before that I will tell you that firstly 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.460
 it's not a birthday like that in any 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.760
 If you work for drying or growth 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:04.720
 mass nutrition occurs 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:06.280
 five times a day at least because 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.470
 not enough and 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.220
 eat here three times a day if you 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.850
 do prudnikov 5 times a day and 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.610
 remember what you need 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:19.150
 individual approach to each person 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.230
 the composition of the products as the mind must eat 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.670
 what you need to eat what portion size 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.110
 unimportant and nipple on mass every man 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.060
 individual weight and speed 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.160
 metabolism its properties of the stomach 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:36.850
 the digestive system so if 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:39.210
 no possibility let's say to 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.410
 nutritionist coach i mean stones 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.450
 use my advice and already many people 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.250
 they say that it helps them a lot 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.770
 Progress is made by those who are engaged in 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.620
 my method even without a trainer just 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.150
 read the site watching videos more than 80 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.610
 percent of people notes excellent 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.440
 progress but still not the same people 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.750
 break 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.360
 something sure and drove there may be 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.310
 98 percent love much more than him 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.940
 standing if you were not in the army 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.090
 workout with a trainer via skype you 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.290
 watch the video read the books and 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.420
 result increase why not 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.790
 via skype to coach on you 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.070
 looked and gave individual advice 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.710
 so if there is 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:24.060
 opportunity to apply for individual 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.740
 coaching me to train you of course 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.710
 it will be as efficient as possible and not 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.750
 See free advice and I do not mind 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.780
 I'm finally glad that so many people amuse 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:37.370
 on site biceps already 3,000 people spent 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:39.960
 statistics that over 80 percent of people 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.000
 got great results even 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.670
 despite the large number of errors 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.670
 which people commit doing 

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.670
 independent
