00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.910
 and today he wrote us our myth 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.220
 that they lost me and I have a problem that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.960
 it happened that there is a girl that I like 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 tell me more than good for a year 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.050
 I know everything about her that I saw but the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.780
 problem is that you have typical boyfriend of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.129
 kevin with whom she is not very happy anymore 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.320
 they always argue today that I do not know if 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.900
 declare my love or do nothing and that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.450
 follow with what I do 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.030
 that my having to live to start has 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.550
 boyfriend and for what he tells me as not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 there is a lot but if they fight like they still 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 I'm not telling you what to do if you tell him 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.660
 that you love because that could 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 after her away and then scare her and my 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 friendship would have but that yes I tell you 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.559
 behave like a gentleman when 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.670
 be with her of all a gentleman of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.489
 silver or golden armor evÃ­n and I know very 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.609
 cute with her but eye do not be 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.280
 too cute and friend at the same time because 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.590
 from what I see you are in the press or in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.990
 the friends area then they do 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.119
 situations but do not be so direct 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.729
 tell her that she looks pretty that you like her 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:27.229
 who loves her and if she gets angry with her wei 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.229
 take advantage of hugging her but not as friends 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.030
 because I have loved me kevin you are in the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.400
 front you do not want to go into it anymore and see 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.320
 that she responds positively is 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.260
 moment to make a movement of 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.680
 quick weakness because I will never make you 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.270
 cry 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.860
 those tears that roll for your 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.560
 cheeks are no longer going to be courageous 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.380
 Sadness or anger will be happiness 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.810
 because I very good color of that because 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.090
 chrome but good there's no need to be 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.130
 so fucking cheesy and remember that the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 actions speak more than the words their 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.720
 boyfriend can tell him he loves her but if 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.179
 makes her feel bad and treats her 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.580
 cock you can do things that are going to 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.430
 feel good and that's more beautiful than 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.280
 tell her that you love her but if she follows 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.010
 that 's because she wants to be there and if 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.430
 suffers is because he wants and then there he wants 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.260
 be unfortunately kevin are 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.019
 friends but 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.299
 my dearest that me that is not the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.730
 only woman in the world and makes 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.099
 surely all technical world that but 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.890
 she is not the only woman in the fucking world 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.590
 it's okay, we're kids, we're made 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.349
 easy we fell in love with our best 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.540
 friend our best friend and then it is 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.519
 normal that I came is normal mood what good 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.980
 because there are many girls in the sea what 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.590
 swear and for every broken there is a stranger 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.890

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.959

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.500
 advice has helped you have helped you 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.540
 kevin and I will not help you because I'm sorry but 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.019
 nothing can be done in the press 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.970
 more than survive or live it friends on 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.690

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.409

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.280

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.170
 normal many couples that last for years and 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.900

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.970
