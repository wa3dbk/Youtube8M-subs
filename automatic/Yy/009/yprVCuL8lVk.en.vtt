00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.080
 karim wallet from quebec 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.970
 melodist and gifted guitarist 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.329
 so I present to you without delay 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.860
 the gala guy the rap game benjamin of 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.540
 ankle boots the one you love all 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.540
 ladies and gentlemen square - letter 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.890
 an hour before going on stage I 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.930
 seems to me feel good 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.969
 a little feverish to present his songs 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.969
 and about 5 for almost the first time 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.289
 gone brand new so this is 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.210
 really a news presentation 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.589
 things so a little feverish kind of see 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:15.770
 people's reaction but I have to be 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:17.630
 to play I tell stories are 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.940
 often love stories and then 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.509
 stories with big pictures that the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.860
 purpose is only to entertain 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.720
 finally this is the aspect of 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.369
 entertainment that - in museums that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.600
 touch me a lot so that's what 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.549
 I try to do when I compose 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.679
 so that's what I wanted to do with 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.539
 this album there not thought some passages 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.280
 whatever but what kind of world this 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.170
 fun by listening to him who can 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.280
 listen and listen to them and worse marked 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.350
 things they would not have noticed the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.610
 first time a bit like a bit like 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.610
 a good american movie 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.620
 I know that the name fox I always 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.020
 found that very beautiful it is and then a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.810
 day by composing a new song 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.730
 I decided to call it fox without any 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.290
 kind of reason because I found 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 about the number or the same reason that 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.750
 beginning and then this song stayed 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.480
 transformed to become the play 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.280
 album title that from the bone 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.840
 it's like becoming more soul and since 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.610
 with the visual we did with the album 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.610
 is everything became obvious 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.200
 obviously it stays somewhere in the 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.510
 skull this thought aude the crazy do 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.150
 better than the first time but I dare 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.269
 humbly hope that this is not the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.269
 better
