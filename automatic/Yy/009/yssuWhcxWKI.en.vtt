00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
reviewed many mice toes in the past and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.690 
reviewed many mice toes in the past and
could<00:00:13.259> feel<00:00:13.410> for<00:00:13.950> people<00:00:13.980> with<00:00:14.309> watch<00:00:14.519> my

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
could feel for people with watch my

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.480 
could feel for people with watch my
videos<00:00:15.089> they<00:00:15.780> know<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:17.100> them<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> lot

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
videos they know that I like them a lot

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.000 
videos they know that I like them a lot
the<00:00:18.390> reason<00:00:18.570> why<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.289> made<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.770> well

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
the reason why is because I made so well

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.950 
the reason why is because I made so well
and<00:00:20.279> they<00:00:20.609> always<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> detail<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.689> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
and they always have the detail that you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.590 
and they always have the detail that you
want<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.199> see<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.580> did<00:00:23.850> show<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.420> does

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
want to see as I did show there it does

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.040 
want to see as I did show there it does
have<00:00:24.779> suspension<00:00:25.230> nice<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:30.050> everything

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
have suspension nice to see everything

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
have suspension nice to see everything
opens<00:00:31.800> that's<00:00:32.399> supposed<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> open<00:00:33.030> obviously

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
opens that's supposed to open obviously

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.340 
opens that's supposed to open obviously
the<00:00:33.899> convertible<00:00:34.320> doesn't<00:00:34.649> work<00:00:36.079> this<00:00:37.079> right

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the convertible doesn't work this right

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
the convertible doesn't work this right
here<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> 454<00:00:38.640> big-block<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.190> says<00:00:41.340> 454

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
here is a 454 big-block and it says 454

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.560 
here is a 454 big-block and it says 454
right<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.530> acts<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:44.520> has<00:00:44.760> 365

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
right there but it acts actually has 365

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
right there but it acts actually has 365
horsepower<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.530> isn't<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> highest

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
horsepower so this isn't the highest

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.610 
horsepower so this isn't the highest
horsepower<00:00:47.489> variants<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:49.289> particular

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
horsepower variants of that particular

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.490 
horsepower variants of that particular
engine<00:00:50.300> I'm<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.719> sure<00:00:51.989> why<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.230> think

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
engine I'm not really sure why I think

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
engine I'm not really sure why I think
that's<00:00:52.710> something<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.300> United

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that's something to do with the United

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.910 
that's something to do with the United
States<00:00:56.090> emission<00:00:57.090> standards<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.989> whatever

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
States emission standards and whatever

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.230 
States emission standards and whatever
I'll<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.699> too<00:00:59.760> much<00:00:59.969> about<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.390> business

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.730 

the<00:01:06.240> color<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.840> actually<00:01:07.530> it's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the color in this is actually it's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.969 
the color in this is actually it's
really<00:01:07.920> unique<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.979> it's

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
really unique I really like it it's it's

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
really unique I really like it it's it's
a<00:01:11.070> bronze<00:01:11.340> color<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.880> goes<00:01:12.030> throughout<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a bronze color it goes throughout the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.080 
a bronze color it goes throughout the
entire<00:01:12.540> car<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.590> matched<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.760> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
entire car and matched with this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.210 
entire car and matched with this
interior<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.020> rare<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.860> stove

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
interior it's rare that my stove

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280 
interior it's rare that my stove
separates<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> colors<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> interior

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
separates the colors of the interior

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
separates the colors of the interior
like<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.040> black<00:01:20.869> carpeting<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
like they have the black carpeting and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
like they have the black carpeting and
then<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:24.200> tannish<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:26.159> looks<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:27.210> looks

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
then this this tannish it looks it looks

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.039 
then this this tannish it looks it looks
pretty<00:01:27.659> nice<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.590> classic<00:01:29.780> nice<00:01:30.780> little

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
an older car the suspension really works

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
an older car the suspension really works
well<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.840> Nova<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
well it's kind of like that Nova that I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.359 
well it's kind of like that Nova that I
showed<00:01:38.210> push<00:01:39.210> down<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.750> really<00:01:40.320> well<00:01:40.770> no

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
showed push down really really well no

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.590 
showed push down really really well no
concern<00:01:41.909> they're<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> break<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
concern they're going to break the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.020 
concern they're going to break the
wheels<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:45.860> this<00:01:46.860> chrome<00:01:47.310> right<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
wheels this this chrome right here it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.149 
wheels this this chrome right here it
I've<00:01:48.240> always<00:01:48.479> found<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.619> be<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> problem

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
I've always found this to be a problem

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
I've always found this to be a problem
with<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> mice<00:01:50.549> toes<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> motor<00:01:51.390> maxes

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
that when you touch them it can easily

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.840 
that when you touch them it can easily
fade<00:01:56.070> away<00:01:56.369> or<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.540> kind<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> turn

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850
