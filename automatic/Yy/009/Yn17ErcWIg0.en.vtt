00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi friends it's volkswagen and we get 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.940
 find for the shortest video of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.230
 snapshot presentation of the world i 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.309
 thought 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.759
 good I'll try to lengthen it a 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.799
 little bit for you the 14 w07 which is 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.570
 a new snapshot of version 1.8 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.390
 of minecraft we will discover it together 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.340
 but only the survival side I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.020
 explain to me you know version 1.8 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.970
 it's actually a version for the maps 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.740
 maker there are a lot of novelties at 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.789
 level of the block commands and these are 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.189
 novelties that I absolutely 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 unable to describe you I you 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.660
 so redirects to the video die stone 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 who went out and you could access 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.320
 by clicking on the link found 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.829
 under the video me on my side I 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.200
 decided to add my grain of salt 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.590
 making you a little presentation of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.829
 what comes out again for the side 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.510
 survival of minecraft is the only 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.670
 novelty in fact it's the hatch in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 so do the hatch it works the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.809
 same way the normal trap except that you 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 can not activate with your little one 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.030
 mimine can activate it only with a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.090
 redstone mechanism whose home makes 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.420
 part of it that's activated only with 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.770
 a mechanism so of course I could 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.140
 tell you well bah actually the video 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.630
 stop there thank you very much for having me 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.250
 kept it to him except that video ba where she 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.360
 is going to be really extremely short and 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.979
 so I decided to give you a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.659
 reason to continue watching this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 video by doing some small 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.909
 constructions using this hatch 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.740
 to make some small ideas here and there 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.750
 to show you a bit about what you 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.520
 can do then we would do my 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.790
 ceiling light it's true ceiling lights 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.400
 so with the new granite blocks 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 diorite et cetera it's still 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.009
 not bad 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.780
 I wanted to show you a little bit 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.729
 the atrocity of the block of glo stone because 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.680
 that it's ugly finally anyway with 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.659
 this pack of basic textures is ugly 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.009
 it can give something nice 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.990
 it's your time glosses look like 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.790
 really to something like in the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 pack john smith or glo stone 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.240
 look like lanterns 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 here good to listen to a month I put two 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.290
 landais zitte font it may not be 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.720
 badly it can do something 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.640
 nice to the rest I do not know 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.489
 no it does not put itself like that it is 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 pity we can not reverse the 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.850
 solar trays would have been nice 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.590
 but also to be able to do something 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.760
 something like that but anyway 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.650
 here we can use it to make 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.130
 ceiling lights can be used of course 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.060
 to make green plants 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.440
 me what I find very friendly 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.720
 it is to use birch wood 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.100
 because the birch wood like these 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.500
 whites bah listen and here you have 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.390
 just a few small black spots and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.600
 you can put big plants 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.090
 green so big leaves here 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.730
 story that all can stay white 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.800
 if you add saha from the decor of 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.390
 marble I think there really is way 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.069
 to do something very good 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.140
 I may try to use it 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.850
 to make a real season 10 of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.739
 minecraft deco guillaume that will be 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.030
 based on the white a white decoration 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.069
 it could be pretty good 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.709
 a little redundant so it's not 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.380
 my final idea but why not 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.320
 serve all this for a season 10 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.820
 then we will listen to the stove must 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.769
 really have a lot of imagination in 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.200
 May since there are four trunks 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.859
 we can use it and say that it is 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.870
 a cooker 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.390
 why not it's part of delusions 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.970
 we can imagine with other minecraft 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.980
 things the arbor or so just the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.209
 ceiling with holes it can be not bad 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.180
 lets the light through it does not leave 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.220
 not spend the rain why not the only one 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.260
 disadvantage is that you are 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.030
 obliged to take a ride like that so 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.079
 to illuminate a corridor for example 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.280
 it's not bad if you do not want 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.770
 to use 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840
 green it can be cool so we have 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.520
 the famous ceiling that let the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.319
 light they know well 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.030
 if you do not want to leave 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.500
 pass the light and you want to 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.540
 for example simulated we will say on your 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.370
 terrace a small manhole that 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.800
 absorb water to prevent your 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.630
 terrace is flooded you can you 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.030
 serve as his sphere of the gullies in the 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.200
 cities for example 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.560
 here to absorb the falling water 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.290
 why not it's a delirium to press 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.480
 this is really another use 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.950
 you can quite well then there 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.920
 it's not deep enough so it'll work 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.260
 not but kind you can put 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.640
 the water is closing 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.930
 and so you have water just 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.690
 below you can tell you this is 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.790
 a city ditch why not the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.110
 pool also it always works with the 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.880
 small manhole at the bottom of the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.500
 swimming pool 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.840
 it's more realistic the same thing 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.740
 still this famous bush that allows 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.450
 to evacuate the water 1 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.680
 here you can find it in 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.550
 below it's still a little bit 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.830
 more realism 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.229
 and then good bah famous toilets 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.870
 the Turkish one of course you activate your 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.150
 lever and that's so you have so 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.110
 school the advantage that you not fall for the 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.760
 life those who had this 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.930
 camping haunt to fall into the 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.789
 Turkish toilet hole 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.300
 I can understand I can you 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.890
 not understand this is it reminds me of 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.940
 bad memories I did not fall but 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.289
 good there are still some bad 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.150
 memories that we use toilets 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.940
 Turkish and we are not used to it 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.190
 so here you can activate her the 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.570
 little lever right next so well the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.190
 better it is to have the little lever if 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.350
 you replace a button it's more 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.900
 aesthetic but less convenient to you to 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:19.470
 make your choice 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:20.669
 okay that was the cool fail good bah 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.080
 listen to it was the little ones 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.560
 dancefloor ideas that I could you 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.180
 give using this new hatch 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.000
 iron that makes its appearance in the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.169
