00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello everybody!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Today I will tell you the right method to
turn the hoop.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.000
Some of you probably think that for turn the
hoop you need to make circle with your hips.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
This is not quite true.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.500
So let's see what we need exactly do for correct hooping.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
To start put the right leg forward and we
will move the hips forward

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:36.000
in the direction of the right foot.
So we move the hips forward.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's look from the side.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Put your right leg forward and begin to move
the hips forward.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.500
one, one, one, one ..
Focus on moving forward.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In order to not interfere with our hands,
because we will have a hoop on the waist,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.500
we will raise them and will keep hands at
chest level.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000
Well, now let's try together with a hoop.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.800
Right foot slightly in front of, hoop put
to your lower back.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.800
We will turn to the left.
Swing, aim a blow and raise your hands at chest level.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Meanwhile hips begin to move forward

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.000
as we already have learned it.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.600
Thus, as you can see, we do not do circle
motion with hips

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.300
but push the hoop with moves forward.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.600
Let's see how it looks from the side.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.400
Right foot forward. Hoop put on your lower
back.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.889
Aim a blow and immediately begin to move the
hips forward.

00:01:54.889 --> 00:02:00.800
Hands at chest level.
I remind you that the emphasis in the movement is forward.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.419
one, one, one, one,

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:08.000
forward, forward, push, push, push, push ..

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.000
So we learned today the correct way to turn
the hoop.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In this case, we are the axis, and the hoop
spinning around us.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.300
Remember that you need to push hoop with your hips but do not make a circle.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.860
See you!
