going<00:01:06.780> there<00:01:06.930> electronics<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:08.490> used<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> have

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
going there electronics we used to have

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.250 
going there electronics we used to have
the<00:01:09.090> burst<00:01:09.299> buck<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.630> one<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:09.869> two<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> the

historic s-- we've actually moved them

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.789 
historic s-- we've actually moved them
into<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> core<00:01:12.869> models<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.740> can

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
into the core models now so they can

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.609 
into the core models now so they can
enjoy<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.790> well<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:16.290> going

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
enjoy that just as well and then going

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.179 
enjoy that just as well and then going
there<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.790> work<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.270> our<00:01:18.299> capacitors<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there we work with our capacitors in the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.080 
there we work with our capacitors in the
past<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.790> had<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.330> oh<00:01:21.630> 22<00:01:22.320> micro<00:01:22.710> farad's<00:01:23.130> we

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
past we had two oh 22 micro farad's we

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.960 
past we had two oh 22 micro farad's we
found<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:24.780> putting<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.200> no<00:01:25.350> 15<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
found that by putting a no 15 in the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
found that by putting a no 15 in the
neck<00:01:27.180> position<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.530> better

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
neck position there was a little better

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640 
neck position there was a little better
clarity<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.360> across<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.900> board<00:01:31.170> we're

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
clarity so right across the board we're

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.350 
clarity so right across the board we're
making<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.130> change<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.090> really

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
making that change so that you really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.770 
making that change so that you really
hear<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> clarity<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> neck<00:01:34.920> pickup<00:01:35.780> so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
hear the clarity of a neck pickup so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.880 
hear the clarity of a neck pickup so
there<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.220> guitar<00:01:38.700> oh<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.890> the

can<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.450> make<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.750> better<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.009> what

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
can we make it better and this is what

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.219 
can we make it better and this is what
we're<00:01:50.310> doing<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.240> very<00:01:51.450> elegant<00:01:51.630> system

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
we're doing it's a very elegant system

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
we're doing it's a very elegant system
it's<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.070> Gibson<00:01:53.610> bridge<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.119> fits<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.810> on

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
it's as Gibson bridge it fits right on

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
it's as Gibson bridge it fits right on
or<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> tailpiece<00:01:55.710> part<00:01:55.979> me<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.310> then<00:01:57.090> they

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
or the tailpiece part me and then they

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.859 
or the tailpiece part me and then they
lock<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> what<00:02:00.299> you're<00:02:00.390> seeing<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
lock in so so what you're seeing here is

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.350 
lock in so so what you're seeing here is
they're<00:02:01.799> taking<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> lot<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> older<00:02:02.909> things

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
