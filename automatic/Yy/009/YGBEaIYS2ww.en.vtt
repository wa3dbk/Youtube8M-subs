00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
23 million customers a week now this is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
23 million customers a week now this is
an<00:01:55.320> exciting<00:01:55.650> fast-moving<00:01:56.520> environment<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
an exciting fast-moving environment and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840 
an exciting fast-moving environment and
what<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.050> does<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.680> creates<00:01:58.850> opportunity

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

and<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.750> retail<00:02:01.260> more<00:02:01.560> than<00:02:01.740> any<00:02:01.950> other

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and I think retail more than any other

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.940 
and I think retail more than any other
sector<00:02:02.700> has<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.020> potential<00:02:04.410> to<00:02:04.650> create

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.449 
haven't been the best as I've looked
around<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.350> I've<00:03:07.680> tried<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> make<00:03:08.160> up<00:03:08.340> for

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459

them

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.140 

I<00:04:49.810> think<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.230> hard<00:04:51.500> work<00:04:51.680> always<00:04:52.220> pays<00:04:52.430> in

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
I think that hard work always pays in

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.409 
I think that hard work always pays in
the<00:04:53.300> end<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:53.919> you've<00:04:54.919> got<00:04:55.160> it<00:04:55.310> within<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.820> the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
the end and you've got it within you the

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.570 
the end and you've got it within you the
one<00:04:56.660> thing<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:57.080> people<00:04:57.410> can't<00:04:57.770> stop<00:04:58.250> you

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
one thing that people can't stop you

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.550 
one thing that people can't stop you
from<00:04:58.610> doing<00:04:58.790> is<00:04:59.360> trying<00:04:59.690> that<00:04:59.810> bit<00:05:00.020> harder<00:05:00.350> so

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
from doing is trying that bit harder so

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.500 
from doing is trying that bit harder so
always<00:05:01.220> turn<00:05:01.520> back<00:05:01.729> on<00:05:01.910> yourself<00:05:02.030> when

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
always turn back on yourself when

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.420 
always turn back on yourself when
something<00:05:02.810> not<00:05:03.020> going<00:05:03.290> your<00:05:03.470> way<00:05:03.500> don't<00:05:04.220> worry

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
something not going your way don't worry

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.129 
something not going your way don't worry
about<00:05:04.639> what<00:05:04.910> maybe<00:05:05.090> other<00:05:05.389> people<00:05:05.630> might<00:05:05.960> do
