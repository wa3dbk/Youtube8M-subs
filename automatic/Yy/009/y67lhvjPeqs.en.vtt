our initial work on the master plan

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.119 
our initial work on the master plan
involved<00:00:05.660> the<00:00:05.810> development<00:00:06.440> of<00:00:06.560> a<00:00:06.680> historic

involved the development of a historic

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.090 
involved the development of a historic
site<00:00:07.400> survey<00:00:08.180> which<00:00:08.600> really<00:00:08.870> allowed<00:00:09.500> us<00:00:09.530> to

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
site survey which really allowed us to

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.570 
site survey which really allowed us to
analyze<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:11.119> park<00:00:11.449> over<00:00:12.440> the<00:00:12.650> period<00:00:12.949> of<00:00:13.309> its

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
development when I first began working

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.070 
development when I first began working
at<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.309> park<00:00:16.550> there<00:00:17.270> were<00:00:17.449> all<00:00:17.660> these<00:00:17.840> various

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
at the park there were all these various

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.860 
at the park there were all these various
arguments<00:00:18.590> among<00:00:18.910> your<00:00:19.910> fashion<00:00:20.330> autos<00:00:20.660> of

arguments among your fashion autos of
the<00:00:21.320> house<00:00:21.500> of<00:00:21.820> what<00:00:22.820> it<00:00:22.940> looked<00:00:23.210> like<00:00:23.330> how<00:00:23.630> it

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840

should be restored everyone had various

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.350 
should be restored everyone had various
pieces<00:00:26.840> of<00:00:27.160> documentation<00:00:28.160> that<00:00:28.880> they<00:00:29.060> would
