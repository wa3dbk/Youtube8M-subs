00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.540
 let's talk about him seedbed 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 or the germination process 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:13.699
 we talk about hydroponics are puzzles 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.749
 this is the stone 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.390
 to develop our crops 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.699
 it's called mola 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.439
 germination process 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.300
 the first of all 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 the first requirement is to have a good seed 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.019
 where are we going to get 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.520
 seeds and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.220
 this seed we can not pretend to go back to the pulpería 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.720
 to the nearest store 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.130
 and buy 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 a packet of seeds that we do not know 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.150
 and where did they come from and what did not 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.110
 all is the first theme of his music 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.340
 a store 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.250
 specialized 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.960
 in agricultural products 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.520
 cross that's him 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.450
 best place in quarters of military agreement 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.690
 to go buy so much 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.530
 these seeds 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.920
 like any of the materials that we are going to use to develop 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 our hydroponic crops 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.400
 for this it is important when going 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.870
 Question 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.690
 if that seed that we are acquiring is a certified seed 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.390
 we will realize 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.400
 that this store of agricultural products 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.180
 has some jars and jars are usually Carlos Keen 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.310
 peace 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.800
 no metal 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.090
 that open and close here stays in a cool place 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.750
 and also what is done 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.490
 then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.270
 these stores sell us those seeds 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.049
 either for leisure jorquera with kilo per kilo 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.860
 then that would be the ideal place for you the seeds 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.600
 or it was also a hotbed to a specialized store if there are in some centers 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.110
 commercial 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.589
 i sell these 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.209
 seeds 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.930
 that are certified 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.709
 That is the first step 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.199
 We know that certified seed is not cheap 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.749
 but if we do not buy a seed of good quality we will not have crops 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.149
 of good quality 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:29.319
 or it can also happen that it goes to more we acquire with the rail seeds 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:32.449
 / peace 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.779
 During the development process, breasts will die 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.359
 two after we die the crops can not be too 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.649
 that the crops 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.259
 that will make us sick 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.529
 will fill them with pests the things are going to get withered 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.639
 and so on 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.969
 it is a clear sign that we are making a mistake 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.539
 in the process of elimination 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:03.249
 I am often called by participants to the medicine workshops 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:04.819
 we have 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.919
 the problems do not tell us or develop the plant 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:10.539
 p 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:15.019
 It also happens that a lesson of the mayor's reading came out a stoppage for 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.439
 river and mouth developed pérez in these cases we are sure that the 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.109
 used seeds 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.499
 josé millás that 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:27.629
 that have been exposed to the sun that are sold or that are not seeds of 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.879
 good quality 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.889
 as a scientist that a quality seed or not 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.029
 here I have a mint seed 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:43.579
 cinema station that is of a company that will be called the city efe 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.239
 comes from a country called Spain 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.039
 has a grade of l 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.999
 purification 95% 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.069
 tells us the date that was ambassador in the yearned 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.919
 2010 in the month of April 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.689
 it indicates a net weight of work 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.000
 and does not guarantee a process with a percentage of germination of 70% 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.019
 what does this mean 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.089
 that of every ten plants seven we are going to finish 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.820
 that's what guarantees us 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.739
 the manufacturer 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.129
 here we have a tomato seed 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.129
 equal of galaxy 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.249
 tells us 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.359
 that was attacked in the month of November of the year 2010 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.090
 that weighs 1 points 5 degrees 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.570
 that expires in the month of December of the year 2013 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:46.399
 and comes a series of acts tells us that it should be cultivated 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.810
 in you 40 centimeters 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.999
 a distance of 40 cents 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.309
 and they even tell us what months should be cultivated 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.319
 this is very important because speaking 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.219
 in the process of going they opposed 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.800
 there are no dates we can do it to the massive at midnight we can verify 

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:11.300
 five in the morning 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.389
 we can do it at noon 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.379
 we determine that the day and time and if we want to do every day 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:19.289
 we can not do the maximum 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.669
 with that cultivation technique still exist is a honeymoon move months in 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.320
 that is cultivated that it was seen indicates to us that it is cultivated in these months 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.349
 this we are going government 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:33.349
 China is a very important issue 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.610
 they always ask us 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.389
 the seed that we use for traditional crops in the same 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.139
 seed 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.270
 we never think for 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.330
 Grow in hydroponics 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.339
 almost always the answer is yes 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:51.520
 because it's like reading opposing has developed in these countries of 

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:54.789
 america as much as in many parts of the world 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.509
 we all have that series if we can not continue 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.770
 a few states a little limited in which 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.770
 i is not a specific seed for the opponent 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.809
 here we have an envelope of thyme seeds 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:12.919
 it is a common standard 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.439
 in a district x of a house known as are of the year 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.070
 of men's houses 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.180
 country of origin belgium 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.349
 who was impacted in 2010 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:26.550
 that the printed 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.650
 b 0 points 5 grams that was insanely treated 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.229
 and that expire on January 3 of the year 2012 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.569
 so 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.229
 whatever our supplier of the seeds it is important to verify 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.050
 everything is information 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.180
 just like I insist that serious nephew with damage that had not been 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.229
 hit that has not been exposed to the sun important to keep the seeds 

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.740
 Always in a dry and cool place
