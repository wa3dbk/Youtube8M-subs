00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.590
 for me 

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:08.590
 [Music] 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:17.150
 It's time to start the industry 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.009
 national ice cream reaches a value of 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.079
 850 million dollars industry 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.000
 compared to other countries is very 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.119
 small that has a per capita consumption 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.750
 of 2 kilos per 2 liters per person 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.370
 annual then what we see is that it is a 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.910
 growth we go with a 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:43.280
 opportunity to companies in the countries 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.730
 as brasil chile they have 8 10 10 kilos 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.540
 New Zealand consumer has up to 24 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.140
 us countries are 24 on the subject of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.640
 consumption of an opportunity where the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.590
 industry has to grow which is the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.890
 approximate cost to venture into 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.600
 this market the basic business 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.650
 complementing it among machinery in 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.270
 refrigeration 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.730
 advertising is costing you minimal 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.490
 120 thousand pesos very limited that you have to 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.430
 clarify it and something very sophisticated to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.960
 survey among the 500 myths is what 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.440
 It should be taken into account before 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.060
 undertake Mexico production from the side 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.610
 much to increase the season 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.800
 heat and considerable low in the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.570
 rainy or cold season depending 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.280
 also the location where you are in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.410
 shopping centers we send that the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.690
 cold season was increased 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.110
 maintains with the influx of people 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.530
 but open places if they decrease 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.180
 then it is a point to consider the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.080
 products the production that will be 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.750
 doing here we recommend it is 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.020
 complement the ice cream industry or 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.030
 the desserts cold with the part also of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.369
 cafeteria that is also exhibited to whom 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.260
 in the event then you have a 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.970
 balance in kid season 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.770
 heat season or equal to well 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.150
 simply have the craving for something cold 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.530
 to hot you can find on your 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.050
 own children 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.300
 producers and manufacturers have to 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.990
 make a healthier ice cream without relishing 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.050
 the 100 grams 275 kilocalories already seen 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.540
 with the tax on all products 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.980
 they must have the labeling and who does not 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.239
 omit them from that legend is taken for granted 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.950
 that is on that on that subject the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.030
 positive part is that during the first 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.640
 year 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.610
 who wants to venture into this in this 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.320
 industry will not be charged 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.959
 taxes during the first year in the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.970
 part of opportunity and based on that 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.560
 start looking for strategies to 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.280
 that you're not affected by a hundred 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.500
 profitable cent is not because you're welcome 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.620
 It's good to have a great team and a great team 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.180
 production if you do not have the market 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.459
 Mexico is a country in which we do not have 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.650
 culture to get ice cream in time of 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.180
 people do not eat cold side , a 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.690
 lluviecita the agency does not buy 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 they only buy extreme heat 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.450
 this really work for us the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.600
 half of the year and half we have 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.340
 prolonged vacation in our country 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.950
 there is no ice cream consumption culture 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.600
 however to be able to succeed in this 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.190
 market should look for innovation 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.980
 then more is dedicated to manufacturing 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.840
 of machines to make ice cream and also 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.300
 to making mix to make the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.550
 water we have different types of ice cream 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.340
 basically it is divided into two branches that 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.650
 is the side knows that this is the cream 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.420
 and yogurt ice cream that is the other 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.360
 branch not depending on the market 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.520
 go is what kind of side to choose 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.560
 goal for a more popular market is 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.510
 used on the side know that the cream 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.880
 and for a slightly more premium market 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.740
 a little higher purchasing power is 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.510
 uses the audiovisual but you 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.420
 kiosk that we have here 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.120
 is 130,000, so massive that includes the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.130
 Machine includes the kiosk includes a kit 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.930
 initial input to start 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.090
 we made already we sell the ice cream in 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.460
 dust do not study by hand hydrated 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.650
 minister lesson the machine and alone more 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.420
 in my case the ice cream knows and in the case 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.240
 of yogurts this water powder 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.950
 and a kilo of commercial yogurt which is the 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.780
 return on investment we take a 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.030
 return investment of 6 months depending 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.460
 of the point I say we have clicks that no 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.500
 month pots in three months others in a year 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.810
 It varies totally depending on the point 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.270
 but as a mean of reference as 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.710
 six months according to experts this 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.530
 market has a high potential for 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.300
 growth in the next few years I am 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.300
 smith arango and it's time to undertake 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.009
