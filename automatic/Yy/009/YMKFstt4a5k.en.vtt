the<00:00:06.870> bike<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.080> very<00:00:07.410> sweet<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.890> ride<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.910> turns

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
the bike is very sweet to ride it turns

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.350 
the bike is very sweet to ride it turns
easy<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.620> didn't<00:00:11.460> really<00:00:11.490> get<00:00:11.849> many<00:00:12.120> laps

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
easy and I didn't really get many laps

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.379 
easy and I didn't really get many laps
on<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> on<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> dry<00:00:13.200> yet<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.980> can't<00:00:14.389> it's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
on the on the dry yet I can't it's

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.140 
on the on the dry yet I can't it's
difficult<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.870> comment<00:00:16.170> yet<00:00:16.350> but<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> wet

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
difficult to comment yet but on the wet

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.630 
difficult to comment yet but on the wet
anyway<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.840> really<00:00:19.650> good<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.160> first<00:00:20.369> feeling

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
anyway is really good the first feeling

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
anyway is really good the first feeling
was<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.330> really<00:00:21.510> good<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> lot<00:00:21.960> riding

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
was really really good and a lot riding

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.429 
was really really good and a lot riding
on<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> wet<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> felt<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.570> felt<00:00:24.600> our<00:00:25.260> own

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
on the wet and so I felt I felt our own

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.920 
on the wet and so I felt I felt our own
straight<00:00:25.800> away<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.300> then<00:00:27.300> hopefully<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.750> were

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
straight away and then hopefully we were

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.420 
straight away and then hopefully we were
going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> know<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> test<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:30.109> understand

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
going to know in this test to understand

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.100 
going to know in this test to understand
the<00:00:32.430> potential<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> draw<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.809> well

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the potential on the on the draw as well

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.250 
the potential on the on the draw as well
but<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.969> he<00:00:36.090> feels<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.600> feels<00:00:36.630> obviously

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
but when he feels it feels obviously

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.740 
but when he feels it feels obviously
very<00:00:37.440> different<00:00:37.920> because<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> different

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
very different because it's a different

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
very different because it's a different
engine<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.950> complete<00:00:41.370> different

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
engine and it is a complete different

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.510 
engine and it is a complete different
like<00:00:41.930> so<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.230> gonna<00:00:43.379> get<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.340> used

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
like so I'm gonna get have to get used

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040 
like so I'm gonna get have to get used
to<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.090> things<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.719> me<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
to it and it's things more for me a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.970 
to it and it's things more for me a
diminutive<00:00:46.670> blending<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.530> Sean<00:00:49.530> understand

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
diminutive blending and Sean understand

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I think the new technical regulations

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.580 
I think the new technical regulations
are<00:01:36.420> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:37.910> playing<00:01:38.990> or<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.050> in<00:01:40.440> your

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
think it's going to be leveling the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.740 
think it's going to be leveling the
performances<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:50.300> hopefully<00:01:51.300> will<00:01:51.450> increase

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
performances and hopefully will increase

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.160 
performances and hopefully will increase
the<00:01:51.930> show<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.500> well<00:01:52.650> for<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170

close<00:01:57.750> racing<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:59.870> issued<00:02:00.870> should<00:02:01.080> shoot

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
close racing and issued should shoot

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.640 
close racing and issued should shoot
shoot<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.010> owner

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.200 

you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.380 

and<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.200> believe<00:02:10.130> there<00:02:10.970> is<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.090> time<00:02:11.360> for

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
and I believe there is a time for

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.480 
and I believe there is a time for
everything<00:02:13.600> for<00:02:14.600> me<00:02:14.750> when<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.020> started<00:02:15.490> racing

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
everything for me when I started racing

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.820 
everything for me when I started racing
his<00:02:16.760> world<00:02:16.940> championship<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.690> never<00:02:18.410> had<00:02:18.650> the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
his world championship I never had the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.540 
his world championship I never had the
best<00:02:19.010> bike<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.730> never<00:02:19.910> had

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
best bike and I never had

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.370 
best bike and I never had
and<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:22.180> know<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.420> complete<00:02:22.630> package<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.290> be

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
and you know the complete package to be

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.110 
and you know the complete package to be
able<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.680> win<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.860> championship<00:02:24.040> or<00:02:24.730> even<00:02:25.030> to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
able to win the championship or even to

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.890 
able to win the championship or even to
win<00:02:25.270> races<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.460> also<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.390> maybe<00:02:28.750> I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
win races but I also think that maybe I

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.610 
win races but I also think that maybe I
wasn't<00:02:29.200> ready<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.860> was<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.760> little<00:02:31.180> bit<00:02:31.530> early<00:02:32.530> to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
wasn't ready I was a little bit early to
