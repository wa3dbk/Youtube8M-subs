this<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.240> how<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:45.449> distinguish<00:04:46.080> one<00:04:46.380> source

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
this is how you distinguish one source

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.029 
this is how you distinguish one source
from<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.490> other<00:04:47.760> sources<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:49.530> here's<00:04:49.770> one

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
from the other sources so here's one

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.770 
from the other sources so here's one
source<00:04:50.930> here<00:04:51.930> is<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.680> second<00:04:53.159> source<00:04:53.780> here's

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
source here is the second source here's

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.370 
source here is the second source here's
the<00:04:54.990> third<00:04:55.229> source<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:56.960> here's<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.110> fourth

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
the third source and here's the fourth

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.080 
the third source and here's the fourth
source<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.650> again<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.130> distinguish<00:05:02.639> them<00:05:02.849> by

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
source so again you distinguish them by

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.510 
source so again you distinguish them by
their<00:05:03.570> indentation<00:05:04.260> all<00:05:04.949> right<00:05:05.340> we<00:05:05.490> are
