00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
balls pick on this scale because he's a

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
balls pick on this scale because he's a
guy<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.050> he's<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.590> normally<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.550> fantasy

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.219 
didn't put up huge numbers but Russell
Wilson<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> much<00:01:54.210> better<00:01:54.240> quarterback<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
Wilson is a much better quarterback and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.709 
Wilson is a much better quarterback and
much<00:01:55.619> more<00:01:55.799> capable<00:01:56.100> than<00:01:56.430> Alex<00:01:56.909> Smith<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.689> I

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
much more capable than Alex Smith so I

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.350 
much more capable than Alex Smith so I
think<00:01:57.990> again<00:01:58.649> then<00:01:59.280> playing<00:01:59.610> at<00:01:59.759> home<00:01:59.969> they

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
think again then playing at home they

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.780 
think again then playing at home they
are<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.540> completely<00:02:01.200> different<00:02:02.009> team<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.520> home

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
are a completely different team at home

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.760 
are a completely different team at home
than<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> road<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.530> think

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
than they are on the road and I think

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.319 
than they are on the road and I think
Russell<00:02:05.100> Wilson<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.149> an

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
Russell Wilson is going to have an

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.380 
Russell Wilson is going to have an
amazing<00:02:06.619> game<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> much-hyped<00:02:08.879> game

okay their defense has been keeping a
minute<00:03:12.180> for<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.359> most<00:03:12.599> part<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.079> this<00:03:13.290> game

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
minute for the most part but this game

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.250 
minute for the most part but this game
could<00:03:13.680> be<00:03:13.859> close<00:03:14.420> having<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.510> go<00:03:15.629> from<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.989> road

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
could be close having to go from a road

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.580 
could be close having to go from a road
game<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:17.190> San<00:03:17.609> Francisco<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.750> another<00:03:19.109> prime

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
game in San Francisco to another prime

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.670 
game in San Francisco to another prime

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
time road game game game is going to be

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.909 
time road game game game is going to be
difficult<00:03:23.010> for<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:24.060> Bears<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.410> Jets<00:03:25.709> are

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
difficult for the Bears and the Jets are

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.729 
difficult for the Bears and the Jets are
the<00:03:26.069> number<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.510> defense<00:03:27.510> against<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.410> run

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
the number one defense against the run

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.640 
the number one defense against the run
now<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.459> saw<00:03:29.819> how<00:03:30.060> San<00:03:30.329> Francisco<00:03:30.930> shut<00:03:31.410> down

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
now we saw how San Francisco shut down

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.509 
now we saw how San Francisco shut down
Matt<00:03:32.010> Forte<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.910> think<00:03:33.359> he<00:03:33.510> had<00:03:33.599> 24<00:03:34.440> yards<00:03:35.370> in

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
Matt Forte I think he had 24 yards in

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.970 
Matt Forte I think he had 24 yards in
that<00:03:35.669> game<00:03:35.910> 21<00:03:36.569> or<00:03:36.720> something<00:03:37.019> like<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.200> they

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
that game 21 or something like that they

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.039 
that game 21 or something like that they
absolutely<00:03:38.220> shut<00:03:38.910> down<00:03:39.090> our<00:03:39.120> run<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
absolutely shut down our run and the

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.650 
absolutely shut down our run and the
Jets<00:03:40.319> are<00:03:40.500> even<00:03:40.829> better<00:03:41.160> against<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.970> run<00:03:42.180> so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
Jets are even better against the run so

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.479 
Jets are even better against the run so
it's<00:03:42.840> going<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.139> be<00:03:43.230> very<00:03:43.260> hard<00:03:43.919> for<00:03:44.010> us<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.250> get
