hands that sort of thing and the actual

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.109 
hands that sort of thing and the actual
battery<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.840> embedded<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.820> 3000<00:01:23.820> milliamp

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
battery is embedded it's a 3000 milliamp

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
battery is embedded it's a 3000 milliamp
battery<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.380> uses<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:26.009> LG<00:01:26.369> calls<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
battery but it uses what LG calls is a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.350 
battery but it uses what LG calls is a
step<00:01:27.780> design<00:01:28.490> for<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> battery<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.119> helps

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
step design for the battery that helps

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.499 
step design for the battery that helps
it<00:01:30.479> keep<00:01:30.509> its<00:01:30.869> thin<00:01:31.259> profile<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:33.090> what

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it keep its thin profile so what

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.679 
it keep its thin profile so what
interesting<00:01:33.869> feature<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> LG<00:01:35.009> g2<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
pretty cool now another thing here

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
pretty cool now another thing here
that's<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.350> nice<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.130> use

that's really nice is you can just use

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.280 
that's really nice is you can just use
the<00:01:50.850> volume<00:01:51.000> key<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> back<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.020> by

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
the volume key on the back here just by

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.859 
the volume key on the back here just by
holding<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.920> down<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.880> that'll

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
holding this down and that'll

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
holding this down and that'll
automatically<00:01:55.470> fire<00:01:55.799> up<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> camera<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
