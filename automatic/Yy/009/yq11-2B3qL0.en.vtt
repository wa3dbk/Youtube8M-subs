00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.980
 It is Ono Sato of camera resale consultant This time we comment on how to check the number of shutters 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.420
 I would like 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:18.770
 If you look at the exhibition page of the camera, the shutter frequency and 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:25.610
 There are some in which a number is described in the form of release number 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:29.789
 This is, of course, the less it gets smaller, the closer it is to a new product, so the high price 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:35.730
 Increase the possibility of being awarded 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:41.730
 By all means, I think if you can make effective use of it, it is good. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:48.260
 Asked if would do better that was expressed, if large numbers of how much in a Asked Questions 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.260
 It will but this will vary by each model 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:58.730
 I manufacturer Nikki announced because official of the shutter durability number Yeah I, but this is the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.680
 There are considerable differences depending on the model 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:09.040
 The entry plane like Kiss x is the entry plane when it says in Canon 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:13.060
 Has become quite Sukumatsuku woman by say 50,000 times 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:19.190
 It is on the other hand said that 1 dx 8 d person 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:25.280
 The number of endurances has become considerably high because it is about 400,000 times for professional machines 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:32.780
 Based on this, let's decide if you would like to indicate the number. 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 I think, but it is better described as long as about 20% of the endurance number It is approximately 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.420
 I think that will sell the camera 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:47.479
 I think that you can refer to it by all means here . 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.640
 In I'm a thing of how we look to it is the actual shutter but of two ways 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.640
 There is a way 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.680
 If you can find out for yourself 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.160
 It will use the freeware 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.580
 Now say to 8 photo meet you soft 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 I'm going to winter , this is my biggest brain 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:13.230
 From that point on, the brain has a staff member's law 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:20.700
 It is possible to check for freeware by yourself like a cat 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:27.330
 As this software can not check all models, it can not be checked 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.420
 hey I think it would be better to take it to the service center of each manufacturer 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.420
 I will 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:37.390
 It is how to examine It is in with the photo seen over um 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.390
 I would like to do 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.150
 photo Download from my site 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.110
 You will open Baofi 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:58.210
 Then, such a page is opened on the top screen 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:59.590
 When examined in Hotomi it is left to the one taken with the camera you want to see as a pre-preparation 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.260
 You will receive 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:10.850
 You will need to import the data that you took on the computer . 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.920
 Start from the point where the fetched data is opened in this area 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.630
 Yeah it is because you open the file 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.569
 I will open the imported data 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:25.579
 This is what I previously shot in advance 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:32.510
 Then, the material of this data is displayed here 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:37.930
 I have taken has a shot to the on models that d 70 of Anikon 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.930
 I will scroll this down below 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:49.500
 Then you can see the shutter account here . 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:57.270
 This will be the shuttered state of d 70 I have taken 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:59.470
 Going to the right, there are 385, so this d 70 has released 385 times 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.390
 It will be 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.540
 This is because it is a very small number in 385 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:12.890
 It is that I'll set forth in the exhibition page 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:19.340
 It is likely that the high price will be high 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:24.040
 Like this, if you check with H å¯Œ tomi , you can check immediately by opening the file. 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.040
 I hope you can utilize this 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:35.430
 Oh each service for in those that can not be examined in the Well Photo people and medical Suinho 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.430
 I have you bring it to the center 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:48.630
 For example, it is in terms of the Canon you can from that such repair slip 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:51.790
 a You can print here by checking the number of shutters . 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.590
 That 's why I got it from the manufacturer 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:01.639
 Since the considerable reliability and ask them to extraordinary and sweet 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:08.749
 Ah ah Toka is, for example, expensive Purokki 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:10.249
 You can also with confidence the highest bidder and if it is the these documents to to sell this 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:16.309
 I wish I could 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:21.789
 I think that also made large likely to be expensive and it makes a successful bid by all means large service of this manufacturer 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:21.789
 I hope you can use the center 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.100
 It becomes affection for the Finding of the shutter number of times by say
