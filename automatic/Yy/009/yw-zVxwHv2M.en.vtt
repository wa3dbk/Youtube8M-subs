 It's a very simple portfolio. 

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:10.656
 Can easily be made by hand! Even if you're just a Hao, you can do it without difficulty! Good activity for your children. Confirmed that it is an excellent challenge to learn by. 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.550
 Just a handkerchief and a cloth that meets the needs. 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.430
 First, we create the cloth that we will use to make the wallet and put on it the handkerchief (or tissue box, for example). 

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:26.732
 As shown in the drawing, the size of the cloth should be twice the size of the handkerchief. We leave about 2 cm from each side for sewing and lack of excess. 

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:31.553
 Stitching the edges of the fabric prevents the fabric from rupturing. 

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.366
 Let's start working. 

00:00:34.894 --> 00:00:36.894
 We guide the cloth so that the tissue box is in the middle. Then set it aside. 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 Now we must sew the wallet hole. 

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.908
 Therefore, one end of the cloth must be turned down about 1 cm. Then we cut it straight. 

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.326
 We do the same with the other party. 

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.966
 Then the piece is wrapped in the middle to get two equal halves. 

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:22.784
 We extend each side towards the middle line. 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360
 As we have done before with the edges, we sew about 1 cm from the edge of the wallet. 

00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:40.220
 We do the same with the counterparty. 

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:59.490
 Cut the excess thread. 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.710
 Finally, we turn back the wallet. If you can not, follow my method. 

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.140
 Finished wallet! 

00:02:23.564 --> 00:02:25.560
 Use it to save cloth.
