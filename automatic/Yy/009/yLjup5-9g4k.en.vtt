tinker<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.490> maybe<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.909> won't<00:01:32.970> be

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
tinker with a lot now maybe it won't be

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.789 
tinker with a lot now maybe it won't be
as<00:01:33.299> bad<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.570> mine<00:01:33.869> maybe<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.290> won't<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
as bad as mine maybe you won't have to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
as bad as mine maybe you won't have to
really<00:01:35.369> adjust<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.939> much<00:01:36.119> stuff<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
really adjust so much stuff with a

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.539 
really adjust so much stuff with a
printer<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.200> still<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> comes<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
printer but still when it comes to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.039 
printer but still when it comes to
printing<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> 3d<00:01:39.479> printing<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.840> have

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
printing and 3d printing you have

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
printing and 3d printing you have
different<00:01:40.409> filaments<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.310> those

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
different filaments and with those

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.859 
different filaments and with those
different<00:01:41.850> filaments<00:01:42.240> which<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.479> basically

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
different filaments which are basically

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.600 
different filaments which are basically
the<00:01:43.049> plastic<00:01:43.530> spools<00:01:43.860> you'll<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> printing

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the plastic spools you'll be printing

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630 
the plastic spools you'll be printing
with<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> adjust<00:01:47.250> things<00:01:47.490> like

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
with you have to adjust things like

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.510 
with you have to adjust things like
temperature<00:01:48.470> whether<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.100> heat<00:01:50.340> the

I<00:02:43.020> thought<00:02:43.320> everyone<00:02:43.770> had<00:02:43.800> heard<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.100> 3d

co-worker the other day and showed him

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.070 
co-worker the other day and showed him
slant<00:02:47.160> printed<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.670> they<00:02:47.790> were<00:02:47.850> mind<00:02:48.630> blown<00:02:48.870> I

easy to do like I'm working on my first
project<00:04:22.020> right<00:04:22.140> now<00:04:22.169> which<00:04:22.410> I'll<00:04:22.530> talk<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.740> you

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
project right now which I'll talk to you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.110 
project right now which I'll talk to you
guys<00:04:22.919> at<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.190> later<00:04:23.400> time<00:04:23.490> about

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
guys at a later time about

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.909 
guys at a later time about
which<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.419> actually<00:04:24.930> requiring<00:04:25.260> me<00:04:25.410> to<00:04:25.530> do<00:04:25.650> 3d

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
which is actually requiring me to do 3d

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.890 
which is actually requiring me to do 3d
modeling<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:26.760> up<00:04:26.880> not<00:04:27.449> in<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.660> window

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
modeling I have it up not in this window

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.240 
modeling I have it up not in this window
but<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.260> have<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.680> up<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:28.860> one<00:04:28.979> of<00:04:29.010> my<00:04:29.100> windows

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
but I have it up on one of my windows

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.010 
but I have it up on one of my windows
where<00:04:30.030> I'm<00:04:30.090> actually<00:04:30.240> trying<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> design

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
where I'm actually trying to design

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.330 
where I'm actually trying to design
something<00:04:31.080> that's<00:04:31.560> actually<00:04:31.710> pretty

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
something that's actually pretty

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.860 
something that's actually pretty
difficult<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.910> do<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:33.150> you've<00:04:33.270> got<00:04:33.449> no<00:04:33.600> prior

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
difficult to do if you've got no prior

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.450 
difficult to do if you've got no prior
experience<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.530> maybe<00:04:34.740> if<00:04:35.010> you're<00:04:35.160> thinking

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
experience so maybe if you're thinking

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.250 
experience so maybe if you're thinking
about<00:04:35.520> getting<00:04:36.120> a<00:04:36.300> 3d<00:04:36.540> printer<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.050> do

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
about getting a 3d printer and you do

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.330 
about getting a 3d printer and you do
want<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.530> create<00:04:37.650> your<00:04:37.860> own<00:04:37.889> stuff<00:04:38.130> online

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
want to create your own stuff online

tinker<00:04:39.120> with<00:04:39.270> 3d<00:04:39.570> modeling<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.139> it<00:04:40.229> too<00:04:40.410> just

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
tinker with 3d modeling of it too just

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.840 
tinker with 3d modeling of it too just
to<00:04:40.620> see<00:04:40.830> what<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.130> think<00:04:41.340> about<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.699> how<00:04:41.820> you

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
to see what you think about it how you

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.340 
to see what you think about it how you
like<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.120> whether<00:04:42.419> you<00:04:42.510> can<00:04:42.600> catch<00:04:42.870> on<00:04:43.080> or<00:04:43.229> not

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
like it whether you can catch on or not

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.320 
like it whether you can catch on or not
because<00:04:43.710> again<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.400> is<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.580> whole<00:04:44.940> other

because again that is a whole other

spectrum of software and learning and

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.000 
spectrum of software and learning and
you<00:04:48.300> know<00:04:48.389> like<00:04:48.510> kind<00:04:48.690> of<00:04:48.750> architectural<00:04:49.410> not

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
you know like kind of architectural not

modeling<00:04:51.600> design<00:04:51.900> that<00:04:52.260> definitely<00:04:52.620> requires

simple compared to stuff I might want to
build<00:05:04.320> down<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.620> line<00:05:04.770> so<00:05:05.070> it<00:05:05.729> definitely<00:05:06.360> is

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
build down the line so it definitely is

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.290 
build down the line so it definitely is
a<00:05:06.990> learning<00:05:07.740> experience<00:05:08.130> to<00:05:08.850> say<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.180> least

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300
