00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
away some of the customization that we

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.690 
away some of the customization that we
could<00:02:53.540> have<00:02:53.630> had<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.989> then<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:54.830> reread<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.430> and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
could have had and then I reread it and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.180 
could have had and then I reread it and
it<00:02:56.390> turns<00:02:56.600> out<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:57.170> something<00:02:57.500> I'm<00:02:57.650> for<00:02:57.980> it

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
it turns out it's something I'm for it

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.040 
it turns out it's something I'm for it
means<00:02:58.640> that<00:02:58.790> they're<00:02:58.970> giving<00:02:59.120> less<00:02:59.540> resources
