this guy okay um yeah so it's got and up
and<00:00:18.150> down<00:00:18.270> outside<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.470> inside<00:00:19.590> you

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and down outside and on the inside you

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.570 
and down outside and on the inside you
can<00:00:20.609> control<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.859> at<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> moment<00:00:23.130> we're<00:00:23.430> on

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
can control it so at the moment we're on

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.609 
can control it so at the moment we're on
the<00:00:23.699> bottom<00:00:24.029> floor<00:00:25.070> you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.550> inside<00:00:27.619> you

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the bottom floor you can go inside you

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.889 
the bottom floor you can go inside you
say<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:29.150> it<00:00:30.150> goes<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:31.160> one<00:00:32.160> floor<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
say up it goes up one floor and so you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.680 
say up it goes up one floor and so you
can<00:00:34.079> see<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:34.980> second<00:00:35.280> floor<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
can see now on the second floor and you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.280 
can see now on the second floor and you
can<00:00:36.809> continue<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> go<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.559> down<00:00:39.290> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
can continue to go up and down the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.959 
can continue to go up and down the
reason<00:00:40.500> I'm<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:41.340> double-clicking<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
reason I'm just like double-clicking it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.119 
reason I'm just like double-clicking it
is<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:43.379> don't<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.010> can

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
is because you don't have to you can

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.410 
is because you don't have to you can
just<00:00:44.160> leave<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.300> leave

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
just leave it on but if you just leave

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.490 
just leave it on but if you just leave
it<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:45.750> every<00:00:45.899> time<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.200> before<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
it on then every time you go before you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.150 
it on then every time you go before you
continue<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.809> think<00:00:48.809> maybe<00:00:49.530> might

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
continue to go up I think maybe might

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.290 
continue to go up I think maybe might
actually<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.730> might<00:00:50.850> not<00:00:50.940> work

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
actually that might not work

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.139 
actually that might not work
don't<00:00:51.570> try<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:52.309> but<00:00:53.309> yeah<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:53.760> basically

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
don't try it but yeah and then basically

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.900 
don't try it but yeah and then basically
if<00:00:54.300> you're<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> floor<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.140> on

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
if you're on the floor that it's not on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.099 
if you're on the floor that it's not on
you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.059> tell<00:00:57.210> whether<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.510> above<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.899> or

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you can tell whether it's above you or

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.260 
you can tell whether it's above you or
below<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.340> above<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.789> then

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
below you because if it's above you then

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
below you because if it's above you then
you'll<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.899> pole<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.590> just

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you'll see this pole then you can just

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.399 
you'll see this pole then you can just
tell<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.980> okay<00:01:02.520> go<00:01:02.670> down<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:07.110> go<00:01:07.229> down

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
tell it okay go down and then go down

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.560 
tell it okay go down and then go down
and<00:01:08.869> then<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> floor<00:01:10.409> you're<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
and then it's on the floor you're on and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
and then it's on the floor you're on and
so<00:01:13.010> let's<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.100> what<00:01:14.189> happens<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.939> just

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
so let's see what happens if we just

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.340 
so let's see what happens if we just
leave<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.600> haven't<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:15.990> tried<00:01:16.080> this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
leave this one haven't really tried this

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.359 
leave this one haven't really tried this
might<00:01:16.770> break<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:18.830> yeah<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.130> will<00:01:20.280> just

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
might break it yeah so this will just

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.960 
might break it yeah so this will just
