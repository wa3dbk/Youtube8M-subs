it's<00:00:00.539> been<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:00.690> couple<00:00:00.900> minutes<00:00:01.110> talking<00:00:01.410> about

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
it's been a couple minutes talking about

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.340 
it's been a couple minutes talking about
backgrounds<00:00:02.460> no<00:00:03.240> way<00:00:03.389> little<00:00:03.659> blossoms<00:00:04.230> up

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
backgrounds no way little blossoms up

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.280 
backgrounds no way little blossoms up
just<00:00:04.589> pop<00:00:04.830> up<00:00:04.980> out<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.130> nowhere<00:00:05.509> they<00:00:06.509> they<00:00:07.140> can

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
just pop up out of nowhere they they can

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.629 
just pop up out of nowhere they they can
embroider<00:00:07.529> painting<00:00:07.890> very<00:00:08.010> quickly<00:00:08.340> we've

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
embroider painting very quickly we've

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.310 
embroider painting very quickly we've
also<00:00:08.849> had<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.090> deal<00:00:09.269> with<00:00:09.450> them<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.630> still<00:00:10.110> deal

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
also had to deal with them I still deal

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.060 
also had to deal with them I still deal
with<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.559> myself

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
with it myself

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.249 
with it myself
but<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.580> found<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.910> way<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.090> minimize<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.049> risk

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
but I found a way to minimize the risk

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.049 
but I found a way to minimize the risk
of<00:00:13.380> getting<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.679> background<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.400> that's<00:00:14.849> by

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
of getting a background and that's by

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.330 
of getting a background and that's by
using<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.509> blotter<00:00:15.780> like<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:17.010> just<00:00:17.160> told

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
using a blotter like this it's just told

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.160 
using a blotter like this it's just told
it<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> issue<00:00:17.670> with<00:00:18.449> paper<00:00:18.660> towel<00:00:18.900> wrapped

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
it to issue with paper towel wrapped

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.200 
it to issue with paper towel wrapped
around<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.310> give<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.550> an<00:00:20.609> example<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.090> how

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
around it to give you an example of how

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.849 
around it to give you an example of how
to<00:00:21.270> avoid<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:21.869> I'm<00:00:22.230> gonna<00:00:22.410> take<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.769> bit

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
to avoid one I'm gonna take a little bit

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.460 
to avoid one I'm gonna take a little bit
of<00:00:22.949> color<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.779> put<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:24.990> piece<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> paper

of color and put on this piece of paper

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.920 
of color and put on this piece of paper
this<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.859> 140<00:00:26.430> pound<00:00:26.609> Fabriano<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.660> cold

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
this is 140 pound Fabriano it's cold

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.259 
this is 140 pound Fabriano it's cold
press<00:00:28.310> let's<00:00:29.310> put<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.490> bit<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.730> color<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.090> this

press let's put a bit of color on this

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.620 
press let's put a bit of color on this
for<00:00:30.720> example<00:00:30.929> putting<00:00:31.260> some<00:00:31.470> violets<00:00:32.630> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
for example putting some violets and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.150 
for example putting some violets and
let's<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:33.989> imagine<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.800> piece<00:00:34.860> we've

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
let's just imagine this is a piece we've

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.450 
let's just imagine this is a piece we've
worked<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> painting<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> we've<00:00:38.309> got

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
worked on it's a painting and we've got

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.569 
worked on it's a painting and we've got
this<00:00:38.579> nice<00:00:38.790> under<00:00:39.270> painting<00:00:40.250> whatever<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.489> is

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this nice under painting whatever it is

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
this nice under painting whatever it is
a<00:00:41.610> sky<00:00:41.940> whatever<00:00:42.329> doesn't<00:00:42.809> really<00:00:42.930> matter<00:00:43.140> in

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
a sky whatever doesn't really matter in

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.060 
a sky whatever doesn't really matter in
this<00:00:43.379> case<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> put<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.410> color<00:00:46.829> on

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
this case and when I put that color on

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.529 
this case and when I put that color on
there<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.430> actually<00:00:47.700> sets<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> paper

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
there it actually sets really the paper

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.090 
there it actually sets really the paper
that<00:00:48.809> paint<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.140> little<00:00:49.410> water<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> now

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that paint has a little water in it now

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
that paint has a little water in it now
water<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.430> getting<00:00:50.640> into<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> paper<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
water is getting into the paper so the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.950 
water is getting into the paper so the
paper<00:00:52.379> has<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> nice<00:00:52.949> damp<00:00:53.820> surface<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> also

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
paper has a nice damp surface it also

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.350 
paper has a nice damp surface it also
has<00:00:55.230> dampness<00:00:55.590> inside<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> paper<00:00:56.360> they're

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
has dampness inside the paper they're

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
has dampness inside the paper they're
longer<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.809> water<00:00:58.050> sits<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.590> paper<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
longer that water sits in that paper the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.709 
longer that water sits in that paper the
more<00:00:59.039> soaks<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.730> initially<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.539> just

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
more soaks in initially as you can just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.330 
more soaks in initially as you can just
saturate<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> interior<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.039> piece<00:01:02.219> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
saturate the interior that piece of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.310 
saturate the interior that piece of
paper<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.570> we're<00:01:03.660> working<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.049> painting

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
paper so if we're working on a painting

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
paper so if we're working on a painting
and<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.739> put<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> pretty<00:01:05.280> sky<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.939> this

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
and so we put in a pretty sky in this

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.700 
and so we put in a pretty sky in this
case<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.450> got<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> purple<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> purple

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
case I got a purple then it's a purple

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
case I got a purple then it's a purple
sky<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:09.030> look<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.570> say<00:01:09.659> okay<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
sky and we look at it and say okay I

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.510 
sky and we look at it and say okay I
think<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.170> want<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> cloud<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.369> now

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
think I want to put a cloud on that now

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
think I want to put a cloud on that now
let's<00:01:11.700> put<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.210> pretty<00:01:12.360> pretty<00:01:12.630> pink

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
let's put it this pretty pretty pink

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.890 
let's put it this pretty pretty pink
cloud<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.350> top<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.939> if<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.090> put<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> really

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
cloud on top of that if I put a really

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
cloud on top of that if I put a really
wet<00:01:16.080> brush<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.740> it's<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> run<00:01:17.460> away

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
wet brush on this it's going to run away

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.240 
wet brush on this it's going to run away
it's<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.330> very<00:01:18.600> very<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:20.009> out

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it's going to get very very out of out

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.830 
it's going to get very very out of out
of<00:01:20.280> control<00:01:20.460> almost<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:21.420> runs<00:01:21.630> away<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of control almost he just runs away a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
of control almost he just runs away a
big<00:01:22.170> blossom<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:22.979> call<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> back<00:01:23.430> run

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
big blossom or what they call a back run

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090 
big blossom or what they call a back run
because<00:01:24.509> what's<00:01:24.689> happening<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.710> surface

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because what's happening is the surface

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.190 
because what's happening is the surface
of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> paper<00:01:26.400> may<00:01:26.670> look<00:01:26.820> dry<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:28.049> there's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
of the paper may look dry but there's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
of the paper may look dry but there's
still<00:01:28.350> water<00:01:28.619> inside<00:01:29.210> certainly<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.329> put<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540

on that I want to put a cloud right here

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389 
on that I want to put a cloud right here
as<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.150> put<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> see

instantly how it almost the color that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.770 
instantly how it almost the color that
got<00:01:46.500> very<00:01:46.649> diffused<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.509> starting

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
got very diffused and it's just starting

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.410 
got very diffused and it's just starting
to<00:01:48.899> bleed<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> run<00:01:49.619> away<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:51.000> lost<00:01:51.119> any

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to bleed and run away I really lost any

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.480 
to bleed and run away I really lost any
attempt<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> put<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> cloud<00:01:52.860> at<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.220> point

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
attempt to put a cloud at this point

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.100 
attempt to put a cloud at this point
because<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.939> paper<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.270> way<00:01:54.450> too<00:01:54.509> wet<00:01:54.899> for

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
because the paper is way too wet for

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
like this which is a semi wet and you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.999

have less water in my brush and just to
make<00:02:09.030> sure<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.450> haven't<00:02:09.599> got<00:02:09.780> too<00:02:09.899> much

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
make sure that I haven't got too much

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.300 
make sure that I haven't got too much
water<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.440> brush<00:02:10.649> I'm<00:02:10.860> taking<00:02:11.220> this

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
water in the brush I'm taking this

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.760 
water in the brush I'm taking this
blotter<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.150> I'm<00:02:12.959> hitting<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.319> edge<00:02:13.440> of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
blotter and I'm hitting the edge of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
blotter and I'm hitting the edge of
rush<00:02:13.890> on<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.100> just<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> second<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.960> take

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
rush on that just for a second to take

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.480 
rush on that just for a second to take
all<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.410> excess<00:02:16.740> water<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.130> of<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.250> brush

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
all that excess water out of that brush

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.900 
all that excess water out of that brush
now<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.570> put<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> magenta<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.320> here<00:02:19.910> I've

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
now I can put the magenta on here I've

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.400 
now I can put the magenta on here I've
got<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> nice<00:02:21.330> clean<00:02:21.360> application<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:22.200> color

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
got a nice clean application of color

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.320 
got a nice clean application of color
and<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.310> gonna<00:02:23.490> run<00:02:23.640> away<00:02:23.760> with<00:02:23.880> me<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.270> I

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and it's not gonna run away with me so I

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.460 
and it's not gonna run away with me so I
can<00:02:24.480> go<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.600> there<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:24.870> whatever<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.200> want

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
can go in there and do whatever I want

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.260 
can go in there and do whatever I want
it's<00:02:25.650> doing<00:02:26.070> they<00:02:26.190> get<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> pretty<00:02:26.730> soft<00:02:27.030> edge

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
it's doing they get a pretty soft edge

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.370 
it's doing they get a pretty soft edge
because<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.600> paper<00:02:27.810> still<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> little<00:02:28.230> bit

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
because the paper still a little bit

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.350 
because the paper still a little bit
damp<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.810> control<00:02:31.170> over<00:02:31.410> it

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
damp but I have control over it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.980 
damp but I have control over it
it's<00:02:33.360> liking<00:02:33.630> when<00:02:33.720> they're<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.870> pain

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
it's liking when they're in pain

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.900 
it's liking when they're in pain
whatever<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.320> want<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:35.640> total

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
whatever I want now and I have total

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.580 
whatever I want now and I have total
control<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.390> shape<00:02:36.630> without<00:02:36.990> without<00:02:37.500> it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
control of the shape without without it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.820 
control of the shape without without it
running<00:02:37.830> away<00:02:38.780> these<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:40.020> back<00:02:40.260> runs<00:02:40.590> like

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
running away these little back runs like

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.680 
running away these little back runs like
this<00:02:41.040> will<00:02:41.580> ruin<00:02:41.820> more<00:02:42.150> paintings<00:02:42.570> than

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
this will ruin more paintings than

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.150 
this will ruin more paintings than
anything<00:02:42.840> else<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.740> can<00:02:43.830> be<00:02:43.920> controlled

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
anything else and it can be controlled

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.640 
anything else and it can be controlled
it<00:02:44.430> can<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:44.640> controlled<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.210> easily<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:46.410> she's

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it can be controlled so easily but she's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.230 
it can be controlled so easily but she's
using<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.980> blotter<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.670> case<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.180> a

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
using a blotter in this case it's a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.850 
using a blotter in this case it's a
total<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.690> tissue<00:02:48.930> with<00:02:49.140> paper<00:02:49.320> towel<00:02:49.590> wrapped

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
total of tissue with paper towel wrapped

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.800 
total of tissue with paper towel wrapped
around<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.060> when<00:02:51.150> you're<00:02:51.240> working<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.570> wet

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
around it so when you're working on wet

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.570 
around it so when you're working on wet
shapes<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.440> got<00:02:52.590> wet<00:02:52.770> paper<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.430> you

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
shapes and you got wet paper and you

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.910 
shapes and you got wet paper and you
want<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> put<00:02:53.910> more<00:02:54.120> color<00:02:54.450> on<00:02:54.720> top<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.290> just

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
want to put more color on top of it just

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.860 
want to put more color on top of it just
remember<00:02:56.310> mix<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> color<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.570> little<00:02:57.720> bit

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
remember mix the color up a little bit

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.410 
remember mix the color up a little bit
thicker<00:02:58.110> with<00:02:58.410> less<00:02:58.590> water<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.640> just

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
thicker with less water in it and just

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.540
