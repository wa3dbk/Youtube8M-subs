you<00:03:07.760> should<00:03:07.940> only<00:03:08.060> have<00:03:08.240> two<00:03:08.390> values<00:03:08.600> left

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
you should only have two values left

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.750 
you should only have two values left
this<00:03:09.620> narrows<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.010> down<00:03:10.040> pretty<00:03:10.310> well<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.700> if

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
this narrows it down pretty well and if

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.130 
this narrows it down pretty well and if
you<00:03:10.910> really<00:03:11.209> want<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.660> can<00:03:11.810> narrow<00:03:11.959> down

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
you really want to you can narrow down

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.240 
you really want to you can narrow down
to<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.500> but<00:03:12.530> that's<00:03:12.860> certainly<00:03:13.100> not

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
to one but that's certainly not

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.309 
to one but that's certainly not
necessary<00:03:13.630> so<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.660> want<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.900> highlight<00:03:15.050> both

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
necessary so you want to highlight both

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.350 
necessary so you want to highlight both
of<00:03:15.500> these<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:16.459> can<00:03:16.610> click<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.910> little<00:03:17.150> red

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
of these you can click this little red

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.680 
of these you can click this little red
arrow<00:03:17.570> right<00:03:17.870> here<00:03:18.580> that'll<00:03:19.580> add<00:03:19.760> them<00:03:19.940> down

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
arrow right here that'll add them down

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.460 
arrow right here that'll add them down
into<00:03:20.840> here<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.720> can<00:03:23.720> either<00:03:23.870> change<00:03:24.290> the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
into here and you can either change the

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.560 
into here and you can either change the
value<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:25.100> whatever<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.700> want<00:03:25.880> or<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.510> can

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
value to whatever you want or you can

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.410 
value to whatever you want or you can
just<00:03:26.690> click<00:03:27.530> frozen<00:03:28.160> that<00:03:28.760> means<00:03:28.970> it'll<00:03:29.239> never

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
just click frozen that means it'll never

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.460 
just click frozen that means it'll never
go<00:03:29.690> past<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:32.060> just<00:03:32.900> for<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.110> hell<00:03:33.230> of<00:03:33.350> it

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
go past that so just for the hell of it

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.600 
go past that so just for the hell of it
to<00:03:33.950> change<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.430> released<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.850> 500<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:36.489> mean<00:03:37.489> it's

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
to change it released of 500 I mean it's

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.550 
to change it released of 500 I mean it's
all<00:03:37.700> permanent<00:03:37.970> we<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.270> 500<00:03:38.870> flaps<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.380> my

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
all permanent we have 500 flaps and my

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.720 
all permanent we have 500 flaps and my
glide<00:03:39.830> so<00:03:40.459> I<00:03:40.489> can<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.239> know<00:03:41.390> never<00:03:42.080> run<00:03:42.290> out

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
glide so I can you know never run out

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.550 
glide so I can you know never run out
500<00:03:43.730> kind<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.030> overkill<00:03:44.390> but<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:44.630> really<00:03:44.930> do<00:03:45.440> not

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
500 kind of overkill but I really do not

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.540 
500 kind of overkill but I really do not
care<00:03:45.620> now<00:03:46.160> you<00:03:46.910> can<00:03:47.450> go<00:03:47.600> back<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.810> spore<00:03:48.550> and

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
care now you can go back to spore and

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.070 
care now you can go back to spore and
once<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.850> want<00:03:49.970> Falls<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.810> should<00:03:50.959> have

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
once you want Falls it you should have

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:02.530 
once you want Falls it you should have
