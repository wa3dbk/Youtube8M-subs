you could even if you find one or you
know<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.180> II<00:01:00.420> one<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> each<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.039> plant

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
know one II one of each you just plant

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
know one II one of each you just plant
it<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.300> sure<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.600> look<00:01:03.899> after<00:01:04.110> well

it and make sure you look after well

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.550 
it and make sure you look after well
because<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:07.049> could<00:01:07.229> harvest<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.189> root<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
because you could harvest the root of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.420 
because you could harvest the root of
the<00:01:10.560> watermelon<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.869> pumpkin<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.799> after

the watermelon and the pumpkin and after
the<00:01:14.549> roots<00:01:14.760> sometimes<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.570> drop<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the roots sometimes they drop you to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.840 
the roots sometimes they drop you to
seeds<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.640> three<00:01:18.299> seeds<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.430> it's<00:01:20.430> your<00:01:20.640> luck

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
seeds or three seeds so it's your luck

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.060 
seeds or three seeds so it's your luck
how<00:01:21.270> much<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.600> could<00:01:21.780> collect<00:01:22.020> let<00:01:22.770> me<00:01:22.860> break

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
how much you could collect let me break

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
how much you could collect let me break
one<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.790> I'll<00:01:24.000> break<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> pumpkin

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
one of it now I'll break the pumpkin

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.289 
one of it now I'll break the pumpkin
seed<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.560> could<00:01:25.799> see<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.340> probably<00:01:26.909> drops

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
seed so you could see it probably drops

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.050 
seed so you could see it probably drops
one<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.229> three<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.650> depends<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.909> go

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
one or two or three it depends if I go

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.200 
one or two or three it depends if I go
lucky<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.540> drop<00:01:30.720> me<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.900> -<00:01:32.000> no<00:01:33.000> that's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.940 

I'll<00:01:56.030> break<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:56.480> one<00:01:56.720> we<00:01:57.500> could<00:01:57.650> see<00:01:57.800> that's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
I'll break that one we could see that's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.890 
I'll break that one we could see that's
two<00:01:58.220> oh<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.400> picked<00:01:58.730> up<00:01:58.910> one<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.270> already

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
sometimes you could break one or two and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.240 
sometimes you could break one or two and
after<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.460> start<00:02:13.670> picking<00:02:13.940> up<00:02:14.030> more<00:02:14.270> than<00:02:14.330> one

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250

spaces<00:02:33.230> for<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.580> otherwise<00:02:34.580> they'll<00:02:34.790> be

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
spaces for it otherwise they'll be

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.670 
spaces for it otherwise they'll be
growing<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.300> each<00:02:35.450> other<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.470> how<00:02:36.620> you

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
growing on each other this is how you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.610 
growing on each other this is how you
collect<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.550> pumpkin<00:02:37.970> seeds<00:02:38.209> as<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:39.170> can<00:02:39.380> see

in<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.989> bottom<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.320> my<00:02:42.620> screen<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.850> have<00:02:43.970> one

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
in the bottom of my screen I have one

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.020 
in the bottom of my screen I have one
spare<00:02:45.170> one<00:02:45.380> now<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.250> I<00:02:46.370> break<00:02:46.610> all<00:02:46.880> of

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
spare one now and if I break all of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.670 
spare one now and if I break all of
these<00:02:47.180> I'll<00:02:47.390> probably<00:02:47.570> have<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:47.989> ten<00:02:48.230> spare

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680
