00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.290
 do not start with the shrimp but 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.850
 give it these wonderful flavors 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.739
 the chance to develop 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.500
 rice into lemongrass 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.530

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.700
 sweat a bit that is allowed 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.440
 do not turn brown and these flavors 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.140

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.580
 just transport you over 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.950
 What could it smell like? 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.750
 guess 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.550
 The shrimp are there now as 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.489
 prepare that it sweats the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.290
 shrimp come in so vanessa the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.140
 Career was always the same 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.970
 but briefly swing the topic and climate 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.370
 I've already told you to pan 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.170
 pine looks over to the film 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.000
 pine trees you are looking at here with butt 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.910
 everything was already learned 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.430
 shrimp pure I get sometime 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.680
 I forgot to stand by this 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.200
 bit of salt and pepper on top 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.810
 you do not need more and now the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.810
 ask when is an eternal okay 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.800
 stir once 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.260
 The shrimp is then not at all like many 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.570
 believe if she is pink but she 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.330
 is then yes when it has become firm 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.120
 we call the inter-jersey strip 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.510
 The protein must become firm the channels 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:03.090
 where getting is so important then 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.709

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.980

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.560
