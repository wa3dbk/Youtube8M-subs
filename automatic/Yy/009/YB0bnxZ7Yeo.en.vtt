00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi girls I finally succeed 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.809
 register and I want to do this today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.480
 make up tutorial on this trick 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 tones of a color that I cannot 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 define in fact while I was making the video 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.539
 I thought but how do I explain it then 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.160
 I'll show you practically 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.779
 This is a trick very quickly 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.570
 very very similar if not exactly the same 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.939
 to what I had up in my glee 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.340
 way some of you asked me to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.250
 present it again and so here I am 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 used the slick stirrer 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 this one called storm 578 is 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.989
 I practically tried this one 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 that I'll show you here hoping that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.059
 we understand that color is practically is 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.489
 a black cherry color I don't know what 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.020
 color is really facts I do it 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.480
 to see precisely why I don't know 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.600
 indeed, define it if you have the suggestion 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.370
 please I welcome advice I must 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.739
 tell you that I would have this kind of smokey mi 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.989
 really like it a lot because it's not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.040
 the usual smokey in shades of marrucino 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.040
 of black and so I like it very much 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 very much use these colors a little 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.369
 undefined and to create nuances really 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.990
 particular and almost unique even at times 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.909
 however, mixing more color together 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.400
 a third color is then created which 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.470
 it cannot be defined but that there is 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.320
 very very well or however we like it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.880
 and no girls anywhere i leave you at 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 video I hope you like it come 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.450
 strong kiss you ok let's start right away 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.400
 applying the primer on the whole 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.460
 mobile eyelid over the entire eyelid 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.649
 fixed well just a little bit everywhere and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.820
 then also on the eyelid and on 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.110
 eyelid to a lower part 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 eye 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.530
 ok then i'm going to get this rose from the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 very slick pink slick palestine that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.460
 I have to tell the truth is getting a little closer to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.380
 maybelline color tattoo why 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.390
 really very very bright a lot 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.100
 clear and I put it on the first part 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.100
 of the eyelid 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 in a fairly abundant manner 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.370
 that is, in the sense, I put it very much 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.530
 high then I go over the eyelid 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.990
 mobile and even a little in the light point 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.170
 we say in the middle of the eye then I take 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.670
 this is our protagonist 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.709
 this unknown color that still does not 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.230
 I understood however this black cherry color 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:32.570
 amaranth as they want to call it fight 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.570
 I apply over the rest of the eyelid 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.239
 well well then at the center 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.550
 above all and even a little towards the end 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.950
 then I take pistol which is this gray 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.290
 beautiful on the naked two I like a 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
 sack and above are two colors 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.489
 very different, however, I like them a lot 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.500
 together and then I'm going to apply it 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.100
 at the end of the eye to create some 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.100
 of tail 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:18.290
 ok then I go practically to fade well 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:20.450
 the colors together then I take a pin 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.060
 just a little bit in fact I blow too 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.829
 on the brush to remove excess la 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.840
 I'm going to apply right into the fold 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.189
 outside of the eye to give a little bit 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.049
 more in depth 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.250
 so let's look at the fact then 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.250
 well faded well 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.510
 I take some more of ours 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.459
 protagonist and I'm going to apply 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.209
 practically still a little in the middle 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.969
 of the eyelid so as to give some more 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.269
 more of intensity to this color we say 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.269
 so 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.420
 obviously it faded a little all in 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.870
 so as to make the colors more 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.400
 homogeneous I apply the same color 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.400
 also in the lower rim of the eye 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.349
 then here she comes the pencil 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.870
 of the perverse that is called then 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.460
 perverse and is of the ather bands that it is 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.169
 really great this black pencil 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.599
 I'll talk about it in a favorite video 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.150
 and in any case I apply it in the rhyme 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.610
 lower and then take with a small brush 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.080
 of eyeliner a little bit of color 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.479
 let's say from the pencil and go to 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.699
 apply as and liner in a very manner 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.590
 very thin on the rhyme we say 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.400
 superior in the upper sumer rhyme 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.400
 of the eye here 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.449
 obviously it fades a little with a 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.169
 brush just so as to make the 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.120
 shade 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:23.639
 let's say the pencil is a little bit more 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.860
 nuanced and therefore more natural then I take 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:28.350
 this illuminating of the new that me 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.940
 like a lot I have to say is I apply it or 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.650
 a little bit with a small brush 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.030
 corrector or even if you want with your fingers 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.040
 there are no problems 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.690
 on the light point to go and lighten them 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.240
 to go to lighten the point of use in 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.960
 very natural way and even a little 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.960
 eye center 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.730
 and now mascara is now mascara and 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.730
 I'm applying the love extreme of essence 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.290
 the same illuminant I go to 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.810
 also apply just above the cheekbones 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:14.180
 in the center of the forehead on the nose and on the 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.270
 little heart of the lips so you don't go 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.440
 Well here we are in India anyway 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.540
 I am going to apply it precisely in these 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.260
 important points of the face so as to 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.260
 illuminate them 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.250
 obviously then it all faded well 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.590
 because otherwise we really do end 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.420
 of the Indians and then I go to fade them 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.510
 you can use your fingers the brush that 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.090
 with which you are better and then I was 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.310
 forgetting the cretin 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.720
 I forgot my eyebrows and therefore 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.940
 I'm going to get this morning from the NSA 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.460
 tris and I'm going to do eyebrows then 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.310
 I take from the palette of snow blushes 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.750
 cosmetics this illuminating we say 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.970
 so in powder I go a little bit to 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.170
 fix the illuminant that I put before 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.240
 in cream of the face a little 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.220
 contouring so I'm going to take this 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.350
 earth of essence that it really is 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.600
 fantastic I find myself very well because 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.190
 I really like the color and I go 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.780
 practically doing just a bit of 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.370
 contouring just below the cheekbones then 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.840
 I use this pink lipstick from 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.330
 I will put the number down there 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.920
 in the info box and tap it on 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.510
 lips so as to have a very effect 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.640
 more unnatural if you want you can too 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:34.530
 pass your fingers a bit so you fade it 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.360
 I apply the gloss of the 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.020
 kiko this is the number 18 I like 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.390
 lot 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:43.830
 using a lot and this is the 

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:45.150
 final trick is the one here I hope 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.380
 you enjoyed sending me a kiss 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.400
 very strong and see you at the next 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.400
 hello video
