00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
started it's different you know when all

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.729

of<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.509> sudden<00:02:08.780> you're<00:02:08.899> when<00:02:09.170> you're<00:02:09.290> thrust

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
of a sudden you're when you're thrust

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.319 
of a sudden you're when you're thrust
into<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.070> situation<00:02:10.340> where<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:10.880> got<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.120> be<00:02:11.209> the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
into a situation where you got to be the

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.080 
into a situation where you got to be the
guy<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.660> be<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.870> starter<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.440> they<00:02:13.040> kind<00:02:14.000> of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
guy and be the starter so they kind of

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.520 
guy and be the starter so they kind of
fought<00:02:14.510> through<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.959> they<00:02:15.170> fought<00:02:15.350> through

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
fought through that they fought through

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.890 
fought through that they fought through
some<00:02:15.680> adversity<00:02:16.010> last<00:02:16.700> year<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.090> now<00:02:17.690> they're

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
some adversity last year and now they're

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.410 
some adversity last year and now they're
going<00:02:18.080> into<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> year<00:02:18.800> where

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
going into a year where

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.210 
going into a year where
you<00:02:19.480> know<00:02:19.599> they've<00:02:20.260> already<00:02:20.470> started<00:02:20.770> X

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
you know they've already started X

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.610 
you know they've already started X
amount<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.580> games<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.690> think<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> pressure

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
amount of games and I think the pressure

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.229 
amount of games and I think the pressure
of<00:02:23.830> being<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.099> first-year<00:02:24.370> starter<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:25.030> off

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
of being a first-year starter is off

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.510 
of being a first-year starter is off
them<00:02:25.510> now<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.099> have<00:02:27.220> some<00:02:27.370> young

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
them now so and then we have some young

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.160 
them now so and then we have some young
guys<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:28.060> got<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.450> know<00:02:28.540> Devon<00:02:28.810> Kennard

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
you have to have instincts and when I

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.910 
you have to have instincts and when I
say<00:04:00.910> instincts<00:04:01.570> that's<00:04:01.750> that's<00:04:02.109> feel<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
say instincts that's that's feel the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.490 
say instincts that's that's feel the
game<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.609> know<00:04:03.840> guys<00:04:04.840> got<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.170> be<00:04:05.260> able<00:04:05.350> to

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
game you know guys got to be able to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.199 
game you know guys got to be able to
decipher<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:06.040> run<00:04:06.310> play<00:04:06.549> before<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.000> ball<00:04:07.180> is

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
decipher a run play before the ball is

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.420 
decipher a run play before the ball is
even<00:04:07.390> snapped<00:04:07.810> he's<00:04:08.769> got<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.040> be<00:04:09.160> able<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.370> have

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
even snapped he's got to be able to have

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.099 
even snapped he's got to be able to have
enough<00:04:09.730> savvy<00:04:10.000> enough<00:04:10.390> since<00:04:10.690> when<00:04:10.870> there's<00:04:11.049> a

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
enough savvy enough since when there's a

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.140 
enough savvy enough since when there's a
play-action<00:04:11.530> pass<00:04:11.859> he's<00:04:12.489> not<00:04:12.670> getting<00:04:12.910> sucked

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
play-action pass he's not getting sucked

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.670 
play-action pass he's not getting sucked
up<00:04:13.329> on<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.569> run<00:04:13.720> he's<00:04:13.870> getting<00:04:14.019> out<00:04:14.230> into<00:04:14.440> pass

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
up on the run he's getting out into pass

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.740 
up on the run he's getting out into pass
coverage<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.430> think<00:04:16.060> those<00:04:16.359> are<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.600> two

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
coverage so I think those are the two

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.120 
coverage so I think those are the two
biggest<00:04:17.019> things<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.530> look<00:04:17.769> for<00:04:17.799> is

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
biggest things that I look for is

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.879 
biggest things that I look for is
toughness<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.850> instincts<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.739> then

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
toughness and instincts and then

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.230 
toughness and instincts and then
probably<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.340> third<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.729> final<00:04:21.850> thing<00:04:22.210> is

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
probably the third and final thing is

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.510 
probably the third and final thing is
that<00:04:22.479> in<00:04:22.630> our<00:04:23.080> defense<00:04:23.320> we<00:04:23.590> like<00:04:23.830> speed<00:04:24.130> you

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
know we like guys to be able to run the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.860

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
ball so if you have those three things

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.089 
ball so if you have those three things
if<00:04:29.140> you<00:04:29.260> have<00:04:29.349> toughness<00:04:29.770> if<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.010> have
