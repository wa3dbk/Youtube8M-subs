different types of batteries affect your
airsoft<00:00:32.300> gun<00:00:32.860> now<00:00:33.860> I've<00:00:34.070> been<00:00:34.280> hearing<00:00:34.579> all

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
airsoft gun now I've been hearing all

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.549 
airsoft gun now I've been hearing all
this<00:00:34.820> crap<00:00:35.149> about<00:00:35.600> how<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:35.899> higher<00:00:36.350> voltage

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
this crap about how a higher voltage

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.240 
this crap about how a higher voltage
battery<00:00:37.129> increases<00:00:37.670> your<00:00:37.820> FPS<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.449> rof<00:00:39.320> that

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
battery increases your FPS and rof that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.439 
battery increases your FPS and rof that
is<00:00:40.400> absolutely<00:00:41.329> not<00:00:41.629> true<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:44.000> voltage

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
is absolutely not true the the voltage

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.329 
is absolutely not true the the voltage
only<00:00:44.629> affects<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.290> rate<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.559> fire<00:00:45.860> at<00:00:46.100> which

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
only affects the rate of fire at which

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.899 
only affects the rate of fire at which
your<00:00:46.519> gun<00:00:46.670> fires<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:48.680> voltage<00:00:49.100> in<00:00:49.280> no<00:00:49.640> way

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
your gun fires the voltage in no way

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.200 
your gun fires the voltage in no way
affects<00:00:50.899> your<00:00:51.110> FPS<00:00:51.230> a<00:00:51.909> different<00:00:52.909> battery

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
affects your FPS a different battery

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.390 
affects your FPS a different battery
does<00:00:53.570> not<00:00:53.720> affect<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:54.290> FPS<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:54.890> your<00:00:55.010> gun<00:00:55.189> the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
does not affect the FPS of your gun the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
FPS of your gun is determined by what

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.590 
FPS of your gun is determined by what
spring<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.729> have<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.000> and<00:00:59.150> that<00:00:59.269> spring

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
spring you have it and that spring

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.289 
spring you have it and that spring
maintains<00:01:00.260> a<00:01:00.439> constant<00:01:00.650> no<00:01:01.640> matter<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.150> have

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
going to stay the same fps the RO F is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.420 
going to stay the same fps the RO F is
different<00:01:14.450> though<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.170> RO<00:01:15.350> F<00:01:15.619> or<00:01:15.860> rate<00:01:16.280> of

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.480 
different though the RO F or rate of
fire<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.880> how<00:01:17.479> fast<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:18.710> can<00:01:18.860> shoot<00:01:19.040> bb's<00:01:19.369> out

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
fire is how fast you can shoot bb's out

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.850 
fire is how fast you can shoot bb's out
of<00:01:19.579> your<00:01:19.700> gun<00:01:19.820> for<00:01:20.240> how<00:01:20.329> fast<00:01:20.570> your<00:01:20.960> AEG<00:01:21.140> cycles

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
of your gun for how fast your AEG cycles

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.470 
of your gun for how fast your AEG cycles
now<00:01:22.790> this<00:01:23.150> is<00:01:23.420> affected<00:01:24.049> by<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.790> voltage<00:01:25.790> so

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
now this is affected by the voltage so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.880 
now this is affected by the voltage so

being<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.519> lot<00:02:28.670> longer<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.120> thicker<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:30.470> is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
being a lot longer and thicker this is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.190 
being a lot longer and thicker this is
this<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.340> seven<00:02:31.880> cell<00:02:32.060> battery<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.170> a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
this is a seven cell battery this is a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.059 
this is a seven cell battery this is a
3-cell<00:02:33.650> battery

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
3-cell battery

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.009 
3-cell battery
this<00:02:35.249> like<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.700> said<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.090> an<00:02:36.209> 11-point<00:02:36.569> 1<00:02:36.810> volt

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
this like I said is an 11-point 1 volt

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.229 
this like I said is an 11-point 1 volt
battery<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.099> one<00:02:38.340> will<00:02:38.609> shoot<00:02:38.819> much

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
battery so this one will shoot much

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.259 
battery so this one will shoot much
faster<00:02:39.719> than<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.959> 8.4<00:02:40.469> volt<00:02:40.829> battery<00:02:41.209> why<00:02:42.209> is

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
faster than the 8.4 volt battery why is

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.119 
faster than the 8.4 volt battery why is
that<00:02:42.389> you<00:02:42.689> may<00:02:42.840> ask<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.530> one<00:02:43.739> has<00:02:43.889> seven

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
that you may ask this one has seven

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.209 
that you may ask this one has seven
cells<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.639> this<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:44.909> only<00:02:45.030> has<00:02:45.269> three

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:46.219 
cells and this one only has three

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.129 
cells and this one only has three
wellyou<00:02:47.219> airsofters<00:02:47.879> that's<00:02:48.540> because<00:02:48.900> this

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
wellyou airsofters that's because this

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.410 
wellyou airsofters that's because this
is<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.379> lithium<00:02:49.709> polymer<00:02:49.950> battery<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.239> lift

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
is a lithium polymer battery the lift

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.910 
is a lithium polymer battery the lift
your<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.870> lithium<00:02:52.230> polymer<00:02:52.379> battery

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
your the lithium polymer battery

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.039 
your the lithium polymer battery
discharges<00:02:53.760> its<00:02:54.060> electricity<00:02:54.420> at<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> lot

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
discharges its electricity at a lot

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.160 
discharges its electricity at a lot
faster<00:02:55.500> rate<00:02:55.680> than<00:02:56.250> these<00:02:56.790> other<00:02:57.780> kinds<00:02:58.139> of

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
faster rate than these other kinds of

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.720 
faster rate than these other kinds of
batteries<00:02:58.319> I'm<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.159> sure<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.609> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
batteries I'm not sure if this is a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.879 
batteries I'm not sure if this is a
nickel<00:02:59.969> metal<00:03:00.150> hydride<00:03:00.299> or<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:01.139> ikat<00:03:01.590> or<00:03:01.620> what

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
nickel metal hydride or an ikat or what

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.530 
nickel metal hydride or an ikat or what
I'm<00:03:02.760> pretty<00:03:02.939> sure<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.239> nickel<00:03:03.480> metal

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
I'm pretty sure it's nickel metal

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.599 
I'm pretty sure it's nickel metal
hydride<00:03:03.689> but<00:03:04.499> so<00:03:04.650> yeah<00:03:04.769> this<00:03:04.919> one<00:03:05.069> discharges

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
hydride but so yeah this one discharges

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.909 
hydride but so yeah this one discharges
it's<00:03:05.819> like<00:03:05.999> electricity<00:03:06.419> very<00:03:07.109> quickly<00:03:07.560> and

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
it's like electricity very quickly and

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.309 
it's like electricity very quickly and
that<00:03:08.239> goes<00:03:09.239> with<00:03:09.450> these<00:03:09.599> other<00:03:09.810> two<00:03:09.900> batteries

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
that goes with these other two batteries

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.369 
that goes with these other two batteries
as<00:03:10.439> well<00:03:11.389> this<00:03:12.389> is<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> nine<00:03:12.780> point<00:03:12.959> six<00:03:13.139> volt

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
as well this is a nine point six volt

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.530 
as well this is a nine point six volt
battery<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.459> one<00:03:14.669> still<00:03:15.209> shoots

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
battery and so this one still shoots

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.179 
battery and so this one still shoots
faster<00:03:16.079> than<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.349> one<00:03:16.560> even<00:03:16.739> though<00:03:17.040> this

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
faster than this one even though this

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.819 
faster than this one even though this
one's<00:03:17.430> also<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.849> seven<00:03:18.299> cell<00:03:18.510> oh<00:03:18.719> no<00:03:19.500> this<00:03:19.620> one's

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
one's also a seven cell oh no this one's

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.909 
one's also a seven cell oh no this one's
an<00:03:19.949> eight<00:03:20.189> cell<00:03:20.459> actually<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.930> this<00:03:22.079> one<00:03:22.319> still

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
an eight cell actually so this one still

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.990 
an eight cell actually so this one still
shoots<00:03:23.250> faster<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.169> this<00:03:25.169> one<00:03:25.439> is<00:03:25.680> only<00:03:26.250> 7.2

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
shoots faster and this one is only 7.2

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.080 
shoots faster and this one is only 7.2
volt<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.620> slowest<00:03:29.129> shooting<00:03:29.609> of<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:29.909> of

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
volt and the slowest shooting of all of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.229 
volt and the slowest shooting of all of
them<00:03:30.269> are<00:03:30.480> Oh<00:03:30.540> F<00:03:31.079> wise<00:03:31.349> anyway<00:03:31.879> now<00:03:32.879> let's<00:03:33.090> go

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
them are Oh F wise anyway now let's go

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.509 
them are Oh F wise anyway now let's go
ahead<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.750> arrange<00:03:34.230> these<00:03:34.469> in<00:03:34.769> order<00:03:35.400> from

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
ahead and arrange these in order from

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.740 
ahead and arrange these in order from
fastest<00:03:36.000> rof<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:38.609> slowest<00:03:39.090> rof<00:03:41.449> that's<00:03:42.449> right

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
fastest rof to slowest rof that's right

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.740 
fastest rof to slowest rof that's right
just<00:03:43.169> like<00:03:43.349> magic<00:03:44.090> these<00:03:45.090> are<00:03:45.269> arranged<00:03:45.659> from

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
just like magic these are arranged from

this<00:04:25.710> one<00:04:26.009> is<00:04:26.430> an<00:04:26.610> 11<00:04:26.909> point<00:04:27.060> one<00:04:27.300> volt<00:04:27.570> you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
this one is an 11 point one volt you

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.820 
this one is an 11 point one volt you
probably<00:04:27.930> can't<00:04:28.110> see<00:04:28.259> that<00:04:28.289> because<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.650> have<00:04:28.740> a

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
probably can't see that because I have a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.980 
probably can't see that because I have a
crappy<00:04:29.070> camera<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.969> is<00:04:30.030> 11<00:04:30.330> point<00:04:30.630> 1<00:04:30.780> volt

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.140 
crappy camera this is 11 point 1 volt
battery<00:04:31.289> this<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:31.979> also<00:04:32.159> a<00:04:32.280> lipo<00:04:32.639> battery<00:04:32.969> so

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
battery this is also a lipo battery so

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.240 
battery this is also a lipo battery so
it<00:04:33.240> discharges<00:04:33.690> faster<00:04:34.139> than<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.320> normal<00:04:34.650> 11.1

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
it discharges faster than a normal 11.1

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.060 
it discharges faster than a normal 11.1
volt<00:04:35.580> NiCad<00:04:36.120> battery<00:04:36.449> so<00:04:37.440> 11.1<00:04:38.009> volt<00:04:38.630> 9.6<00:04:39.630> volt

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
volt NiCad battery so 11.1 volt 9.6 volt

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.409 
volt NiCad battery so 11.1 volt 9.6 volt
8.4<00:04:41.070> volt<00:04:41.280> 7.2<00:04:42.120> volt<00:04:43.159> so<00:04:44.159> that's<00:04:44.550> how<00:04:44.729> that's

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
8.4 volt 7.2 volt so that's how that's

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.920 
8.4 volt 7.2 volt so that's how that's
an<00:04:45.690> order<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.289> fastest<00:04:47.010> rof<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:48.120> slow<00:04:48.389> it

an order of fastest rof to slow it

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.770 
an order of fastest rof to slow it
now<00:04:49.920> let's<00:04:50.160> put<00:04:50.310> him<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:50.520> order<00:04:50.700> from<00:04:51.330> longest

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
now let's put him in order from longest

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.570 
now let's put him in order from longest
lasting<00:04:51.990> battery<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.890> shortest<00:04:53.250> lasting

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580
