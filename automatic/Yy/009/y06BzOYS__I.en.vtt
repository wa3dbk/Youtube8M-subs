00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
shedding with it from the initial run

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.179 
shedding with it from the initial run
through<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.269> bundle<00:03:09.870> itself<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:10.560> very<00:03:10.620> thick

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
through the bundle itself is very thick

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.220 
through the bundle itself is very thick
I<00:03:11.370> do<00:03:11.489> know<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.760> with<00:03:12.090> every<00:03:12.120> bundle<00:03:12.659> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
I do know that with every bundle the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.349 
I do know that with every bundle the
longer<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.280> thinner<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.939> bundle

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
longer you get the thinner the bundle

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.020 
longer you get the thinner the bundle
will<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.629> but<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.049> have<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.470> say<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:16.799> with<00:03:17.699> this

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
will be but I have to say that with this

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.719 
will be but I have to say that with this
hair<00:03:18.389> line<00:03:18.629> even<00:03:19.260> though<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.799> 20<00:03:20.099> inch<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.549> the

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
hair line even though the 20 inch is the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.969 
hair line even though the 20 inch is the
longest<00:03:21.120> inch<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.900> bundle<00:03:22.229> itself<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.739> still

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
longest inch the bundle itself is still

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.770 
longest inch the bundle itself is still
thick<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:23.430> do<00:03:23.519> feel<00:03:23.819> like<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.030> 20<00:03:24.329> inch<00:03:24.479> has

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
thick I do feel like the 20 inch has

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.479 
thick I do feel like the 20 inch has
enough<00:03:25.169> hair<00:03:25.409> on<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.829> make<00:03:25.979> it<00:03:26.040> worth<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
enough hair on it to make it worth the

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.849 
enough hair on it to make it worth the
price<00:03:26.699> because<00:03:27.479> of<00:03:27.629> the<00:03:27.750> fact<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.169> it<00:03:28.439> is<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
price because of the fact that it is a

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.619 
price because of the fact that it is a
thicker<00:03:29.129> bundle<00:03:29.609> now<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> stick<00:03:30.540> at

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
thicker bundle now it's not a stick at

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.229 
thicker bundle now it's not a stick at
the<00:03:30.780> 14-inch<00:03:31.409> but<00:03:31.889> as<00:03:32.099> you're<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.519> from<00:03:32.729> 14

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
the 14-inch but as you're going from 14

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.140 
the 14-inch but as you're going from 14
to<00:03:33.269> 16<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.109> 18<00:03:34.439> to<00:03:34.500> 20<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.310> bundle<00:03:35.699> itself<00:03:36.030> it

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
to 16 to 18 to 20 the bundle itself it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.699 
to 16 to 18 to 20 the bundle itself it
does<00:03:36.299> get<00:03:36.449> smaller<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.079> it's<00:03:37.260> still<00:03:37.409> a<00:03:37.470> thick

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
does get smaller but it's still a thick

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.110 
does get smaller but it's still a thick
amount<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.430> are<00:03:38.549> if<00:03:38.729> you<00:03:38.879> feel<00:03:39.090> like

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
closure and the fact that I feel like I

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.350 
closure and the fact that I feel like I
can<00:04:51.570> do<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.350> part<00:04:52.889> any<00:04:53.070> anywhere<00:04:53.850> within<00:04:54.180> the

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360

closure<00:04:54.690> makes<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.290> very<00:04:55.500> exciting<00:04:56.280> and

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
closure makes it very exciting and

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.580 
closure makes it very exciting and
whatever<00:04:57.120> my<00:04:57.330> girl<00:04:57.600> decides<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.139> put<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.470> i

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
whatever my girl decides to put it i

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.040 
whatever my girl decides to put it i
will<00:04:58.800> add<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.160> concealer<00:04:59.639> on<00:04:59.880> that<00:05:00.389> part<00:05:00.690> area
