electromechanical<00:00:12.870> snake<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.009> is

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
electromechanical snake so this is

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.960 
electromechanical snake so this is
titanoboa<00:00:14.630> it<00:00:15.630> has<00:00:16.190> 20<00:00:17.190> custom<00:00:17.670> welded

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
cylinders while working in tandem as

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.360 
cylinders while working in tandem as
muscle<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> muscles<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.880> snake

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
muscle the muscles of a snake

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.220 
muscle the muscles of a snake
providing<00:00:26.150> that<00:00:26.240> repulsive<00:00:27.050> repulsive

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
providing that repulsive repulsive

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.570 
providing that repulsive repulsive
and<00:00:29.350> the<00:00:29.529> slithering<00:00:29.890> motion<00:00:30.160> back<00:00:30.279> aboard

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
and the slithering motion back aboard

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.240 
and the slithering motion back aboard
right<00:00:31.090> so

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
right so

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.540 
right so
basically<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.300> snake<00:00:34.570> is<00:00:34.750> controlled<00:00:35.550> each

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
basically the snake is controlled each

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.640 
basically the snake is controlled each
of<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:36.760> cylinders<00:00:37.180> have<00:00:37.780> kind<00:00:38.350> of<00:00:38.410> like<00:00:38.620> a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
of the cylinders have kind of like a

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.299 
of the cylinders have kind of like a
closed<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:39.400> control<00:00:40.260> that's<00:00:41.260> run<00:00:42.010> by<00:00:42.040> an

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
closed and control that's run by an

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.170 
closed and control that's run by an
Arduino<00:00:42.760> microcontroller<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.940> kind<00:00:46.120> of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
Arduino microcontroller and it's kind of

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.330 
Arduino microcontroller and it's kind of
time<00:00:46.420> in<00:00:46.690> pockets<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.380> five<00:00:47.650> vertebrae<00:00:48.160> at<00:00:48.250> a

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
time in pockets of five vertebrae at a

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.549 
time in pockets of five vertebrae at a
time<00:00:48.370> so<00:00:48.910> each<00:00:49.120> library<00:00:49.360> has<00:00:49.960> its<00:00:50.110> own<00:00:50.230> brain

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
time so each library has its own brain

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.299 
time so each library has its own brain
and<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.940> all<00:00:52.120> those<00:00:52.239> little<00:00:52.629> brains

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
and the all those little brains

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.740 
and the all those little brains
coordinate<00:00:54.309> together<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.879> provide<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.180> role

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
coordinate together to provide that role

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.939 
coordinate together to provide that role
during<00:00:56.440> motion<00:00:56.680> and<00:00:57.250> it<00:00:57.910> can<00:00:58.059> go<00:00:58.239> side<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.720> side

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
during motion and it can go side to side

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.890 
during motion and it can go side to side
yeah<00:00:59.949> so<00:01:00.220> if<00:01:00.340> you<00:01:00.430> go<00:01:00.580> so<00:01:00.790> I<00:01:00.820> decide<00:01:01.239> now<00:01:01.540> and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
yeah so if you go so I decide now and

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900 
yeah so if you go so I decide now and
we're<00:01:02.830> just<00:01:03.010> starting<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.309> implement<00:01:03.489> these

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
we're just starting to implement these

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.090 
we're just starting to implement these
vertical<00:01:04.510> cylinders<00:01:04.930> on<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.140> bottom<00:01:05.470> which

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
vertical cylinders on the bottom which

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.710 
vertical cylinders on the bottom which
will<00:01:06.280> give<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.550> capability<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.149> doing<00:01:07.330> 3d

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
will give it the capability of doing 3d

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.660 
will give it the capability of doing 3d
motion<00:01:08.020> so<00:01:08.350> like<00:01:08.560> it'll<00:01:09.310> be<00:01:09.399> able<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.580> do<00:01:09.640> a

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
motion so like it'll be able to do a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.320 
motion so like it'll be able to do a
sideline<00:01:10.149> each<00:01:10.300> kind<00:01:10.479> of<00:01:10.600> course<00:01:10.869> sir

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
sideline each kind of course sir

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.150 
sideline each kind of course sir
that<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.050> help<00:01:13.170> us<00:01:13.260> out<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:13.950> we're

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
that will help us out a lot when we're

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.410 
that will help us out a lot when we're
in<00:01:14.310> rough<00:01:14.940> terrain<00:01:14.970> sandy's<00:01:15.840> rain<00:01:16.050> on<00:01:16.530> grass

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
in rough terrain sandy's rain on grass

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.820 
in rough terrain sandy's rain on grass
so<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.990> originally<00:01:19.290> brought<00:01:19.710> out

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so now this was originally brought out

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.160 
so now this was originally brought out
to<00:01:19.920> Barney<00:01:20.160> ma'am<00:01:20.310> yeah<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.510> was<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.660> it<00:01:22.140> was

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to Barney ma'am yeah so it was a it was

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.950 
to Barney ma'am yeah so it was a it was
a<00:01:22.260> funded<00:01:22.650> project<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.130> 2011<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.750> barely

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
a funded project in 2011 we just barely

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300 
a funded project in 2011 we just barely
got<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.380> done<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:26.010> had<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.160> lot<00:01:26.280> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
got it done and we had a lot of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.600 
got it done and we had a lot of
technical<00:01:26.580> as<00:01:26.820> she<00:01:26.910> was<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> playa<00:01:27.480> so

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
technical as she was on the playa so

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.710 
technical as she was on the playa so
since<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.790> we've<00:01:29.940> been<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> innovating

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
since then we've been kind of innovating

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.530 
since then we've been kind of innovating
and<00:01:31.220> improving<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> by<00:01:32.640> adding<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.180> belly

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and improving it by adding like belly

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
and improving it by adding like belly
scales<00:01:33.870> a<00:01:34.110> variety<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> other<00:01:34.860> features<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
scales a variety of other features to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.400 
scales a variety of other features to
enable<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> work<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.630> playa<00:01:36.840> better

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
enable it to work on the playa better

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.170 
enable it to work on the playa better
the<00:01:37.650> next<00:01:37.680> time<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.370> hopefully<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.060> year

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the next time so hopefully this year

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
the next time so hopefully this year
we're<00:01:39.330> going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.510> take<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.690> back<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:39.990> there

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
we're going to take it back down there

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
we're going to take it back down there
and<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:41.130> walk<00:01:41.340> around<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.730> desert<00:01:41.850> all

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and just walk around in the desert all

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.020 
and just walk around in the desert all
over<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.480> place<00:01:42.630> now<00:01:42.990> why<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.560> CES

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
over the place now why is it the CES

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.390 
over the place now why is it the CES
it's<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.150> CES<00:01:45.479> because<00:01:45.750> we're<00:01:46.410> here<00:01:46.590> lenovo

project like it's all volunteer based
labor<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.910> rely<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.190> grants<00:01:56.190> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
labor and we rely on kind of grants and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
labor and we rely on kind of grants and
sponsorships<00:01:56.970> from<00:01:57.090> companies<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.540> Lenovo

sponsorships from companies like Lenovo

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.630 
sponsorships from companies like Lenovo
they've<00:01:58.650> given<00:01:58.770> us<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.040> bunch<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.280> computer

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
they've given us a bunch of computer

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.780 
they've given us a bunch of computer
gear<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.200> do<00:02:01.200> our<00:02:01.350> solid<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:02.160> solid<00:02:02.580> first

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
gear to do our solid like solid first

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.390 
gear to do our solid like solid first
design<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.570> our<00:02:04.050> computer<00:02:04.800> coding<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.280> stuff

design and our computer coding and stuff

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.570 
design and our computer coding and stuff
like<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> we're<00:02:07.470> showcasing<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
like that and so we're showcasing and a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.120 
like that and so we're showcasing and a
type<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:08.910> project

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.000 

and<00:02:16.130> what's<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.490> relationship<00:02:17.800> maybe<00:02:18.800> from<00:02:18.950> a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
and what's the relationship maybe from a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.589 
and what's the relationship maybe from a
technical<00:02:19.280> perspective<00:02:19.430> between<00:02:20.060> between

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
technical perspective between between

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.890 
technical perspective between between
this<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.590> mondo<00:02:21.830> spider<00:02:22.450> okay<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.510> yeah

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
this and the mondo spider okay so yeah

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.620 
this and the mondo spider okay so yeah
mondo<00:02:24.290> spider<00:02:24.410> was<00:02:24.620> built<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.550> 2006<00:02:26.209> there<00:02:26.540> was

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
mondo spider was built in 2006 there was

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.650 
mondo spider was built in 2006 there was
part<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.930> team<00:02:26.959> about<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.660> it's

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
part of the team about that and it's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.520 
part of the team about that and it's
largely<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.410> mechanic<00:02:31.010> strictly<00:02:31.760> mechanical

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
largely a mechanic strictly mechanical

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.990 
largely a mechanic strictly mechanical
just<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.620> battery<00:02:34.280> electric<00:02:34.520> system<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:34.910> be

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
just a battery electric system to be

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.300 
just a battery electric system to be
added<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.390> then<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.650> project<00:02:37.069> and<00:02:37.250> I

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
added and then so this project and I

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.680 
added and then so this project and I
kind<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.640> was<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.630> next<00:02:38.690> evolution<00:02:38.989> of<00:02:39.680> the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
kind of was the next evolution of the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.970 
kind of was the next evolution of the
foundation<00:02:41.690> called<00:02:42.140> yard<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.709> kind<00:02:42.950> of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
foundation called yard that kind of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.940 
foundation called yard that kind of
umbrella<00:02:43.370> organization<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.650> I<00:02:45.680> had<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
umbrella organization and so I had the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.500 
umbrella organization and so I had the
idea<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.250> do<00:02:46.430> this<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.880> then<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.090> brought<00:02:47.269> on

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
idea to do this and then I brought on

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.180 
idea to do this and then I brought on
board<00:02:47.930> all<00:02:48.200> these<00:02:48.350> other<00:02:48.500> people<00:02:48.560> sign<00:02:49.160> up

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
board all these other people sign up

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.370 
board all these other people sign up
mechanical<00:02:49.519> guy<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.030> need<00:02:50.180> guys<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:50.989> James

and Julian here is it like to help me do

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.900 
and Julian here is it like to help me do
the<00:02:54.799> computer<00:02:55.040> coding<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.700> all<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
the computer coding and all the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.180 
the computer coding and all the
electronics<00:02:56.890> like<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> really

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
electronics like a really

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.220 
electronics like a really
multidisciplinary<00:02:58.790> project<00:02:59.569> involves

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
multidisciplinary project involves

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.690 
multidisciplinary project involves
pretty<00:03:00.440> much<00:03:00.530> every<00:03:00.799> aspect<00:03:01.220> of<00:03:01.280> engineering

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
pretty much every aspect of engineering

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.770 
pretty much every aspect of engineering
you<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.970> think<00:03:02.239> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you can think of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.340 
you can think of
and<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:05.600> what<00:03:06.600> will<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.900> doing<00:03:06.990> with<00:03:07.230> it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
and so what will you be doing with it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.230 
and so what will you be doing with it
here<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.590> say<00:03:07.709> yes<00:03:07.880> we're<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> be

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
here is say yes we're just going to be

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.670 
here is say yes we're just going to be
kind<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.540> slow<00:03:09.720> vinter<00:03:09.900> slithering<00:03:10.530> around

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
kind of slow vinter slithering around

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.000 
kind of slow vinter slithering around
the<00:03:11.100> outside<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.520> little<00:03:11.790> boat<00:03:11.940> n<00:03:12.120> will<00:03:12.900> be

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
the outside of the little boat n will be

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.620 
the outside of the little boat n will be
trying<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.040> use<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:14.640> these<00:03:14.970> new<00:03:15.120> tablets<00:03:15.510> we

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
trying to use this these new tablets we

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.600 
trying to use this these new tablets we
got<00:03:15.780> from<00:03:15.990> Lenovo<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.560> we've<00:03:17.190> written<00:03:17.370> this

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
got from Lenovo and we've written this

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.970 
got from Lenovo and we've written this
Android<00:03:18.270> app<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.600> try<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:18.959> get<00:03:19.290> Diagnostics

Android app to try and get Diagnostics
from<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> snake<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.610> as<00:03:20.790> we're<00:03:21.030> showing<00:03:21.720> this

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
from the snake so as we're showing this

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.910 
from the snake so as we're showing this
thing<00:03:22.200> off<00:03:22.350> we're<00:03:22.560> going<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.800> learning

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
thing off we're going to be learning

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.320 
thing off we're going to be learning
more<00:03:23.310> about<00:03:23.450> how<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:25.040> parameters<00:03:26.330> involved

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
more about how the parameters involved

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.090 
more about how the parameters involved
in<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> snake<00:03:27.900> like<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> voltages<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
in the snake like the voltages and the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.850 
in the snake like the voltages and the
current<00:03:29.850> draw<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.450> stuff<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:31.020> that<00:03:31.110> behave

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
current draw and stuff like that behave

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.820 
current draw and stuff like that behave
while<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:32.489> slithering<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.590> it's<00:03:34.590> kind<00:03:34.800> of

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
while it's slithering so it's kind of

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.070 
while it's slithering so it's kind of
like<00:03:34.950> we're<00:03:35.100> almost<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:36.450> learning<00:03:36.690> about<00:03:36.840> it

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
like we're almost like learning about it

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.870 
like we're almost like learning about it
and<00:03:37.260> developing<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.769> as<00:03:37.980> we're<00:03:38.190> showing<00:03:38.670> it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
and developing it as we're showing it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.210 
and developing it as we're showing it
off<00:03:39.000> yeah<00:03:39.630> cool<00:03:40.050> thanks<00:03:40.530> very<00:03:40.680> much<00:03:40.709> yeah<00:03:41.040> no
