00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.969 
similar to mono blue since I do have a
decent<00:04:50.210> bit<00:04:50.509> of<00:04:50.660> greedy<00:04:50.930> mana<00:04:51.229> costs<00:04:51.770> in<00:04:51.889> the

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
decent bit of greedy mana costs in the

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.100 
decent bit of greedy mana costs in the
deck<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.430> thought<00:04:52.910> I'd<00:04:53.060> throw<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.479> one<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.870> take

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.260 
deck I thought I'd throw in one to take
advantage<00:04:54.440> of<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.550> 17<00:04:55.940> Plains

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
advantage of that and the 17 Plains

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.510 
advantage of that and the 17 Plains
should<00:04:56.539> be<00:04:56.690> self-explanatory<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:57.860> that's<00:04:58.370> it

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
should be self-explanatory so that's it

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.980 
should be self-explanatory so that's it
for<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.759> main<00:04:58.910> deck<00:04:59.120> let's<00:04:59.419> take<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.690> look<00:04:59.900> at

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
running it is it's basically the only

way<00:05:55.870> this<00:05:56.080> deck<00:05:56.260> can<00:05:56.440> deal<00:05:56.620> with<00:05:56.650> blood<00:05:57.010> baron

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
way this deck can deal with blood baron

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.010 
way this deck can deal with blood baron
of<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.430> scope<00:05:57.670> which<00:05:58.180> is<00:05:58.210> really<00:05:58.600> important

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
of the scope which is really important

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.350 
of the scope which is really important
and<00:05:59.140> since<00:05:59.770> this<00:05:59.980> is<00:06:00.160> a<00:06:00.190> mono<00:06:00.520> color<00:06:00.820> deck<00:06:01.090> i

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
and since this is a mono color deck i

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.060 
and since this is a mono color deck i
rarely<00:06:01.750> will<00:06:02.110> have<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.410> sacrifice<00:06:02.620> anything

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
rarely will have to sacrifice anything

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.670 
rarely will have to sacrifice anything
to<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.640> so<00:06:04.120> it<00:06:04.270> will<00:06:04.450> be<00:06:04.570> one<00:06:04.870> sided<00:06:05.170> most<00:06:05.530> of

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
to it so it will be one sided most of

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.680 
to it so it will be one sided most of
the<00:06:05.740> time<00:06:05.920> and<00:06:06.280> finally<00:06:06.850> I<00:06:06.910> have<00:06:07.180> three<00:06:07.450> route

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.830 
white and Esper decks running things
like<00:06:12.190> supreme<00:06:12.520> verdict<00:06:12.850> as<00:06:13.030> well<00:06:13.510> as<00:06:13.600> the<00:06:13.720> new

like supreme verdict as well as the new
card<00:06:14.110> faded<00:06:14.530> retribution<00:06:14.890> which<00:06:15.430> i<00:06:15.520> think<00:06:15.580> is

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
card faded retribution which i think is

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.910 
card faded retribution which i think is
going<00:06:15.910> to<00:06:15.970> be<00:06:16.090> really<00:06:16.600> really<00:06:16.780> highly<00:06:17.680> played

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
going to be really really highly played

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.130 
going to be really really highly played
the<00:06:18.490> chances<00:06:18.910> of<00:06:18.940> being<00:06:19.210> able<00:06:19.420> to<00:06:19.570> populate

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
the chances of being able to populate

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.960 
the chances of being able to populate
are<00:06:20.350> also<00:06:20.620> fairly<00:06:20.890> decent<00:06:21.400> since<00:06:21.610> I<00:06:21.700> have<00:06:21.850> the

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
are also fairly decent since I have the

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.510 
are also fairly decent since I have the
captain's<00:06:22.390> as<00:06:22.840> well<00:06:23.080> as<00:06:23.200> bromans<00:06:23.650> so<00:06:24.340> that's

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
captain's as well as bromans so that's

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.040 
captain's as well as bromans so that's
it<00:06:24.670> for<00:06:24.790> this<00:06:24.940> deck<00:06:25.120> tank<00:06:25.420> thank<00:06:25.810> you<00:06:25.900> all<00:06:26.020> very
