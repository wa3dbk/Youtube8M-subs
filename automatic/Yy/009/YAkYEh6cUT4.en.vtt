00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:11.020
 Dear subscribers, I showed that I 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:14.320
 currently purchased gas equipment of any 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.200
 Type with me in I show you the package 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.310
 He also printed it out 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.500
 Finally I put it that is like this 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.970
 now looks 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.970
 hood space treshki 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:37.510
 especially nothing to tell how would I 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.989
 gave it to the lads who set 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.090
 This is done professionally. 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.290
 as if the desire itself was not set 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.700
 yes and experience so how to be there no 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.950
 sound put so I thought you 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:00.790
 security there all things decided to file 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:04.360
 to professionals means they are located 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.929
 units here you can see itâ€™s our unit 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:12.749
 control here he stands under went 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:16.119
 main inlet wiring 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:20.289
 reducer here they are also for 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:29.619
 us the control unit that is like that 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:37.409
 so here and then were cut out yes yes yes 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:41.139
 seen shorter gear well it is necessary that 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.340
 heated with antifreeze that is this mixture here 

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:45.939
 which 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.359
 Well, for what she did the engine already 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:54.270
 warmed so it connects to 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:59.429
 antifreeze that's seen there docking up 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:04.500
 so here the filter went here wiring 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:06.229
 it is visible so we have a connector for 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.799
 diagnostics 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.799
 so here we are here just an injection system 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:24.060
 we have this tee myself I remember 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:28.440
 showed it in the review mushrooms out all 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.459
 sensors went battery + 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.220
 we must be here 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.569
 fuse he's not there so well 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.180
 like that 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.900
 In general, it looks, in principle, I say 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.010
 establish himself as if it really have 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.799
 decanter it's about I don't know there is one two 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.470
 day well, the agent is not able to do it 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.319
 About two or three days I want to threaten 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.799
 set yourself you will also 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:07.579
 save another 700 hryvnia I gave 1750 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:10.440
 for the whole installation mantle there is everything 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.980
 the site of the service room and now me 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.950
 porn for free there they have that is 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:23.099
 here so we all look so now you 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.019
 I will show start button ok 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.709
 the button itself 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:32.420
 put it here 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:38.599
 initially put yes here next to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:43.250
 Nurse regulator will farm 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:46.709
 generally understood yes that's regulated bias 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:52.940
 imitation well decided to put it here 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.940
 here therefore as especially 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.049
 first trial easier it 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.049
 stretch it 1 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.420
 secondly decided to fight you the evil eye because 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.629
 that the highest are poured looks and 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:19.289
 it is well and I still have registration 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:22.260
 in the plans and enters the nearest about 33 line 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:28.320
 so I decided to hide there from and then 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:30.300
 in general, that is, well, I do not know correctly 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.020
 whether then put logan there wrong well 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.460
 I will understand this operation I decided to go there and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:41.430
 put it all on this general 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.440
 the conversation is over and about the launch by 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:50.370
 the point of the adventure itself that is now 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:52.740
 let's go ahead and see this one is full here 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.780
 the floor is not necessary here basically all easier 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:01.520
 simple he gets up to his own native this 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.379
 no fool of the forest fleet 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.949
 here that is how it is all to sleep 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:12.430
 refueling water costs me refueling 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.430
 valve itself 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.820
 so here it looks like it is it 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.390
 fits so full there already everything already there 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:28.770
 everything is clear that is like this 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:33.510
 8 way me attached so now we 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:38.340
 run the engine and see what we see 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:46.870
 it's the same for yourself 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:50.970
 the launch goes on gasoline that's it 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.970
 there is an hour gasoline pokamis us 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.289
 and all this has already gone to call 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:12.409
 so it shows with us in fish day 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:15.520
 refueling is full and he can see it yes we are here 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:21.560
 once switched to gasoline now 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:25.819
 principle of difference I do not feel the transition from 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:29.240
 gas to gasoline from gasoline to gas is it 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.530
 we are now running gas already that is 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.879
 well, everything is easier just 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:46.000
 it switches automatically or you 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:54.110
 yourself switching it now works on 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:58.580
 the base widget will be quietly principle everything 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:03.529
 we build 22 times cheaper patient 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:08.620
 gasoline this way 16 8 there is a difference yes 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:10.629
 her but the cost of installation and equipment 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:15.860
 okay 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:19.070
 6000 here grieve and deliver ie you 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.870
 made the decision themselves 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:25.280
 all on this and others finished 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.380
 no one asks taken hit drive 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.990
 site break it show how you do it 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:35.100
 standing there show the video here I specifically
