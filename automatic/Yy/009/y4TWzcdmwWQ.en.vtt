00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.440
 How deep is this place 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.360
 Did you do all this? 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.960
 Yes 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.860
 It took us a little work to do it 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.220
 Even among the three 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.160
 But do not be intimidated 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.120
 We must work even more 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.762
 Are you serious? 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.920
 Seriously 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.160
 This level is poor of minerals 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.480
 Also! 

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:43.557
 What we really want is below 

00:00:43.557 --> 00:00:44.627
 And really 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 It would? 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.685
 Diamonds Steve 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.340
 We can not guarantee our 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.400
 security at this point of the server 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.240
 Without the necessary supplies 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.570
 to defend ourselves 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 Go 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.340
 You really are not aware of anything 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.321
 about the game 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.000
 Good luck you came across us 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.916
 or you would not last a second out there 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.020
 Good 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.620
 I'm glad that it was 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.500
 I know this place should try to call 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.740
 the least possible attention 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.340
 But... 

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:11.639
 A couple more torches 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:12.219
 it would not hurt 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.920
 This place has gone unnoticed 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.928
 a good time 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.500
 It's annoying 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.240
 But give some credit to the little lighting 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.880
 Good 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.764
 When you're right 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.140
 You're right 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.160
 Hey Pro 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.991
 Can I ask you a question? 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.580
 Question 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.020
 Why does Multiquecho have totally red eyes? 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.600
 That... 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.720
 It is normal? 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.380
 That... 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.120
 Neither Krizth nor I know 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.480
 Whenever we ask you change the subject 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.420
 What will it be? 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.320
 I do not know 

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.471
 But I have theories about it 

00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:41.241
 For example
