00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
engine this part of the engine broke out

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250 
engine this part of the engine broke out
so<00:00:36.250> just<00:00:36.489> broke<00:00:36.670> up<00:00:36.820> because<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.270> piston<00:00:38.050> rod

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
so just broke up because the piston rod

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.470 
so just broke up because the piston rod
here's<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.739> picture<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.130> the<00:00:39.520> piston<00:00:40.180> the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
here's a picture of the piston the

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.660 
here's a picture of the piston the
piston<00:00:41.230> rod<00:00:43.050> somehow<00:00:44.219> loosened<00:00:45.219> up<00:00:45.340> I<00:00:45.520> don't

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
piston rod somehow loosened up I don't

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.459 
piston rod somehow loosened up I don't
know<00:00:45.760> why<00:00:45.940> here's<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.839> screw<00:00:47.109> it's<00:00:47.289> two

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469 
know why here's the screw it's two

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.259 
know why here's the screw it's two
totally<00:00:47.739> bent<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.489> piston<00:00:48.850> what<00:00:48.940> it<00:00:49.059> does

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
totally bent and the piston what it does

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.360 
totally bent and the piston what it does
is<00:00:49.420> been<00:00:49.629> so<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:49.960> can't<00:00:50.140> really<00:00:50.260> seize<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.739> and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
is been so you can't really seize it and

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.689 
is been so you can't really seize it and
it<00:00:51.640> just<00:00:52.059> pushed<00:00:52.629> out<00:00:52.839> this<00:00:53.140> part<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:54.429> the

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
it just pushed out this part of the

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.569 
it just pushed out this part of the
engine<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.329> pushed<00:00:55.600> it<00:00:55.749> out<00:00:55.839> and<00:00:56.199> it's<00:00:57.190> now<00:00:57.550> I

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
engine it pushed it out and it's now I

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.060 
engine it pushed it out and it's now I
have<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.789> hole<00:00:58.030> in<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.329> engine<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:59.499> motor

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
have a hole in the engine and the motor

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.880 
have a hole in the engine and the motor
holder<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:01.179> motor<00:01:01.420> holder<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.589> engine

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
holder the motor holder the engine

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.680 
holder the motor holder the engine
holder<00:01:03.219> I<00:01:03.429> don't<00:01:04.120> know<00:01:04.180> what<00:01:04.300> you<00:01:04.360> call<00:01:04.510> this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
holder I don't know what you call this

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.980 
holder I don't know what you call this
just<00:01:05.290> put<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.500> broke<00:01:05.980> out<00:01:06.190> also<00:01:06.460> so<00:01:06.970> here<00:01:07.900> are

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
just put a broke out also so here are

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.399 
just put a broke out also so here are
the<00:01:08.050> pieces<00:01:08.230> of<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.850> engine<00:01:09.850> holder<00:01:10.409> soaked

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
the pieces of the engine holder soaked

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.590 
the pieces of the engine holder soaked
out<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:12.010> basically<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.150> don't<00:01:13.270> know<00:01:13.360> where<00:01:13.510> the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
out and basically I don't know where the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.510 
out and basically I don't know where the
bottom<00:01:13.870> part<00:01:14.080> is<00:01:14.229> here<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.590> think<00:01:15.190> it<00:01:15.250> must<00:01:15.430> be

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
bottom part is here I think it must be

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.150 
bottom part is here I think it must be
somewhere<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.420> engines<00:01:16.810> -<00:01:17.050> I<00:01:17.320> don't<00:01:18.010> know

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
somewhere in the engines - I don't know

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.200 
somewhere in the engines - I don't know
maybe<00:01:19.060> I'll<00:01:19.270> find<00:01:19.540> out<00:01:19.630> someday<00:01:19.960> okay<00:01:20.860> so<00:01:21.490> now

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
maybe I'll find out someday okay so now

here this injection unit and the airbox

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.930 
here this injection unit and the airbox
and<00:01:40.440> here<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.620> exhaust<00:01:41.920> pipes<00:01:42.190> on<00:01:42.400> both<00:01:42.550> sides

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
and here the exhaust pipes on both sides

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.400 
and here the exhaust pipes on both sides
and<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:44.440> managed<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.340> put<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.140> turbo<00:01:47.740> lover

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
and I managed to put in the turbo lover

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.080 
and I managed to put in the turbo lover
here's<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> turbo<00:01:51.630> C<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:54.100> is<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.280> turbo<00:01:54.700> is

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
here's the turbo C what is the turbo is

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.960 
here's the turbo C what is the turbo is
the<00:01:55.360> exhaust<00:01:55.690> system<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.380> your<00:01:57.250> exhaust

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the exhaust system and your exhaust

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.050 
the exhaust system and your exhaust
fumes<00:01:58.930> can<00:01:59.260> get<00:01:59.410> out<00:01:59.560> to<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.520> exhaust<00:02:00.790> pipe

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
fumes can get out to the exhaust pipe

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.120 
fumes can get out to the exhaust pipe
and<00:02:01.300> on<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.810> side<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.110> think<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.500> better<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.040> I

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
and on this side I think it better if I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.740 
and on this side I think it better if I
change<00:02:03.490> sides<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:07.030> this<00:02:07.210> side<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.630> can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
change sides now on this side you can

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
change sides now on this side you can
see<00:02:07.780> here<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.800> air<00:02:08.950> gets<00:02:09.220> sucked<00:02:09.429> in<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.530> here

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
see here the air gets sucked in and here

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.490 
see here the air gets sucked in and here
there<00:02:12.760> get<00:02:13.330> pressed<00:02:13.690> in<00:02:14.790> press<00:02:15.790> into<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.750> air
