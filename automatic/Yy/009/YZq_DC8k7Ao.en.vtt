00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
quite well and he was one of the the key

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.980 
quite well and he was one of the the key
parts<00:00:22.340> of<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.970> silly<00:00:23.689> season

parts of the silly season

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.230 
parts of the silly season
engineering-wise<00:00:24.770> anyway<00:00:25.310> leaving<00:00:25.700> red<00:00:26.119> bull

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
engineering-wise anyway leaving red bull

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.940 
engineering-wise anyway leaving red bull
racing<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.750> heading<00:00:26.930> to<00:00:26.960> HRT<00:00:27.410> yeah

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
racing and heading to HRT yeah

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.280

absolutely and I think it took everybody
in<00:00:30.800> pit<00:00:31.130> lane<00:00:31.160> probably<00:00:31.849> apart<00:00:32.180> from<00:00:32.329> Adrian

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
in pit lane probably apart from Adrian

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.540 
in pit lane probably apart from Adrian
and<00:00:32.960> maybe<00:00:33.290> James<00:00:33.590> Courtney<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.190> Brian

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
and maybe James Courtney and Brian

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.510 
and maybe James Courtney and Brian
walkinshaw<00:00:35.060> by<00:00:35.660> surprise<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:36.470> you<00:00:37.430> know

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
walkinshaw by surprise and you know

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.540 
walkinshaw by surprise and you know
especially<00:00:37.670> Roland<00:00:38.210> Dane<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:38.810> I<00:00:39.050> rollin<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:40.130> I

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
especially Roland Dane so I rollin to I

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.990 
especially Roland Dane so I rollin to I
guess<00:00:41.360> March<00:00:42.020> Adrian<00:00:42.500> out<00:00:42.680> of<00:00:42.890> team<00:00:43.640> red<00:00:43.820> bull

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
guess March Adrian out of team red bull

that he wasn't moving to HRT was a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.820 
that he wasn't moving to HRT was a
pretty<00:00:49.640> big<00:00:49.880> call<00:00:50.150> think<00:00:50.750> everybody<00:00:51.230> thought

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
pretty big call think everybody thought

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.920 
pretty big call think everybody thought
that<00:00:51.890> it<00:00:52.160> was<00:00:52.250> going<00:00:52.370> to<00:00:52.490> hurt<00:00:52.810> triple<00:00:53.810> eight

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
that it was going to hurt triple eight

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.050 
that it was going to hurt triple eight
more<00:00:54.260> than<00:00:54.290> it<00:00:54.530> actually<00:00:54.650> did<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.250> Triple<00:00:55.970> H

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
more than it actually did and Triple H

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.000 
more than it actually did and Triple H
seemed<00:00:56.270> to<00:00:56.390> come<00:00:56.510> out<00:00:56.660> firing<00:00:57.020> at<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.290> end<00:00:57.440> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010

johnson racing what do you expect with
that<00:01:20.060> combination<00:01:20.329> well<00:01:21.109> i<00:01:21.140> think<00:01:21.289> you<00:01:21.920> know

that combination well i think you know
Adrienne's<00:01:22.670> very<00:01:23.270> good<00:01:23.509> not<00:01:23.840> one<00:01:24.140> person<00:01:24.439> can

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
Adrienne's very good not one person can

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.099 
Adrienne's very good not one person can
make<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.219> team<00:01:25.579> win<00:01:25.819> races<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.390> mean<00:01:26.539> it<00:01:26.659> that's

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
make a team win races I mean it that's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.539 
make a team win races I mean it that's
what<00:01:27.259> a<00:01:27.289> team<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.740> team<00:01:27.859> about<00:01:28.310> working

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
what a team is a team about working

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.219 
what a team is a team about working
together<00:01:28.759> bringing<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.840> best<00:01:29.960> out<00:01:30.170> of

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
together bringing the best out of

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.889 
together bringing the best out of
everybody<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.429> building<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.030> I<00:01:32.060> think

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
everybody in that building and I think

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.209 
everybody in that building and I think
Adrienne's<00:01:33.289> quite<00:01:33.469> good<00:01:33.649> at<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.829> is<00:01:33.950> good<00:01:34.100> at

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
Adrienne's quite good at that is good at

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.950 
Adrienne's quite good at that is good at
getting<00:01:34.460> people<00:01:34.490> to<00:01:34.880> work<00:01:35.060> together<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.749> head

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
getting people to work together to head

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.590 
getting people to work together to head
in<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.469> certain<00:01:36.679> direction<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.429> and<00:01:38.389> put

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
in a certain direction and and put

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.569 
in a certain direction and and put
processes<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.319> place<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.859> I<00:01:39.889> think<00:01:39.979> Adrienne's

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
processes in place so I think Adrienne's

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.699 
processes in place so I think Adrienne's
certainly<00:01:41.509> here's<00:01:41.780> his<00:01:42.049> role<00:01:42.289> down<00:01:42.469> there

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
certainly here's his role down there

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:43.959 
certainly here's his role down there
will<00:01:42.829> be<00:01:42.920> two<00:01:43.069> that<00:01:43.219> to<00:01:43.459> put<00:01:43.639> all<00:01:43.789> those

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
will be two that to put all those

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.719 
will be two that to put all those
positive<00:01:44.929> processes<00:01:45.469> in<00:01:45.619> place<00:01:45.649> get<00:01:46.609> the

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
positive processes in place get the

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.399 
positive processes in place get the
business<00:01:47.060> running<00:01:47.240> I<00:01:47.600> mean<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.319> know

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
business running I mean you know

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.069 
business running I mean you know
Adrienne<00:01:49.219> is<00:01:49.399> an<00:01:49.880> engineer<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:50.450> he's<00:01:50.899> not

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
Adrienne is an engineer but he's not

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.440 
Adrienne is an engineer but he's not
that<00:01:51.259> he<00:01:52.009> wasn't<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.280> key<00:01:52.459> success<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.299> dick

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
that he wasn't the key success to dick

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.330 
that he wasn't the key success to dick
johnson<00:01:53.780> racing<00:01:53.810> yet<00:01:54.439> he<00:01:54.649> was<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.799> big<00:01:54.950> part<00:01:55.159> of

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
johnson racing yet he was a big part of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.330 
johnson racing yet he was a big part of
it<00:01:55.459> so<00:01:55.789> as<00:01:56.329> was<00:01:56.990> all<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.529> other<00:01:57.649> employees<00:01:57.920> and

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
it so as was all the other employees and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.949 
it so as was all the other employees and
I<00:01:58.429> think<00:01:58.609> what<00:01:58.789> he<00:01:59.270> will<00:01:59.389> be<00:01:59.479> able<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.659> do<00:01:59.810> down

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
I think what he will be able to do down

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.019 
I think what he will be able to do down

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
outside of of where I was I guess lots

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.510 
outside of of where I was I guess lots
of<00:02:49.650> things<00:02:49.860> have<00:02:50.010> changed<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:52.520> the

you<00:02:59.070> know<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.190> guess<00:02:59.370> overall<00:02:59.730> I<00:03:00.030> thought

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
you know I guess overall I thought

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
you know we all know that that for cars

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.600 
you know we all know that that for cars
works<00:03:51.720> better<00:03:51.930> than<00:03:52.080> the<00:03:52.170> three<00:03:52.410> cars<00:03:52.709> you

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
works better than the three cars you

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.630 
works better than the three cars you
know<00:03:53.700> logistical<00:03:54.360> e<00:03:54.390> commercially<00:03:55.580> so<00:03:56.580> you

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
know logistical e commercially so you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.210 
know logistical e commercially so you
know<00:03:56.940> from<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.150> point<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.510> view<00:03:57.570> it's<00:03:58.140> good<00:03:58.350> i

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
know from that point of view it's good i

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.930 
know from that point of view it's good i
guess<00:03:59.790> for<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.690> team<00:04:00.900> overall<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.850> you<00:04:02.850> know

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
guess for the team overall and you know

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.860 
guess for the team overall and you know
i<00:04:02.970> think<00:04:04.040> as<00:04:05.040> far<00:04:05.640> as<00:04:06.000> moving<00:04:06.240> forward<00:04:06.780> and

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
i think as far as moving forward and

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.330 
i think as far as moving forward and
developing<00:04:07.320> it's<00:04:07.500> probably<00:04:07.740> better<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.040> have

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
developing it's probably better to have

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.650 
developing it's probably better to have
I<00:04:08.760> guess<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.570> know<00:04:09.690> almost<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.320> sort<00:04:10.680> of

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
I guess you know almost to sort of

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.120 
I guess you know almost to sort of
separate<00:04:12.660> teams<00:04:12.900> within<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.320> one<00:04:13.470> team<00:04:13.770> if

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
separate teams within the one team if

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.380 
separate teams within the one team if
you're<00:04:14.640> like<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.910> know<00:04:14.940> I'm<00:04:15.060> not<00:04:15.180> sure

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
you're like you know I'm not sure

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.090 
you're like you know I'm not sure
exactly<00:04:15.750> how<00:04:16.020> it's<00:04:16.169> all<00:04:16.260> going<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.440> be<00:04:16.500> run<00:04:16.739> but

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
exactly how it's all going to be run but

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.270 
exactly how it's all going to be run but
I<00:04:17.370> think<00:04:17.730> it'd<00:04:17.790> be<00:04:17.910> good<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:20.160> know

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280
