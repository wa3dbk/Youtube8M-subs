 Let's learn from you, here it is. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.219
 solid to get an idea of â€‹â€‹how it is 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:37.020
 the assembly was one today 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:41.640
 Good problem being box in files 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.210

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.210
 Details 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.230
 ie the instructions of your hispanic 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.770

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.770
 compensates for whistling 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 there 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.940
 currently the organ is easy for you 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:20.060
 This table is much bigger than I am. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:28.450
 I thought it was half saqa the part of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:33.070
 down and if that height adjustment you 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.070
 Loosen up here for what she gave a fall. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.140
 through the two in which you do today 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.369
 at the time my little one has no adjustment 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.770
 none 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.979
 it has height adjustment in three 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.979
 levels 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.190
 This type of cross foot is ideal for 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.190
 pass for example from below attacking 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.770

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.550
 the table costs an average of 99 reais to 130 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.170
 real 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.300
 more than that it is out of the standard 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.350
