00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.490 

it<00:03:45.549> actually<00:03:45.939> tastes<00:03:46.209> really<00:03:46.329> good<00:03:46.569> it's<00:03:47.290> not

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
but you thought about the flavor it's

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.069 
but you thought about the flavor it's
really<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.730> texture<00:04:07.359> of<00:04:07.390> it's<00:04:07.569> almost<00:04:07.750> like<00:04:08.049> a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
really the texture of it's almost like a

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.059 
really the texture of it's almost like a
cake<00:04:08.379> type<00:04:10.139> which<00:04:11.139> I<00:04:11.260> do<00:04:11.319> for<00:04:11.530> Dad<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.709> have<00:04:11.920> like

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
cake type which I do for Dad I have like

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.369 
cake type which I do for Dad I have like
the<00:04:12.250> gooey<00:04:12.459> stuff<00:04:12.849> but<00:04:13.689> the<00:04:13.780> directions<00:04:14.139> did

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
the gooey stuff but the directions did

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.920 
the gooey stuff but the directions did
say<00:04:14.650> like<00:04:14.889> 25<00:04:15.159> minutes<00:04:15.670> take<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.090> out<00:04:16.299> tested

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
say like 25 minutes take it out tested

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.860 
say like 25 minutes take it out tested
do<00:04:17.199> not<00:04:17.349> overcook<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:18.039> so<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:19.299> think<00:04:19.449> it<00:04:19.810> is

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
do not overcook it so I think it is

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.890 
do not overcook it so I think it is
about<00:04:20.320> as<00:04:20.739> good<00:04:21.669> as<00:04:21.820> it's<00:04:21.970> supposed<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.360> be<00:04:22.539> and

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
about as good as it's supposed to be and

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.350 
about as good as it's supposed to be and
I<00:04:23.430> think<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.580> could<00:04:24.759> definitely<00:04:24.880> be<00:04:25.330> a

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
I think this could definitely be a

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.659 
I think this could definitely be a
