found in the game files so a total of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.600 
found in the game files so a total of
both<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.170> but<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:40.770> missing<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.579> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
both of them but we're missing one so I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.040 
both of them but we're missing one so I
don't<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.879> where<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.180> last<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
either but it's in the game files it's a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
either but it's in the game files it's a
little<00:00:46.469> bit<00:00:46.590> weird<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.670> anyways

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
little bit weird but it is so anyways

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
little bit weird but it is so anyways
which<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.070> don't<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.370> how

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
which one is it I think I don't know how

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.310 
which one is it I think I don't know how
you<00:00:50.640> guys<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:50.910> classify<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.750> because

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
you guys would classify this because

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
you guys would classify this because
there's<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> different<00:00:53.340> speculation

you personally I just think it's normal
old<00:01:05.430> Freddy<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:07.049> know<00:01:07.170> there's<00:01:07.439> really

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
old Freddy but you know there's really

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
old Freddy but you know there's really
no<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> activating<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.299> far<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.659> we

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
no way of activating this as far as we

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
no way of activating this as far as we
know<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.680> happens<00:01:11.100> which<00:01:11.369> tends

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
know it just kind of happens which tends

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.280 
know it just kind of happens which tends
to<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.119> lot<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> secrets<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.049> game

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to be a lot of the secrets in this game

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.660 
to be a lot of the secrets in this game
I<00:01:13.530> don't<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.920> what's<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.400> Scott

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
I don't know what's up with that Scott

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
I don't know what's up with that Scott
but<00:01:14.939> apparently<00:01:15.210> he<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.509> likes<00:01:15.689> adding<00:01:16.049> in

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
but apparently he just likes adding in

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.660 
but apparently he just likes adding in
random<00:01:16.560> secrets<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.159> can't<00:01:17.400> really

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
those check them out for sure because

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
those check them out for sure because
they<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:27.960> pretty<00:01:28.140> interesting<00:01:28.530> anyways<00:01:28.970> what

do<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.119> about<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.049> don't

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
do I think about this I really don't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.390 
do I think about this I really don't
think<00:01:31.229> there's<00:01:31.470> any<00:01:31.560> significance<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
think there's any significance to it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.679 
think there's any significance to it
I<00:01:32.520> mean<00:01:32.909> well<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> course<00:01:33.210> there's<00:01:33.509> something

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
I mean well of course there's something

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.120 
I mean well of course there's something
there<00:01:34.170> has<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.380> some<00:01:34.590> sort<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> meaning<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
there has to be some sort of meaning to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
there has to be some sort of meaning to
it<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.640> weird<00:01:35.850> how<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.020> fact

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
it because it's weird how it was in fact

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.130 
it because it's weird how it was in fact
two<00:01:37.290> Freddy's<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
two Freddy's to and then they kind of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.990 
two Freddy's to and then they kind of
they<00:01:40.470> teleported<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.430> was<00:01:41.549> weird

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
they teleported which was weird

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.219 
they teleported which was weird
I<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.390> all<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.869> did<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
I don't think all three of them did if I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660 
I don't think all three of them did if I
remember<00:01:43.590> correctly<00:01:43.829> there's<00:01:43.979> only<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.399> I

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
remember correctly there's only one I

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.859 
remember correctly there's only one I
covered<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.420> long<00:01:45.600> ago<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> can't

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
covered this so long ago I can't

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.969 
covered this so long ago I can't
remember<00:01:46.020> though<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.590> point<00:01:46.829> but

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
remember though at this point but

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
remember though at this point but
basically<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.180> only<00:01:48.360> one<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
basically I think it was only one and a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.510 
basically I think it was only one and a
lot<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.380> people<00:01:49.560> thought<00:01:49.680> chico<00:01:50.070> was<00:01:50.220> hiding

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
lot of people thought chico was hiding

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.920 
lot of people thought chico was hiding
it<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.909> something<00:01:51.390> along<00:01:51.509> those<00:01:51.630> lines<00:01:51.720> at

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it or something along those lines at

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539 
it or something along those lines at
yale<00:01:52.049> somehow<00:01:52.439> related<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> chica<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.430> we

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
yale somehow related to chica but we

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.929 
yale somehow related to chica but we
really<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.420> don't<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.579> you<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:56.700> this

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
really we don't know so you know this

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.030 
really we don't know so you know this
kind<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.299> goes<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.079> whole<00:01:58.649> fact

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
kind of goes on to the the whole fact

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.499 
kind of goes on to the the whole fact
that<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.310> don't<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.850> fans<00:02:00.000> raise<00:02:00.240> three<00:02:00.420> is

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that I don't think fans raise three is

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.999 
that I don't think fans raise three is
the<00:02:00.630> ending<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.619> there's<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.860> be

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the ending I think that there's gonna be

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.260 
the ending I think that there's gonna be
a<00:02:02.040> fourth<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.820> still<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.090> know

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
a fourth one because we still don't know

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
a fourth one because we still don't know
what's<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> kitchen<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:04.979> of

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
what's in the kitchen so that's kind of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.889 
what's in the kitchen so that's kind of
interesting<00:02:05.189> I'm<00:02:06.060> talking<00:02:06.600> about<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
interesting I'm talking about all the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.029 
interesting I'm talking about all the
way<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.290> fines<00:02:07.439> raised<00:02:07.649> one<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.860> mean

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
way back to fines raised one I mean

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.380 
way back to fines raised one I mean
maybe<00:02:08.220> there's<00:02:08.670> gotta<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.149> sort<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
maybe there's gotta be some sort of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.699 
maybe there's gotta be some sort of
theory<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:09.989> topic<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:10.500> but

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
theory I'm so off topic right now but

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470 
theory I'm so off topic right now but
honestly<00:02:11.160> that's<00:02:11.430> been<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.000> my<00:02:12.090> mind<00:02:12.239> lately

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
honestly that's been on my mind lately

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.610 
honestly that's been on my mind lately
as<00:02:12.750> what<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.260> kid

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
as what is in that kid

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.259 
as what is in that kid
because<00:02:13.920> we<00:02:14.010> really<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.549> but<00:02:14.790> other

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
because we really don't know but other

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.729 
because we really don't know but other
than<00:02:15.390> that<00:02:15.450> though<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.989> mean<00:02:16.230> these<00:02:16.440> things

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
than that though I mean these things

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.800 
than that though I mean these things
have<00:02:16.920> been<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.129> sort<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.489> large<00:02:18.000> mystery<00:02:18.510> or

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
have been in sort of a large mystery or

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.050 
have been in sort of a large mystery or
they<00:02:19.049> played<00:02:19.290> kind<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.709> role<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.909> whole

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
they played kind of a role in the whole

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.059 
they played kind of a role in the whole
secret<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:22.049> restaurant<00:02:22.590> stuff<00:02:22.799> like<00:02:22.920> that

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
secret of the restaurant stuff like that

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.190 
secret of the restaurant stuff like that
because<00:02:23.159> they're<00:02:23.940> just<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.209> mysterious<00:02:24.989> I

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
because they're just so mysterious I

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.170 
because they're just so mysterious I
mean<00:02:25.319> clearly<00:02:25.560> they're<00:02:25.769> made<00:02:25.920> by<00:02:26.069> kids<00:02:26.370> but

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
mean clearly they're made by kids but

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.580 
mean clearly they're made by kids but
why<00:02:27.299> do<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.569> teleport<00:02:28.049> around<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.409> that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
why do they teleport around like that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.710 
why do they teleport around like that
and<00:02:28.799> why<00:02:28.980> why<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:29.940> third<00:02:30.120> game<00:02:30.360> and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and why why is it in the third game and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.839 
and why why is it in the third game and
it<00:02:31.140> appears<00:02:31.470> above<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.700> old

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
it appears above you know the old

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.339 
it appears above you know the old
animatronics<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.930> mean<00:02:34.049> it's<00:02:34.170> kind

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
animatronics like that I mean it's kind
