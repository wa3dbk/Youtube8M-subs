00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
with the beats you can have a little bit

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.820 
with the beats you can have a little bit
of<00:01:00.210> problem<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.309> not<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.460> flexible

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
breaking when the fold and this does not

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.539 
breaking when the fold and this does not
take<00:01:56.399> battery<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.560> consumes<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
take battery these and this consumes a

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.870 
take battery these and this consumes a
lot<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.909> room<00:02:00.090> taking<00:02:00.390> these<00:02:00.780> off<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.880> they

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
lot of room taking these off and they

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.800 
lot of room taking these off and they
both<00:02:03.180> hit<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.750> highs<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.320> lows

but<00:02:06.860> personally<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.009> think<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:09.170> Sol

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
but personally I think the Sol

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.020 
but personally I think the Sol
Republic's<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:12.450> better<00:02:13.140> bass<00:02:13.640> better<00:02:14.640> sound

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
Republic's have better bass better sound
