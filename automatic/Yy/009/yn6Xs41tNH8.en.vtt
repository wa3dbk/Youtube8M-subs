 I'll explain step by step to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.689
 You guys at the beginning are a bit difficult until 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.619
 pick agility on the buttons you have 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.019
 that tighten 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.390
 only training doing sometimes 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.360
 you will soon get the tricks show 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.100
 which I am in version 1.1 11 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.879
 you will not be using a program 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.680
 type x leg or in titles or any 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.670
 another program does not need legg 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.829
 Internet 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.739
 my internet is very fast and even 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.570
 so I can make you guys go there 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.989
 able to make sure just get a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.640
 practice, but before starting to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.410
 show you the milk I just wanted 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.809
 apologize and for those days that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 I stayed away there I was very run there 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.390
 in the service was not getting in 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.360
 on the video game to try to find out 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.720
 glitch nothing then that's all it only 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.710
 I'm sorry, let's go to the things that matter 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.330
 now wants how does the good glitch do 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 first of all you have to enter 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.619
 in a home in a public session here I 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.330
 I put it down directional and I chose 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.610
 my character from the online mode that is the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.009
 Faster way to be there in session 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.270
 public or you can push the start there 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.909
 even online play and even online and will give 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.509
 anyway I was carrying the game here 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.890
 I'm back online, I'll be right back with you. 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.090
 Good guys are loading here already. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.880
 online mode 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.229
 I left it to carry there inside the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.820
 garage only by a security measure 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.790
 As you can see the room was 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.670
 then it is just one more measure of 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.820
 Security, I'll even open the phone. 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.390
 I go here on the internet tab in cash 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.549
 and I'm going to the bank here in the middle of the bank and I 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.399
 I'll take it out and I'll take all the money. 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.560
 that has in my account all does not leave 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.509
 less than 100 thousand just to ensure 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.970
 I'm not going to take it because I do not have it 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530
 lots of money in this account, you 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.890
 you have a lot of money going in a box 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.690
 electronic 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.790
 which can take much more of a 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:24.120
 I came here on the trip sac services 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.270
 I go here at the store that sells the tank and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.010
 I'm going here on this same 450 thousand 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.300
 You can do it with the apartment too. 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.180
 No problem, you're staying with the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.690
 tight start button goes on top of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.660
 buy and will hit x release the start 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.700
 while doing this will tighten 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.440
 to buy and this screen will appear 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:53.130
 here to leave the online gta you go 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.260
 push ball to go back and stay 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.050
 with this screen that will be pressed again 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.970
 the stadium will leave tight and when 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.530
 you drop start 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.690
 You will squeeze the brushes quickly. 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.430
 will show this screen again 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.050
 you have to be very fast to put 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.140
 to right push up put 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.780
 and leave the gt online 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.000

 try again until it appears it has to be 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.350
 very fast at this time but will not 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.989
 to succeed in the same method that I did 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.390
 a video you put out of gt 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.760

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.290

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.519
 when you return from the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.700
 playstation store 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.530
 you will fall into the room online a creator 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.890
 content and you may be placing 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.230
 those barriers there at the door of 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.549
 garage put car to disrupt the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.829
 personal these things 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.970

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.250

 here is loading playstation store 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.560
 Every once in a while you lock it up here. 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.930
 be careful it's loaded here it's just 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.030
 You tighten the ball and control it. 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.120
 You to come back when you 're 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.979
 coming back it will put character of the mode 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.940
 The story that you were in my case was 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.360
 the maicon 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.550

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.990
 locked 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.830
 when he's caught 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:41.070
 you simply push the start of 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.720
 new here df fought like that caught 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.130
 You could not buy the tank if you did not. 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.250
 would have caught if I was 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.040
 controlling the character would give 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.890
 buy the tank or bob cargo as not 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:58.200

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.880

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.140

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.150
 store has no secret as soon as you return to 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.430
 to load the mode online it was going to come back 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.770
 playing with maicon controlling him 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.400

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.670

 so you can make those gestures 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.720

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.540

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.380

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.850

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.750
 stay is getting right in people dies 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.980
 now I'm going to be invisible now 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.800
 From that moment on, who is in the room 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.430
 Can you see when I was in the 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.710

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.230
 tribute maicon so far nobody 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.600
 could you see me in case 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.160
 now i'm invisible to me only 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.230
 Who's in the room? 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.840
 now they can see 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.280
 so just take a little care here 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.920
 And now you're going to kill someone 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.650
 room here has to be in the grenade or in the 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:08.100
 c4 shooting only taking you will not 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.570
 to kill the person with when you 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.730
 has played with the character in the mode 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.330
 story now here you can kill 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:18.480
 usually but you can die and the 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.520
 tip this staff is not so useful as well 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.070
 only useful for those who do not have the 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.150
 tank or bob job and managed to do well 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.280
 fast 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.620
 if you come back from the playstation store 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.620
 When you're doing blitze and I've already fallen 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.780
 controlling the character automatically 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.830
 Are you going to be able to buy the cargo? 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.830
 bob was just like before 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.780
 if you do not know how it used only 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.790
 if you search the internet you will have 

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.910
 someone showing for sure 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:50.970
