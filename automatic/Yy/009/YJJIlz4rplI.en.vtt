00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
Note 2 but what I realized both when I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.000

did<00:00:42.629> crush<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.290> screen<00:00:44.300> that<00:00:45.620> Galaxy<00:00:46.620> Note<00:00:46.770> 2

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
did crush this screen that Galaxy Note 2

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.940 
did crush this screen that Galaxy Note 2
is<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.480> realized<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.260> new<00:00:49.500> got<00:00:49.770> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
is that I realized that this new got a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.709 
is that I realized that this new got a
gravis<00:00:50.579> -<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.090> sounds<00:00:51.329> thing<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.510> saying

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
gravis - that sounds thing is saying

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.160 
gravis - that sounds thing is saying
that<00:00:51.870> they<00:00:51.989> were<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:53.360> freaking<00:00:54.360> sucks<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that they were using it freaking sucks I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810 
that they were using it freaking sucks I
think<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.829> previous<00:00:56.309> generation<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
think that the previous generation of

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
think that the previous generation of
gravis<00:00:57.329> feels<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.440> stronger<00:00:59.039> because

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
gravis feels like it's stronger because

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.540 
gravis feels like it's stronger because
I<00:00:59.730> don't<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.570> why<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.949> gas<00:01:02.160> seems

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I don't know why but the the gas seems

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.020 
I don't know why but the the gas seems
to<00:01:02.699> shatter<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.719> very<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.439> easily<00:01:05.030> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
to shatter very very very easily and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.490 
to shatter very very very easily and
also<00:01:06.240> there<00:01:06.450> was<00:01:06.600> something<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.930> realized<00:01:07.140> my

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
also there was something I realized my

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.450 
also there was something I realized my
