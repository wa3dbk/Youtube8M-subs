00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.190
 before the actual dissection of 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.019
 Harry Potter and the firecracker starts 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.250
 I have to be the ax again 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.990
 they already grind in many 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.000
 porcelain store stuck 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.859
 because the fourth harry potter part is in 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.099
 Not only my eyes, but those of you 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.810
 distance worst he moves 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.330
 qualitatively in all regions to one 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.910
 really just gossamer line the 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.320
 this disaster of twilight level 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.000
 trend yes I think so shit that 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.530
 capped love triangle the total 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.510
 crazy plot device of the sport 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.030
 the ridiculous filler story 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.460
 The offended ron builds that up practically 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.220
 almost everyone participates too 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.840
 the spectators at the games are more constant 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.150
 lebensgefahr are exposed that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.350
 students against their will in the games 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.950
 be involved 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.650
 an absolute fanfiction disaster 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.410
 yes, I think the film so shit 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.600
 the book went i could at least 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.180
 by reading without puking what i got from 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.400
 can formally assert 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.280
 in the course of the new film was alfonso 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.290
 CuarÃ³n against mike newell replaced by 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.250
 harry potter to rotate only had 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.750
 refuse to turn the eternal gardener 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.090
 knows him even still would not matter 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.160
 Mike Newell convinced the studios about it 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.080
 not to divide the book into two parts 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.310
 and after a few months in a row 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.440
 to publish 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.200
 Under the conviction support 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.810
 alfonso he rate stood firmly to 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.270
 that he is enough fraisa place from the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.720
 story could remove all that in 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 a movie would work 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.060
 whether out of this risk or another 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.310
 founding only received one 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 million dollars as a gage if you are 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.210
 the ordinary directors wanted to know 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.980
 to earn chris columbus strokes 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.710
 very first harry potter movie smooth 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.460
 ten million plus shares in the film 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.320
 winning a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.700
 then we come to the place to the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.470
 Actors because especially the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.350
 actor was becoming curious 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.510
 or turned out to be so michael 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.130
 Landon as professor dammel kept there 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.410
 his under his costume constantly his 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.180
 street clothes on and also in his 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.959

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.250
 stock of trains re locate de jong as off 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.740
 all film practically complete 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.240
 equipped character churchill has 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.440
 he actually does not occur for the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.150
 to audition 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.070
 just before your planned shopping tour 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.380
 she looked past her father 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.170
 you had a brief note so you had a look 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.420
 that baris of heart blood in these five going on 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.940
 the beautiful book really profound 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.280
 character of victor crown got in the movie 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.880
 even the task is difficult to master 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.850
 Two whole text numbers pay out 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.600
 to squeeze 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.120
 a total of 20 words, though 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.520
 sometimes they were in negative terms 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.830
 not idle at the effects 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.200
 underwater scene became all titanic in 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.150
 a huge artificial tank turned 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.520
 who was outfitted with blue screen 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.040
 because her ratcliffe leyen spent for 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.430
 the recordings just under 41 hours 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.100
 water 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.410
 he carried two ears of it 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.150
 for the film was actually a 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.710
 visual revision program 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.840
 requested that already for 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.090
 TV productions had been tested 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.710
 this so-called spot Rimowa was 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.590
 used for the skin impurities 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.220
 and pimples digitally to reduce 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.500
 no shit because it was make up team 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.150
 apparently too stupid or like none 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 became aware of Voldemort's nose 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.540
 meanwhile not with make-up 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.590
 covered but also digital 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.830
 away 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.970
 and, of course, had to fell 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.340
 starting material to be tampered with 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.470
 three main characters are missing 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.320
 for the purpose of the reduction completely in the film 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.300
 udo beckmann head of the ministry 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.310
 for magic sport and referee of 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.720
 eleven winky of which he was suspected 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.930
 would have shot it in the sky 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.330
 and berta jerkins this character became 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.280
 of voldemort and tail tormented 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.440
 them before the dramatic start of the tournament 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.890
 to betray where it is held 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.170
 would 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.820
 as Frank Price the janitor the 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.310
 They both talk and talk 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.720
 just about her death 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.300
 in the film, however, was one 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.760
 enrichment improvised crouch eating 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.560
 who pretends to be moody has the tick 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.400
 frequent with the tongue over the lips 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.010
 to drive 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.810
 after the second job as a senior 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.450
 meet under faked moody 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.150
 Do you think senior crouch would have this 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.800
 tick noticed in the flashback as a herb 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.930
 A gate was charged better 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.530
 this part is very prominent 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.160
 available 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.080
 All this is not included in the book 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.880
 and for some reason that took away 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.950
 teach him the freedom out 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.150
 voldemorts resurrection the text line 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.790
 build on the road lie in willing 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.740
 are about to change, however, in German 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.630
 you actually made the effort 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.600
 to pick out the original place and 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.880
 correct to sync with 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.160
 Unknowingly, the conclusion included the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.900
 credits the hint that no kites 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.440
 to damage during the shooting 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.810
 came 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.150
 the firecracker had to be the first harry 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.960
 potter- part pc leads him as a rating in 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.030
 take a purchase 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.650
 and accordingly and if I have this 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.990
 message misinterpret should do 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.690
 I'm sorry but the island just seems 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.850
 a synchronization for very, very very 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.800
 to make profitable children's films or 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.990
 movies for the whole family 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.950
 because the audience just because of 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.060
 of the foreign rating of pg 14 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.680
 was restricted took place this time 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.190
 no synchronization like that 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.200
 looks 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.240
 for this harry potter part we lie 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.620
 Unfortunately, this time no pay and 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.620
 revenue in comparison
