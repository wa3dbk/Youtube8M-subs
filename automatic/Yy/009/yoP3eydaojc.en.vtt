00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.810
 hello to all of you welcome on 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.050
 gameblog.fr I come out of a small 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:38.020
 presentation of wwe touquet sixtine with 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.270
 you see him the friend daniel bryan who does not 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.090
 will not be on the cover since this 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.940
 this honor will come back to stone cold steve 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.710
 austin the legend of the only Roman wrestling 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.690
 never stop renting when we 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.130
 are then an action then the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.200
 presentation consisted basically 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.870
 to show us the highlights of this 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.019
 new version that will be released on the 30th 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.980
 october this year on ps3 ps4 xbox one 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.260
 and xbox 360 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.250
 the things that have been most emphasized 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.019
 the points that were the most 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.960
 underlined concern in particular 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.760
 the animation the mocap was redone there is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.880
 a lot more animation of 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.560
 transition that have been proposed the other 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.120
 thing and it shows for those 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.780
 animations it was much better rendered 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.220
 than in the previous edition 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.570
 the other thing that was important for 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.340
 they were talking about the roster we had 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.430
 already had the information but actually 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.170
 there will be one hundred and twenty 120 wrestler and 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.070
 diva that will be modeled 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.140
 it's twice more than the year 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.480
 last is a roster of the most 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.880
 complete to have fun in arena then at 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.950
 level of the game modes do not talk about 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.770
 there is also there will be the obviously the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.110
 the mic has nothing that will come back with a little 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.160
 more personality that will be added 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.750
 throughout the season there will be a 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.860
 third commentators also like who 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.170
 will be added we still do not know who 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.940
 who it is, but obviously it's okay 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.410
 to be someone prestigious the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.450
 universe mode returns the touquet show 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.820
 case is back 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.690
 now if we take inside 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.200
 same game 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.820
 what we were able to see and down there 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.930
 are small small amenities 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.910
 that we were when were granted for 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.110
 for years the game a little more balanced a 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.130
 little nicer I talked to you about 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.230
 animations and down there is a small element 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.040
 who is nice to know that 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.040
 reversal this year are no longer 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.050
 unlimited so I think I understood 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.420
 that now he's recharging is when 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.550
 we were working members of a 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.830
 opponent in the ring but are no longer 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.900
 limited so we will have a counter of 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.640
 reversal during the match and it's a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.530
 something quite logical because 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.820
 it's true that in match if you look 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.680
 a wrestling match and but that are not going 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.420
 they will not counter everything that goes 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.250
 what they will choose their moment for 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.500
 try to have a kind of de 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.060
 theatricality to the whole so that was 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.740
 some of the things we could see we have 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.810
 saw two fights with their entry 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.390
 obviously we saw the entry of finb 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.570
 so this kind of warriors 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.020
 painted on the ground that makes it 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.750
 his time 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.270
 by the way there is a new feature 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.590
 which was implemented there is a counter 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.680
 which appears at the top and if you want 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.930
 being opponent cut the entry of 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.700
 your of your opponent you can 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.860
 perfectly do it so we saw it 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.080
 the entry of finb then with the same the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.600
 same scenography the same for this 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.610
 rollins the world champion who was 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.190
 also available without confronting all 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.400
 two we saw a match also between daniel 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.070
 bryan precisely against bad news bar 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.930
 and well it allowed us to see a little 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.200
 little that it was a little more dynamic 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.880
 better animate a little prettier too 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.140
 could see that wrestlers cases 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.430
 was really better done than at 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.459
 level of the middle class at their level 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.320
 little faces over this year 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.030
 visibly it is that in the scanning 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.040
 which was redone a facial scanning 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.890
 because the tools have been improved 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.370
 and they added emotion on 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.989
 the faces 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.780
 so when I have emotion it's not 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.940
 they will whine and hop direction 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.810
 oscars no what will happen in fact 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.269
 that's when they will take shots 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.519
 down it will show on their face when I 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.850
 do not know is a wrestler will end up 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.770
 in a corner on the ground slumped after 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.120
 have been screened eh ben 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.200
 imagine daniel bryan will put him a 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.430
 blow of pump in the mouth it is going to be 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.660
 see on his mouth that he's trying to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.370
 to take a blow of pump and to 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.990
 to walk on it so it's 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.070
 small rather small additions for 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.560
 the moment who are my own faith to do 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.180
 case that makes the fans of wrestling 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.910
 will now have to see my controller in 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.130
 hand if all that works well if we 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.080
 can really have a little bit of rhythm at 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.870
 during games if the gameplay is 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.340
 well balanced we seem to be gone 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.380
 for but you never know 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.289
 actually if this collaboration 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.899
 between yuxi and 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.580
 of italy of the young and go well in this 

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:53.119
 one-way match that's it I remember more 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.800
 the name of the studio 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:57.409
 not serious will correct me 1 you 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.569
 do not hesitate in the comments 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.860
 to tell me who the other studio is 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.189
 you make a little quiz like that will be 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.990
 not bad 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.810
 short 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.580
 you will see I hope we can 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.260
 see soon of the Roman body to have 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.840
 soon what that gives joystick in hand 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.130
 little reminder anyway also one of the 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.520
 most important thing 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.460

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.660
