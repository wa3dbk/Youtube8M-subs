trapeze<00:01:05.750> you'd<00:01:06.380> never<00:01:06.560> think<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:06.979> can

on a trapeze before before the
Paralympics<00:01:11.060> before<00:01:11.690> my<00:01:11.840> son<00:01:11.900> watched<00:01:12.350> me<00:01:12.619> he

Paralympics before my son watched me he

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.500 
Paralympics before my son watched me he
used<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.159> tell<00:01:13.340> me<00:01:13.490> he<00:01:13.640> didn't<00:01:14.240> want<00:01:14.270> his

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
friends to see that I've got new legs

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.340 
friends to see that I've got new legs
because<00:01:16.460> he<00:01:16.729> used<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.510> say<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:17.780> was<00:01:17.869> cheating

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
because he used to say it was cheating

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.170 
because he used to say it was cheating
and<00:01:18.439> really<00:01:18.950> I'm<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.070> little<00:01:19.400> person<00:01:19.580> the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
and really I'm a little person the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.790 
and really I'm a little person the
London<00:01:20.479> Paralympics<00:01:21.110> will<00:01:21.260> have<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.410> huge

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
London Paralympics will have a huge

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.090 
London Paralympics will have a huge
impact<00:01:22.070> it<00:01:22.760> will<00:01:22.910> showcase<00:01:23.180> diversity

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
impact it will showcase diversity

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.490 
impact it will showcase diversity
quality<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.370> show<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.390> we<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:26.960> do<00:01:27.110> anything

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
quality and show that we can do anything

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.780 
quality and show that we can do anything
look<00:01:28.190> at<00:01:28.340> us

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.450 

I<00:01:36.140> think<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.710> Paralympics<00:01:38.250> made<00:01:38.430> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I think the Paralympics made a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.880 
I think the Paralympics made a
difference<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.390> people's<00:01:39.720> food<00:01:39.840> while<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.800> was

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
difference to people's food while it was

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.660 
difference to people's food while it was
on<00:01:41.040> TV<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:41.940> sadly<00:01:42.420> had<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.020> gone<00:01:43.460> back<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
on TV now sadly had just gone back to

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.630 
on TV now sadly had just gone back to
how<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.910> was<00:01:44.970> before

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.399 

I<00:01:47.760> definitely<00:01:48.510> think<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.020> has<00:01:49.140> changed

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
I definitely think it has changed

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.610 
I definitely think it has changed
perceptions<00:01:50.400> of<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:51.150> of<00:01:51.270> people<00:01:51.690> maybe<00:01:52.409> not

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
perceptions of a lot of people maybe not

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.719 
perceptions of a lot of people maybe not
everyone<00:01:52.979> you're<00:01:53.130> never<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
everyone you're never going to get to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.950 
everyone you're never going to get to
everyone

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
everyone

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.960 
everyone
hopefully<00:01:56.960> this<00:01:57.110> time<00:01:57.350> next<00:01:57.530> year<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.850> know

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
hopefully this time next year you know

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.370 
hopefully this time next year you know
it<00:01:59.240> will<00:01:59.420> still<00:01:59.660> be<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.870> sin<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.290> the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
it will still be the sin and the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.490 
it will still be the sin and the
attitudes<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.190> people<00:02:01.250> will<00:02:01.610> stay<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.030> way

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
attitudes of people will stay that way

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500 
attitudes of people will stay that way
hopefully
