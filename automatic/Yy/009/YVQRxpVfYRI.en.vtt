00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 d 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.650
 of yours and camacho I would like to enter 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.750
 around this 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.390
 for this they have to know the scale 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 of two which already on a good video 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.560
 start today we're going to try a new topic 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.440
 which is called the double of strings or of 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.620
 This barb consists of three strokes 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.040
 of the prong in on two strings when it comes 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.170
 the double I'll explain more 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.539
 with the pick 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.190
 I'm going to play the last two strings or 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.839
 the first these two 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.130
 and I'm going to make a move with the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.770
 doll 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:15.340
 which is this way he touched this rope and 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.980
 then the one below also and the same as 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.940
 I touched up 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.940
 something like that 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.390
 as they dominate slowly they go 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.390
 raising the speed 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.590
 so that also the doublet since what 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.140
 dominate well let's start playing the 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.180
 song we started with the double in the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.570
 scale of two on the first note that is 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.570
 here 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.280
 we continue it 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.100
 Y 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.770
 and the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.890
 Y 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.340
 let's that the last 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.769
 or not 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.080
 and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.530
 d 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.340
 and finish the song and then decorated it 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.340
 studies we arrived here 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.060
 we play here and from here 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:46.719
 we descend on the scale of 2 which already 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:47.950
 they must know clearly and then they 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.609
 I recommend that you make the movement of 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.609
 this way 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.310
 again 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.609
 only the three notes 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.890
 then 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.790
 Y 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.990
 and we do the same thing here so very 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.990
 okay listen to it slowly 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.320
 and there the ornament ends 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.270
 accompaniment will be areola 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.950
 song so that practice together 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.280
 with me since they have learned the 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.280
 requinto 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.780
 is 4 have the throat 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.780
 so much 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.930
 as for you 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.130
 I felt it very well to be seen 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.169
 how are the times so it looks good 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.700
 the ornament and everything I hope you like them good 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.430
