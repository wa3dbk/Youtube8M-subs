00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.410
 Well today I am going to teach you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.260
 I'm going to show you one of the things that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.590
 I'll teach you to do this then 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.060
 it's a little ice cream that I made that is very 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.030
 easy one 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.670
 this is a pizza this is a manzanita 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.410
 and those in other manzanitas 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.770
 they also come to do this 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.160
 little tray and these eggs that I made them 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.900
 with silicone and a foami fish and this 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.750
 cheese cake or whatever it 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.080
 I made with polymer clay and silicone 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.970
 these are some cookies that I made 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.640
 also assists with polymer clay and 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.649
 I painted them over them and put them in frost 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.649
 that's a brownie with ice cream 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.050
 the coni is very big but 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:02.410
 as well and this is done with brownie 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.629
 made with a sponge and the cone is made 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.600
 with toilet paper 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.280
 this is a halloween dessert and also 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.710
 I did it with polymer clay and what 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.310
 I painted 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.299
 and these are pastures to the Bolognese and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.390
 They did with cardboard hardness or 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.630
 I also did it with con with cardboard 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.159
 white of colors and milk 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.509
 this painting gives over 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:34.780
 so I also made this milk 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.299
 I printed out by the computer for 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.030
 some templates that I got from my frob 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:46.450
 and this is one is a channel speakers 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.200
 English and what about them here is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.329
 idea for example in this in my frog and 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.030
 estube get these templates that is 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.219
 is a program in English and the problem 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.310
 is that it is very difficult to understand 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:03.069
 so they can look at them 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.439
 give an account of what they say then 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.229
 that was all for today's video and 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.590
