00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello after another cool 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.370
 life turn 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 I used to catch myself thinking that if 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.220
 know something a little bit earlier 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 would lay a straw and wondered what 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.830
 if much of what we are taught 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.099
 life would teach us more in school but how 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.920
 it says better late than you know 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.360
 these are practically the secret keys to life 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.280
 that I should have known at school 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 first only 20 percent of yours 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.800
 activity is for real 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.559
 effective they bring you 80 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.770
 percent of your income look back 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.780
 around a lot of what you do not 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.640
 so necessary as you think 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.129
 and much you can score the second you can 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.859
 do what you need much faster 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.719
 what do you think do not pull rubber because 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.210
 the more time you spend on 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.590
 the task you spend the more 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.869
 wasting ahead of events do not slow down 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.670
 it will not only save you from expectations 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.710
 well, you will take pleasure 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.580
 will feel that you can masterly 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.590
 manage your life mistakes allow 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.350
 gain invaluable experience learn 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.930
 Lots of interesting and become successful 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.299
 as success in life often comes 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.150
 only if you don't give in 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.280
 failures and mistakes he comes only to 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.590
 persistent 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.090
 don't treat yourself too critical it 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 only creates additional unnecessary 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.200
 inner pain and takes away precious 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.189
 time your relationship changes reality 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 pessimism 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.270
 can hide behind the mask of realism this 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.060
 happens when you are tuned to perception 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.630
 negative and accordingly you only see 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060
 him 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.579
 that's why you find yourself every 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.310
 just like the right neighbor, but I 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.680
 spoke on the other hand maybe 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.110
 better not to be right in such situations 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.509
 if you try to change drastically 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.729
 your attitude instead just 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.010
 consider this opportunity you will 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.730
 pleasantly surprised 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.069
 thanks easy way 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.220
 feel happy here 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.770
 great feeling of gratitude 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.030
 only a minute or two 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.250
 is a great way 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.010
 turn bad mood into good 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.050
 it supports your positive and helps 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.560
 concentrate on the right goals a 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.260
 still making others happy 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.920
 the queue will make you whine even happier 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.519
 is logical 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.150
 emotions are contagious without comparing yourself to 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.980
 by others 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.049
 if you start to compare yourself with 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.269
 by others you allow the outside world 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.700
 control your sense of self 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.310
 and mood swings provided to you 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.830
 it is much more important to compare yourself only with 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.930
 yourself to see you go ahead or 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.120
 no and what goals achieved 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.340
 maybe it doesn't sound like that 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.650
 great but in the end it is 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.610
 will bring inner peace and strengthen strength 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.010
 will and leave a positive in the shower 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.860
 most of what you're afraid of 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.980
 never happen in reality 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.410
 Relax 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.350
 these monsters only exist in your 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.019
 head and even if it does happen 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.390
 then more often it will not be so terrible 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.780
 how much did you expect and worry 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.989
 prove to be a waste of time not 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.660
 take it all too seriously 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.910
 today it seems a big problem you 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.430
 don't even remember in three years if 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.920
 treat yourself to your thoughts and emotions 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.450
 too seriously it will only bring 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.579
 unnecessary suffering 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.829
 so as you relax all is well it 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.370
 there was a program 10 for the channel pleased 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.370
