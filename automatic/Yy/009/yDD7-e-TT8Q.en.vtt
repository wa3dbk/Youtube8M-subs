00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.740
 do not slow down at all the shooter does not 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.390
 stop and do not stop in the past 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.760
 years has been the reference genre 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.440
 I started and video game consoles and practically 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.150
 since its inception has had 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.890
 formidable representatives who have 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.320
 captivated the attention of millions of 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.010
 players around the world but all that 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.010
 you already know 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.060
 us what we want on this occasion 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.980
 is to show that there are great games of 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.200
 shots for you no matter your tastes 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.810
 as we already did with the report about 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.910
 the rpg experience in the variety is 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.130
 the taste true then here we present 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.870
 the best representatives of each type 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.500
 of shooter during the generation of 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.110
 playstation 3 xbox 360 wii and the latest 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.479
 years of pc there are in the first person 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.060
 there are in the third there are futurists 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.979
 there are wars the backdrop gives us 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.840
 same but forget about those who mix 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.790
 shots with driving cars with 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.979
 adventures and platforms or with stealth 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.000
 here what we really care about is 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.000
 kill the bad guys 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.910
 as it has been happening in the past 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.650
 times what has most abounded in the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.870
 action has been the shooters at first 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.610
 person the reasons are clearly 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.920
 related to the immersion that 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.600
 it causes you to feel inside the action and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.610
 probably when haiti software 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.620
 began to popularize all this not 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.030
 imagine the amount of jewelry for 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.030
 that would end up being inspiration 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.750
 but the last few years are the ones that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.729
 they are interested and here there have been so many 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.710
 impressive titles that cost a lot 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.780
 choose our favorites we could 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.119
 start with several or that made us lose 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.850
 the head with its underwater city its 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.950
 splicers and of course their big daddy's 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.570
 one of the most fascinating worlds that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 we have enjoyed in the history of the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.619
 video games clear that if we refer to 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.660
 the fantasy is impossible not to think about 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.789
 the zombies of some leds by ted that have 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.770
 copado the activity indexes online 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.930
 but although it is fundamental to start with 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.000
 the underwater utopia of ken levine and by 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.739
 the undead would also be unfair 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.900
 forget about other great works of 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.940
 fantasy like a metro saga that has 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.100
 managed to immerse ourselves in a post universe 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.210
 apocalyptic as we had never before 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.790
 viewed 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.530
 a greeting 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.959
 if we talk about action in the first person 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.750
 futuristic the offer is wild and of 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.609
 very great quality the saga hello has 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.739
 offered in this generation some of 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.480
 his best episodes and we have also 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.090
 enjoyed a lot with the exponents 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.340
 graphics of kill sound and of a crisis 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.290
 that they started in an unbeatable way 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.510
 first delivery is unforgettable post 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.890
 that with his artificial intelligence 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.049
 huge environments and powerful technology 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.389
 it is still for many one of the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.430
 best works of the genre of the new 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.019
 ips we are left with a resistance 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.849
 adrenaline - charged with 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.290
 multiplayer of tight and fall and 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.510
 especially with the fantastic 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.519
 borderlands that has created a marriage 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.650
 extraordinary between the cooperative and the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.300
 cult to arms 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.940
 to follow your impression 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.100
 and more things of course in a profile 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.810
 The FARCRY and their 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.550
 paradisiacal islands and freedom 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.950
 overflowing but we can not either 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.020
 forget about all the wars with call 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.030
 of duty at the head has been one of the 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.590
 most popular sagas of the generation and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.700
 has been crowned as one of the brands 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.740
 Most sold 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.630
 battlefield have not been laced 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.790
 with his approach even more focused on 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.650
 the multiplayer has also had time 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.330
 to enjoy a the new world air 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.580
 that has helped to recover the brand 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.320
 wolfenstein his proposal mixes with 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.450
 grace what we expected from a game of 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.670
 war and all the artistic freedom that 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.440
 allows fantasy because killing Nazis 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.480
 in the Second World War attracts 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.070
 anyone but still more kick the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 back to the drive in a reality 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.200
 alternative in which they dominate the world 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.380
 night that franklin there have been great 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.090
 absent that is clear for example this 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.980
 generation that has just finished have not 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.990
 had his own half life but 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.160
 settle for the orange box is not 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.160
 no nonsense truth 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.250
 when the camera comes out from within 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.669
 our head and it is placed in our 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.130
 back 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.959
 we have a totally different subgenre 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.430
 it might seem that the difference between 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.960
 the shooters in first and third 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.820
 person has to do only with the 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.820
 perspective but it would not be true 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.390
 for example games like those in the series 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.710
 girls of war show it with their 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.840
 bet to inject a light 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.640
 tactical component not only put of 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.590
 fashion the use of coverages but that 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.020
 they also achieved a viscerality in their 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.910
 really brutal violence while the 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.340
 saga has maintained the level quite well 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.500
 of aggressiveness and quality others do not 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.960
 have made so much plans to put the 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.820
 case started with a lot of force but 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.820
 it has been deflating matching game 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.520
 the one that maintains its aggressiveness and bad 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.440
 milk is a max payne that in the past 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.930
 years has only given us an adventure 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.970
 although truly memorable rockstar 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.620
 he picked up the relay of remedy and left us 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.060
 one of the best shooters in third 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.060
 person of the last years 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.970
 but there are also many people who are not 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.860
 it's worth it just by shooting some 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.840
 amateurs demand that an experience 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.580
 shooter will focus on the action but with 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.040
 additives that give you an incentive to 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.570
 kill the staff we talk clear about the 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.710
 who prefer the action products 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.710
 with a tactical component 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.969
 there are many examples of great 

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:37.769
 videogames that in recent times we 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:40.019
 have admired introducing a point of 

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:41.969
 strategy and even allowing us to give 

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:44.129
 orders to our colleagues in time 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:46.199
 real for example comes to mind a 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.119
 rainbow six that with the two episodes of 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.129
 vegas left a great taste in our mouths 

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:51.989
 there has also been time to enjoy 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.789
 of the ghost recon that are now a 

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:55.799
 little forgotten but that with advanced 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.959
 warfighter and his second part we 

00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:59.849
 they left with their mouths open in these 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:02.069
 years these formulas have not abounded but 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.759
 who knows maybe they hit back hard 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.759
 in this generation 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.250
 we do not want to close this special without 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.990
 remember also the subtopics that 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.360
 rather classic style that still 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.040
 continues to give us great joys in fact 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.380
 one of the best samples is that of 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.730
 laugh with that against all odds 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.260
 has become one of the best 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.310
 releases of what we take from 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.310
 playstation 4 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.570
 On the other hand geometry words has 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:34.220
 He left a lot of quality with his deliveries of 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.690
 xbox 360 ds and wii and b6 this has been one 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.400
 of the great remakes of the past 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.480
 generation in terms of shooting and 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.480
 shoot from ships 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.160
 also in a very different style either 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.990
 we can miss the opportunity to 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.780
 mention the new episodes of series 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:54.310
 as powerful as against or metal slug in 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.310
 about your theme with horizontal scroll 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.330
 but last shooting shots 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.830
 on rails they have been on the decline in 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.870
 the last years and not even 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.180
 franchises like house of the dead have 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.979
 managed to revitalize that subgenre without 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.870
 However there have also been some rays 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.580
 of light and I'm going to delight the 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.650
 who like these proposals 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.349
 We personally recommend the crazy 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.810
 sin and punishment successor of skies 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:20.879
 besides umbrella chronicles one of the 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.440
 most controversial residents but also 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:24.620
 one of the highest quality in this 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.620
 generation 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.480
 and the most recent years have been 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.400
 particularly generous in terms of 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.070
 high-level shooters and the offer has 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.170
 been extraordinary in 3d games we believe 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.360
 that there have literally been shots for 

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.430
 all tastes and with this video we have 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.130
 tried to prove it we killed 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.330
 a lot and well on pc and consoles and nobody gets 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.520
 can complain that they have missed 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:49.240
 precisely the cartridges and long life 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.240
 to the shooter
