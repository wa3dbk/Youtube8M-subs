00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.890
 part of oxford years 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.180
 the ter is now 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.280
 the device jr m2 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.170
 the was delivered woman is at the hospital of 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.970
 timone the acquisition of this 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.540
 equipment is a major breakthrough in 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.540
 hospital environment 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.480
 it is installed in an extension 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.400
 specially built in the center 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.130
 metabolic exploration by resonance 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.020
 magnetic the cemerem these images 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.390
 will offer medical teams 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.070
 unparalleled precision close to the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.080
 microscopy 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.040
 you see it's a magnet to this tesla 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.110
 it is an element 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.910
 particularly powerful to give a 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.949
 order of thought most drm to 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.340
 the current time is 1 5 tesla 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:52.670
 we have a proportion of about 20% 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.070
 3 tesla donations that are already a 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.960
 Magnetic effluent force enough 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.820
 high and now so we move on to a 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.409
 more than a factor 2 compared to the more 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.600
 powerful so far it's up to 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.680
 say 3 tesla to chasselas this 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.630
 equipment will allow advances 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.850
 major in the diagnosis prognosis 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.140
 and multiple therapeutic follow-up 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 pathologies such as diseases 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.100
 neurological and psychiatric 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.810
 cardiovascular rheumatologic 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.140
 that we will increase the capacity 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.610
 to record the signal ie 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.530
 to record what comes from the organs 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.030
 and therefore to make images of what 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.020
 comes from the organs and that's the reason 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.400
 for which we will increase the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.230
 resolution so extremely 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.550
 important because we will be able 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.500
 almost doing microscopy 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.660
 they live at that ie to have a 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.350
 resolution of around a hundred 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.730
 micrometers 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.800
 while until now we are 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.760
 capable of having the resolutions of 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.880
 millimeter order 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.070
 next to this anatomical resolution 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.630
 we also have the possibility of being able to 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.610
 measure compounds that was not 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.110
 measurable hardly measurable 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.060
 like sodium for example which is a 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.410
 major component of particular cells 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.550
 excitable cells like 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.930
 cells are there in the brain of the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.700
 spinal cord in the heart in the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.110
 muscles what we could start 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.250
 develop at 3 tesla and that we will 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.320
 develop obviously so 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.510
 much larger at 7 and this 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.550
 thanks to this intense magnetic field 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.950
 the handling of the machine requires 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.659
 some expertise of many tests 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.030
 will be realized before they can 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.830
 enjoy his power next to his 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.050
 abilities there are also the difficulties 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.659
 to run these machines and have 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.909
 good quality images that will know 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.080
 without artifacts especially so it's for 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.340
 that they are not machines at all 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.300
 push buttons machines that are 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.920
 ready for clinical use 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.850
 today and that is why it 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.500
 need 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.960
 specialized sites like ours 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.940
 since the crm is both a service 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.130
 hospital that belongs to the cluster 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.350
 medical imaging but also a 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.940
 part of a resonance lab 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.220
 magnetic and the center of resonance 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.780
 magnetic geological and medical and 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.850
 so it's a multidisciplinary team 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.680
 who will run this machine with 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.870
 doctors of course but also 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.520
 physicists of the researchers who are going to be 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.890
 able to implement 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.140
 make this tool work which still 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.520
 once is an accomplished tool but who 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.630
 still asks for developments have 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.700
 faces technical difficulties 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.050
 with them that was what drives us a 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.060
 little in our entrenchments as to 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.470
 methodological developments and its 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.850
 its methodological developments 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.560
 methodological solutions like to put 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.390
 in place with the set and it goes us 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.250
 to solve problems 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.720
 that we even had 3 tesla or 1.5 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.190
 tesla is therefore to evolve also 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.600
 these machines that are once again 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.510
 the most common machines to 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.560
 the current time in the in the park of 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.180
 say m 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.680
 in France and in the world the implementation 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.750
 service will be effective in the middle of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.730
 summer 2014 and the first protocols 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.830
 with patients should start at the 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.600
 end of the year this equipment will be 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.910
 open to local collaborations 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.520
 national and international 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.590
 that industrial partners with the 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.730
 first there is queen this tesla installed 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.800
 in a hospital in France 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.750
 marseille confirms that she is one of the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.280
 most active global platforms 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.280
 in preclinical and clinical imaging
