for<00:01:01.650> the<00:01:01.890> moment<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.519> what<00:01:02.670> else<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.910> have

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
for the moment and see what else we have

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.790 
for the moment and see what else we have
in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> box<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.800> various

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
in the box so here we have various

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.400 
in the box so here we have various
pieces<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.399> paper<00:01:08.820> work<00:01:09.149> that<00:01:09.509> were<00:01:09.720> unlikely

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
pieces of paper work that were unlikely

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.600 
pieces of paper work that were unlikely
to<00:01:10.619> read<00:01:11.030> cut<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> way<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.610> we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to read cut those out of the way and we

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.230 
to read cut those out of the way and we
have<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.619> buds<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> earphones

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
have the buds for the earphones

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.790 
have the buds for the earphones
presumably<00:01:18.690> there<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.930> phones<00:01:19.289> in<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.680> as

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
presumably there are phones in there as

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.050 
presumably there are phones in there as
well<00:01:19.830> somewhere<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.590> then<00:01:22.590> we<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
well somewhere and then we have a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.830 
well somewhere and then we have a
standard<00:01:24.060> micro<00:01:24.630> USB<00:01:25.289> charging<00:01:25.890> cable<00:01:26.070> here

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.109 

here<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.410> power<00:01:31.979> adapter<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.759> two

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
here we have a power adapter in two

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:42.090 
here we have a power adapter in two
parts

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.160 

then<00:01:42.760> there<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.450> actual<00:01:46.600> air<00:01:46.930> phones

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
then there is the the actual air phones

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.190 
then there is the the actual air phones
themselves<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.979> go<00:01:48.159> with<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> earbuds<00:01:48.790> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
themselves to go with the earbuds and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.249 
themselves to go with the earbuds and
finally<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.500> battery<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.690> there<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:52.990> have<00:01:53.110> it

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
finally the battery so there you have it

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.289 
finally the battery so there you have it
that's<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.680> contents<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.369> box<00:01:54.580> we<00:01:55.119> will

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
that's the contents of the box we will

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.090 
that's the contents of the box we will
be<00:01:55.450> firing<00:01:55.810> up<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> phone<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.619> putting<00:01:57.009> it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
be firing up the phone and putting it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.920 
be firing up the phone and putting it
through<00:01:57.220> its<00:01:57.310> paces<00:01:57.430> very<00:01:58.000> soon<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:58.540> stay

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
through its paces very soon so stay

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.060 
through its paces very soon so stay
