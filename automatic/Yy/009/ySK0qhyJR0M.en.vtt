00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello with you sysadmin Alexander and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.730
 I will tell you about creating a new raid 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.840
 server chipset c220 series 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:18.090
 such 3c 222 chipsets 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.960
 with 224 226 specifically my mother 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.689
 intel board from 1200 to 3 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.180
 but the video will be interesting and the owner 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.910
 other motherboards let's go right away 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.689
 let's get down to work in bios click 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.719
 f2 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.600
 bios here the principle of ordinary go 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.430
 go to the advanced tab and select mass 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.489
 storage controller configuration 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.899
 now choose the mode of the controller 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.120
 sata there is a rhythm from consisting of 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.629
 several options the first option of this srt 2 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.020
 the second option is rst in general than 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:04.260
 It is different rst it is in my opinion faster 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:07.229
 but with RT-2 supports driver 1 x further 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.130
 look at the boot options go to the menu 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.840
 boot communities and choose 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:19.040
 drives we see what's there 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.360
 two discs with a priority and do not call in two 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.939
 flash drives that also do not remain for us 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.500
 system blocks 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.579
 now we need to save it all 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.110
 click at 10 click yes and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.150
 reboot earlier to create 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.500
 we needed a site when booting the system 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.710
 click for example control and or kontrol 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.020
 possible control e but now in these 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.270
 new motherboards 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.680
 missing red configurator 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.140
 and to create wright we need 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.880
 boot like this boot 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.280
 I drive intal 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.189
 this drive was bundled with the maternal 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.549
 A board further we insert this disk after 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.430
 reboot press f6 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.700
 menu, select download 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.810
 Sidir 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.890
 siege rum is already worth this drive 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:17.480
 load minimum of disk components 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.650
 screensaver must read the license 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.530
 accept click further go 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:31.550
 raid configurator choose wright 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:36.300
 control and there is a choice or choose 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:40.110
 recovered raid is two levels 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.360
 or choose that zero wright then 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.620
 there is a quick breeze but I'm sort of for 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.610
 servers choose 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.050
 raid level 1 is not a mirrored raid 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.170
 for greater server reliability and pushing 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.290
 create a raid pass small 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.500
 amount of time and us pops up 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.840
 the message also tries to pass 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.959
 further there is an interesting menu 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.480
 function, you can update the bios show how 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.510
 this is done by special can be updated 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.200
 Internet settings or prescribing 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.239
 flash drives 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.910
 but here I have for example from the Internet is not 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.100
 it turned out to update just did not find but 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.390
 version 1 exit reboot 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.410
 go to the boot menu and select 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.840
 boot from flash drive on my flash drive 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.190
 unpacked view of sam and driver 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:43.410
 for two raid controllers and that is 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:48.570
 rt-2 and rst further we will begin installation 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:51.690
 I will show how to integrate drivers from 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.030
 cover to cover read the license push 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.560
 Next, select the full installation 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.740
 as we can see there is no raid array 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.450
 on which we would install windows then 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.770
 so he appeared we need to download 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:13.490
 driver choose this driver here it is in 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:17.250
 daddies windows 7 64 bits this driver 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:22.200
 now there is after we have it 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.970
 we choose should appear there immediately 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.640
 I will say I filmed this moment specifically 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:35.810
 to show the mistake i made 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.810
 and I want to warn you of her 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.740
 but until we wait for the installation to complete 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.740
 drivers 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:52.620
 Now the driver is getting everything 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.620
 appeared and marked place in this he 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.810
 we press our array further and here is the error 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.150
 the installer cannot find 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.790
 existing or create a new system 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.980
 section 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.050
 Now I will show what to do if 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.160
 you will have the same problem 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.900
 first close all these windows and 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.380
 restart the computer in order to 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.260
 go to bios after reboot click 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.240
 and v2 go in bios choose item 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.720
 absence 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.300
 choose hardy skoda and here we need 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.440
 put in first place 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.770
 raid controller 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.740
 accordingly choose glad control 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.610
 press enter and then we would choose 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.970
 priorities 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.979
 from a specific hard drive flash drive 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.500
 It is also considered as a hard disk 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.509
 This cant further choose the priority of 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.810
 all devices in the first place put 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:50.650
 too happy controller further push and in 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.659
 ten and save now I'm a little 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.220
 apply cunning and video editing and 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:57.099
 will mount and that place where we 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.440
 stopped and there was a mistake then after 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:03.180
 start installing windows and we chose 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.590
 full install install the driver and 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.840
 after the driver is installed 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.979
 there should have been a section with no 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.440
 marked area of ​​the disk but when we 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:18.340
 We started to install windows on it from 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.580
 there was an error but now the error has disappeared 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.840
 click next install windows a 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.569
 started successfully 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.740
 while the installation is going I would say 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.849
 a few words about the speed of work in the raid 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.400
 solid state hard drives 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:36.810
 I tested solid state hard drives 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.580
 kingston special server series and 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.300
 measured their work speed in different 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.810
 raid configurations and on different raid 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.360
 controllers plus I compared 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:53.289
 z77 raid performance 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.319
 with built-in red controller and got 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:58.000
 very interesting results 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.460
