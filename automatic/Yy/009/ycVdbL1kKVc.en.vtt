assuming some of these people are
elderly<00:01:16.890> people<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.580> assuming<00:01:17.790> there

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
elderly people and I'm assuming there

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.490 
elderly people and I'm assuming there
they<00:01:18.360> include<00:01:18.630> complications<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> like

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
they include complications of like

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.749 
they include complications of like
breaking<00:01:19.650> their<00:01:19.950> hip<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> things<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
breaking their hip and things like that

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
breaking their hip and things like that
but<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.540> assuming<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.259> our<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.619> children

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
but I'm assuming just our or children

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
but I'm assuming just our or children
maybe<00:01:23.490> infants<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.299> things<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.659> fall

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
maybe infants and things like that fall

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.450 
maybe infants and things like that fall
over<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> bed<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.650> there's<00:01:25.830> I'm<00:01:26.280> sure

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
over the bed so there's I'm sure

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.940 
over the bed so there's I'm sure
