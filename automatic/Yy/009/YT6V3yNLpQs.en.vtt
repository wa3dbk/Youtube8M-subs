to work with but at the same time it

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.289 
to work with but at the same time it
gives<00:00:14.219> me<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> little<00:00:14.670> bit<00:00:14.790> more<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.120> work<00:00:15.269> with

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
the lighting might not be perfect so

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.250 
the lighting might not be perfect so
actually<00:00:20.609> after<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> show<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.480> each<00:00:21.779> polish

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
actually after I show you each polish

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.109 
actually after I show you each polish
I'm<00:00:22.410> about<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.800> talk<00:00:22.949> about<00:00:23.279> I'll<00:00:23.760> try<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
I'm about to talk about I'll try to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.529 
I'm about to talk about I'll try to
insert<00:00:25.109> an<00:00:25.350> image<00:00:25.550> with<00:00:26.550> better<00:00:26.789> lighting<00:00:27.119> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
insert an image with better lighting so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.849 
insert an image with better lighting so
you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.439> know<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.710> that's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you can see because I know that that's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.650 
you can see because I know that that's
super<00:00:29.130> important<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.420> annoying

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
when you watch videos that the color

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.600 
when you watch videos that the color
isn't<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.850> when<00:00:33.450> they're<00:00:33.600> talking<00:00:33.809> about

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
isn't right when they're talking about

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you know a nail polish or something that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.470 
you know a nail polish or something that
you<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.380> see<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> colors<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.480> hopefully

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you want to see the colors so hopefully

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.090 
you want to see the colors so hopefully
I'll<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.750> good<00:00:39.899> pictures<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.710> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
of have a variety of China Glaze and OPI

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.060 
of have a variety of China Glaze and OPI
and<00:00:56.850> stuff<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.449> first<00:00:58.140> I'm<00:00:58.469> starting<00:00:58.890> off<00:00:59.039> with

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
pictures will come but this is OPI is my

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.060 
pictures will come but this is OPI is my
private<00:01:06.030> jet<00:01:06.080> there<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.229> million<00:01:07.650> versions

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
private jet there are million versions

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.770 
private jet there are million versions
of<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.270> there's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
of this out there I think there's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.480 
of this out there I think there's
different<00:01:10.110> levels<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.979> holographic

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
different levels of the holographic

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
different levels of the holographic
glitter<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.860> have

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
glitter in it I don't think I have

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.940 
glitter in it I don't think I have
anything<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.840> particularly<00:01:15.950> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
anything that's like particularly you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
anything that's like particularly you
know<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> ones<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.670> hard<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.030> find<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
know the ones that are hard to find I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.999 
know the ones that are hard to find I
have<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> green<00:01:18.990> writing<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> bottom<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
have the green writing on the bottom I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
have the green writing on the bottom I
don't<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.670> super<00:01:21.479> special<00:01:21.869> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
don't think it's the super special one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.280 
don't think it's the super special one
but<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.340> gorgeous<00:01:23.549> color<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.420> almost<00:01:24.990> like

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
but the gorgeous color it's almost like

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
but the gorgeous color it's almost like
a<00:01:25.320> deep<00:01:25.880> grayish<00:01:26.880> brown<00:01:27.299> black<00:01:28.430> with<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.700> bunch

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
a deep grayish brown black with a bunch

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.060 
a deep grayish brown black with a bunch
of<00:01:30.030> tiny<00:01:30.329> holographic<00:01:31.049> glitters<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:31.920> it

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
of tiny holographic glitters but then it

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.160 
of tiny holographic glitters but then it
kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> reflects<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.150> brownish<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.900> red

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
kind of reflects a brownish like red

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.130
