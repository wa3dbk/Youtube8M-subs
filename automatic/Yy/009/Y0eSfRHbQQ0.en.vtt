00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
 its part the students of food engineering perform their practices in 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.790
 the dairy plant 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.400
 today the students are developing a dairy plant of the university 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.229
 of the Amazon 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:14.239
 the practical part of the subject technology artés during the 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.369
 Semester development is based on the theoretical part 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.349
 to then experience the scientific processes involved in the production 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.050
 and the transformation of milk 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.289
 for the production of different productions such as yogurt 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.689
 kunis and cheeses 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 we are developing the practical part of the afternoon 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.710
 I have done in these courses are essentially developing the part 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 theoretical about a year ago 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 success the scientific processes that 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.920
 involves the production and transformation of milk 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.280
 and the silver pilot honda works with a painful Amazon 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.500
 it develops 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.990
 the practical cover 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.110
 at this moment as I said we are with 25 students 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.440
 developing another one of a technological process of elaboration of milks 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.510
 fermented 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330
 we are in the previous stages 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.230
 to the elaboration of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.260
 how can you give 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.880
 there is a source of work 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.120
 We're in process 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.000
 quality control I do not know what happened in the formulation 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.210
 It is important to emphasize that before entering the dairy processing plant 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120
 go through a quality control 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.880
 here the conditions of a lord piccolo must be the best in the processes 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 productive of dairy processing the laboratory of the dairy plant 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.740
 fulfills important functions here the students with the support of the engineer 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.030
 analyze the physicochemical variables to determine ideas and the cidac of 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.130
 milk and with this result know if it is suitable for transformation into 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 this case to perform the production of youku 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.020
 we will play another car 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 we are going to a criminal trial 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.880
 determination with which to choose 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.050
 one is the one that is not below one eye 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.340
 as little 0 90 grams per 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.420
 and some children who do not exceed what he says as author 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.550
 in total you have to have the ideas 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.950
 in the third quarter set and 18 degrees pain 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.289
 which percent account for other parameters established by the standard 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.850
 as reported 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.169
 check 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.069
 I believe that the fact does not fear 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.409
 the expulsion 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.340
 which is indicating that viabaja entitled 'la 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.340
 the ace of the series that is 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.169
 as we can see 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.859
 that spending approximately 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.839
 1 points 5 milliliters 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.719
 what is clear about what that commercial area has for the trip 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.709
 in that way 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.250
 we conclude that it may be affected for watches has been carried out 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.149
 jobs 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:45.209
 This formula determines the amount of microorganisms that is present in the 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.819
 milk 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.030
 microorganisms that are responsible for converting sugars spaces 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.629
 the judge altered milk levels 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.629
 the Swedish parliament under 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.519
 e banks because there is no problem whatsoever which means that the 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.539
 enresa milk came up as to plant 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.179
 but if the law that is found 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.729
 above the bank means there are a number of microorganisms 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.949
 ep alters the commission of the fact 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.469
 also the levels can call you at level 1 and level 2 of train level 4 in the 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.249
 5 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.529
 for being an acceptance level 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:24.259
 which voted as it locks the fair of 3 level 1 and level 2 in the three 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.199
 comes behind rivas peña 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.779
 the conditions are 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.049
 quite 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.779
 hinaco appliances once verified this data starts the whole process of 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:34.919
 transformation 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.309
 In the formulation phase mixture is quantified inputs that are 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:43.680
 vana and swamp the raw material such as sugar and milk powder pay them 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:48.249
 specific and precise characteristics to the finished product the milk to be 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.159
 a raw material with high water content nutrients such as proteins 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.229
 and carbohydrates is a propitious medium for bacterial proliferation is by 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.229
 that must go through the pasteurization process 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.709
 it was that famous efe logo 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.709
 all the flora japan 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.119
 the post process 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:10.869
 that what is being done at this moment 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.459
 I want to make a clarification 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.089
 just behind the monumental 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:16.979
 in any case nothing increases at the time of the plant 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.349
 we have sea 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.939
 it was the clothing that 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.849
 Decree 30 76 requires the norm 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.849
 our clothing before the white 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.749
 mo'tassim parlamento mascara 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.849
 we have some processes 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.849
 to what the regulations 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.189
 this only raw material excellent quality 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.819
 fruit of production 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.110
 by the way, it must be like that 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.710
 the conference is where they decide to please 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.849
 it is a fact that proceeds 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.020
 of the collection what you have at this moment 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.919
 depending on the needs 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.190
 very good qualities 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.009
 physical-chemical high 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.550
 average of fat 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.490
 and that at this moment we are holy dessert for the ing 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.039
 any kind of agreement of what you can be present 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.119
 after this process 6 100 to liuzzi use elaborated in the stage of 

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:08.520
 mesquid formulation 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.110
 comes a cooling 46 degrees centigrade an ideal temperature for 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.360
 the development and growth the act so vulgar and sti is little thermophilus 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.770
 two microorganisms that convert yogurt milk and are responsible for 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.909
 Arles characteristics of color zambotti texture of the product 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.169
 after this process comes the incubation for four hours you have to 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.220
 leave it full rest lechín to then spend the product 18 hours per 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.339
 refrigeration 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.059
 here the essences and colorants are added 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.919
 and in the packaging a refrigeration quality control and its commercialization 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.479
 The plant has an internal and external infrastructure according to the 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.830
 needs of production processes 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.939
 free pollution funds complying with the regulations as 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:56.969
 the law requires according to decree 30 76 of 1997 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.759
 the plant has already been visited by the invima the national institute of 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.439
 food and medication surveillance 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.080
 we went to the same last year's visit 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.569
 the seconds with the recommendations of form not of fund 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.680
 and as we know we can say that it leaves the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.810
 the dairy plant 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.779
 of the eurozone universe meets the parameters 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:18.699
 quality 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.629
 regarding logistics conditions and production processes 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.870
 the program includes food from the University of the Amazon 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.650
 is training students with practical theoretical criteria in processes 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.850
 real productive processes that can be found later when they are 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.999
 professionals 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:37.580
 eto'o the contribution 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.740
 I wish him well 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.740
 through the program 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.789
 professionals worth the redundancy 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:47.759
 in the confectionery 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.930
 on the one hand it does enough 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.830
 to face an increasingly competitive labor market 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.020
 the university of the amazonía through the plant of dairy 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.300
 will continue to contribute to the professional training of students of the program 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.780
 Ingest food with fundamentals and practical experiences in processes of 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.680
 production today the students know the scientific processes that the 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 milk processing for the production of the 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.729
 different productions like kumis that those scoundrels buck 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.639
 there are different homemade productions made by them 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.050
 they like it at the University of the Amazon
