should contain an interesting plot in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
should contain an interesting plot in
your<00:01:04.530> story<00:01:05.270> stories<00:01:06.270> need<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> be

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
your story stories need to be

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
your story stories need to be
entertaining<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.920> means<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.520> need

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
entertaining which means that they need

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.969 
entertaining which means that they need
to<00:01:09.060> string<00:01:09.570> us<00:01:09.750> along<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.439> make<00:01:10.560> us<00:01:10.680> want<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to string us along and make us want to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.530 
to string us along and make us want to
know<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.490> what's<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.090> happen

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
know more about what's going to happen

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.710 
know more about what's going to happen
so<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.409> need<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.950> make<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> interesting<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so you need to make it interesting as

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
so you need to make it interesting as
far<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> plot<00:01:16.229> goes<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.430> very<00:01:17.640> good<00:01:17.790> way

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
far as the plot goes and a very good way

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
far as the plot goes and a very good way
to<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> hook<00:01:18.960> us<00:01:19.140> into<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> story

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to do this is to hook us into the story

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
to do this is to hook us into the story
if<00:01:20.610> you're<00:01:20.820> writing<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> longer<00:01:21.390> novel<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.680> can

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
if you're writing a longer novel you can

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
if you're writing a longer novel you can
have<00:01:23.070> hooks<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.549> ends<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.000> chapters

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
have hooks at the ends of your chapters

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.830 
have hooks at the ends of your chapters
so<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.229> example<00:01:25.640> if<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.390> hook<00:01:27.630> as

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
so for example if you think of a hook as

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
so for example if you think of a hook as
a<00:01:27.869> commercial<00:01:28.320> break<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:29.159> television<00:01:30.259> you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
a commercial break on television you

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.429 
a commercial break on television you
know<00:01:31.729> some<00:01:32.729> big<00:01:33.060> information<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.840> revealed<00:01:34.200> at

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
know some big information is revealed at

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
know some big information is revealed at
the<00:01:34.530> end<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.799> your<00:01:34.890> chapter<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.610> you're

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the end of your chapter and you're

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.240 
the end of your chapter and you're
waiting<00:01:36.810> until<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.350> next<00:01:37.380> chapter<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:37.979> see
