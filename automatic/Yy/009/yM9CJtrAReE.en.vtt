00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.430
 hello we are here in skud then let's go 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.860
 to perform a flow test in a 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:21.640
 chevy multiport acceleration body 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.640
 for which 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.920
 let's put it first stock without 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.350
 Modify 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.350
 and we are going to give him a pressure of 3 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.210
 inches of water column that is to the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.870
 specification that you have to do this 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.870
 type of test 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.879
 in this case he gave us a group of 53% 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.789
 now let's place the body of 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.789
 modified acceleration 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.190
 which already has the kite open to 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.040
 100% 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.290
 we dump on the equal test plate 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.130
 way you have to do the same 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.009
 Pressure 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.659
 to which the test was done in the background 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.039
 acceleration stock 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.039
 inches of water 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.039
 in this case 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.039
 gave us a flow of 70 and 4.5 percent 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.510
 to find the difference is not going to be 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.300
 hypnotic differential but relative 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.300
 we make a simple rule of three 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.819
 gives us a 40 point 56 percent more than 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.819
 flow 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.159
 and that's it and I hope you enjoyed 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.159
 of this action
