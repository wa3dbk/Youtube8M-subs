00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hi people thanks for turning on 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.500
 Today we want to compare that 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.559
 google nexus 7 2013 the ipad mini the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:18.029
 first generation under sony xperia or 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.850
 net age 60 70 79 aluminum glass and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.320
 polycarbonate so three very 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.970
 different smartphone tablet or 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.930
 Tablets however one does that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.939
 would like to designate 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.369
 We want them exactly and indeed 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.430
 really in detail answer exactly that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.020
 will make you wish you much fun 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.329
 First of all , the material was in 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.510
 direct comparison arrive in principle 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.860
 on the datasheet sounds natural 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.780
 Polycarbonate not quite as valuable as it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820
 for example, glass or aluminum 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.920
 However, I have to say that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.760
 All three really very good 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.250
 feel 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.600
 the ipad mini will probably be at the top of the list 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 we can see that right here in the direct 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.860
 compare with the polycarbonate now with 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.270
 then the glass will probably be the glass 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.989
 come and then comes the polycarbonate 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.149
 so ipad mini xperia worth age and 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.100
 then probably the google nexus like 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.340
 but if you notice that in your hand, 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.299
 that all three are really good 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.049
 are processed there is nothing there 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.939
 to complain 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.390
 and then, of course, is still the factor 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.770
 because what lies as best in the hand 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.689
 you look at the whole of the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.090
 side will be another picture 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.369
 I'll go from factor size to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.320
 operation in high format and 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.570
 If I look at it that way then it is there 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.950
 clearly the google nexus live entirely 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710
 far ahead because it's easy on the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.869
 width and form factor of that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.729
 how it feels very much of optics 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.560
 awesome in one hand to wear it 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.350
 and just the other chambers then 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.030
 then tap the sony xperia will come 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.920
 So that you are great with one hand 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.329
 can grab and then tap with others 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.860
 but of course you can see it on the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.720
 nexus seven significantly more because of it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.130
 just a bigger display has that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.960
 ipad mini is if you ask me 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.490
 clearly too heavy and with one hand 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.770
 that does not really fit 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.869
 because it's just way too wide 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.630
 Of course now my opinion but the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.399
 but you should know also from the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.100
 There are many many connections 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.200
 differences during the experience et 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.750
 Altera and the nexus of course look up 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.729
 a micro-usb connection is apple 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.140
 once again 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.390
 one way and has the lightning 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.700
 Connection admitted the whole extreme 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.890
 practical that you can always run it purely 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.390
 No matter how you got it on the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.930
 the other side it is simply the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.120
 Scarcity towards absolutely fred almost 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.400
 somehow I do not think I can find 3 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.110
 because this one is forced to complete 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 I can buy new accessories 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.129
 typical micro-usb plugs take the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.480
 You do not want to change at home like that 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.129
 definitely needs a lightning 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 for example, if it breaks 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.780
 you get a new and sorry for the bargain 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.390
 buy micro usb cable you have everywhere 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.489
 lying around from the old smartphone or too 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.680
 because you need the pons that is 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.540
 Definitely something the tablets and 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.329
 smartphones as you would call them 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.680
 also distinguish a big one 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.410
 difference is the memory extension 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.920
 while the sony xperia becomes alcohol 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.230
 64gb micro sd card can expand 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.900
 you neither the nexus 7 nor the ipad mini 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.000
 somehow expand and also with the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.359
 speakers must be distinguished 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.590
 Although the ipad mini has more or less 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.879
 stereo speakers because it's just two 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.709
 has on the bottom 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.540
 however, they are not really smart 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.669
 that will be positioned at the nexus seven 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.380
 solved much cleverer than there 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:23.480
 one on the left and 1 on the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.220
 opposite side at the ipad 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.470
 they lie as mentioned and next to each other 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.599
 so only on one side of the stone 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.310
 extreme weather, the problem does not exist 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.989
 There is only one in one 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.970
 artificial little speaker on the 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.889
 bottom 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.750
 otherwise there is the usual house 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.609
 power button and volume 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.440
 which of course is available at all 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.269
 plus a front camera and a 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.209
 main camera synonymous that can be found on one 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.310
 devices and of course the different ones 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.959
 display and also the operation is 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.970
 distinctly different while on 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.560
 much about an ipad mini 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.720
 one can also regulate one 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.940
 physical home button that you naturally 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.489
 below below the displays will be included 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.769
 the other the sony xperia setra and 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.690
 the nexus he works on on screen 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.849
 keys below the display 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.769
 are found and depending on how it is 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.540
 is to turn with the display if 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.310
 you let it rotate once the whole 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.720
 takes a little bit away from the display 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.269
 but it is also a very 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.010
 intelligent solution 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.140
 I think as a look into the design 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.729
 that will be enough you will see how 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.510
 are they what i built for 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.610
 materials 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.020
 are all important and all very 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.160
 detailed left and then it was 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.930
 even with this video 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.120
 I hope I could ask you some 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.520
 clarify some things you want to know 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.990
 you now learned and yes that was it then 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.160
 also with this video I thank you for 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.160
 your time is good
