00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello, I wanted to share today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.040
 impressions about the robot vacuum cleaner 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 firms quick to the marking him 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.199
 gave this device is not a new one 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.390
 year thing cool self vacuuming itself 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.910
 gets up charging only trash itself 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.300
 not throwing out but basically everyone 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 happy wife and I don't have to do anything 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.420
 he just vacuuming somewhere after 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.270
 cleaning once a day need to throw out the trash 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.480
 because I have been programming for three days 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.700
 a week vacuuming it with this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.620
 copes after cleaning comes in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.860
 container to warm the container is removed 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.530
 easy principle here we press a button here 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.559
 this is a container here it is like 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.270
 Looks like the principle is a cute robot already 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.719
 more advanced container there 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.690
 differently they did but we say and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.560
 This is normal so he copes 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.610
 running and running on 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.610
 here she starts to go vacuuming 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.460
 all cool can 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.710
 program either by day or by 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.470
 full that he himself discharges the battery 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.810
 charging and go out again but and cumin in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.990
 the fact that he has them once so we 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.840
 at night she started working therefore 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.899
 programmed for three days a week 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:41.159
 given enough time for it to 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.679
 clean the small room here it is everywhere 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.470
 calls in if you have 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:49.679
 low that is vice versa high 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:56.940
 let's say bed tone ipad bed drives in 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:59.119
 all this is good here so can 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.520
 put it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.149
 forced to base then now looking 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.149
 search base 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.830
 also he gets up after charging when u 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.780
 him charging starts to set himself 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.480
 automatically switches to this mode and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.450
 starts to let the base in order to 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:25.720
 you can manually charge to it 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 also comes a remote control for 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:35.350
 program let's say so considering the top 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 Naturally there is no well, in general, a toy 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:45.370
 cool maybe 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.549
 the robot is even cooler for the experiment took 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.819
 here is this knock here is this base here it is to her 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:56.530
 drives up here he has parked and now 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.450
 worth it so charging up to that point 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:05.350
 while he has a programmed day 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.280
 not appointed okay everyone yet will be 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.280
 different videos
