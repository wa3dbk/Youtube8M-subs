00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.369 

all<00:00:11.959> right<00:00:12.139> I'm<00:00:12.620> gonna<00:00:12.709> give<00:00:12.920> it<00:00:13.009> a<00:00:13.070> go<00:00:13.219> today

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:14.379

all right I'm gonna give it a go today
not<00:00:15.379> holding<00:00:15.860> out<00:00:16.010> for<00:00:16.070> much<00:00:16.400> because<00:00:17.590> it's

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
not holding out for much because it's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.830 
not holding out for much because it's
minus<00:00:19.009> five<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:22.119> think<00:00:23.119> the<00:00:23.210> ground<00:00:23.450> might<00:00:23.689> be<00:00:23.810> a

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
minus five I think the ground might be a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.790 
minus five I think the ground might be a
bit<00:00:24.050> too<00:00:25.270> hard<00:00:26.270> to<00:00:26.419> do<00:00:26.540> anything<00:00:26.809> but<00:00:29.800> gonna

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
bit too hard to do anything but gonna

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.940 
bit too hard to do anything but gonna
give<00:00:30.950> it<00:00:31.009> a<00:00:31.040> go<00:00:32.140> see<00:00:33.140> I<00:00:33.170> get<00:00:33.440> on<00:00:35.559> this<00:00:36.559> is<00:00:36.710> an<00:00:36.800> old

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
is the gap through to the field Sam I'll

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.730 
is the gap through to the field Sam I'll
look<00:01:17.570> see<00:01:18.080> what<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.320> looks<00:01:18.470> like<00:01:20.740> it's

I think I might stick to the edges to

00:01:49.100 --> 00:02:00.100 
I think I might stick to the edges to
slow<00:01:49.310> down<00:01:49.520> look<00:01:51.820> as<00:01:52.820> deep

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
I'll stick along the edge get back to
