00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.980
 that you have ended quintuple to whiskers with channel 2 sudoe 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.080
 in the tutorial bild two you will learn how they passed image with pencil effect as 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.759
 what you see on the screen you have to be original 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.579
 and the final effect here is having done 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.429
 well before starting this tutorial I want to tell you that 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.779
 Soon the first call to the digital kindi will be launched 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.589
 sorry 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.300
 the stellar soon indicate when uploading a good video call we will begin 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 the tutorial by opening the image 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.970
 in my case I'm going to open this 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.970
 the vpb something like that 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.070
 boza duplicate the implementation layer 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.700
 and 11 and the image mode and grayscale 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.420
 you are going to put not dock 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.390
 let's put discard 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.730
 and not what we see and we are going to press control more inc 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.160
 I'm not going to stay country doing well because the colors this layer we're going to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.690
 put a fusion model 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360
 overexpose polo 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.010
 good what gives a look that white but that we will go to filter 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.900
 blur and blur erosion oct here attending pixel number that you 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.890
 put us going to clarify cordoba obscures the image as you can see in my case 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.680
 I must with some difficult 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.410
 something like that I'm going to put because I would not be able to buy cap cap picture 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.410
 sorry again we are going to duplicate the image 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.340
 delinquency filter 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.980
 stylize yesterday edges 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.540
 will cause a very bad truth effect 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.180
 for that I did not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.290
 side the merger hoarding and let's put it in clarify 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.020
 well now let's go to the center stylize 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.380
 and we are going to highlight here you have to put at an angle 135 degrees 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 in height one pixel in quantity 100% 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.010
 Well let's see what and finally we'll go to what layer 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.110
 to buy and martÃ­n 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.509
 mozilla image mode and then and we will change rgb 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.780
 smell that erre that erre good we have here the final image 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.609
 and you and they want to change the color that is not lived you can propose with 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.989
 its step and change the color 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.139
 here you can not change the current saturation and luminosity 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.899
 Kyle can go moving stressed 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:29.309
 good wishes because this has been all for this video tutorial says goodbye to his friend 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:31.839
 emanuel from channel 2 workshop until next time
