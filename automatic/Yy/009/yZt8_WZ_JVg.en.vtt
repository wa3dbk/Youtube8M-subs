00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.370
 tomorrow is what we will build all 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.859
 our homes with a simple printer 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.809
 Giant 3d it's not a dream anymore 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.519
 already a reality several builders 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.860
 already offers it near Lille 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.420
 3d construction also planks on the idea 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.310
 we talk about it right away with gail 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.010
 collaro the co-founder of finding everything 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.560
 women and hello french 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.789
 hello gail collaro while when is 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.070
 what are you going to build your 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.960
 first house in 3d printers I 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.400
 believe it's in the boxes it's 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 in project or are you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 here we go 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 make a model prototype 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.719
 to show the possibilities show the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.120
 operation and 100 percent foresee 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.270
 do for this summer then we will do a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 first prototype is real and it will be 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 for late 2015 early 2016 so agree 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.879
 it's really possible we will have is this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.110
 that we can imagine that in a year I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.190
 call you say hello I want 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.690
 build my house is what you 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.559
 can make me a 3d false house 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.390
 with a printer 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.910
 that's all right so that's 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.790
 feasible within two years or more 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.890
 less there now there is china the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.710
 united states in holland also finally 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.020
 each has its particularities but it's 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 already feasible it's already done yes it's 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.340
 already that's what I've already seen 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.439
 Chinese company windson decoration you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 have already had to hear about it had 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.189
 hit the headlines in 2014 in 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.479
 building ten houses in less than 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.390
 twenty four hours with a material 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.890
 hybrid cement-based classic you 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.299
 also you do in recycling 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.790
 that's what you want to do one of 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.650
 but with houses in penalties material 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.540
 recyclable and reusable that's it 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 that's exactly where we're in 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.630
 contact with a lot of companies 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.850
 because our goal is really to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.369
 make an association and close in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.560
 humanitarian project and we are in 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.490
 association with renowned schools 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.210
 with lots of little professionals and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.280
 who are going to regroup and lyon who are 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.439
 each experts in their field for 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.780
 allow here is the find different 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.479
 interview 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.600
 and possibly recycle on site 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.780
 also the materials to create concrete 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.300
 and to be able to print directly 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.890
 without having to carry yeah but you 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.360
 and in addition you want to do it my open 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.620
 source it's priest the plans to 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.780
 provision for the public 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.880
 so that's really not to do 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.770
 something more creative it's 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.360
 really a humanitarian goal and power 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.800
 to house people who are in the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.090
 need 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.160
 at first we were sent 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.330
 especially my machines in africa for 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.890
 can a person and that's already 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.900
 possible we can send a machine in 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.550
 Africa have said that they watch with 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.380
 what materials wants to work and then 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.910
 we can do the house here but everything 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.070
 that must be further developed so the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.580
 machine but not yet and the materials 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.670
 or down there and it's finding 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.090
 really the most ecological material 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.150
 possible and maybe that too 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.769
 the sand straw no matter what 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.590
 was there any more 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.209
 constraints having question legislation 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.340
 or even question of the price of the machine 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.329
 man pons and basically is that it's 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.280
 feasible right now or is it 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.720
 there are still constraints to respect a 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.670
 specifications in France and 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.410
 lot of regulations do 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.290
 there too it will be the case for a house 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.160
 3d at the level of urbanism that's for sure 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.600
 that in europe 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.030
 we will see many more problems 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.510
 than when in Africa where there is a lot 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.489
 of places where planning will be 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.549
 a lot less problems and yes 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.260
 okay and I also saw that at the level 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.859
 foreigners we are also in 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.470
 firstfruits 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.940
 I saw that neither a professor 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.640
 south carolina university had 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.200
 developed a robot prototype capable 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.750
 already to build a house in less 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.480
 24 hours we already talked about the project 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.340
 Chinese where we are at this moment of 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.160
 this search on a house via 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.840
 3d printer is already possible where we 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.579
 is still there is still a lot of 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.310
 things to check before it's 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.280
 concretizable but currently the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.550
 problems they have 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.430
 he had imagined a huge machine and 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.230
 so that's the problem he was 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.450
 confronted that's why I imagined 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.910
 to another model of machine because 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.490
 their machine needs to be bigger than 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.820
 the house and there I the idea that I had 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.000
 it's printed from ore 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.260
 from the center of the house it was 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.700
 and suddenly it makes it possible to have a machine 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.780
 much smaller that of a private 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.490
 much larger houses 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.080
 we have already calculated the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.360
 importance and that's so there is no 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.130
 problem with all this so you 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.950
 are a robot actually a kind of 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.510
 folding cranes that unfolds and 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.010
 so once the house is over 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.100
 even when we have the tone above 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.510
 little robot can leave and after we can 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.570
 imagine also that it is a crane 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.260
 that a take from outside the same 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.900
 to do and so that's possible here 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.800
 a few months anyway you are 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.260
 we gladly have another little 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.180
 bridge is going to make models that 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.870
 will print public benches 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.020
 etc. 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.240
 things like that but the real 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.570
 prototype that first prototype contract 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.080
 it will be so in two years and that's it 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.479
 so we take a price but here soon 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.440
 a house in 3d printers maybe 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.979
 in Africa 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.270
 maybe a solution for housing lodge 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.070
 everybody 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.780
 with few means and maybe in 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.580
 France is it ever if the legislation 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.710
 evolves if you want to react to this 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.240
 interview to other interviews france 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.470
 there and it's happening on twitter with the 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.720
 hashtag will do this live tv 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.340
 discover each day in video those and 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.740
 those who innovate and move the big ones 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.460
 on our mobile apps and on background
