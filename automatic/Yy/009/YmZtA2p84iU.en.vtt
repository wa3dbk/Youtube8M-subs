00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.469 
at all so we'll look to looking for
grace<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.070> train<00:02:03.430> bring<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.759> conclusion<00:02:04.150> to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
grace and train bring a conclusion to

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.969 
grace and train bring a conclusion to
the<00:02:04.630> methanol<00:02:05.020> then<00:02:05.350> we'll<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.710> go

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the methanol then we'll have to go

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.460 
the methanol then we'll have to go
elsewhere<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.450> interesting<00:02:07.479> thing<00:02:08.259> is

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
elsewhere but the interesting thing is

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.180 
elsewhere but the interesting thing is
that<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.929> there's<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.290> catalogue<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.800> class

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
that and if there's a catalogue of class

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.210 
that and if there's a catalogue of class
that's<00:02:13.060> becoming<00:02:13.420> bigger<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:14.830> becoming

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that's becoming bigger and it's becoming

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.150 
that's becoming bigger and it's becoming
a<00:02:16.090> higher<00:02:16.630> standard<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.319> player<00:02:17.530> that's<00:02:17.680> no<00:02:17.950> get

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
a higher standard a player that's no get

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.580 
a higher standard a player that's no get
pictures<00:02:18.700> rather<00:02:19.660> than<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:20.050> four<00:02:20.320> awards

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
pictures rather than like four awards

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.920 
pictures rather than like four awards
for<00:02:20.980> five<00:02:21.220> weeks<00:02:21.430> ago<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:21.970> people<00:02:22.660> are<00:02:22.780> being

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
for five weeks ago so people are being

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.890 
for five weeks ago so people are being
here<00:02:23.110> like<00:02:23.260> loves<00:02:24.150> so-called<00:02:25.150> higher<00:02:25.390> level

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
here like loves so-called higher level

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.199 
here like loves so-called higher level
