00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
so now we move into the stomach let's

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.670 
so now we move into the stomach let's
look<00:00:03.179> at<00:00:03.360> just<00:00:03.540> characteristics<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
look at just characteristics of the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.860 
look at just characteristics of the
stomach<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.130> begin<00:00:05.400> with<00:00:05.580> so<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.629> empty

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
stomach to begin with so the empty

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.600 
stomach to begin with so the empty
volume<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.379> your<00:00:07.500> stomach<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.950> about<00:00:08.130> 50

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
volume of your stomach is about 50

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.270 
volume of your stomach is about 50
milliliters<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:10.110> full<00:00:10.349> volume<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.950> about<00:00:11.250> a

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
milliliters the full volume is about a

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.850 
milliliters the full volume is about a
thousand<00:00:11.969> milliliters<00:00:12.290> which<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.590> same

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
thousand milliliters which is the same

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.189 
thousand milliliters which is the same
as<00:00:14.099> saying<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.610> liter<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.450> stomach<00:00:15.809> secretes

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
as saying one liter the stomach secretes

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.080 
as saying one liter the stomach secretes
gastric<00:00:16.770> juice<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.430> we're<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> be

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
gastric juice and we're going to be

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
gastric juice and we're going to be
talking<00:00:18.420> about<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.320> gastric<00:00:19.740> juice<00:00:20.070> is

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
talking about what that gastric juice is

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.269 
talking about what that gastric juice is
here<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.660> little<00:00:21.689> bit<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:23.250> have

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
here in just a little bit and you have

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.189 
here in just a little bit and you have
contractile<00:00:24.060> smooth<00:00:24.390> muscle<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.810> lines<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
contractile smooth muscle that lines the

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.620 
contractile smooth muscle that lines the
wall<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:25.859> stomach<00:00:26.279> what<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.060> does<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
wall of your stomach what that does is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.290 
wall of your stomach what that does is
it<00:00:28.230> helps<00:00:28.380> pulverize<00:00:29.099> or<00:00:29.519> break<00:00:29.939> down<00:00:30.119> your

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
it helps pulverize or break down your

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.810 
it helps pulverize or break down your
food<00:00:30.449> particles<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:32.160> mixes<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> with

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
food particles and then mixes it with

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.459 
food particles and then mixes it with
the<00:00:32.969> juice<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:34.050> form<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.410> mixture<00:00:34.710> called<00:00:35.399> chyme

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
the juice to form a mixture called chyme

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.530 
the juice to form a mixture called chyme
so<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.649> no<00:00:37.829> longer<00:00:37.860> completely<00:00:38.700> resembles

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
so it no longer completely resembles

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.590 
so it no longer completely resembles
food<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.800> actually<00:00:41.010> ingested<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.360> let's

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
food that you actually ingested so let's

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
food that you actually ingested so let's
take<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> look<00:00:43.079> into<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> components<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
take a look into the components of the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.430 
take a look into the components of the
stomach<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> fundus<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
stomach so there's the fundus of the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.220 
stomach so there's the fundus of the
stomach<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.090> upper<00:00:48.600> part<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
stomach so that's this upper part of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.619 
stomach so that's this upper part of
your<00:00:49.289> stomach<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.850> has<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> thin<00:00:51.360> wall

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
your stomach here and it has a thin wall

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
your stomach here and it has a thin wall
that<00:00:51.899> easily<00:00:52.289> expands<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.550> contains

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that easily expands and it contains

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.779 
that easily expands and it contains
gastric<00:00:54.570> pits<00:00:54.780> below<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.980> fundus<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.550> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
gastric pits below the fundus is the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.660 
gastric pits below the fundus is the
body<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> stomach<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.050> has<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> gastric

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
body of the stomach it has a gastric

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.200 
body of the stomach it has a gastric
mucosa<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.750> folds<00:01:01.020> into<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.070> called

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
mucosa and it folds into what are called

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.109 
mucosa and it folds into what are called
rugae<00:01:03.650> what<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> figure

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
rugae what I want you to do is to figure

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.219 
rugae what I want you to do is to figure
out<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> function<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.520> rugae

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
out what is the function of the rugae

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.840 
out what is the function of the rugae
the<00:01:10.229> antrum<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> thickest<00:01:11.340> portion<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the antrum is the thickest portion of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.600 
the antrum is the thickest portion of
the<00:01:11.939> stomach<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> contracts<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.130> propels

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the stomach when it contracts it propels

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.390 
the stomach when it contracts it propels
the<00:01:14.790> chyme<00:01:15.060> into<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> small<00:01:15.930> intestine<00:01:16.470> we're

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the chyme into the small intestine we're

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.789 
the chyme into the small intestine we're
going<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.700> refer<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.799> gastric

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
going to refer to this as gastric

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.399 
going to refer to this as gastric
emptying<00:01:20.299> now<00:01:21.299> there's<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.780> section<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
emptying now there's one more section to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
emptying now there's one more section to
the<00:01:22.530> stomach<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> I've<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.850> listed<00:01:24.330> here

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the stomach that I've not listed here

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.770 
the stomach that I've not listed here
for<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> that's<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.860> pylorus<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.780> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
for you and that's the pylorus and so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
for you and that's the pylorus and so
that's<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.290> last<00:01:28.530> region<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.250> stomach

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that's the last region of the stomach

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.810 
that's the last region of the stomach
that<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> food<00:01:30.119> will<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.780> pass<00:01:31.049> through

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
that the food will have to pass through

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.090 
that the food will have to pass through
before<00:01:32.820> passing<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.990> small<00:01:34.590> intestine

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
before passing into the small intestine

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.670 
before passing into the small intestine
so<00:01:35.250> let's<00:01:36.150> zoom<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.810> these<00:01:36.930> gastric<00:01:37.470> pits

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
so let's zoom in on these gastric pits

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.950 
so let's zoom in on these gastric pits
for<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.310> moment<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.840> gastric<00:01:39.840> pits

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
for just a moment the gastric pits

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.010 
for just a moment the gastric pits
contain<00:01:40.470> secretory<00:01:41.009> cells<00:01:41.600> secretory<00:01:42.600> cells

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
contain secretory cells secretory cells

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
contain secretory cells secretory cells
based<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> name<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.640> could<00:01:44.790> guess

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
based on the name you could guess

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.550 
based on the name you could guess
they're<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> secrete<00:01:45.720> something<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
they're going to secrete something so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.800 
they're going to secrete something so
the<00:01:46.710> gastric<00:01:47.159> pits<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.270> into<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the gastric pits then go down into the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
the gastric pits then go down into the
wall<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> stomach<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.119> there<00:01:51.119> are<00:01:51.240> lots

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
wall of the stomach and there are lots

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.120 
wall of the stomach and there are lots
of<00:01:51.600> different<00:01:51.990> types<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.560> cells<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.040> are

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
of different types of cells that are

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.209 
of different types of cells that are
associated<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.240> gastric<00:01:54.720> pit<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> we

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
associated with the gastric pit so we

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.240 
associated with the gastric pit so we
have<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.610> mucous<00:01:57.060> neck<00:01:57.540> cells<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.590> blue<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
have the mucous neck cells in blue and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.149 
have the mucous neck cells in blue and
what<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> neck<00:02:00.420> cells<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.710> they<00:02:01.860> secrete

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
what the neck cells do is they secrete

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.580 
what the neck cells do is they secrete
mucus<00:02:02.399> which<00:02:03.299> may<00:02:03.540> help<00:02:03.810> protect<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.259> lining

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
mucus which may help protect the lining

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.590 
mucus which may help protect the lining
of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> stomach<00:02:04.790> then<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.210> gastric

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
of the stomach then we have the gastric

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.749 
of the stomach then we have the gastric
glands<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.350> contain<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.680> couple<00:02:08.250> or<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
glands and they contain a couple or a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
glands and they contain a couple or a
few<00:02:09.239> different<00:02:09.690> well<00:02:09.810> three<00:02:10.080> different<00:02:10.410> cell

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
few different well three different cell

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.559 
few different well three different cell
types<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.069> least<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
types at least the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.050 
types at least the
chief<00:02:12.689> cells<00:02:12.959> secrete<00:02:13.349> pepsinogen<00:02:14.060> so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
chief cells secrete pepsinogen so

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.709 
chief cells secrete pepsinogen so
pepsinogen<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> pepsin<00:02:16.560> precursor<00:02:17.719> pepsin

the<00:02:39.870> G<00:02:40.109> cells<00:02:40.409> secrete<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.799> hormone<00:02:40.889> called

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
the G cells secrete a hormone called

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.119 
the G cells secrete a hormone called
gastrin<00:02:41.969> so<00:02:42.719> again<00:02:43.049> gastrin<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> hormone

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
gastrin so again gastrin is a hormone

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.069 
gastrin so again gastrin is a hormone
very<00:02:44.669> important<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.269> regulation<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.959> the

very important in the regulation of the

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.860 
very important in the regulation of the
gastrointestinal<00:02:46.650> system<00:02:47.269> now<00:02:48.269> one<00:02:48.540> thing<00:02:48.750> we

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
gastrointestinal system now one thing we

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.559 
gastrointestinal system now one thing we
want<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.139> focus<00:02:49.349> on<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.889> why<00:02:50.549> is<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:51.209> lumen

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
want to focus on is why is the lumen

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.129 
want to focus on is why is the lumen
acidic

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
acidic

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.949 
acidic
well<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.280> lumen<00:02:53.639> has<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:54.090> be<00:02:54.209> acidic<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.719> order

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
well the lumen has to be acidic in order

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.500 
well the lumen has to be acidic in order
to<00:02:55.049> convert<00:02:55.349> pepsinogen<00:02:55.969> remember<00:02:56.969> that<00:02:57.269> this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
to convert pepsinogen remember that this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.929 
to convert pepsinogen remember that this
is<00:02:57.659> our<00:02:57.780> pepsin<00:02:58.199> precursor<00:02:58.739> over<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.549> pepsin

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
is our pepsin precursor over to pepsin

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.629 
is our pepsin precursor over to pepsin
if<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.810> lumen<00:03:01.139> is<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:01.469> acidic<00:03:02.040> pepsinogen

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
if the lumen is not acidic pepsinogen

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.929 
if the lumen is not acidic pepsinogen
will<00:03:03.209> not<00:03:03.419> be<00:03:03.629> converted<00:03:04.079> to<00:03:04.109> pepsin<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
will not be converted to pepsin and

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.970 
will not be converted to pepsin and
therefore<00:03:05.939> pepsin<00:03:06.599> will<00:03:06.810> not<00:03:07.049> be<00:03:07.290> active<00:03:07.799> and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
therefore pepsin will not be active and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.559 
therefore pepsin will not be active and
you<00:03:08.040> will<00:03:08.609> not<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:09.000> able<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.299> break<00:03:09.540> down

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
you will not be able to break down

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.379 
you will not be able to break down
protein<00:03:10.379> so<00:03:11.340> that's<00:03:11.639> one<00:03:11.849> reason<00:03:12.060> why<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
protein so that's one reason why the

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.390 
protein so that's one reason why the
lumen<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:12.959> acidic<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.680> second<00:03:14.099> reason<00:03:14.219> why

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
lumen is acidic the second reason why

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.220 
lumen is acidic the second reason why
the<00:03:14.579> lumen<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.120> acidic<00:03:15.419> is<00:03:15.659> because<00:03:16.049> it's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the lumen is acidic is because it's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.780 
the lumen is acidic is because it's
going<00:03:16.409> to<00:03:16.500> kill<00:03:16.799> any<00:03:17.069> foodborne<00:03:17.549> bacteria

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
going to kill any foodborne bacteria

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.599 
going to kill any foodborne bacteria
that<00:03:18.479> you<00:03:18.569> have<00:03:18.810> ingested<00:03:19.349> so<00:03:20.129> if<00:03:20.250> there<00:03:20.400> was

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
that you have ingested so if there was

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.610 
that you have ingested so if there was
bacteria<00:03:21.269> on<00:03:21.419> the<00:03:21.540> food<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.109> ingested

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
bacteria on the food that you ingested

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.830 
bacteria on the food that you ingested
the<00:03:23.129> bacteria<00:03:23.729> gets<00:03:24.000> down<00:03:24.239> into<00:03:24.419> the<00:03:24.540> stomach

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the bacteria gets down into the stomach

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:34.540 
the bacteria gets down into the stomach
and<00:03:25.199> the<00:03:25.470> acidic<00:03:25.829> environment<00:03:25.889> kills<00:03:26.549> it
