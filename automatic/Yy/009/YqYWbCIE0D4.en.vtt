engine of our ecosystem they stand

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.120 
engine of our ecosystem they stand
literally<00:01:19.320> between<00:01:19.740> us<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.310> our<00:01:20.520> food<00:01:20.820> in

researchers<00:01:23.130> say<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.780> one-third<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.020> her

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
researchers say that one-third of her

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.990 
researchers say that one-third of her
food<00:01:25.530> production<00:01:25.979> depends<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.820> bee

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
food production depends on bee

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.289 
food production depends on bee
pollination<00:01:27.920> what<00:01:28.920> happens<00:01:29.400> when<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.939> third

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
pollination what happens when one third

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.870 
pollination what happens when one third
of<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.840> employees<00:01:31.320> decides<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.640> come<00:01:32.670> to

of your employees decides not to come to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
of your employees decides not to come to
work<00:01:33.030> tomorrow<00:01:33.680> who's<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> call<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
work tomorrow who's going to call the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 
work tomorrow who's going to call the
customers<00:01:35.850> who's<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> make<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
customers who's going to make the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
customers who's going to make the
product<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.409> work<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.979> B<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> pollinating

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
product the work of the B is pollinating

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.260 
product the work of the B is pollinating
so<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.350> doesn't<00:01:44.220> happen<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.759> fine<00:01:45.030> man

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
so if that doesn't happen this fine man

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.260 
so if that doesn't happen this fine man
shows<00:01:45.600> us<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.020> economical<00:01:46.619> perspective<00:01:47.270> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
shows us the economical perspective the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
shows us the economical perspective the
impact<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:48.840> be<00:01:49.790> 265<00:01:50.840> billion<00:01:51.840> worldwide<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
impact will be 265 billion worldwide of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.639 
impact will be 265 billion worldwide of
valued<00:01:53.490> food<00:01:53.850> production<00:01:54.299> which<00:01:55.049> depends<00:01:55.530> on

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
valued food production which depends on

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.910 
valued food production which depends on
bee<00:01:55.829> pollination<00:01:56.450> yeah<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:58.229> quite<00:01:58.710> an

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
bee pollination yeah that's quite an

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.030 
bee pollination yeah that's quite an
impact<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.880> let<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> settle<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.860> make

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
impact so let that settle in and to make

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.249 
impact so let that settle in and to make
an<00:02:02.189> even<00:02:02.430> bolder<00:02:02.670> statement<00:02:03.119> Einstein<00:02:03.869> says

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
an even bolder statement Einstein says

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.270 
an even bolder statement Einstein says
that<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:04.770> cannot<00:02:05.130> live<00:02:05.549> without<00:02:05.820> bees<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> if

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that we cannot live without bees so if

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.530 
that we cannot live without bees so if
today<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.270> decide<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.899> do<00:02:10.020> nothing<00:02:10.970> some<00:02:11.970> say

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
today we decide to do nothing some say

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.720 
today we decide to do nothing some say
we<00:02:12.689> are<00:02:12.870> not<00:02:13.110> likely<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.739> survive<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.430> all<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
we are not likely to survive it all the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.470 
we are not likely to survive it all the
big<00:02:14.939> labs<00:02:15.829> in<00:02:16.829> China<00:02:17.670> they<00:02:18.000> chose<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.269> different

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
big labs in China they chose a different

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.140 
big labs in China they chose a different
way<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> handling<00:02:19.109> this<00:02:19.469> problem<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.760> chose

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
way of handling this problem they chose

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.990 
way of handling this problem they chose
