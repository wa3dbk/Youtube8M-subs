shift now when you do this you only want
to<00:01:00.879> spring<00:01:01.390> this<00:01:01.860> c-clip<00:01:02.860> enough<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.909> get<00:01:04.510> it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
to spring this c-clip enough to get it

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.080 
to spring this c-clip enough to get it
off<00:01:04.780> because<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.379> is<00:01:05.409> possible<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:06.100> unspring

the clip you want to put this someplace

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.620 
the clip you want to put this someplace
safe<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.630> secure<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.350> asphalt<00:01:12.040> to<00:01:12.220> colored

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.469 
safe and secure it is asphalt to colored
and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.950> there<00:01:15.280> is<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.460> washer<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.420> comes

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
and then there is a washer that comes

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.860 
and then there is a washer that comes
off<00:01:16.900> and<00:01:17.229> then<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.370> gearshift<00:01:18.850> slides<00:01:19.660> on

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
off and then the gearshift slides on

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.850 
off and then the gearshift slides on
first<00:01:21.810> you'll<00:01:22.810> probably<00:01:23.020> want<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.500> do<00:01:23.680> this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
first you'll probably want to do this

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.040 
first you'll probably want to do this
while<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.550> still<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.180> bike<00:01:25.330> unless<00:01:25.870> you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
while it's still on the bike unless you

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.200 
while it's still on the bike unless you
have<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.200> vise<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.860> your<00:01:27.010> shop<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.610> can<00:01:27.790> put

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
have a vise in your shop you can put

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.960 
have a vise in your shop you can put
this<00:01:28.330> in<00:01:28.510> a<00:01:28.570> vise<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:29.560> order<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:30.040> broke<00:01:30.730> this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
this in a vise in order to broke this

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.540 
this in a vise in order to broke this
post<00:01:31.360> loose<00:01:31.800> but<00:01:32.800> if<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:32.950> don't<00:01:33.130> have<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.280> vise

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
post loose but if you don't have a vise

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.920 
post loose but if you don't have a vise
doing<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.060> on<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.330> bike<00:01:34.510> is<00:01:34.720> fine<00:01:34.960> okay<00:01:35.830> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
doing it on the bike is fine okay so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.950 
doing it on the bike is fine okay so
there<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.140> locking<00:01:38.950> compound<00:01:39.190> on<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.630> post

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
there is a locking compound on this post

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.770 
there is a locking compound on this post
so<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.430> not<00:01:42.640> going<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.030> break<00:01:43.270> free<00:01:43.570> as

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
so it is not going to break free as

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.450 
so it is not going to break free as
easily<00:01:43.990> on<00:01:44.200> your<00:01:44.320> bike<00:01:44.710> because<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:45.100> doesn't

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
easily on your bike because it doesn't

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.310 
easily on your bike because it doesn't
line<00:01:45.670> right<00:01:45.880> here<00:01:46.120> because<00:01:46.540> mine's<00:01:46.840> been<00:01:47.110> done

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
line right here because mine's been done

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:59.220 
line right here because mine's been done
several<00:01:47.590> times<00:01:47.770> already

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.470 

now<00:02:00.230> we're<00:02:01.130> gonna<00:02:01.220> be<00:02:01.460> taking<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.030> look<00:02:02.180> at<00:02:02.330> the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
now we're gonna be taking a look at the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.680 
now we're gonna be taking a look at the
adjustable<00:02:03.440> version<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.480> mine's

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
adjustable version and you see mine's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:29.370 
adjustable version and you see mine's
already<00:02:05.930> put<00:02:06.230> together<00:02:06.380> I'll<00:02:06.770> take<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.980> part

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.500 

right<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.800> plate<00:02:31.070> looks<00:02:31.670> much<00:02:32.180> like<00:02:32.480> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
right so the plate looks much like the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.840 
right so the plate looks much like the
foot<00:02:33.260> peg<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.650> control<00:02:33.980> or<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.370> plate<00:02:34.610> right

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
foot peg and control or in plate right

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.620 
foot peg and control or in plate right
here<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.740> then<00:02:37.340> you've<00:02:37.490> got<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.970> selection<00:02:38.660> of

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
here and then you've got a selection of

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.690 
here and then you've got a selection of
basically<00:02:41.740> extensions<00:02:43.209> that<00:02:44.209> you<00:02:44.270> can<00:02:44.630> use

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
basically extensions that you can use

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.360 
basically extensions that you can use
those<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:47.209> we<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.540> took<00:02:47.720> out<00:02:47.959> goes<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.130> here

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
those that we just took out goes in here

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.970 
those that we just took out goes in here
now<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.610> will<00:02:49.970> want<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.300> use<00:02:50.390> Loctite<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.380> some

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
now you will want to use Loctite of some

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.120 
now you will want to use Loctite of some
kind<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.220> blue<00:02:52.459> loctite<00:02:53.740> it's<00:02:54.740> red<00:02:54.890> locking

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
kind of blue loctite it's red locking

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.310 
kind of blue loctite it's red locking
compound<00:02:57.520> here<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:59.360> I'll<00:02:59.510> I'll<00:02:59.870> screw<00:03:00.200> this

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:14.410 
in a second so on my bike I know I have
a<00:03:04.790> v2<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.560> my<00:03:08.170> shoe<00:03:09.170> size<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:10.750> 10<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:13.420> I'm

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
a v2 and my shoe size is a 10 so I'm

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.449 
a v2 and my shoe size is a 10 so I'm
going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.840> look<00:03:15.019> for<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:16.130> minimum

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
going to look for the the minimum

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.020 
going to look for the the minimum
extension<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:18.500> on<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:18.800> v2<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:19.610> going<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.940> be

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
extension and on a v2 that's going to be

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.530 
extension and on a v2 that's going to be
the<00:03:20.180> second<00:03:20.570> set<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:20.870> holes<00:03:21.110> because<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.540> peg

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
the second set of holes because the peg

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.120 
the second set of holes because the peg
position<00:03:24.050> on<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.350> plate<00:03:24.590> is<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:24.830> little

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
position on the plate is a little

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.190 
position on the plate is a little
different<00:03:25.430> on<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.640> v2<00:03:25.820> on<00:03:26.450> some<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.050> other

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
different on the v2 on some of the other

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.770 
different on the v2 on some of the other
bikes<00:03:27.670> probably<00:03:28.670> all<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:29.090> other<00:03:29.209> V<00:03:29.420> strums

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
bikes probably all of the other V strums

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.560 
bikes probably all of the other V strums
you<00:03:30.320> can<00:03:30.500> come<00:03:30.680> all<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:30.920> way<00:03:30.950> down<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:32.269> here

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
you can come all the way down to here

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.020 
you can come all the way down to here
and<00:03:32.750> if<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:33.860> are<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.100> size<00:03:35.110> 10<00:03:36.790> you'll<00:03:37.790> probably

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
and if you are a size 10 you'll probably

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.320 
and if you are a size 10 you'll probably
want<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.570> do<00:03:38.750> that<00:03:38.959> as<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.860> move<00:03:40.040> into<00:03:40.250> size<00:03:40.970> 12

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
want to do that as you move into size 12

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.009 
want to do that as you move into size 12
and<00:03:41.540> 13<00:03:41.989> you're<00:03:42.290> into<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.590> mid<00:03:42.769> holes<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.690> if

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
and 13 you're into the mid holes and if

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.460 
and 13 you're into the mid holes and if
you're<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.260> 14<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.340> 16<00:03:46.750> you'd<00:03:47.750> probably<00:03:47.989> want<00:03:48.410> to

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
you're a 14 to 16 you'd probably want to

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.509 
you're a 14 to 16 you'd probably want to
go<00:03:48.590> all<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.860> way<00:03:48.890> out<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.459> end<00:03:50.320> okay<00:03:51.519> I'll

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
go all the way out to the end okay I'll

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:07.089 
go all the way out to the end okay I'll
go<00:03:52.670> ahead<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.910> put<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.150> together

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.190 

and<00:04:08.099> again<00:04:08.430> you'll<00:04:08.790> want<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.120> use<00:04:09.239> thread

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
and again you'll want to use thread

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.679 
and again you'll want to use thread
locking<00:04:10.439> compound<00:04:10.799> on<00:04:11.310> these<00:04:11.969> after<00:04:12.569> you

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
locking compound on these after you

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.640 
locking compound on these after you
determine<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.780> extension<00:04:16.320> that<00:04:16.440> you're

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
determine the the extension that you're

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:36.149 
determine the the extension that you're
going<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.919> want

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
the extension that we've been able to

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.619 
the extension that we've been able to
get<00:06:34.919> this<00:06:35.919> is<00:06:36.129> where<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:36.460> post<00:06:36.970> used<00:06:37.330> to<00:06:37.479> be

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:37.629 
get this is where the post used to be

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.350 
get this is where the post used to be
and<00:06:38.500> this<00:06:38.740> is<00:06:38.800> where<00:06:39.069> the<00:06:39.190> post<00:06:39.370> is<00:06:39.669> now<00:06:39.880> moved

and this is where the post is now moved

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.730 
and this is where the post is now moved
forward<00:06:40.900> about<00:06:42.120> probably<00:06:43.120> a<00:06:43.150> inch<00:06:43.630> and<00:06:43.840> 3/16

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
forward about probably a inch and 3/16

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.219 
forward about probably a inch and 3/16
in<00:06:44.919> this<00:06:45.069> case<00:06:46.740> now<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:49.060> gear<00:06:49.780> shift<00:06:50.050> linkage

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:50.229 
in this case now the gear shift linkage

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.330 
in this case now the gear shift linkage
is<00:06:50.889> the<00:06:51.190> next<00:06:51.430> part<00:06:51.639> we<00:06:51.789> want<00:06:51.970> to<00:06:52.060> look<00:06:52.150> at<00:06:53.340> the

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
is the next part we want to look at the

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:02.120 
is the next part we want to look at the
top<00:06:54.880> part<00:06:55.240> is<00:06:55.509> a<00:06:55.690> standard<00:06:56.380> right<00:06:57.280> hand<00:06:57.550> thread

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.059 

okay<00:07:03.130> and<00:07:03.819> in<00:07:04.330> my<00:07:04.840> case<00:07:04.900> on<00:07:05.349> my<00:07:05.500> bike<00:07:05.740> I<00:07:06.009> know

00:07:06.059 --> 00:07:06.069 
okay and in my case on my bike I know

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.939 
okay and in my case on my bike I know
that<00:07:06.490> I<00:07:06.759> want<00:07:07.270> this<00:07:07.479> as<00:07:07.780> short<00:07:08.080> as<00:07:08.229> possible<00:07:08.259> so

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
that I want this as short as possible so

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.260 
that I want this as short as possible so
I'll<00:07:09.520> go<00:07:09.669> ahead<00:07:09.759> and<00:07:10.090> run<00:07:10.330> the<00:07:11.340> the<00:07:12.340> nut<00:07:12.580> down

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
I'll go ahead and run the the nut down

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.959 
I'll go ahead and run the the nut down
to<00:07:13.719> the<00:07:13.810> end<00:07:13.960> of<00:07:14.080> the<00:07:14.169> threads<00:07:14.469> and<00:07:14.830> then<00:07:15.729> lock

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:15.969 
to the end of the threads and then lock

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.689 
to the end of the threads and then lock
it<00:07:16.120> in<00:07:16.210> place<00:07:16.419> now<00:07:16.449> the<00:07:16.780> bottom<00:07:17.289> one<00:07:17.469> is<00:07:17.680> a<00:07:18.340> left

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:18.699 
it in place now the bottom one is a left

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:21.209 
it in place now the bottom one is a left
hand<00:07:18.940> thread<00:07:19.090> so<00:07:19.930> you<00:07:19.960> would<00:07:20.469> turn<00:07:20.770> it<00:07:20.919> as<00:07:21.039> if
