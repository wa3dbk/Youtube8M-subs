 h 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.000
 the home 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 yet 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.850
 in a hammock 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.850
 bob on 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 let's finish more often first 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.250
 I'm talking about it 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.340
 I hope that party 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.860
 today there is kicked off hassan year earlier 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.690
 very quickly 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.160
 they would rather be there to be a friend 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.300
 poet and writer arte kpn are made 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.720
 what do you expect from the rest of the staff 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 I hope the first containers 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.580
 ill see 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.159
 Bob was a first rate that she was glad I couldn't 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.160
 it must be very clever though 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.460
 I think unfortunately all of us fall 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.659
 brussels on the rest naturally has a very different meaning 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.310
 at least if you are already a wolf subscriber 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.620
 but what was happy to be minister again 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.300
 if necessary 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.020
 8 what is expected to be something like that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.400
 moat 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.250
 van bommel right thigh 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.250
 haha 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.030
 roj 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.849
 the 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.129
 paul 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.799
 no easy maximum penalty for borrows 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.799
 but there were no issues with a point 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.949
 my senses are set now comes over 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.709
 chairwoman Marianne Thyssen but then nine months 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.539
 the rocks 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 warmerdam offers that 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:34.209
 later moment to the debate 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.539
 I think the impression that he you could play football is not easy 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.559
 we just try the germanlands of ourselves and yemen every match 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.739
 tried to keep deep animal today will the terms 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.069
 little scary in the game 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.889
 But then you know he has two that he falls into a hotel that it will still matter 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.639
 that it will still be difficult all of them have endured it 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.069
 Most importantly I think we think the two a very fast wenger on the 40th 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.139
 minute and then you know it will be very difficult so that she will be in the 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.649
 second half was like the neighborhood 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:07.819
 due to extra pressure the pressure on members and disgusting I think mainly about 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.169
 be dissatisfied with the end of the day 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.339
 it sounds it 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.409
 percentage of possession of anderlecht 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.179
 that comparison with us 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.449
 Also it barely had any chances in the first half alone 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.779
 I think three or four in the first 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.009
 five minutes later 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.019
 dogs on its side 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.569
 yes I also come with a bit of luck and leader 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.399
 nice second goal 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.779
 and then you actually hope to start the second half and people can stay long 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.109
 that goal keep you away and keep your eye on the win after that 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.109
 goal could be just about anything very quickly 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.569
 be the best buy 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.879
 very good switch practically also that leads to their start a bit 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.449
 have trouble with it 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.859
 we could wish that the ball was 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.199
 but coincidentally falls to that goal yes then you know the bomb or drown nothing 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.129
 and then we just have a problem the winnings were football 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.299
 power 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.449
 then such competitions 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.749
 therefore actually with us 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.269
 justice, however 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.899
 a good organization 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.529
 pick up the second ball then try to steal fruit 

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:17.099
 but can be very difficult to hold the ball 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.749
 the three pillars all four competitions 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.120
 showed it myself 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.190
 but we can compensate a lot with a big heart faster 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.939
 and done it today so I am really nice to stay with the boys 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.129
 that we are not there for the north of the Netherlands 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:34.349
 have experienced it once and other side 2 0 behind after a 2 3 win 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.110
 it would be very nice this was designated one had to 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.110
 After a second further there are now he takes eating meat 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.620
 I think it can be earned 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.240
 there is already evacuation 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.870
 have not played a tote and a good game 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.870
 we are still playing in Anderlecht 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.889
 the easy opponent 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.680
 and i think it is very europe league 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.909
 The Hague 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.370
 at the turn of the year in the city of palma nts they can take 2 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.550
 and then it should do the same with the honor of playing a game anyway 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.339
 continue a little 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.659
 and I think we already know that it deserves six of them from it 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.960
 is a depth due to our defensive nature 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.919
 and then to telecom with 2 0 for number of people is fantastic and then 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.789
 you might get a little too fast 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.779
 out of the two before again trains were hard will get 6 th 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:22.900
 natural 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.449
 and a stupid fall 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.779
 penalty straight up 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.009
 al Qaeda 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.110
 for those who peel two murders were at peace with it 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.550
 I also don't think it's a good time 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.759
 it was a petition and tea with a penalty 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.569
 yes the ball becomes a type of play 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.009
 the technically gifted could immediately get the ball in with a sliding 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.189
 and that ball hits my body fairly hard 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:49.189
 and he walks anthem and the poor 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:51.680
 we wanted look 0 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.120
 Well full for the Iran victory but I think a subscription by that way 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.039
 get a lot of smoke 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.960
 that fell a folder 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.210
 The players also put many governments on to the canvas There are men the stops to go on 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.749
 to solve then another board 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:11.619
 the concentration that animals dutch pasok 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:13.889
 VAT 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:19.500
 geoff morrell let's be bonuses on the course of the dark 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.629
 there are in the museum 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.449
 Brussels stood by 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.339
 as i like them very much i have taught myself with that 2 2 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:28.300
 for brussels 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.419
 0 2 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.699
 if there were practical ones to nasri man I would appreciate a lot of quality 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.930
 play football more urgently every month 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.219
 Meg especially pulled out after all the place is said 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:42.110
 there the ball could keep more in the team 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.110
 yes and then we know it gets very difficult it gets the other state 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:48.729
 ordinary week against it where you can die from it 

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:52.860
 there try this point the new parking lot 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.879
 against top teams that his ex-wife from the singer under contract 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:00.069
 Monday at the end of a point soon thereafter as a curious all the better 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.639
 if we had losses what will it be 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:06.539
 but then encountered non-performance to a number of images on which points to 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:07.219
 gathering 

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:09.379
 Prime Minister but rutte 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:11.349
 but we'll see where now 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.550
 removed as an example in marseille 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.089
 we try to use violence
