00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.650
 Hello everyone in previous releases, we 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
 told you the background of the game world 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.330
 so this issue will be dedicated 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.170
 some key character and so 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:36.070
 let's start 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:36.760
 Lord Guine had three children a princess 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.950
 guveniver 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.970
 some was due to norland along with 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.620
 other gods 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.380
 as evidenced by the ring description 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.899
 princess of the sun is unknown why she 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.329
 left the city on maybe she knowing 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.940
 Soon the end of the era of fire just took 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.700
 my fate as it is not married to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.980
 god of fire which nothing plans 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.809
 is known 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.300
 Gwindolina is the youngest son of Guine who is not 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.170
 inherited the power of the sun but inherited 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.960
 moon power 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.060
 so he was raised like a princess 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.789
 the only one of the gods who has not left 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.800
 and I stayed in norland 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.970
 magic aid gwendolyn created the illusion 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.270
 his sister 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.580
 the illusion of the sun over he arlonda he spoke 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.340
 with the chosen not dead from the face of guvenier 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.590
 and he is the leader of a covenant in 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.530
 dark moon and princess defenders 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.170
 it is clear that since he spoke on behalf of his 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.860
 sisters then it is he who wishes to continue 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.259
 era of fire 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.560
 but it is not known why, and most likely he 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.420
 has some goals of its own also gwen and 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.149
 was the firstborn god of war 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.280
 whose name has long been forgotten regarding 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.229
 he has a very interesting theory about 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.229
 which we will tell you later 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.670
 Gwen gathered the top four warriors from 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.220
 his army 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.030
 knight artorisa siaran from the group 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.950
 assassins called master blades 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.369
 ornstein dragon slayer as well as goha 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.380
 Ornstein's falcon eye captain of knights 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.810
 he is the only one who decided 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.420
 stay in norland guard illusion 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.600
 princesses although he himself most likely and not 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.910
 knows that he is guarding only the illusion of 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.920
 Ornstein's nickname can be concluded 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.620
 that he distinguished himself during the war with 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.510
 dragons are much taller than average 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.930
 most likely not a person 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.239
 the bearer of the ring with his lion is golden 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.989
 Armor has a high protection from lightning and 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.970
 the spear, on the contrary, is charged with the power of lightning 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.250
 ornstein guards the guveniver tower together 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.410
 with smaug by the court executioner 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.630
 and sonar londa he wanted to be one of 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.239
 knights but because of his habit of adding 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.880
 I didnâ€™t eat the bones of my victims 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.100
 adopted most likely could still 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.380
 angry about refusing to be knighted 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.630
 this is visible from a small scene after 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.450
 how do we kill ornstein first during 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.700
 battle with him 2 immediately finish him off 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.040
 his hammer and begin to laugh angrily 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.200
 according to the description of the armor of smaug and his 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.670
 sizes can be assumed that he is so 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.049
 same not a man and most likely a giant about 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.660
 the siaran past is also unknown 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.850
 except she was very capable 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 Wars for which I was invited to join the ranks 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.230
 Guine Knights also for their skill 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.630
 was awarded a porcelain helmet 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.880
 cyclops judging because after death 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.220
 artorisa asks to give his soul to her 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.730
 siaran was not just close to him 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.730
 a friend also her dead body can be found 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.799
 near the grave of artoris perhaps she too 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.130
 not a man as before death says 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.380
 about people in the third person 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.359
 god falcon eye leader of archers 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.060
 giants who also participated in 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.220
 dragon war slits for his eyes 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.769
 the helmet was sealed with wood resin 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.620
 after someone dismissed the false 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.930
 rumors of cruelty guha who just 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.710
 cannot be true to suggest it 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.720
 can be from a dialogue with him 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.970
 very peaceful and friendly 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.160
 towards the player and even remembers 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.950
 his old friend the blacksmith giant 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.260
 and sonar london despite the fact that gog 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.510
 blindly he masterfully knocks down calamite from 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.030
 of your giant bow knight artorias 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.280
 has nicknames and no wolf for 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.739
 ability to walk the abyss after 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.080
 tragedies dragged he goes there with 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.540
 friend wolf and cifam in order to save 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.940
 people in the dungeon surround them 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.400
 causing of the abyss after which artorias 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.980
 cleans the CIF with its magical shield and 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.330
 goes deep into the dungeons it was there that he 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.880
 injured 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.430
 then goes crazy and remains to wander 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.530
 executioner or driven by instinct alone 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.860
 kill bye the undead chosen 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.110
 will not save him from this fate the legend of 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.300
 it sold throughout the kingdom was 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.270
 created a fake grave of artorias 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.980
 the truth about which only Elizabeth and 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.920
 knight's closest friends 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.710
 the grave became a monument to him and the hero 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.660
 the winning manus and as for the ring 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.270
 walking along the abyss 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.490
 definitely nothing to say is possible that 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.310
 the ring was given a cif so that he could 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.140
 help arthur with his trekking 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.660
 Artorias ability to walk the abyss 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.670
 It was in this ring first 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.160
 option is more likely since we ring 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.070
 we are not able to select the wolf scab knight 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.080
 CIF according to the description of one of the swords 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.450
 artorias we learn that he also 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.060
 hunted for dark shadows which 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.870
 probably served as a cashier which brought on 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.870
 trouble for olachil 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.830
 as we said earlier there is one theory 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.169
 Soler from astor knight whose we 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.630
 meet after killing the demon calf in 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.240
 the city of undead can be this very 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.610
 the firstborn about it says his strange 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.009
 thirst for the sun you remember the first 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.870
 meet him when we meet him 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.270
 first time this friendly knight 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.699
 fascinated looks at the sun 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.330
 he calls him the magnificent father 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:07.190
 for gwen is the lord of sunlight 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.320
 if you look at the medal of light, you can 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.199
 notice that the symbol is engraved on it 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.620
 sun with the face in the description of the medal said 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:19.300
 that this firstborn symbol is also a symbol 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.430
 can be seen on the armor and shield of the solarium 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.710
 on this we have all the opinion of the author can 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.930
 different from yours so write your 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.180
 theory proposal in the comments and if 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.349
