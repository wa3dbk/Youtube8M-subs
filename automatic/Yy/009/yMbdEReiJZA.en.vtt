back of this one two three and four
and<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:43.350> you'll<00:00:43.470> back<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:44.010> off<00:00:44.720> about<00:00:45.720> an

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
eighth of an inch that's where my

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.120 
eighth of an inch that's where my
thumbnail<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:48.720> this<00:00:48.870> shoulder<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.470> you

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
thumbnail is from this shoulder if you

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.550 
thumbnail is from this shoulder if you
backed<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> off<00:00:50.670> too<00:00:51.000> far<00:00:51.330> then<00:00:52.320> you're<00:00:52.470> only

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
backed it off too far then you're only

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.960 
backed it off too far then you're only
going<00:00:52.740> to<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.950> couple<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.310> threads<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.820> in

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
going to have a couple of threads up in

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.310 
going to have a couple of threads up in
there<00:00:54.120> show<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.600> you're<00:00:54.720> going<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:54.960> strip<00:00:55.290> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there show and you're going to strip it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
there show and you're going to strip it
so<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.070> don't<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> go<00:00:56.760> more<00:00:57.000> than<00:00:57.030> two

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so you don't want to go more than two

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.880 
so you don't want to go more than two
maybe<00:00:57.360> an<00:00:57.540> eighth<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.960> an<00:00:58.080> inch<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.710> if<00:00:58.800> you'll

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
maybe an eighth of an inch but if you'll

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.880 
maybe an eighth of an inch but if you'll
back<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.490> I'm<00:00:59.700> off<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.090> eighth<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.630> inch

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
back off or I'm off of eighth of an inch

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.180 
back off or I'm off of eighth of an inch
then<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.970> that's<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.990> there<00:01:04.230> you'll<00:01:04.949> take

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
then as that that's in there you'll take

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.570 
then as that that's in there you'll take
it<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.720> tool<00:01:06.720> put<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:07.830> against<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.250> head<00:01:08.400> of

to go on the head of that bolt and then

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.980 
to go on the head of that bolt and then
it<00:04:38.310> comes<00:04:38.520> over<00:04:38.760> here<00:04:38.940> and<00:04:38.970> acts<00:04:39.150> as<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.330> spacer

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and it lets your power-steering pump do

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.840 
and it lets your power-steering pump do
all<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.570> high-pressure<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.410> push<00:04:43.650> that<00:04:43.920> rotor

unscrewed about an eighth of an inch now
we<00:04:53.880> just<00:04:54.240> unscrewed<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.140> little<00:04:55.380> bit<00:04:55.500> more<00:04:55.740> so

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
we just unscrewed a little bit more so

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.470 
we just unscrewed a little bit more so
we<00:04:56.130> got<00:04:56.280> about<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.490> quarter<00:04:56.940> inch<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.240> travel

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
we got about a quarter inch of travel

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.510 
we got about a quarter inch of travel
space<00:04:57.930> in<00:04:58.200> there<00:04:58.350> now<00:04:58.500> now<00:04:58.920> once<00:04:59.160> we've<00:04:59.340> got

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
space in there now now once we've got

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.160 
space in there now now once we've got
those<00:04:59.700> bolts<00:05:00.120> threaded<00:05:00.570> out<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.750> little<00:05:00.960> bit

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
those bolts threaded out a little bit

truck for rock salt or whatever there's

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.220 
truck for rock salt or whatever there's
a<00:06:16.580> lot<00:06:16.730> of<00:06:16.850> surface<00:06:17.060> area<00:06:17.360> on<00:06:17.720> the<00:06:17.870> outside

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
a lot of surface area on the outside

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.410 
a lot of surface area on the outside
flange<00:06:18.620> here<00:06:18.920> there's<00:06:19.760> also<00:06:19.910> a<00:06:20.060> lot<00:06:20.300> of

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
flange here there's also a lot of

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.330 
flange here there's also a lot of
surface<00:06:20.750> area<00:06:21.110> square<00:06:21.590> each<00:06:21.710> is<00:06:21.890> by<00:06:22.040> the<00:06:22.100> time

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
surface area square each is by the time

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.460 
surface area square each is by the time
you<00:06:22.460> figure<00:06:22.610> up<00:06:22.820> this<00:06:22.970> surface<00:06:23.390> here<00:06:23.660> if<00:06:24.320> it

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
you figure up this surface here if it

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.320 
you figure up this surface here if it
gets<00:06:24.620> a<00:06:24.710> bunch<00:06:24.920> of<00:06:27.160> rust<00:06:28.160> and<00:06:28.460> build-up<00:06:29.060> to<00:06:29.300> it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
gets a bunch of rust and build-up to it

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.510 
gets a bunch of rust and build-up to it
that's<00:06:29.840> a<00:06:30.050> lot<00:06:30.230> of<00:06:30.290> force<00:06:30.830> that<00:06:31.070> it<00:06:31.190> takes<00:06:31.220> to

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
that's a lot of force that it takes to

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.300 
that's a lot of force that it takes to
pull<00:06:31.700> that<00:06:31.730> out<00:06:32.000> of<00:06:32.120> there<00:06:32.860> as<00:06:33.860> you<00:06:34.070> can<00:06:34.190> see

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
pull that out of there as you can see

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.850 
pull that out of there as you can see
with<00:06:34.460> this<00:06:34.610> camera<00:06:34.910> on<00:06:35.240> this<00:06:35.560> kind<00:06:36.560> of<00:06:36.680> gives

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
with this camera on this kind of gives

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.740 
with this camera on this kind of gives
you<00:06:36.980> an<00:06:37.070> idea<00:06:37.190> how<00:06:37.610> much<00:06:37.790> rust<00:06:38.150> is<00:06:38.390> on<00:06:38.570> this

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
you an idea how much rust is on this

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.520 
you an idea how much rust is on this
rotor<00:06:39.050> and<00:06:39.500> the<00:06:39.590> other<00:06:39.770> parts<00:06:40.130> here<00:06:40.430> and<00:06:41.530> that

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
rotor and the other parts here and that

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.050 
rotor and the other parts here and that
can<00:06:42.650> end<00:06:42.770> up<00:06:42.890> making<00:06:42.950> noise<00:06:43.430> against<00:06:43.940> this

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
can end up making noise against this

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.090 
can end up making noise against this
backing<00:06:44.360> plate<00:06:44.810> it<00:06:45.290> will<00:06:45.500> make<00:06:45.800> it<00:06:45.890> difficult

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
backing plate it will make it difficult

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.950 
backing plate it will make it difficult
to<00:06:47.140> get<00:06:48.140> the<00:06:48.200> hub<00:06:48.410> out<00:06:48.620> of<00:06:48.860> the<00:06:49.040> knuckle<00:06:49.670> and

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
to get the hub out of the knuckle and

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.620 
to get the hub out of the knuckle and
that<00:06:50.960> is<00:06:51.200> how<00:06:51.350> it's<00:06:51.560> done
