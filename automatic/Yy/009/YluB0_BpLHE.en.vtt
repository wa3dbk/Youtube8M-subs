this<00:00:22.500> weird<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.130> look<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.430> like<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> biker<00:00:23.939> game

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.720 
this weird and look of like a biker game
and<00:00:24.510> there's<00:00:25.439> thing<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> once<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.250> mount<00:00:26.460> up

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and there's thing is once you mount up

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.179 
and there's thing is once you mount up
they<00:00:27.480> actually<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.500> bikes<00:00:28.710> like

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
they actually get on bikes like

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
they actually get on bikes like
mechanics<00:00:29.570> even<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:30.660> you're<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> different

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
mechanics even if you're on a different

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
mechanics even if you're on a different
amount<00:00:31.320> they<00:00:31.529> go<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.740> bike<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.189> their<00:00:32.309> own<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
amount they go on bike to their own I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.220 
amount they go on bike to their own I
thought<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:33.960> pretty<00:00:34.110> cool<00:00:34.640> because

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
thought that was pretty cool because

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
thought that was pretty cool because
since<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.320> had<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.680> myself<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.460> looked

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
since I had one myself it just looked

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.490 
since I had one myself it just looked
like<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.210> bikers<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:40.110> looks<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
like for bikers and it looks like you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.540 
like for bikers and it looks like you
have<00:00:40.530> friends<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.070> don't<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:41.309> friends

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

one here is a dragon and I just let them
do<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.010> thing<00:00:50.219> because<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> look<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.449> the

bottom action bar they have their own

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.490 
bottom action bar they have their own
moves<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:53.969> time<00:00:54.300> stopped<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.899> enrage<00:00:55.199> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
moves like time stopped and enrage so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.889 
moves like time stopped and enrage so
you<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> tank<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> mage<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.120> Link

pretty<00:01:00.420> much<00:01:00.510> take<00:01:00.840> care<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> by

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
pretty much take care of it by

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.979 
pretty much take care of it by
themselves<00:01:02.420> unless<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.780> pop

out to be a dragon the skies look as a
goblin<00:01:26.810> coming<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:27.990> till<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.409> guy<00:01:29.479> quick

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
laws and the planet even kill mobs it's
just<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.560> fun<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.189> guess<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> would<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:38.970> more

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
just for fun I guess it would be more

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.639 
just for fun I guess it would be more
fun<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.630> didn't<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:39.960> flying<00:01:40.259> mount<00:01:40.439> I

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
fun if I didn't have a flying mount I

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.350 
fun if I didn't have a flying mount I
wasn't<00:01:40.979> sure<00:01:41.130> cutting<00:01:41.789> it<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.270> have

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
wasn't sure cutting it because you have

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.980 
wasn't sure cutting it because you have
to<00:01:42.450> actually<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:44.210> think<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> one

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
to actually use them I think this is one

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.609 
to actually use them I think this is one
the<00:01:46.229> last<00:01:46.590> quest<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> chain<00:01:48.500> kill<00:01:49.500> all

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the last quest of the chain kill all

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.649 
the last quest of the chain kill all
these<00:01:49.740> whelps<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.789> actually<00:01:50.970> had<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> go

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
these whelps and I actually had to go

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.609 
these whelps and I actually had to go
help<00:01:51.810> them<00:01:52.049> because<00:01:52.320> they<00:01:52.439> don't

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
help them because they don't

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.730 
help them because they don't
automatically<00:01:53.840> stopped<00:01:54.840> attacking<00:01:55.439> them

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
automatically stopped attacking them

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.889 
automatically stopped attacking them
next<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:56.970> over<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.329> cave<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> I've

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
next to go over to this cave and I've

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.340 
next to go over to this cave and I've
left<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.439> regular<00:01:59.399> speed<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.570> there

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
left this at regular speed because there

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
left this at regular speed because there
is<00:02:01.500> actually<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> cinematic<00:02:02.490> while<00:02:03.210> you're

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

doing<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.619> quest

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.370 

secretly<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:10.410> dragon<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.870> starts<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.350> soon

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
secretly a dragon so that starts as soon

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.370 
secretly a dragon so that starts as soon
as<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.650> accept<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.980> quest<00:02:15.420> watch<00:02:16.420> her<00:02:17.140> go

into<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.680> cave<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.220> think<00:02:18.490> she's<00:02:18.640> going<00:02:18.820> to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.990 
into the cave I think she's going to
retrieve<00:02:19.270> her<00:02:19.480> egg<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:21.370> was<00:02:21.520> captured<00:02:21.760> by

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
retrieve her egg it was captured by

retrieve her egg it was captured by
completing<00:02:22.480> or<00:02:22.630> something

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.059 

BAM<00:02:56.100> definitely<00:02:56.790> yeah<00:02:57.330> I<00:02:57.630> was<00:02:58.410> little<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.800> was<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
BAM definitely yeah I was little I was a

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.940 
BAM definitely yeah I was little I was a
little<00:02:59.250> surprised<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.959> this<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.290> third

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
little surprised and this is the third

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.100 
little surprised and this is the third
or<00:03:02.340> fourth<00:03:02.640> time<00:03:02.730> I've<00:03:03.090> seen<00:03:03.239> them<00:03:03.390> pop<00:03:03.540> up<00:03:03.750> so

or fourth time I've seen them pop up so

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.530 
or fourth time I've seen them pop up so
it's<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:05.070> as<00:03:05.280> frequent<00:03:05.790> as<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.090> wasn't<00:03:06.269> wrath

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
it's not as frequent as it wasn't wrath

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.600 
it's not as frequent as it wasn't wrath
of<00:03:06.720> lich<00:03:06.840> king<00:03:07.080> with<00:03:07.230> Arthas<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.430> just

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
of lich king with Arthas and it just

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.880 
of lich king with Arthas and it just
kind<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.820> make<00:03:08.970> him<00:03:09.090> an<00:03:09.180> icon<00:03:09.630> awful<00:03:10.590> up<00:03:10.709> and

kind of make him an icon awful up and
random<00:03:11.160> things<00:03:11.430> but<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.000> guess<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> low-level

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
random things but I guess as a low-level

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.199 
random things but I guess as a low-level
character<00:03:14.010> leveling<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.640> see<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.970> dragon

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
character leveling to see that dragon

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.300 
character leveling to see that dragon
that's<00:03:15.780> going<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.050> be<00:03:16.140> pretty<00:03:16.260> cool<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.830> don't

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that's going to be pretty cool I don't

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.800 
that's going to be pretty cool I don't
know<00:03:17.370> what<00:03:17.459> he<00:03:17.580> does<00:03:17.700> here<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.060> kind<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.300> goes

apparently he just killed her because he

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.350 
apparently he just killed her because he
was<00:03:29.000> trying<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.330> steal<00:03:29.480> my<00:03:29.540> hangers<00:03:31.360> just

after the cinematic you have to run back

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.380 
after the cinematic you have to run back
in<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.430> get<00:03:40.550> something<00:03:40.880> while<00:03:41.030> you're<00:03:41.090> hiding
