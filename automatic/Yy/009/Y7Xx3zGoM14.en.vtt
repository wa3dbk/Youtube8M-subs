tacked together with the iron all of
this<00:01:48.330> layering<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.050> seaming<00:01:49.619> allows<00:01:50.190> the

this layering and seaming allows the

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.580 
this layering and seaming allows the
strands<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.030> carbon<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.720> run<00:01:51.899> parallel<00:01:52.289> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
strands of carbon to run parallel to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.440 
strands of carbon to run parallel to
each<00:01:52.830> other<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.220> some<00:01:53.490> parts<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> fabric

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.370 
each other in some parts of the fabric
which<00:01:54.929> makes<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.440> stick<00:01:55.770> stronger<00:01:57.110> they<00:01:58.110> also

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
which makes the stick stronger they also

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.499 
which makes the stick stronger they also
intersect<00:01:59.100> each<00:01:59.250> other<00:01:59.429> in<00:01:59.670> other<00:01:59.970> parts<00:02:00.390> and

intersect each other in other parts and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.160
