the pro 15 now each of these are rated

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.929 
the pro 15 now each of these are rated
at<00:00:23.340> 4<00:00:24.060> ohms<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.630> each<00:00:25.140> speaker<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.070> has<00:00:26.910> a

power sorry of 300 watts RMS that's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.759 
power sorry of 300 watts RMS that's
probably<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.140> lot<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> people<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.740> there

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
probably a lot of people out there

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.459 
probably a lot of people out there
thinking<00:00:32.369> already<00:00:32.730> well<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.230> base

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
thinking already well if the base

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.889 
thinking already well if the base
speaker<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> 4<00:00:35.430> ohms<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.090> top<00:00:36.329> speaker<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
speaker is 4 ohms and the top speaker is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.510 
speaker is 4 ohms and the top speaker is
4<00:00:37.170> ohms<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.950> put<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> two<00:00:38.340> together

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
4 ohms and you put the two together

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.000 
4 ohms and you put the two together
won't<00:00:39.300> Matt<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> rating<00:00:40.200> down<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.379> 2<00:00:40.800> ohms

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
won't Matt put the rating down to 2 ohms

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.670 
won't Matt put the rating down to 2 ohms
which<00:00:41.399> means<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:42.960> amplifier<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
which means if you have an amplifier of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
which means if you have an amplifier of
4<00:00:43.980> ohms<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> start<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> overheat

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
4 ohms it's going to start to overheat

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.220 
4 ohms it's going to start to overheat
well<00:00:46.620> I've<00:00:46.710> actually<00:00:46.860> been<00:00:47.780> informed<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.020> if

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
well I've actually been informed that if

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.830 
well I've actually been informed that if
you<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.620> use<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:50.010> amplifier<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.789> 4<00:00:51.120> ohms<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
you do use an amplifier of 4 ohms and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
you do use an amplifier of 4 ohms and
you<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
you go in here and out of here into the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
you go in here and out of here into the
mid<00:00:54.480> top<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.410> amplifier<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.250> only

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
mid top the amplifier will only

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.580 
mid top the amplifier will only
recognize<00:00:57.000> 4<00:00:57.719> ohms<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.410> very

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
recognize 4 ohms now that's very

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
recognize 4 ohms now that's very
important<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.050> 300<00:01:01.050> watts<00:01:01.230> RMS<00:01:01.969> 300<00:01:02.969> watts<00:01:03.149> RMS

you're looking at an amplifier of 600
watts<00:01:07.049> RMS<00:01:07.619> aside<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:08.280> slightly<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.510> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
watts RMS aside or slightly more if you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.510 
watts RMS aside or slightly more if you
want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.229> you've<00:01:10.350> got<00:01:10.500> some<00:01:10.710> Headroom<00:01:10.950> if

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
want to so you've got some Headroom if

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.929 
want to so you've got some Headroom if
for<00:01:12.000> example<00:01:12.680> an<00:01:13.680> amplifier<00:01:14.340> let's<00:01:14.729> say

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
for example an amplifier let's say

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.050 
for example an amplifier let's say
thousand<00:01:15.659> Watts<00:01:15.869> aside<00:01:16.229> RMS<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.520> use<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
thousand Watts aside RMS if you use that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
thousand Watts aside RMS if you use that
in<00:01:18.330> conjunction<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.229> setup<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
in conjunction with a setup like this it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
in conjunction with a setup like this it
means<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.360> amplifier<00:01:21.840> isn't<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
means that the amplifier isn't going to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.170 
means that the amplifier isn't going to
over<00:01:23.070> work<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> lot<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
over work it's going to have a lot of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
over work it's going to have a lot of
headroom<00:01:24.530> meaning<00:01:25.530> you're<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.070> get<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
headroom meaning you're going to get a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.999 
headroom meaning you're going to get a
good<00:01:26.640> quality<00:01:26.939> sound<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.710> use

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
good quality sound out but if you do use

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.999 
good quality sound out but if you do use
an<00:01:29.280> amplifier<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.570> rated<00:01:30.930> higher<00:01:31.470> for

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
an amplifier that's rated higher for

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.270 
an amplifier that's rated higher for
example<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.060> 300<00:01:33.659> that's<00:01:34.229> 300<00:01:34.860> put<00:01:35.159> them

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.090 
example this is 300 that's 300 put them
together<00:01:35.720> 600<00:01:36.720> watts<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.979> an

assigned<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.590> always<00:01:40.890> need<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.280> very

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
assigned you always need to be very

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.789 
assigned you always need to be very
careful<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.659> mixer<00:01:43.079> make<00:01:43.380> sure<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
careful with your mixer make sure you

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
careful with your mixer make sure you
don't<00:01:44.070> increase<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.030> gain<00:01:45.329> too<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.810> because

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
don't increase the gain too much because

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.260 
don't increase the gain too much because
there<00:01:46.590> could<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:47.009> possibility<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.939> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there could be a possibility of you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.770 
there could be a possibility of you
starting<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.170> over<00:01:49.680> power<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> speakers<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
starting to over power the speakers so
