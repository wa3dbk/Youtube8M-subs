to chemically break down food starch

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.860 
to chemically break down food starch
digestion<00:00:46.500> also<00:00:47.070> begins<00:00:47.430> here<00:00:47.850> starch<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
digestion also begins here starch is

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.720 
digestion also begins here starch is
also<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.410> potatoes<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> used

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
also in your potatoes and that is used

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.049 
also in your potatoes and that is used
to<00:00:50.820> make<00:00:51.030> energy<00:00:52.160> next<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.610> move<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to make energy next we move to the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 
to make energy next we move to the
esophagus<00:00:54.379> here<00:00:55.379> no<00:00:55.559> actual<00:00:55.980> digestion<00:00:56.460> takes

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
esophagus here no actual digestion takes

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
esophagus here no actual digestion takes
place<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.660> esophagus<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.500> basically<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> long

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
place the esophagus is basically a long

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.400 
place the esophagus is basically a long
tube<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.940> moves<00:01:00.239> food<00:01:00.510> from<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:01.020> mouth<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
tube that moves food from your mouth to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.049 
tube that moves food from your mouth to
your<00:01:01.559> stomach<00:01:01.649> through<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.550> sequential

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
your stomach through the sequential

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.729 
your stomach through the sequential
contraction<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.930> muscles<00:01:04.320> known<00:01:04.589> as

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
contraction of muscles known as

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.789 
contraction of muscles known as
peristalsis<00:01:05.720> next<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:07.080> move<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> stomach

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
peristalsis next we move to the stomach

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
peristalsis next we move to the stomach
here<00:01:08.549> both<00:01:08.700> physical<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.390> chemical

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
here both physical and chemical

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
here both physical and chemical
digestion<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.650> taking<00:01:11.040> place<00:01:11.189> physical

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
digestion are taking place physical

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.789 
digestion are taking place physical
digestion<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.900> occurring<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
digestion is occurring because of the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.590 
digestion is occurring because of the
churning<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> stomach<00:01:14.670> chemical

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
churning of the stomach chemical

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
churning of the stomach chemical
digestion<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.680> occurring<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
digestion is also occurring because the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.640 
digestion is also occurring because the
stomach<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> very<00:01:18.090> acidic<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:19.229> means<00:01:19.470> it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
stomach is very acidic which means it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.219 
stomach is very acidic which means it
contains<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:20.340> acid<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.509> causes<00:01:21.570> starch

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
contains much acid this causes starch

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.230 
contains much acid this causes starch
digestion<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.100> continue<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:23.850> protein

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
digestion to continue and then protein

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
digestion to continue and then protein
digestion<00:01:24.659> begins<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.380> as<00:01:25.500> well<00:01:25.729> proteins

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
digestion begins here as well proteins

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
digestion begins here as well proteins
are<00:01:26.880> important<00:01:27.360> because<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:28.140> are<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
are important because they are the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.230 
are important because they are the
building<00:01:28.740> blocks<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.220> things<00:01:29.490> such<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.060> your

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
building blocks of things such as your

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.319 
building blocks of things such as your
bones<00:01:30.450> cartilage<00:01:31.079> muscles<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.040> skin<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:33.270> do

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
bones cartilage muscles and skin now do

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.270 
bones cartilage muscles and skin now do
you<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.960> those<00:01:34.140> three<00:01:34.320> organs<00:01:34.770> surrounding

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you see those three organs surrounding

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
you see those three organs surrounding
the<00:01:35.400> stomach<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:36.360> are<00:01:36.540> known<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.750> auxiliary

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the stomach these are known as auxiliary

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
the stomach these are known as auxiliary
organs<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.939> part<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
organs because they are not a part of

taken into the body you also know what

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
taken into the body you also know what
bile<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.619> ever<00:01:49.829> thrown<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.220> and

starches this m's ions are very
important<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:08.700> they<00:02:09.000> allow<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.420> body

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
important because they allow your body

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360 
important because they allow your body
to<00:02:09.750> break<00:02:10.050> down<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.470> food<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> can<00:02:11.220> be

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to break down the food so it can be

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.070 
to break down the food so it can be
turned<00:02:11.640> into<00:02:11.879> something<00:02:12.030> your<00:02:12.510> body<00:02:12.750> needs

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
turned into something your body needs

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.610 
turned into something your body needs
like

energy<00:02:13.860> we<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:14.909> move<00:02:15.150> into<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.540> small

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
energy we now move into the small

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.930 
energy we now move into the small
intestine<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.860> called<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.220> small<00:02:17.430> intestine

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
intestine it's called a small intestine

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.670 
intestine it's called a small intestine
because<00:02:18.209> it's<00:02:18.360> very<00:02:18.540> small<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.019> diameter<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
because it's very small in diameter and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.589 
because it's very small in diameter and
we<00:02:20.159> all<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.790> diameter<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
we all know that diameter is the

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.270 
we all know that diameter is the
distance<00:02:21.989> across<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.379> circle<00:02:22.560> through<00:02:23.129> its

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
distance across the circle through its

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.789 
distance across the circle through its
center<00:02:23.519> point<00:02:23.549> here<00:02:24.030> all<00:02:24.690> digestion<00:02:25.200> comes<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
center point here all digestion comes to

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:26.210 
center point here all digestion comes to
an<00:02:25.890> end

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
an end

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.490 
an end
therefore<00:02:26.849> starch<00:02:27.299> protein<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.200> fat

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
therefore starch protein and fat

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.619 
therefore starch protein and fat
digestion<00:02:28.920> continue<00:02:29.610> unto<00:02:29.970> all<00:02:30.150> food<00:02:30.420> is

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
digestion continue unto all food is

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.470 
digestion continue unto all food is
absorbed<00:02:31.340> finally<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.670> move<00:02:32.879> on<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.269> large

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
absorbed finally we move on to the large

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.110 
absorbed finally we move on to the large
intestine<00:02:33.629> here<00:02:34.470> water<00:02:34.799> is<00:02:35.040> reabsorbed<00:02:35.370> it's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
intestine here water is reabsorbed it's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.729 
intestine here water is reabsorbed it's
called<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> large<00:02:36.659> intestine<00:02:37.230> because<00:02:37.560> it's

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
called the large intestine because it's

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.160 
called the large intestine because it's
large<00:02:38.159> in<00:02:38.340> diameter<00:02:38.519> at<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.150> end<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.049> your
