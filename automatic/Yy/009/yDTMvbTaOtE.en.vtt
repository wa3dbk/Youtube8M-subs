so continuing on with um kind of using a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.889 
so continuing on with um kind of using a
single<00:00:05.040> unit<00:00:05.310> for<00:00:05.520> everything<00:00:05.910> I've<00:00:06.299> got<00:00:06.509> 40

single unit for everything I've got 40

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.379 
single unit for everything I've got 40
Giants<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.410> time<00:00:07.790> I'm<00:00:08.790> not<00:00:09.059> sure<00:00:09.179> if<00:00:09.300> this

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
Giants this time I'm not sure if this

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.129 
Giants this time I'm not sure if this
one's<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:10.170> successful<00:00:10.950> pun<00:00:11.429> I'm<00:00:12.300> just<00:00:12.900> going

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
one's that successful pun I'm just going

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.839 
one's that successful pun I'm just going
to<00:00:13.200> throw<00:00:13.230> them<00:00:13.769> all<00:00:13.889> down<00:00:14.070> we'll<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.490> i<00:00:14.519> see

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
to throw them all down we'll see i see

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.870 
to throw them all down we'll see i see
how<00:00:15.150> they<00:00:15.299> go<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:16.070> think<00:00:17.070> they'll<00:00:17.220> slowly<00:00:17.580> just

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
how they go I think they'll slowly just

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.450 
how they go I think they'll slowly just
crawl<00:00:18.210> their<00:00:18.420> way<00:00:18.650> through<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> base<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.250> fast

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
crawl their way through the base as fast

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.810 
crawl their way through the base as fast
as<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:21.109> but<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.920> main<00:00:23.130> thing<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.490> I'm

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
as they can but the main thing that I'm

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.609 
as they can but the main thing that I'm
concerned<00:00:23.850> about<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
concerned about in this one is the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
concerned about in this one is the
splash<00:00:26.039> damage<00:00:26.250> from<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.939> wizards<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
splash damage from the wizards in the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.460 
splash damage from the wizards in the
mortars<00:00:28.470> because<00:00:29.630> one<00:00:30.630> wizard<00:00:30.900> can<00:00:31.260> pretty

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
mortars because one wizard can pretty

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
mortars because one wizard can pretty
much<00:00:31.560> attack<00:00:31.980> every<00:00:32.369> single<00:00:32.700> one<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> those

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
much attack every single one of those

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.709 
much attack every single one of those
giants<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.809> once<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:37.640> my<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.940> smart<00:00:38.969> dryads

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
giants at once so my really smart dryads

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
giants at once so my really smart dryads
go<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> more<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.250> under

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
go for that more that's under

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.940 
go for that more that's under
construction<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
construction because you know it's so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.549 
construction because you know it's so
dangerous<00:00:44.510> but<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.200> see<00:00:46.379> look

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
dangerous but that was it there see look

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.709 
dangerous but that was it there see look
most<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.700> them<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:47.910> quite<00:00:48.149> damaged<00:00:48.570> already

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
most of them are quite damaged already

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.900 
most of them are quite damaged already
just<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.649> splash<00:00:50.010> those

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
just because of the splash those

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
just because of the splash those
individual<00:00:51.649> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> arches<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
individual kind of the arches and the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.270 
individual kind of the arches and the
cannons<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> Tesla<00:00:54.809> tells<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.890> very

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
cannons and the Tesla tells I'm very

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740 
cannons and the Tesla tells I'm very
effective<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.090> only<00:00:57.210> target<00:00:57.420> like

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
effective because they only target like

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.229 
effective because they only target like
one<00:00:57.989> giant<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> time<00:00:58.910> whereas<00:00:59.910> those

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
one giant at a time whereas those

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.060 
one giant at a time whereas those
mortars<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.930> hit<00:01:01.109> everything<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.920> them

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
mortars can hit everything one of them

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.039 
mortars can hit everything one of them
and<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.510> arm<00:01:04.610> clan<00:01:05.610> castle

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
and now we have that arm clan castle

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
and now we have that arm clan castle
which<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> suck<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.640> Giants

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
which is going to suck because Giants

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
which is going to suck because Giants
won't<00:01:09.780> attack<00:01:10.080> clean<00:01:10.590> castle<00:01:11.040> troops<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
won't attack clean castle troops so

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
won't attack clean castle troops so
they're<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.270> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> sit<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:12.720> taking

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
they're just going to sit there taking

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.450 
they're just going to sit there taking
it<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> whole<00:01:13.680> time<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:16.100> that's<00:01:17.100> quite

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it the whole time and that's quite

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
it the whole time and that's quite
annoying<00:01:17.790> actually<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> can't<00:01:18.930> do

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
annoying actually because I can't do

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.370 
annoying actually because I can't do
much<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> those<00:01:21.869> those

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
much about that now so those those

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.630 
much about that now so those those
drawings<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:23.009> sitting<00:01:23.340> there<00:01:23.460> while

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
drawings do sitting there while

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.289 
drawings do sitting there while
barbarians<00:01:24.360> arshavin<00:01:24.780> swords<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.259> there<00:01:25.470> but

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
barbarians arshavin swords up there but

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.039 
barbarians arshavin swords up there but
but<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:28.590> can't<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.159> much<00:01:29.340> about<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.610> either

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
but I I can't do much about that either

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
but I I can't do much about that either
so<00:01:31.049> well<00:01:31.530> they<00:01:31.829> getting<00:01:32.400> through<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> bait

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
so well they getting through the bait

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.760 
so well they getting through the bait
okay<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:35.299> they're<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
okay and they're just got to get that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.730 
okay and they're just got to get that
through<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> intersection<00:01:39.409> then<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> think

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
through that intersection then I think

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.990 
through that intersection then I think
that's<00:01:40.979> most<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.430> them<00:01:41.579> did<00:01:41.790> anyway<00:01:44.000> that's

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that's most of them did anyway that's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.710 
that's most of them did anyway that's
quite<00:01:45.180> unsurprising<00:01:46.640> so<00:01:47.640> next<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
quite unsurprising so next up in this

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.770 
quite unsurprising so next up in this
series<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.170> 100<00:01:49.770> wall<00:01:49.920> breakers<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.329> make

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
series we have 100 wall breakers so make

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
series we have 100 wall breakers so make
sure<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> watch<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.820> if<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.149> this
