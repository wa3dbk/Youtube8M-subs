00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 I would like to explain the Shaun unit This is a grand piano action 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.660
 It is also that model but 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.470
 It's so is seen of me moving You know the Fu say when you play the keyboard 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.500
 But 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.100
 I think that I want to explain in this establishment 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.050
 First of all 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.820
 this 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.970
 The part called the jack The part called this l- type jack is 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:38.140
 Well also I'd become to serve as a point of key 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:42.730
 Parts of this jack at the base of this hammer are coming and finishing 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:49.350
 I'm deviate from such Fu the cat of the roller on the way 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:53.490
 What does this mean ? This hammer is different to say five shrines 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:58.260
 Also I'd come rebounded hit also between this 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.520
 And it comes to the push-up Panashi forever in order to come rebounded To soggy outside Hittsui 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.850
 Because it will 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.080
 In the middle 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.750
 It will not bounce if you do not avoid it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.750
 It is such a mechanism, but it is Moe 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:18.939
 I change this wing so that this weak is good 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:24.100
 Timing to avoid from this roller it from going to a place as close as possible to line to this chord 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:28.940
 Hamburger those who avoid keep wrapped this way from going down to near a place deep that keyboard 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.010
 But I think it is ideal because I can make noodles 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.280
 Also 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.240
 If you put on a small knit 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.030
 If When you set items twice this semi-circle movement 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.960
 I will stop 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:47.600
 Because it will stop before it hits this string 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:51.100
 I have to do the rotation of this stopped 12 jacks together 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.900
 In this turn of this jack to match this is 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 It's Tteyuu camp star button I Turn child this part 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.729
 this 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.790
 But I'm hitting here that'll keep timing that weak is back 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.280
 So even though I'll change the timing of this rotation 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.840
 this 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.620
 Bar is made of ice I do not go unless Yara to match it to the hammer stops position 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.130
 Ne 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.130
 Because 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:25.300
 After all , this part is that that is again when it is released even if it is released to a small whistle 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.330
 Though I say if Kurere up 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.330
 Because such a function can not be added easily 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:41.450
 Things will come out Fu they can affect it that we 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:43.300
 But Mr. Yamaha show init is had become a You're that with two this kelp 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:50.490
 that 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:50.490
 This part also comes to another country by school when it is canceled 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.099
 I usually touch the head and head when playing 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.280
 Let's play this weak turn here when the bar got off at 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.340
 It's supposed to come off, so there are mountains in the mountains 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.590
 I think that there is an excellent place with energy saving 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:15.730
 Just after the cast of figures this is also net 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:19.840
 Of a fine-tuning also because considerably effectiveness towards the bar of the bar I have been considerably firmly 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:27.970
 You can set it to the very last minute 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.560
 So even with that retrofit knitwear, the current ones are getting better and better. 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.890
 At the very last minute 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.990
 If you make adjustments to make it stop 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:44.569
 For example, when 1 barn and a lot of hammers enter , the bar will move when it moves 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.530
 Hey did you guess that a house in the place of about would sound is also Toka adjusted losing 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.130
 In such a form 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:54.740
 Almost even with that retrocast unit 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:59.840
 It became possible to attach that so as not to be affected 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:05.750
 Well if you look at this model, it will be that kind of explanation 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.000
 Because it is difficult to explain with so I tried to explain in the video a little, but because the explanation is poor 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.030
 Could you understand ? 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.570
 a It will be such a mechanism to say an award 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.640
 Because 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.420
 Takayama-san's nice but 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:24.650
 Huh 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:27.800
 If you buy second-hand and meet you , the part of the electronics is 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.350
 In after all of it is said to Toka 10 years 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.420
 When it comes to within 10 years in particular wish of used it says within 10 years a new article 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.350
 Will be higher 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:44.520
 Good at it that until a couple towards the or piano 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.990
 There is a piano, so buy it and post retrofit 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.990
 Only a small amount of yarn is new 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:56.320
 It is said to put something on 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.009
 If you think that it is the cause of that winning that saying that it is not as influence as possible 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.619
 that 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:10.309
 Also because I am listed in now way I candidate Do you think we made the point to choose that child 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:14.830
 The current Article Kyoto king init of the do you think I Yes e grand piano Fu that 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:14.830
 I mean, I feel like that
