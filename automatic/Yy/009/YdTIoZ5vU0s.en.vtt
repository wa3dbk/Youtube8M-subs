00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
meet some of the best scientists in this

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.400 
meet some of the best scientists in this
area

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.010 

my<00:00:40.160> official<00:00:40.340> title<00:00:40.520> is<00:00:40.850> curator<00:00:41.300> palms<00:00:41.660> and

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
my official title is curator palms and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.960 
my official title is curator palms and
cycad<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.040> basically<00:00:43.190> means<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:43.820> I

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
cycad so that basically means that I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.400 
cycad so that basically means that I
take<00:00:44.210> care<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.480> both<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.810> those<00:00:45.140> collections

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
take care of both of those collections

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.140 
take care of both of those collections
stick<00:00:46.250> them<00:00:47.140> on<00:00:48.140> top<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:48.740> soil<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.490> just

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
stick them on top of the soil and just

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.570 
stick them on top of the soil and just
push<00:00:50.390> them<00:00:50.540> down<00:00:50.600> about<00:00:51.140> halfway<00:00:51.580> difference

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
push them down about halfway difference

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.490 
push them down about halfway difference
between<00:00:52.970> palms<00:00:53.240> and<00:00:53.480> cycads<00:00:53.900> is<00:00:53.990> a<00:00:54.080> little<00:00:54.350> bit

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
between palms and cycads is a little bit

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.160 
between palms and cycads is a little bit
tricky<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.890> explain<00:00:55.300> palms<00:00:56.300> are<00:00:56.690> monocots

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
tricky to explain palms are monocots

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.680 
tricky to explain palms are monocots
which<00:00:57.770> means<00:00:58.040> they're<00:00:58.250> in<00:00:58.340> a<00:00:58.400> group<00:00:58.610> of<00:00:58.760> plants

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
which means they're in a group of plants

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.250 
which means they're in a group of plants
that<00:01:00.320> includes<00:01:00.950> orchids<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:01.940> grasses<00:01:02.780> for

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
that includes orchids and grasses for

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.400 
that includes orchids and grasses for
example<00:01:04.120> side<00:01:05.120> cats<00:01:05.449> though<00:01:05.660> they<00:01:05.810> look<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.200> lot

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
example side cats though they look a lot

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.920 
example side cats though they look a lot
like<00:01:06.560> palms<00:01:06.830> are<00:01:07.010> actually<00:01:07.520> quite<00:01:07.790> different

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
like palms are actually quite different

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.520 
like palms are actually quite different
they're<00:01:08.930> actually<00:01:09.560> more<00:01:09.770> closely<00:01:09.920> related<00:01:10.250> to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
they're actually more closely related to

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.650 
they're actually more closely related to
say<00:01:12.530> pine<00:01:13.010> trees<00:01:13.460> or<00:01:13.670> first<00:01:14.030> because<00:01:14.510> they're

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
say pine trees or first because they're

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:29.650 
say pine trees or first because they're
coning<00:01:15.080> plants<00:01:27.610> Fairchild<00:01:28.610> has<00:01:28.850> one<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.600> the

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
coning plants Fairchild has one of the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.390 
coning plants Fairchild has one of the
best<00:01:29.840> collections<00:01:30.050> of<00:01:30.440> palms<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.160> world

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
best collections of palms in the world

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.600 
best collections of palms in the world
and<00:01:31.900> this<00:01:32.900> garden<00:01:33.110> has<00:01:33.590> been<00:01:34.100> around<00:01:34.310> since

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
and this garden has been around since

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.450 
and this garden has been around since
1938<00:01:35.420> growing<00:01:35.900> palms<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:36.500> cycads<00:01:37.130> from

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
1938 growing palms and cycads from

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.080 
1938 growing palms and cycads from
everywhere<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.440> so<00:01:39.440> with<00:01:40.100> tropical<00:01:40.670> plants

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
everywhere and so with tropical plants

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.210 
everywhere and so with tropical plants
like<00:01:41.600> like<00:01:41.840> palms<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.320> cycads<00:01:42.710> there<00:01:42.950> aren't

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
like like palms and cycads there aren't

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.639 
like like palms and cycads there aren't
very<00:01:43.250> many<00:01:43.460> places<00:01:43.819> in<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.300> world<00:01:44.479> where<00:01:45.170> that

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
very many places in the world where that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.400 
very many places in the world where that
work<00:01:45.860> can<00:01:46.009> be<00:01:46.130> done<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.149> being<00:01:48.050> here<00:01:48.229> at<00:01:48.319> this

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
work can be done so being here at this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.080 
work can be done so being here at this
garden<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:49.009> probably<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.520> best<00:01:49.700> place<00:01:49.910> in<00:01:50.060> the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
garden is probably the best place in the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.510 
garden is probably the best place in the
world<00:01:50.149> for<00:01:50.479> me<00:01:50.569> to<00:01:50.600> work<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.830> what<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.009> do<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.429> I

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
world for me to work so what I do is I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520 
world for me to work so what I do is I
work<00:01:52.550> with<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.119> with<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.660> plants<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.140> bring

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
work with the with the plants and bring

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.410 
work with the with the plants and bring
them<00:01:54.679> back<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.979> our<00:01:55.009> laboratory<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.880> try<00:01:56.360> to

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
them back to our laboratory and try to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.990 
them back to our laboratory and try to
study<00:01:56.690> them<00:01:56.960> in<00:01:56.990> ways<00:01:57.319> that<00:01:57.830> we<00:01:58.310> learn<00:01:58.759> things

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
study them in ways that we learn things

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.520 
study them in ways that we learn things
that<00:01:59.179> you<00:01:59.240> can't<00:01:59.539> tell<00:01:59.750> just<00:01:59.990> by<00:02:00.020> looking<00:02:00.110> at

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
that you can't tell just by looking at

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.190 
that you can't tell just by looking at
the<00:02:00.649> plants

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
the plants

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590

I<00:02:02.289> actually<00:02:03.219> was<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.789> palm<00:02:03.969> biologist<00:02:04.450> very

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
I actually was the palm biologist very

I actually was the palm biologist very

the garden when you think about it

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.930 
the garden when you think about it
Fairchild<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.920> probably<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.430> only<00:02:12.550> place<00:02:12.730> in

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
Fairchild is probably the only place in
