 hello how about youtube people I know I 've 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.020
 been quite absent in the channel but 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 today I come with a new video 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.179
 tutorial in which I will teach 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.570
 how to fix the microphone sound 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.570
 the logitech je 430 hearing aids 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.770
 in these hearing aids I've seen several 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.770
 videos that youtube some youtubers 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.149
 criticism in these hearing aids just for their 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.629
 microphone because audio are excellent 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.570
 but what they do not know is that only bad 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.180
 configuration of this and to fix it 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.000
 we go here to this incognito that comes out 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.970
 down here on the back right 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.670
 let's go to recording devices 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.210
 and this box appears to us here we are going to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.270
 microphone we give in properties 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.090
 and here we go to advanced options like 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.199
 come I have it on channel 1 16 bits 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.720
 radio quality am already by default you 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.200
 it will come in quality I decided already 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.850
 and for and what is the use of changing it to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.380
 radio am 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.130
 Well, the audio you are listening to 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.939
 is the one that is reproducing through 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.820
 of the logitech microphone 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:29.119
 excuse me and then you hear excellent or 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.509
 it does not have interferences like those that 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.719
 I already believe that they have tested the hearing aids 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.549
 has interference and that's the only 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.520
 problem that you have because if you do not 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.619
 He listens in excellent and is always like 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.869
 that makes you do that and you already have 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.079
 perfectly functioning I hope that you 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.359
