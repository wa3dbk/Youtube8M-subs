00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
they're doing it on purpose you got to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.530 
they're doing it on purpose you got to
understand<00:01:32.220> black<00:01:32.520> ops<00:01:32.759> 3<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.509> a

understand black ops 3 is going to be a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.940 
understand black ops 3 is going to be a
game<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> take<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> lot<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.650> data

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
game that is going to take a lot of data

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
game that is going to take a lot of data
and<00:01:35.189> basically<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> old<00:01:35.939> gen<00:01:36.210> consoles

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and basically the old gen consoles

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
and basically the old gen consoles
cannot<00:01:36.930> actually<00:01:37.170> take<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> they<00:01:38.220> don't<00:01:38.549> have

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
cannot actually take it they don't have

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
cannot actually take it they don't have
enough<00:01:39.299> data<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.930> them<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:40.740> take<00:01:41.100> all

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
enough data in them to actually take all

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.679 
enough data in them to actually take all
the<00:01:41.400> information<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.030> things<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the information and things like that the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
the information and things like that the
black<00:01:42.899> ops<00:01:43.140> 3<00:01:43.409> will<00:01:43.590> bring<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:44.310> why<00:01:44.430> aw<00:01:44.970> was

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
black ops 3 will bring that's why aw was

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.370 
black ops 3 will bring that's why aw was
a<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.450> different<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.780> last<00:01:46.049> gen<00:01:46.229> than

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
a little bit different on last gen than

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.319 
a little bit different on last gen than
it<00:01:46.470> was<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> next-gen<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.310> black<00:01:47.820> ops<00:01:48.060> 2<00:01:48.210> is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it was a next-gen and black ops 2 is

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.730 
it was a next-gen and black ops 2 is
going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.720> completely<00:01:49.170> different<00:01:49.649> on

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
going to be completely different on

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.310 
going to be completely different on
next-gen<00:01:50.130> than<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.210> last<00:01:51.810> gen<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
next-gen than it is in last gen so I

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
next-gen than it is in last gen so I
just<00:01:52.590> want<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.740> clear<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.979> air<00:01:53.100> guys<00:01:53.399> don't

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
just want to clear the air guys don't

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.039 
just want to clear the air guys don't
think<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.540> doing<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.020> purpose

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
think that they're doing this on purpose

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.050 
think that they're doing this on purpose
you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.619> against<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.399> Jen<00:01:56.790> players

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you know against you know Jen players

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.819 
you know against you know Jen players
it's<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> way<00:01:58.710> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
it's not like that that's not the way it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's not like that that's not the way it
works<00:01:58.860> obviously<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.700> they<00:02:00.030> could<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.479> they

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
works obviously if they could do it they

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
works obviously if they could do it they
probably<00:02:00.869> would<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.770> money<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.009> them

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
probably would it's more money for them

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
probably would it's more money for them
but<00:02:02.490> that's<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> way<00:02:03.060> things<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.509> due

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
but that's just the way things are due

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
but that's just the way things are due
to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> current<00:02:04.170> limitations<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.920> last<00:02:05.189> gen
