basically one of the new not really a
new<00:00:23.670> new<00:00:23.910> computer<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:24.510> it's<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.779> fairly<00:00:25.019> new

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
new new computer but it's a fairly new

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.880 
new new computer but it's a fairly new
computer<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.769> has<00:00:27.050> amd's<00:00:28.050> new<00:00:28.080> apu

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
computer that has amd's new apu

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.090 
computer that has amd's new apu
processing<00:00:29.460> unit<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:31.940> AMD<00:00:32.940> ii<00:00:34.070> 350<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
processing unit is a AMD ii 350 I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.170 
processing unit is a AMD ii 350 I
believe<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.750> has<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.670> graphics<00:00:38.670> card<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
believe and that has a graphics card and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450 
believe and that has a graphics card and
processor<00:00:39.989> built<00:00:40.170> into<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.010> works<00:00:41.250> with

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
processor built into it so it works with

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.479 
processor built into it so it works with
my<00:00:41.579> 85<00:00:42.469> and<00:00:43.469> let<00:00:43.770> me<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.250> out<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
my 85 and let me just get this out of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.720 
my 85 and let me just get this out of
here<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:46.010> I'm<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
here for you I'm just going out of this

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.100 
here for you I'm just going out of this
one<00:00:47.940> hand<00:00:48.180> today<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:48.899> my

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
one hand today I don't want to use my

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.819 
one hand today I don't want to use my
tripod<00:00:50.600> into<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.690> such<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> small<00:00:52.140> box<00:00:53.600> but

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
tripod into this such a small box but

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
tripod into this such a small box but
really<00:00:55.829> nice<00:00:55.949> computer<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.210> price

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
really nice computer a really good price

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.910 
really nice computer a really good price
so<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> figured<00:00:58.590> anybody<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.680> need<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so I figured anybody the good need of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.290 
so I figured anybody the good need of
anything<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.000> these<00:01:03.090> because

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
anything can get one of these because

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.170 
anything can get one of these because
it's<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> netbook<00:01:04.080> form<00:01:04.350> factor<00:01:05.000> but<00:01:06.000> it's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's like a netbook form factor but it's

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.570 
it's like a netbook form factor but it's
at<00:01:06.510> least<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.439> lot<00:01:07.950> better<00:01:08.189> than<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> netbook

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
at least on a lot better than a netbook

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.240 
at least on a lot better than a netbook
at<00:01:08.909> least<00:01:09.090> twice<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.570> fast<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.110> can<00:01:10.890> play<00:01:11.040> even

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
at least twice as fast I can play even

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
at least twice as fast I can play even
why<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.330> wanted<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.630> but

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
why on if you really wanted to but

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
why on if you really wanted to but
that's<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.369> used<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.840> just

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that's not really be used for just

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.620 
that's not really be used for just
freely<00:01:16.020> college<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.590> stuff<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.979> guess<00:01:17.630> just

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
freely college and stuff I guess just

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.499 
freely college and stuff I guess just
taken<00:01:19.020> off<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.790> little<00:01:20.790> protection<00:01:21.150> for

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
taken off all the little protection for

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.960 
taken off all the little protection for
it<00:01:21.650> basically<00:01:22.650> only<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.460> just

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
it basically only thing that I just

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.219 
it basically only thing that I just
pulled<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.479> earlier<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> start

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pulled out here earlier was a start

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.130 
pulled out here earlier was a start
guide<00:01:26.030> nothing<00:01:27.030> special<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.479> teaching<00:01:28.080> how

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
guide nothing special just teaching how

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
guide nothing special just teaching how
to<00:01:28.170> even<00:01:28.409> plug<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:28.979> turn<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.990> tell

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
to even plug it in and turn it on tell

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.420 
to even plug it in and turn it on tell
me<00:01:31.079> about<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> quick<00:01:31.560> web<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.070> has<00:01:32.189> which

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
me about the quick web that it has which

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.039 
me about the quick web that it has which
is<00:01:32.549> basically<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> instant<00:01:33.420> solution<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
is basically the instant solution so you

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.420 
is basically the instant solution so you
have<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> wait<00:01:34.320> for<00:01:34.380> windows<00:01:34.799> 7<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> boot<00:01:35.310> up

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
have to wait for windows 7 to boot up

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.260 
have to wait for windows 7 to boot up
and<00:01:35.759> turn<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:37.579> let's<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.759> everything<00:01:39.030> else

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
and turn on let's get everything else

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.930 
and turn on let's get everything else
battery<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.660> should<00:01:43.350> be<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:44.130> stick<00:01:44.400> so<00:01:44.670> much

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
battery here should be the stick so much

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.660 
battery here should be the stick so much
choice<00:01:48.440> silver<00:01:49.440> goes<00:01:49.800> in<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.980> back<00:01:50.160> we'll<00:01:50.370> put

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
choice silver goes in the back we'll put

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.660 
choice silver goes in the back we'll put
that<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.150> minute<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.890> charger<00:01:56.370> which<00:01:56.550> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that in a minute the charger which is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
that in a minute the charger which is
most<00:01:56.850> likely<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.350> 65<00:01:58.350> watt<00:01:58.620> charger<00:02:00.710> yep<00:02:01.710> 65

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
most likely a 65 watt charger yep 65

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
most likely a 65 watt charger yep 65
watt<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:04.230> then<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> other<00:02:05.100> end<00:02:05.400> of<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:06.020> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
watt and then the other end of it and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.370 
watt and then the other end of it and
then<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.890> believe<00:02:08.130> there's<00:02:08.399> everything<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.390> just

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.090 
what's called cool Sense technology so
here<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.989> bottom<00:04:11.110> can't<00:04:11.830> really<00:04:11.920> see

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
here on the bottom can't really see

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.979 
here on the bottom can't really see
anything<00:04:12.250> like<00:04:12.730> special<00:04:13.060> about<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.360> but

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
anything like special about it but

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.470 
anything like special about it but
basically<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.500> has<00:04:14.590> sensors<00:04:14.920> in<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:16.090> tell

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
basically it has sensors in it that tell

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.409 
basically it has sensors in it that tell
you<00:04:16.660> well<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.650> tells<00:04:17.829> itself<00:04:18.250> what<00:04:19.090> way<00:04:19.269> it's

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
you well it tells itself what way it's

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.569 
you well it tells itself what way it's
being<00:04:19.540> used<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.169> if<00:04:20.290> it's<00:04:20.440> on<00:04:20.560> your<00:04:20.590> lap<00:04:20.919> it

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
being used so if it's on your lap it

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.860 
being used so if it's on your lap it
will<00:04:21.700> cool<00:04:21.850> certain<00:04:22.210> way<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:22.510> way<00:04:22.720> your

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
will cool certain way so that way your

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.380 
will cool certain way so that way your
your<00:04:23.350> lap<00:04:23.860> doesn't<00:04:24.160> get<00:04:24.280> hot<00:04:24.430> well<00:04:25.240> if<00:04:25.300> your

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
your lap doesn't get hot well if your

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.970 
your lap doesn't get hot well if your
nose<00:04:25.510> is<00:04:25.540> on<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.840> table<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.440> will<00:04:26.560> start<00:04:26.740> cooling

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
nose is on a table it will start cooling

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.250 
nose is on a table it will start cooling
certain<00:04:27.310> way<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.730> gets<00:04:27.820> more<00:04:28.000> efficient<00:04:28.450> so

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
certain way so it gets more efficient so

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.900 
certain way so it gets more efficient so
it's<00:04:29.410> pretty<00:04:29.560> neat<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.040> they're<00:04:30.669> pretty<00:04:30.790> much

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
it's pretty neat and they're pretty much

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.060 
it's pretty neat and they're pretty much
integrated<00:04:31.210> into<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:31.780> on<00:04:32.380> all<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.950> new

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
integrated into that on all the new

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.580 
integrated into that on all the new
computers<00:04:33.690> but<00:04:34.690> now<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:34.990> newer<00:04:35.200> ones<00:04:35.530> have

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
computers but now the newer ones have

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.040 
computers but now the newer ones have
like<00:04:35.919> a<00:04:36.130> six<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.790> A<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.000> which<00:04:37.450> are<00:04:37.600> dual<00:04:37.780> core

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
like a six and A a which are dual core

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.890 
like a six and A a which are dual core
on<00:04:38.110> quad<00:04:38.320> cores<00:04:38.620> with<00:04:39.100> better<00:04:39.340> graphics<00:04:39.900> but

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
on quad cores with better graphics but

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.570 
on quad cores with better graphics but
yeah<00:04:41.290> those<00:04:41.440> are<00:04:41.590> heavy<00:04:41.740> duty<00:04:42.040> computers<00:04:42.400> but

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
yeah those are heavy duty computers but

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.010 
yeah those are heavy duty computers but
this<00:04:42.790> is<00:04:42.940> a<00:04:43.080> little<00:04:44.080> baby<00:04:44.200> netbook<00:04:45.810> sorry<00:04:46.810> but
