00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.250
Teaching your dog, whether a puppy or an adult,
to rest comfortably in their crate, is a wonderful

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.960
skill for you and your dog to have.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.460
For puppies or new adult dogs coming into
your home, it's an excellent way to ensure

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.120
that they don't have potty accidents and get
into habits that they shouldn't when you can't

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.590
supervise them.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.090
But even for adult dogs, especially if you
travel, it's a wonderful way to ensure that

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.440
they have a home away from home.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.890
The first thing you want to do, whether it's
a puppy or an older dog, is make sure that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.800
they love their crate.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.010
Some ways that you can accomplish this is
making the crate a desirable place to rest

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.720
and that they get wonderful things in there.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.120
So I always think it's a great idea to feed
your dog all of its meals in the crate.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.520
You can keep the door open.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.380
So that meals go off in the crate.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.380
You can also put your dog in the crate when
it's nap time or their most likely to settle

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.380
down.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.270
And you want to just give it a little bit
of time to make sure your dog is comfortable

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.270
in the crate.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.920
So for instance, if you give your dog a toy
in the crate do they remain in the crate playing

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920
with it?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.490
Or do they take it out?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.020
Once you feel like your dog feels very confident
with the crate, you can begin shutting the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.979
door for periods of time where they have something
to do.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.049
So right now, Walter is happily licking at
his toy and I can close the crate door and

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.509
then a little bit before he was finished with
that, I might open it up for him.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.009
And once he was crate trained, I could leave
it on in there and he would probably settle

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.090
down for a nap.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.720
Another thing that really helps with crate
training your dog is to play some crate games.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.529
So I'm going to encourage Walter to come on
out of the crate.

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:57.829
And when he comes out I'm going to give him
some hugs and some pets and some love.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.969
And then I'm going to toss this treat into
the crate and he's going to run on in there

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.009
to get his treat.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.789
And when he turns around I'm going to say
"good" and I'm going to drop a couple of treats

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.590
on the floor for him.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.830
And then I'm going to encourage him to come
out.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.180
When he comes out, I'll reward him for coming
out, but I'm going to use tactile, or petting,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.880
and verbal praise "good boy" and I'm going
to toss the treat on back into the crate.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.560
I want my dog to prefer the idea of going
in the crate than coming out.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.250
And that's why I'm going to use high value
treats for rewarding him for going in the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.720
crate and verbal praise and pets for coming
out.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.390
Once he's doing that reliably, I can put it
on cue "go to your crate" and point him on

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.780
in when they turn around you reward them after
the fact.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.920
And then if I had to go out and I wanted to
crate my dog, I would give him some toys and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920
shut the door.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.720
I know that my adult dog or my puppy is safe.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.570
So follow these tips for crate training and
in no time you should have a dog that's resting

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.620
calmly and safely in his crate.
