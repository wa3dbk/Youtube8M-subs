00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 ae 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.550
 curitiba is giving us this 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.350
 some athletes that we do not 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.909
 has not had so much opportunity is in 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.010
 contact or the life of our relationship 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.009
 so it's not so close 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.560
 So we can through this 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.800
 party of this meeting could kill a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.890
 little of the longing is always a moment 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.369
 very important because when you meet 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.100
 Brazilian champions are gathered from the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.509
 environment in the same space and claw 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.960
 willingness and love to shirt 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.880
 This was a trademark registered in the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.690
 our conquest so I think the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.200
 Coritiba is to be congratulated on this 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.850
 promoting this reunion and I would say 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.390
 that their great recognition and 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.390
 is very pleased 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.519
 ae 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.620
 I hope to be marked for us neither 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.690
 we participated in a group formed to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.640
 to play a Brazilian championship where 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.370
 nobody was commenting the name curitiba 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.030
 so I guess what's going to be saved 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.120
 for us 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.350
 I think it's going to be the word union and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.320
 team was formed by having the command of the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.790
 Your Enio it was a wonderful person 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.870
 everybody respected everyone 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.250
 obeyed 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.290
 we had at the time a coach who 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.230
 when I lost the game he spoke he hit 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.260
 on chest so I say I lost the game 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:02.250
 When I was tying and speaking, we 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.440
 game and when we won he left 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.750
 the players to celebrate the victory at 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.610
 victory were two players we 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.620
 we played a championship but for 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.540
 Brazilian against teams that had 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.140
 players who were of the Brazilian national team 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.720
 the corinthians are sport reef once a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.420
 miner then it was times that were 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.550
 quoted to be champion but coritiba 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.500
 I spoke was working together 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.370
 He was able to do everything I asked of us. 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.690
 coach 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.200
 I think that we got this 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.200
 unpublished title 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.840
 my God 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.299
 this is very good and satisfies the ego of 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.459
 We really are not happy with 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.650
 this homage because it 's coming 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.480
 at a certain time, not after the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.810
 People leave, so that's why we 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.790
 we are immensely happy with 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.680
 opportunity to be here within the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.360
 field and seeing this wonderful mass 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.040
 here at coritiba 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.569
 and every time I 'm home and 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.700
 thinking about those moments that he 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.090
 passed by we remember with a lot of 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.519
 miss today semp toshiba curitiba 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.859

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.680
 brought here when we came to live 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.110

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.479
