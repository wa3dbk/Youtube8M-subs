00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.690
 good morning we are all in revel 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.560
 in the province of turin 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.800
 we are in the auto box workshop that over 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.070
 have the department as you can see 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.460
 car and repair also takes care of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 resale of car accessories and spare parts 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.950
 in addition we are obviously dealers of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.100
 meta products with sellers e 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.140
 users first introduced me to the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.590
 flight my name is giacomo I come from 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.120
 ferrari racing department formulates one and me 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.410
 I've been in motorsport for many years 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.030
 and besides doing this activity in the sense 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.710
 in addition to being responsible for the workshop 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.020
 in the car box this year I also follow the 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.329
 Swiss team of committed maserati 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.979
 of the trophy maserati and I manage the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.060
 machines are practically technical 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.710
 good engineer technician 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.409
 let's start talking a little bit about 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.509
 metamondo products we also see a bit 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.240
 you answer the whole range the most 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.189
 what we use is important 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.670
 especially on our cars both from 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.549
 race that road cars because this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.729
 product is excellent especially for the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.939
 daily machines then we start with 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.840
 the meta bond cl that the treatment of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.909
 washing inserted in the engine 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.069
 obviously in the engine oil before 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.130
 make the old oil drain in 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.229
 so that they are removed eliminated 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.829
 all the waste of old oil 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.369
 once used on here obviously 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.749
 let's put it back into the new oil 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.439
 inside the engine and we can 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:02:00.149
 move to the eco method treatment 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.170
 this product here 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.700
 increases the smoothness of the material 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.940
 acting at the molecular level on 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.000
 material and consequently increases the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.550
 engine power and torque 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.099
 eliminating a lot of friction in the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.940
 metal eco but canteens obviously to the engine 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.100
 warm so that it acts is held 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.130
 within that whole interval 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.530
 then use the oil 15 10 20 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.590
 thousand kilometers based on the oils that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.740
 manufacturer the foot we move to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.140
 that change treatment is 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.390
 same differential appearance 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.340
 meta bonda echo technician in the sense that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.800
 acts on material molecules 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.090
 obviously reducing friction e 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.730
 thereby increasing 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.870
 smoothness of all subject parts 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.000
 the rolling temperature decreases 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.510
 exercise all in favor of durability 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.630
 of the material we pass to the other 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.130
 produced in meta with legal nor this e 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.020
 gasoline treatment and associated with 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.750
 his twin brother is also the goal 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:18.240
 fuel oil bond the main operation 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.970
 is the molecular composition of the 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.430
 gasoline or its twin brother I repeat 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.920
 of diesel in favor of a perfect one 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.730
 therefore combustion in the decrease of the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.650
 consumption and obviously in favor again 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.780
 of increase in power and torque of 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.040
 engine as all the petrol 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.460
 introduced into the combustion chamber 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.070
 it is completely burned with an envelope 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:47.520
 not just in part like a normal 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.530
 like a normal combustion this is 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.060
 really a great a great product 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.210
 then as you can well see not 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.380
 we use everything on these machines 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.200
 this is in favor of speed power but 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.520
 above all it is of duration because you know 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.870
 very well the costs they may have 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.030
 of the machines of the kind and therefore 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.580
 we need to make the most last 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.100
 possible the material must go the 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.340
 as strong as possible but must also 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.340
 out 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.590
 the recovery 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.470
 however I repeat from the sentence without 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.470
 oil cannot be accessed 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:33.780
 straight bottom 788 are now good 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.230
 with longer screen modes more 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.230
 increase 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.530
 I called
