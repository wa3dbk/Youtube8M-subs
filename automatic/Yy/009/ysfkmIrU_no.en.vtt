00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.840 
kind of hard to get it to seat it on
there<00:02:14.950> once<00:02:15.190> you've<00:02:15.340> got<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.580> all<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> way

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
there once you've got it all the way

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.420 
there once you've got it all the way
down<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:19.500> see<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.800> totally<00:02:20.950> messed<00:02:21.280> that

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
down so see I just totally messed that

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.660 
down so see I just totally messed that
up

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
up

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.810 
up
but<00:02:22.420> anyway<00:02:22.690> put<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:23.820> there

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
but anyway put it on like this there

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.840 
but anyway put it on like this there
it's<00:02:24.970> kind<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.209> seated<00:02:25.570> there<00:02:25.750> right<00:02:25.930> now<00:02:26.850> then

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
it's kind of seated there right now then

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.000 
it's kind of seated there right now then
you<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.120> screw<00:02:28.360> on<00:02:28.390> your<00:02:30.600> nut<00:02:31.600> there<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.890> you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
you can screw on your nut there and you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.120 
you can screw on your nut there and you
want<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.250> put<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:33.580> into<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.830> vise<00:02:35.830> or

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
want to put this into a vise or

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.350 
want to put this into a vise or
something<00:02:36.489> because<00:02:36.610> you'll<00:02:36.820> want<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.000> tighten

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
something because you'll want to tighten

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.930 
something because you'll want to tighten
down<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:38.530> got<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.739> crank<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.100> down<00:02:39.160> all<00:02:39.700> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
down you got to crank this down all the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.360 
down you got to crank this down all the
way<00:02:40.120> until<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:40.930> stops

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.670 

you<00:02:46.370> may<00:02:46.520> or<00:02:46.700> may<00:02:46.760> not<00:02:46.850> need<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.210> vise<00:02:47.680> actually

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
you may or may not need a vise actually

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.490 
you may or may not need a vise actually
this<00:02:48.770> one<00:02:48.980> doesn't<00:02:49.220> seem<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:49.520> I'm<00:02:49.640> going<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.740 

here<00:02:57.100> we<00:02:57.190> go<00:02:57.370> that's<00:02:58.330> how<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.540> should<00:02:58.720> look

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
here we go that's how it should look

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.020 
here we go that's how it should look
when<00:02:59.080> it's<00:02:59.200> done<00:02:59.410> it<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.550> kind<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.730> folds

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
when it's done it just kind of folds

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.660 
when it's done it just kind of folds
over<00:03:01.240> himself

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
over himself

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.220 
over himself
and<00:03:03.670> then<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.910> last<00:03:04.060> piece<00:03:04.330> would<00:03:04.570> be<00:03:04.630> your

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and then the last piece would be your

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.260 
and then the last piece would be your
adjustment<00:03:05.650> screw<00:03:05.860> which<00:03:06.070> we'll<00:03:06.940> get<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.120> that

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
adjustment screw which we'll get to that

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.520 
adjustment screw which we'll get to that
later<00:03:07.600> that's<00:03:07.900> when<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.110> actually<00:03:08.350> put<00:03:08.500> on

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
later that's when you actually put on

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.200 
later that's when you actually put on
the<00:03:08.680> bike<00:03:08.860> but<00:03:09.070> essentially<00:03:09.550> that's<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.880> hole

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
the bike but essentially that's the hole

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.580 
the bike but essentially that's the hole
over<00:03:10.390> your<00:03:10.570> master<00:03:10.930> cylinder<00:03:11.080> put<00:03:11.470> together

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
over your master cylinder put together

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.960 
over your master cylinder put together
the<00:03:11.950> last<00:03:12.130> thing<00:03:12.340> like<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.580> said<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.820> got<00:03:12.910> to

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
the last thing like I said you got to

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.449 
the last thing like I said you got to
tighten<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:13.360> down<00:03:13.680> put<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.070> tip<00:03:15.250> is

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
tighten this down put the the tip is

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.250 
tighten this down put the the tip is
flattened<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:18.240> there<00:03:19.240> you<00:03:19.330> go<00:03:19.480> put<00:03:20.230> that

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
flattened see that there you go put that

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.580 
flattened see that there you go put that
in<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.530> vise<00:03:20.709> then<00:03:21.040> tighten<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.550> nut<00:03:21.760> down<00:03:22.000> and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
in a vise then tighten this nut down and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.720 
in a vise then tighten this nut down and
you've<00:03:23.590> got<00:03:23.740> your<00:03:23.860> rear<00:03:24.010> master<00:03:24.370> cylinder

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
you've got your rear master cylinder

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.370 
you've got your rear master cylinder
that's<00:03:25.209> pretty<00:03:25.390> much<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.690> right<00:03:25.720> now<00:03:26.020> for<00:03:26.200> that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
that's pretty much it right now for that

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.040 
that's pretty much it right now for that
until<00:03:26.980> we<00:03:27.070> stall<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.580> bike<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:28.090> next

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
until we stall it on the bike so next

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.449 
until we stall it on the bike so next
we'll<00:03:29.200> come<00:03:29.680> up<00:03:29.770> with<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.980> front<00:03:30.160> master

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
we'll come up with the front master

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.820 
we'll come up with the front master
cylinder
