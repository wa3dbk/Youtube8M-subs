00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.200 
basically i realized that the sound on
the<00:01:15.070> Nano<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.330> can<00:01:16.509> see<00:01:16.689> right<00:01:16.720> here<00:01:17.259> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the Nano that you can see right here is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.690 
the Nano that you can see right here is
deeper<00:01:19.210> richer<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.079> has<00:01:20.799> much<00:01:21.159> more<00:01:21.189> base

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
deeper richer and has much more base

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.420 
deeper richer and has much more base
than<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.650> sound<00:01:23.920> on<00:01:24.220> my<00:01:24.400> beloved<00:01:24.850> iphone<00:01:26.430> this

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430

than the sound on my beloved iphone this
it<00:01:27.670> first<00:01:28.000> kind<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.570> upset<00:01:28.990> me<00:01:29.020> because<00:01:29.290> i

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
it first kind of upset me because i

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.289 
it first kind of upset me because i
thought<00:01:29.680> you<00:01:29.979> know<00:01:30.009> for<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.000> price

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
thought you know for the price

thought you know for the price
comparison<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.740> 16<00:01:33.189> gig<00:01:33.369> iphone<00:01:33.610> as

comparison this is the 16 gig iphone as
eight<00:01:35.860> gig<00:01:37.140> nano<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:39.000> thought<00:01:40.000> well<00:01:40.299> for<00:01:40.750> the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
eight gig nano I thought well for the

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.069 
eight gig nano I thought well for the
price<00:01:41.110> you<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:43.329> I<00:01:43.360> should<00:01:43.780> definitely<00:01:46.079> have

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
price you know I should definitely have

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.690 
price you know I should definitely have
better<00:01:47.350> sound<00:01:47.710> quality<00:01:47.799> from<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.490> more

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
better sound quality from the more

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.870 
better sound quality from the more
expensive<00:01:49.030> unit<00:01:49.659> but<00:01:49.930> actually<00:01:50.200> I<00:01:50.880> checked

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
expensive unit but actually I checked

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.730 
expensive unit but actually I checked
and<00:01:52.090> made<00:01:52.240> sure<00:01:52.270> all<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.899> settings<00:01:53.290> were<00:01:53.560> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and made sure all the settings were the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.219 
and made sure all the settings were the
same<00:01:54.270> knowing<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> equalizer<00:01:57.270> banging<00:01:58.270> the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
same knowing the equalizer banging the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.830

standing up and you know both of my kids

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.500 
standing up and you know both of my kids
run<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.680> they<00:02:32.950> have<00:02:33.130> iphones<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
run and they have iphones and one of the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.030 
run and they have iphones and one of the
things<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.810> they<00:02:35.020> say<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.320> they<00:02:35.740> don't<00:02:35.920> like

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
things that they say is they don't like

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.470 
things that they say is they don't like
running<00:02:36.430> with<00:02:36.460> their<00:02:36.700> iPhone<00:02:37.030> because<00:02:37.300> it's

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
running with their iPhone because it's

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.140 
running with their iPhone because it's
so<00:02:37.600> much<00:02:37.750> heavier<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.400> guess<00:02:39.700> one<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.000> my

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
so much heavier so I guess one of my

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.110 
so much heavier so I guess one of my
recommendations<00:02:40.510> would<00:02:41.200> be<00:02:41.500> if<00:02:42.070> you're<00:02:42.850> into

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
recommendations would be if you're into

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.150 
recommendations would be if you're into
sports<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.870> or<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:47.200> know<00:02:47.320> any<00:02:47.350> activities

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
sports and or you know any activities

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.980 
sports and or you know any activities
like<00:02:48.340> working<00:02:48.820> out<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.090> gym<00:02:49.180> or<00:02:49.570> anything

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
like working out in the gym or anything

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.270 
like working out in the gym or anything
sound<00:02:50.950> quality<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.550> weight<00:02:51.940> wise<00:02:52.860> Nana<00:02:53.860> would

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
sound quality and weight wise Nana would

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.810 
sound quality and weight wise Nana would
be<00:02:54.460> better<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:59.190> you<00:03:00.190> know<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.580> kind<00:03:00.760> of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
be better and you know I just kind of
