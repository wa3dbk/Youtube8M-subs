happens before you've pasted back foot
to<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.280> rear<00:03:45.160> bang<00:03:47.709> no<00:03:48.709> replace<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.670> this

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
to the rear bang no replace it so this

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.880 
to the rear bang no replace it so this
term<00:03:53.329> niskanen<00:03:53.870> also<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.440> lot<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.680> people

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
term niskanen also a lot of people

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.650 
term niskanen also a lot of people
making<00:03:55.100> incorrect<00:03:55.640> step<00:03:55.850> their<00:03:56.030> study<00:03:56.209> here

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
making incorrect step their study here

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.140 
making incorrect step their study here
so<00:03:57.230> they<00:03:57.380> look<00:03:57.620> like<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.579> must<00:03:58.790> step<00:03:58.970> out

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
so they look like this you must step out

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150 
so they look like this you must step out
far<00:03:59.420> enough<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.840> right<00:04:00.170> when<00:04:00.769> you<00:04:00.799> sit

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
far enough to the right when you sit

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.800 
far enough to the right when you sit
back

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.229 

so<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.080> step<00:04:10.260> out<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.709> right

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
so you can step out to the right

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.370 
so you can step out to the right
diagonally<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.840> when<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.050> come<00:04:13.230> into

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
diagonally so that when you come into

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
the final this type and turning you see

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:22.370 
the final this type and turning you see
that<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.510> normal<00:04:15.750> boxing<00:04:16.680> stance<00:04:21.350> Thank<00:04:22.350> You

anyway and you just squeeze down that
with<00:06:10.009> a<00:06:10.039> little<00:06:10.189> bit<00:06:10.369> of<00:06:10.429> pressure<00:06:10.639> to<00:06:11.089> squeeze

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
with a little bit of pressure to squeeze

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.029 
with a little bit of pressure to squeeze
down<00:06:11.749> as<00:06:12.079> your<00:06:12.499> hand<00:06:12.709> chops<00:06:13.039> down<00:06:13.309> to<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.699> left

and chi now this is the difference you

00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:43.149 
and chi now this is the difference you
of<00:06:41.389> course<00:06:41.599> the<00:06:42.229> next<00:06:42.499> one<00:06:42.679> we<00:06:42.829> got<00:06:42.949> your

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
of course the next one we got your

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.279 
of course the next one we got your
square<00:06:43.399> like<00:06:43.579> this<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:44.120> grab<00:06:44.629> actually<00:06:45.079> take

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
square like this and grab actually take

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.009 
square like this and grab actually take
a<00:06:45.319> step<00:06:45.649> through<00:06:45.889> this<00:06:46.129> time<00:06:46.539> so<00:06:47.539> we<00:06:47.659> look<00:06:47.839> in<00:06:47.959> a

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:48.019 
a step through this time so we look in a

00:06:48.019 --> 00:06:48.580 
a step through this time so we look in a
mirror

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
mirror

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.960 
mirror
and<00:06:48.680> as<00:06:48.800> you<00:06:48.950> do<00:06:49.070> that<00:06:49.100> you<00:06:49.400> take<00:06:49.610> a<00:06:49.640> step

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 
and as you do that you take a step

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.750 
and as you do that you take a step
through<00:06:50.300> and<00:06:50.450> open<00:06:50.600> your<00:06:50.900> hands<00:06:51.730> to<00:06:52.730> the

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
through and open your hands to the

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.900 
through and open your hands to the
normal<00:06:53.150> position<00:06:53.270> we<00:06:53.630> had<00:06:53.780> it<00:06:53.930> in<00:06:54.050> before<00:06:54.910> then

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
normal position we had it in before then

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.550 
normal position we had it in before then
this<00:06:56.090> one<00:06:56.270> comes<00:06:56.540> around<00:06:56.900> as<00:06:57.110> you're<00:06:57.260> picking

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560
