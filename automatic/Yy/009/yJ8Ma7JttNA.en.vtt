we<00:01:40.140> know<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.409> want<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> know<00:01:40.829> ahead<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.369> time<00:01:41.640> so

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
we know we want to know ahead of time so

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.510 
we know we want to know ahead of time so
we<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.110> best<00:01:43.229> product<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:43.950> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we can put the best product out there so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280 
we can put the best product out there so
Paul<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> durability<00:01:45.390> test<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> really<00:01:46.110> cool

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
Paul the durability test is really cool

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
Paul the durability test is really cool
but<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> find<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.399> fascinating<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
but what I find more fascinating is that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
but what I find more fascinating is that
the<00:01:48.360> same<00:01:48.570> guys<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.049> working<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.500> Indy

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the same guys that are working on Indy

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.649 
the same guys that are working on Indy
car<00:01:49.979> engines<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.549> NASCAR<00:01:50.970> engines<00:01:51.329> are

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
car engines and NASCAR engines are

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.899 
car engines and NASCAR engines are
working<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> Mastercraft<00:01:52.619> engine<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.250> how

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
working on the Mastercraft engine so how

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.209 
working on the Mastercraft engine so how
does<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.119> play<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> end<00:01:55.740> user<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
does that play in for the end user the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.399 
does that play in for the end user the
new<00:01:56.549> Mastercraft<00:01:57.149> owner<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.079> want<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
new Mastercraft owner you you want the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.080 
new Mastercraft owner you you want the
same<00:01:58.649> people<00:01:58.920> building<00:01:59.549> your<00:01:59.700> products

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
same people building your products

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.280 
same people building your products
consistently<00:02:00.719> especially<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
consistently especially at the

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.080 
consistently especially at the
development<00:02:01.770> level<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.670> doesn't<00:02:03.000> really

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
development level so it doesn't really

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.480 
development level so it doesn't really
matter<00:02:03.329> whether<00:02:03.600> we're<00:02:03.810> working<00:02:04.140> on

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
matter whether we're working on

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.730 
matter whether we're working on
motorcycle<00:02:05.490> engines<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.329> pump<00:02:06.689> sections<00:02:07.290> or

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
motorcycle engines that pump sections or

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.979 
motorcycle engines that pump sections or
the<00:02:07.770> fuel<00:02:08.550> systems<00:02:09.000> engine<00:02:09.479> tear<00:02:09.720> down

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the fuel systems engine tear down

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.869 
the fuel systems engine tear down
cylinder<00:02:10.649> heads<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.280> really<00:02:11.520> doesn't<00:02:11.790> matter

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
cylinder heads it really doesn't matter

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.860 
cylinder heads it really doesn't matter

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
equipment along here that we can test

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.930 
equipment along here that we can test
our<00:03:12.970> alternators<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:14.489> sensors<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:15.790> on

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
our alternators and sensors and so on

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.339 
our alternators and sensors and so on
straight<00:03:16.269> off<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.569> boat<00:03:16.750> straight<00:03:17.109> off<00:03:17.230> an

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
straight off the boat straight off an

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.390 
straight off the boat straight off an
Indy<00:03:17.530> car<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.769> doesn't<00:03:17.919> matter<00:03:18.130> same

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
Indy car it doesn't matter same

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.050 
Indy car it doesn't matter same
equipment<00:03:18.639> same<00:03:19.000> people<00:03:19.209> same<00:03:20.019> everything

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
equipment same people same everything

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.520 
equipment same people same everything
so<00:03:22.060> Paul<00:03:22.269> earlier<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.930> were<00:03:23.019> telling<00:03:23.349> me<00:03:23.380> it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
so Paul earlier you were telling me it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.319 
so Paul earlier you were telling me it
takes<00:03:23.709> about<00:03:23.829> two<00:03:24.190> years<00:03:24.220> ago<00:03:24.549> from<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.030> raw

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
takes about two years ago from the raw

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.629 
takes about two years ago from the raw
GM<00:03:25.810> block<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.500> finished<00:03:26.919> LLL<00:03:27.130> more<00:03:27.370> marine

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
GM block to the finished LLL more marine

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.360 
GM block to the finished LLL more marine
engine<00:03:28.030> why<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:28.720> long<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.709> takes<00:03:29.980> about<00:03:30.129> a<00:03:30.280> year

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
engine why so long it takes about a year

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.729 
engine why so long it takes about a year
just<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:30.970> get<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.269> engine<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:32.109> a<00:03:32.139> point<00:03:32.470> where

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
just to get the engine to a point where

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.860 
just to get the engine to a point where
we've<00:03:33.310> designed<00:03:33.639> everything<00:03:34.030> manufactured

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
we've designed everything manufactured

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.360 
we've designed everything manufactured
everything<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.410> we<00:03:35.530> can<00:03:35.650> put<00:03:35.799> it<00:03:35.919> on<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.069> dyno

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
everything so we can put it on a dyno

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.159 
everything so we can put it on a dyno
and<00:03:36.609> put<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.879> in<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.060> boat<00:03:37.269> once<00:03:37.840> we've<00:03:37.989> done

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
and put it in a boat once we've done

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.180 
and put it in a boat once we've done
that<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.530> all<00:03:38.709> about<00:03:38.950> performance

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that it's all about performance

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.940 
that it's all about performance
durability<00:03:39.989> calibration<00:03:40.989> for<00:03:41.109> EPA<00:03:41.440> carb

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
durability calibration for EPA carb

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.460 
durability calibration for EPA carb
etcetera<00:03:42.579> this<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.299> great<00:03:43.540> example<00:03:43.660> we<00:03:44.139> make

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
etcetera this is a great example we make

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.089 
etcetera this is a great example we make
all<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> parts<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.190> engine<00:03:45.609> but<00:03:45.760> for<00:03:46.239> this

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
all the parts on the engine but for this

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.170 
all the parts on the engine but for this
performance<00:03:48.099> development<00:03:48.669> we<00:03:48.940> tried

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
performance development we tried

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.599 
performance development we tried
different<00:03:49.569> volumes<00:03:49.959> for<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.199> 5.7<00:03:50.799> intake<00:03:51.430> you

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
different volumes for the 5.7 intake you

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.520 
different volumes for the 5.7 intake you
see<00:03:51.819> this<00:03:51.970> one's<00:03:52.209> completely<00:03:52.690> different<00:03:53.079> we

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
see this one's completely different we

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.229 
see this one's completely different we
like<00:03:53.709> this<00:03:53.919> one<00:03:54.129> gave<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.489> best<00:03:54.639> performance

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
like this one gave the best performance

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.809 
like this one gave the best performance
so<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.810> turned<00:03:56.199> into<00:03:56.379> the<00:03:56.470> 5.7<00:03:57.069> intake

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
so that turned into the 5.7 intake

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.300 
so that turned into the 5.7 intake
system<00:03:58.299> this<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> great<00:03:59.680> example<00:03:59.829> of

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
system this is a great example of

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.039 
system this is a great example of
fitting<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.209> in<00:04:01.329> a<00:04:01.419> boat<00:04:01.629> some<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.959> the

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
fitting it in a boat some of the

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.080 
fitting it in a boat some of the
problems<00:04:02.470> performance<00:04:03.370> development<00:04:03.579> said

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
problems performance development said

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.610 
problems performance development said
this<00:04:04.239> was<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.449> best<00:04:04.660> plenum<00:04:05.079> we<00:04:05.169> could<00:04:05.379> use

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
this was the best plenum we could use

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.890 
this was the best plenum we could use
found<00:04:06.519> out<00:04:06.699> that<00:04:06.879> this<00:04:07.060> is<00:04:07.209> a<00:04:07.239> little<00:04:07.419> too<00:04:07.690> long

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
found out that this is a little too long

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.039 
found out that this is a little too long
it<00:04:08.139> hit<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.410> motor<00:04:08.620> box<00:04:08.859> on<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.129> 190<00:04:09.669> and<00:04:10.049> so

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
it hit the motor box on the 190 and so

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.900 
it hit the motor box on the 190 and so
we<00:04:11.169> had<00:04:11.319> to<00:04:11.349> redesign<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:12.099> but<00:04:12.310> what<00:04:12.609> we<00:04:12.730> did

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
we had to redesign it but what we did

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.479 
we had to redesign it but what we did
god<00:04:13.840> thing<00:04:14.139> redesigned<00:04:14.680> got<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.040> rapid

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
god thing redesigned got a rapid

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.279 
god thing redesigned got a rapid
prototype<00:04:15.970> made<00:04:16.180> by<00:04:16.329> Penske<00:04:16.810> Racing<00:04:16.840> in

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
prototype made by Penske Racing in

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.890 
prototype made by Penske Racing in
Mooresville<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.239> we're<00:04:19.239> back<00:04:19.419> on<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:19.720> dyno

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
Mooresville and we're back on the dyno

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.589 
Mooresville and we're back on the dyno
36<00:04:20.560> hours<00:04:20.739> later<00:04:20.919> with<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.250> rapid<00:04:21.609> prototype<00:04:22.090> we

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
36 hours later with a rapid prototype we

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.360 
36 hours later with a rapid prototype we
were<00:04:22.659> able<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.020> test<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.530> no<00:04:23.710> performance<00:04:24.219> loss

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
were able to test it no performance loss

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.980 
were able to test it no performance loss
so<00:04:24.610> this<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.210> what<00:04:25.330> you're<00:04:25.479> going<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.690> see<00:04:25.840> on

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
so this is what you're going to see on

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.220 
so this is what you're going to see on
the<00:04:26.080> 6<00:04:26.320> liter<00:04:26.590> now

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
the 6 liter now

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.780 
the 6 liter now
but<00:04:27.320> that<00:04:27.440> that's<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:27.860> process<00:04:28.430> that's<00:04:28.610> why

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
but that that's that process that's why

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.600 
but that that's that process that's why
it<00:04:28.850> takes<00:04:29.120> two<00:04:29.390> years<00:04:30.190> Wow

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
it takes two years Wow

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.000 
it takes two years Wow
so<00:04:32.000> this<00:04:32.210> is<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.510> dyno<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.500> looks<00:04:33.680> like<00:04:33.800> one

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
so this is the dyno this looks like one

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.890 
so this is the dyno this looks like one
heck<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.430> commitment<00:04:34.790> tell<00:04:35.510> me<00:04:35.600> what<00:04:35.750> goes

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
heck of a commitment tell me what goes

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.580 
heck of a commitment tell me what goes
on<00:04:36.080> in<00:04:36.260> here

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.440 
on in here
this<00:04:37.190> is<00:04:37.340> really<00:04:37.520> where<00:04:37.760> we<00:04:37.790> do<00:04:38.030> all<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.270> load

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
this is really where we do all the load

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.060 
this is really where we do all the load
testing<00:04:38.870> for<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.110> engines<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:39.650> make<00:04:39.770> sure<00:04:39.950> the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
testing for the engines to make sure the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.280 
testing for the engines to make sure the
engines<00:04:40.400> durable<00:04:40.940> this<00:04:41.330> unit<00:04:41.750> back<00:04:41.930> here<00:04:42.170> is

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
engines durable this unit back here is

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.740 
engines durable this unit back here is
the<00:04:42.410> absorption<00:04:42.770> unit<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.520> converts<00:04:44.000> engine

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
the absorption unit it converts engine

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.540 
the absorption unit it converts engine
power<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.230> performance<00:04:45.500> into<00:04:46.100> electrical

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
durability testing this is where we run

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.570 
durability testing this is where we run
those<00:04:51.230> six<00:04:51.560> hundred<00:04:51.860> hour<00:04:51.980> tests<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.460> was

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
those six hundred hour tests I was

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.280 
those six hundred hour tests I was
talking<00:04:52.940> about<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.630> know<00:04:53.750> we<00:04:53.870> can<00:04:54.020> run<00:04:54.170> the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
talking about you know we can run the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.190 
talking about you know we can run the
engine<00:04:54.590> 24<00:04:55.010> hours<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.280> day<00:04:55.310> seven<00:04:55.850> days<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:56.030> week

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.060 
make sure everything's good very cool
and<00:05:01.130> how<00:05:01.790> does<00:05:01.970> EPA<00:05:02.680> regulations<00:05:03.680> play<00:05:03.890> into

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
and how does EPA regulations play into

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.690 
and how does EPA regulations play into
this<00:05:04.220> as<00:05:04.340> well

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
this as well

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.690 
this as well
well<00:05:04.880> this<00:05:05.210> Dinos<00:05:05.720> is<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.110> lot<00:05:06.590> more<00:05:06.830> investment

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
well this Dinos is a lot more investment

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.730 
well this Dinos is a lot more investment
than<00:05:07.970> just<00:05:08.330> an<00:05:08.450> absorption<00:05:08.870> unit<00:05:09.350> this<00:05:09.470> is

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
than just an absorption unit this is

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.000 
than just an absorption unit this is
actually<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.280> full<00:05:10.670> 13<00:05:11.420> gas<00:05:12.010> emission

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010
