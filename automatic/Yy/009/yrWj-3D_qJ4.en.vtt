designed to work with the iPhone 4 so
much<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.890> good<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> bit<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:47.640> this

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
much so good we know a bit about this

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
much so good we know a bit about this
but<00:00:48.000> what's<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> end<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.750> how<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> works

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but what's the end about how it works

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.770 
but what's the end about how it works
one<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> key<00:00:50.010> things<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.090> 6.1<00:00:51.660> inch

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
one of the key things is the 6.1 inch

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.740 
one of the key things is the 6.1 inch
multi-touch<00:00:52.500> capacitive<00:00:53.039> screen<00:00:53.940> capacitive

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
multi-touch capacitive screen capacitive

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.150 
multi-touch capacitive screen capacitive
so<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> same<00:00:55.320> flavor<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> ticularly

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.179 
classic design DNA yeah ok so we doing
here<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:41.369> thing<00:01:41.490> we'll<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.560> open<00:01:43.560> up

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
here is first thing we'll do is open up

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.639 
here is first thing we'll do is open up
the<00:01:44.759> app<00:01:44.880> screen<00:01:45.110> that's<00:01:46.110> where<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.470> brings

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the app screen that's where it brings

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
the app screen that's where it brings
contents<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.490> providing<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> app<00:01:48.149> itself

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
contents are providing the app itself

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.109 
contents are providing the app itself
has<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> output<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:50.790> come<00:01:51.090> through

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
has got the output it will come through

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.940 
has got the output it will come through
and<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> recommended<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.799> by

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and then if it's a recommended at by

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.289 
and then if it's a recommended at by
pioneer<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.820> will<00:01:53.909> actually<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
pioneer it will actually have a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
pioneer it will actually have a
dedicated<00:01:54.720> interface<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.040> saying<00:01:56.310> open<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
dedicated interface so saying open the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
dedicated interface so saying open the
app<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> first<00:01:57.210> thing<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> need<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
app so the first thing you need to do is

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.340 
app so the first thing you need to do is
download<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.070> app<00:01:59.729> from<00:01:59.939> either<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.960> Pioneer

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
download the app from either the Pioneer

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.700 
download the app from either the Pioneer
page<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.829> from<00:02:01.979> iTunes<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.320> an<00:02:04.500> app

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
page or from iTunes so it's just an app

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.749 
page or from iTunes so it's just an app
on<00:02:04.890> there<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.000> go<00:02:06.860> that<00:02:07.860> now<00:02:08.190> allows<00:02:08.520> the

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
in this tin room here it still knows

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.979 
in this tin room here it still knows
we're<00:03:14.819> at<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.000> side<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.359> building<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
we're at the side of the building and

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.449 
we're at the side of the building and
then<00:03:16.440> if<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.620> know<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.889> was<00:03:17.010> closer<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
then if you know if I was closer to the

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.370 
then if you know if I was closer to the
window<00:03:17.819> or<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.000> GPS<00:03:18.600> we<00:03:18.720> could<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.139> sky

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
window or the GPS we could see the sky

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.629 
window or the GPS we could see the sky
little<00:03:19.590> better<00:03:19.829> outside<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.489> building

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
little better outside of the building

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.340 
little better outside of the building
but<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.359> knows<00:03:21.510> we're<00:03:21.720> on<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> side<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.260> as

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
but it knows we're on the side and as
