00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:08.219
 no no 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.260
 lidia gÃ³mez I'm in ninth and 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.670
 I'm from the Basque country 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.679
 Well now I'm working on 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.480
 district of realization but what 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.739
 really is working in another area to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.739
 world of the ninth edition 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.939
 the truth is that they knew not having 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.699
 gone but they are never practices or anything and 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.190
 it's a bit difficult to imagine things 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.350
 because of course one thing is to read it but 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.239
 is lost is you do not have the location 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.670
 of the servant to finish and more the noise 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.020
 I really liked the three of them 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.360
 face-to-face meetings 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.140
 more for a lot because there is a lot of material 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.570
 you see it and when you see things it's already 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.840
 much easier than written or read 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.690
 why have I gone crazy 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.690
 trying to imagine with more classes 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 but it has always helped me with the theory 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.760
 that give us pretty good the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.400
 teachers who are very good and also 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.680
 the practical classes is giving me 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.580
 enough with 200 new ones that before 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.080
 I had 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.970
 then the practices in the hospital and what 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.190
 I'm doing it's a good to enjoy 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.510
 the people are very well they are very 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.520
 earrings also own 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.530
 the organization in front of us and not 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.550
 be very much with the notes plus the 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.720
 practices that bring us much less 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.640
 what we are doing 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.140
 if the truth is that yes because good I 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.119
 I especially picked it up because you can 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 do practices in the public that up 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.470
 now you could not and from a 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.119
 ancestor by signing an agreement and 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.170
 then I could also osakidetza what 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.750
 is what interests me because that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.760
 who wants to work 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.260
 next week I start practices and 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.620
 We have already been told that yes with the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.600
 practices that are not ready and all 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.600
 they consider this master 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.680
 I recommend it to more people who have 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.390
 something or not have any difference 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.060
 because it covers for people who already have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.190
 like people who come new who do not know 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.310
 nothing that you work in a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.310
 operating theater
