00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.029
 hi friends from youtube this is my first 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:12.910
 video and I bring you this roaming and matsui 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.910
 5.0 version 3.1 good let's start 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.390
 this is the lox cream 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.919
 as we see it does not have no access 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.919
 direct and we're just going to do well 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.610
 it's like the one in s 4 we do this 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.090
 and if the flag is not activated 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.140
 as we see it is very fluid and it does not have 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.860
 problems to run 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.900
 this is something very good that has the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.780
 and the water has been having the power 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.550
 widget 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.270
 we can not only run 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.270
 sorry 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.630
 we can run and expand or deactivate what 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.630

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.550

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.039
 the versions of eating sandwiches for 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.840
 that we can have more fluidity 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.640
 because there whether we will see in céline 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.640

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.500
 unknown 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.500
 here I can put 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:05.190
 to enable the options of 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.190

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:18.370
