read some of the signs and will soon
find<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> small<00:00:39.480> town<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.500> main

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
find out it's a small town the main

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.920 
find out it's a small town the main
concept<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.210> flat<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.750> all

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
concept is that it's all flat it's all

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.430 
concept is that it's all flat it's all
on<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.440> level<00:00:44.930> not<00:00:45.930> sure<00:00:46.079> how<00:00:46.170> well<00:00:46.350> they

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
on one level not sure how well they

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.779 
on one level not sure how well they
stuck<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> end<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.520> we'll<00:00:47.670> have

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
stuck to that in the end but we'll have

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.180 
stuck to that in the end but we'll have
a<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.710> people<00:00:49.710> were<00:00:49.770> told<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.100> they

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
a look and people were told that they

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
a look and people were told that they
could<00:00:50.340> build<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.850> were<00:00:50.969> told<00:00:51.149> sort<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
could build here they were told sort of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.630 
could build here they were told sort of
you<00:00:52.260> know<00:00:52.289> build<00:00:52.680> houses<00:00:53.100> build<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
you know build houses build what you

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.619 
you know build houses build what you
like<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> sort<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.629> proper

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
like and so you get a sort of proper

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.720 
like and so you get a sort of proper
center<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.079> planning<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:59.309> makes<00:00:59.520> stuff

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
center of planning which makes stuff

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.979 
center of planning which makes stuff
look<00:00:59.879> much<00:01:00.059> cooler<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.600> don't<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.809> get

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
look much cooler you don't just get

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.630 
look much cooler you don't just get
everything<00:01:01.260> shoved<00:01:01.920> all<00:01:02.039> over<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> place<00:01:02.489> for

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
everything shoved all over the place for

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.960 
everything shoved all over the place for
no<00:01:02.760> reason<00:01:04.909> as<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:07.670> community<00:01:08.670> areas

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
no reason as you can see community areas

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.789 
no reason as you can see community areas
normally<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.479> their<00:01:09.720> own<00:01:09.750> community<00:01:10.439> chests

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
normally have their own community chests

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.000 
normally have their own community chests
that<00:01:10.950> people<00:01:11.580> working<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> area<00:01:12.710> use<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
that people working on the area use and

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980 
that people working on the area use and
then<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.180> their<00:01:15.299> own<00:01:15.360> craft<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
then we have their own craft in and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.179 
then we have their own craft in and
forages<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> worry<00:01:17.070> about

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
forages so you don't have to worry about

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.000 
forages so you don't have to worry about
setting<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.240> stuff

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.740 

it's<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.910> science<00:01:23.210> telling<00:01:23.420> people<00:01:23.630> not<00:01:23.690> to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
it's a science telling people not to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.910 
it's a science telling people not to
steal<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.930> can<00:01:27.050> see<00:01:27.080> people<00:01:27.560> tend<00:01:27.770> to

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
steal and as you can see people tend to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.040 
steal and as you can see people tend to
write<00:01:28.190> down<00:01:28.370> what<00:01:29.030> they<00:01:29.180> made<00:01:29.390> what<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:29.930> is

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
write down what they made what it is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.170 
write down what they made what it is
science<00:01:30.800> have<00:01:30.950> been<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.130> massive<00:01:31.580> improvement

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
science have been a massive improvement

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.610
