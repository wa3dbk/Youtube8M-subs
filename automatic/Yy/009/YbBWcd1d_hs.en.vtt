00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.220
 samsung presented last night with 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.670
 lampa that its 2012 new galaxy note 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.810
 you see the two images bring us to 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.030
 facing a phone that is very much 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.949
 similar galaxy s3 actually the 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.770
 difference are of work dimensions the 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.480
 design and materials is really minimal 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.029
 also the benefits 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.320
 equal to the samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.210
 excellent screen performance 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.789
 very fluid indeed even more fluid given 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.620
 that the galaxy note 2 uses joe 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.989
 jellybean then project beat 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.269
 interface 60 hertz very suede 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.920
 reactive and fast you see it in ours 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.690
 video really is hard to find 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.359
 android device with these 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.510
 performance at the moment differences between 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:53.260
 the axis iii and ii the screen 5.5 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.969
 inch hd oled of course that yes 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.339
 check both with the fingers and with the prine 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.459
 and span let's try now to see how 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.749
 the browser works let's go on d day 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.729
 They say that the browser came finger 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.110
 as a benchmark and if the browser benchmark 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.630
 to cults see that quietly 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.610
 the experience of using this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.310
 samsung note two is something 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.640
 exceptional especially if we remember 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.050
 the first few android smartphones 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.120
 year ago also last year o 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.720
 even many android smartphones by 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.430
 now that they show us the images e 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.100
 sites with a few clicks too 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.680
 on scrolling the nova and turn off the real 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.460
 even more subtle more ergonomic 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.230
 easy to handle to use 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.490
 is used if to make designs that 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.560
 if this is the application I am a little bit 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.420
 limit pray see now let's change the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.810
 extreme nib of ideas to see how 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.200
 reacts to pressure and writing 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.240
 a kind of ink is not used 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.860
 obviously no lag really reactive 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.620
 a galaxy notes really perfected is 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.700
 really excellent to use we see 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.470
 what, however, are the innovations that they are 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.200
 added by samsung on this new one 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.370
 northern release because in the end 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.159
 optimizations have been made more at the level 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.310
 software with the stylus without touching it 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.390
 screen we can 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.370
 do a series of actions for example 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.680
 during videos we can do scrolling 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.390
 with real-time preview of that 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.099
 which will happen before and after to find 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.810
 the exact point is sufficient only 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.849
 rest the pen without touching it 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.980
 screen in this case supporting the 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.890
 pen on the folder we see a preview 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 of the photos inside 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.610
 therefore a double use is touching it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.120
 screen then marking both doing 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.950
 simply a kind of on imposed 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.299
 5300 of the screen with a pointer that 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.459
 is highlighted on the screen itself 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.099
 which allows us to have other functions 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.000
 like a mover or a preview the same 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.650
 what can be used 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.940
 quietly the web if predominantly 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.099
 for example we have a site with menus 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.670
 that come down when we do or mouse 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.410
 over 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.200
 just support the penalty above without 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.870
 tap to see the end of the pull-down 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.030
 of scrolling from another interesting thing 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.349
 it is obviously not applications 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.879
 reworked magazines the possibility of 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.260
 add notes on the back of one 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:08.049
 photo and send it as if it were one 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.489
 postcard now the guy doing 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.370
 we showed it that fact 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.980
 marked his name and the spy product 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.620
 of the postcard so many 919 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.079
 total experience with the pen 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.180
 improved and improved with respect to 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.700
 that of the already valid night of the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.739
 last year to return precisely to the subject 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.060
 use of the pen we see as if 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.549
 add an appointment on ours 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.900
 calendar and we pass the nib on top 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.639
 without touching it makes us see directly 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.799
 that appointment then every time 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.900
 we don't have to open 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.940
 the appointment to see what it is but enough 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.610
 lean over to realize 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.280
 what happened then the real 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.110
 an intuitive use that gives value 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.110
 added to this samsung smartphone 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.430
 we remember the latest processor data 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.370
 quadcore from a note 6 gb screen 55 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.560
 inch hd collectivity also holds them 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.650
 some territories and the price still to be 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.650
 to define
