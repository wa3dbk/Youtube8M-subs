00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
basically um not because I just wanted

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.190

dyed<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.670> came<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.329> pretty<00:01:49.079> much

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
dyed it but it came out pretty much

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.889
