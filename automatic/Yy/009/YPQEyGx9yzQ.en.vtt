00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
to like annoyed with it and stupid and

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.710 
to like annoyed with it and stupid and
really<00:03:12.829> possibly<00:03:14.390> but<00:03:15.390> if<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:16.290> does<00:03:17.099> work<00:03:17.370> out

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
really possibly but if it does work out

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.849 
really possibly but if it does work out
you<00:03:18.720> should<00:03:19.019> end<00:03:19.260> up<00:03:19.379> with<00:03:19.439> something<00:03:19.680> really

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
you should end up with something really

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.280 
you should end up with something really
whole<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:21.299> this<00:03:21.540> or<00:03:22.909> something<00:03:23.989> even<00:03:24.989> better

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
whole like this or something even better

whole like this or something even better
like<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:29.599> so<00:03:30.599> that's<00:03:31.409> how<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.739> make<00:03:32.129> a

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
like this so that's how you make a

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.030 
like this so that's how you make a
master<00:03:32.730> desk
