00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.480
 hello and welcome thanks for the 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.100
 tuning is can solve windows and 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.870
 your android channel this time 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.590
 I come to enter what is no longer and in mode 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.529
 11 in its snapshot version m 10 for the 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.480
 Samsung Galaxy S3 9.300 is pure android 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.070
 does not bring here for customization so 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.390
 which will have the terminal little more 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.119
 fluid and more liberated what is the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.410
 ram if you want to install this rum 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.850
 so I recommend you download the 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.529
 files that I'll leave you in the description 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.060
 of the video but not before doing the 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.830
 backup of your pc folder as 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.720
 also on the android backup so 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.329
 let's avoid problems after the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.070
 installation is pure android like 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.170
 I mentioned earlier you 're going to 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.510
 give more performance to the terminal though 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.660
 I always tell them that when you 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.329
 rom that does not have this customization 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.890
 it is a little less flashy but 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.840
 now with the topics that are 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.070
 implementing implementing there is no 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.230
 We give for the truth it does a little more 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.180
 attractive also negative point that the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.670
 I always find what roms are in 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.199
 today in is that what is the duration of 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.930
 the battery we have to change what the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.369
 kernel for a kernel that may not 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.720
 can optimize a little more the 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.550
 performance of what is the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.770
 administration of the battery 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.170
 We can use the meat of our 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.840
 channel is the video of how our 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.250
 tender and also what are the adjustments 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.990
 of the configuration with your application 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 Well, the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.670
 enter into recovery we will pay 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.920
 We are going to pay for our device and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.630
 then we will enter into recovery mode 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 to bring back everything you know that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.370
 the volume up the power key and the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 keys or simultaneously we keep 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.300
 pressed about three seconds so that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.360
 start what is the recovery so be able 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.360
 install a rom in clean 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.610
 once we have entered recovery we go 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.120
 to proceed to make the waves we are going to 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.680
 do 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.680
 guaita bills the king set 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.750
 then we will proceed to do 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.760
 the wild cache partition 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.460
 and to end with omÃ¡n where it says 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.020
 advance and we make the white dalvik h 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.580
 I always recommend you do it, they are 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.410
 which for us to do an installation 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.450
 clean and so have no 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.370
 conflict at the time of running the rom with 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.170
 the applications we are going to enter what 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.060
 is the folder that we have in our 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.800
 micro sd I always have to create a 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.050
 folder in the micro sd to walk 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.040
 looking in all the memory then 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.750
 I'm just going to the folder 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.810
 since we have them first we are going to 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.140
 enter what is the rom 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.330
 in the last one is male the last 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.110
 stable version for samsung galaxy 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.140
 s3 and 9,300 that has launched there is no 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.580
 we have and so we bring them every 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.540
 one of you so that the militias the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.760
 want to try then if you are encouraged 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.709
 in this process it will take a bit of 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.269
 time what has been the 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.349
 installation of the rumba so you 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.480
 I recommend that you have a bit of 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.400
 patience as it also has the battery 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.689
 at least 70% so you do not have 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.689
 no energy short 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.590
 how can we be valleys and whitewashed what 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.180
 which is the rom now we are going to 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.920
 proceed to install what apps are 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.780
 once you have finished what is 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.130
 the installation of the rom and the box 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.010
 we're just going to restart our 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.420
 device like everyone already know to the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.740
 time to install what the first time 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.360
 the round at the time we are starting 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.830
 to run it can take a little 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.860
 we will have to confirm what they are 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.360
 our personal data and well 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.800
 will be running to the rom without any 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.420
 problem well once we have 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.880
 finished what is the configuration of 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.260
 the rom is not the first time because 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.500
 we will have installed what is the year 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.380
 2011 in its version 10 that the last 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.959
 stable version that launched the now the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.519
 let's try it I have the use a 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.050
 day but it 's going very well what they always 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.280
 I recommend that they change what he 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.530
 wants yours to have a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.120
 better performance the matter of triumph 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.190
 a quick look what's been the 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.590
 Rom as everyone already knows how to show what 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.810
 is the launcher launcher is 3 widget 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.220
 it's going and the mont what are the funds 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.350
 screen, they have not incorporated 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.720
 new wallpapers are we are 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.270
 working 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.800
 in the same line of development they want or 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.520
 well they are not implementing any 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.400
 Android function still until already 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.109
 be completely stable in the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.660
 versions that are launching google 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.240
 because so far google has facilitated 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.620
 two android updates l but 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.260
 they are not working yet or they are not 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.030
 going with her 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.440
 ok let's go to what is the bar 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.880
 status if we enter the status bar 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.320
 we can find that they are the same 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.450
 quick settings that we always find 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.850
 in what rice in the android area 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.270
 pure as you can see in a while is 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.880
 functional sounds very good let's go 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.410
 to what are the settings what you like 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.030
 of customization that we all already know 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.300
 is based on the latest version of 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.120
 android android 4.4 point 4 for this 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.889
 device for samsung galaxy 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.840
 79,300 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.300
 Most people ask that 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.669
 why install android the pure android 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.680
 and what is android with layer of 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.779
 personalization is that they will notice a 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.580
 great change in what has been this 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.569
 these android versions that bring us 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.210
 here for customization as the 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.430
 device moves faster what 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.560
 is what performance will have a 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.779
 optimal performance in field in 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.800
 comparison with the other versions of 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.620
 Android that they see and with layer of 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.090
 personation since it does a little more 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.759
 heavy what is ram memory and so 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.849
 Well, it does not work as fast as you are 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.709
 pure android versions 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.899
 we can find the camera good 

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:32.429
 works very well already in these versions 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.110
 from android, I do not have much 

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:36.419
 add now to all the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.270
 world must have proven whether they are 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.069
 today we have not brought any news 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.139
 they are only improving what the 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.029
 device performance hopefully 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.189
 that the next snapshot comes already with 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:50.969
 including some functions of android 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:53.339
 some some things whatever it is 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.839
 the energy saving that the truth is 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.639
 working very well I have it in my 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.979
 nexus and that savings works very well 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.139
 energy and then hopefully in the 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.119
 next nights as they include some 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.059
 Android functions the axis for our 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:07.439
 device well in what if you have 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.669
 questions all suggestions you can 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.110
 do in our comments of the video 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.029
 As you can also go to the 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.279
 chat session of our application you can 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:15.479
 visit us in solution encuentro.es 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.879
 you will find everything that is 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.379
 relevant information of the world andrÃ©s

 thank you for your time, thanks for your 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.689
 tuning resolution in windows and up 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.689
 the next
