00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.800
 tries to pass on this same event is 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.360
 one is an idea of ​​one of a medicine 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.590
 a little different we do not want 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.630
 sitting on that biological model 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.390
 where the doctor is the one who shakes his head 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.520
 so the doctor knows he's going there and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.009
 gioli does simply thinks 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.259
 that is a clinical reasoning and people 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.860
 WOW, and so on. 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.840
 in addition to this idea that 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.670
 people have to show a doctor who 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.470
 that he knows art a doctor that he 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.190
 is concerned about health 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.899
 public 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.270
 The doctor who is concerned about 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.780
 everything is society our goal is 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.640

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.550
 she is human 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.900

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.220
 that I had I had spoken now 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.100
 adversary that goes beyond this context 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.810
 theology and then I spoke about our crisis 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.090
 to spend here at unicamp was football that 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.540

 shows the positive sides and also 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.550
 negative shows that production times 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.620
 It's not quite what we think it shows. 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.910

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.060
 way that will follow everything that goes 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.060
 face 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.530
 seriously what the balance of this event with 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.969
 importance for workshop students 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.819
 students who attended the event 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.340
 how the event allows them to know 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.610
 more closely that is the medical course 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.430
 so not only lectures with doctors 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.650
 who have careers in outstanding 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.560
 to live with some of the specialties 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.810
 is that the medical course then offers 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.500
 they choose to participate in the 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.409
 afternoon of several leagues then a schoolboy 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.860
 diabetes and there is a more 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.379
 practice of what is the course of these areas 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.569
 serious specialization this kind of 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:20.789
 event as the medicine workshop he is 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.520
 fundamentally at the hour one 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.610
 young people's doubts is important because 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.659
 many people have a romantic view of the 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.000
 courses if there were others of 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:36.060
 area of ​​engineering administration with 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.680
 doubts and questions in the 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.919
 time to choose the profession would be 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.919
 minors 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.800
 two students are part of the gecap is a 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.449
 specific class of vinicius medicine 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.490
 How much for people like me? 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.830
 does the checkup work and why did you 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.789
 for not staying is my peak first year of 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.129
 and check it out because they are more 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.529
 classes is from tomorrow to the people 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.419
 resolves basic exercise and from the 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.550
 later a deepening of their 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.999
 teachers and gave think it will come down 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:23.279
 to say right in your opinion is what 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.029
 I call Checape the difference of course in 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.919
 brother 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.870
 I think the extended workload and 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.879
 it only helps a lot we have classes 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.300
 as well as the other classes in the 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:34.860
 part of the morning and the afternoon having 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.899
 deepening and endless lists of 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.599
 exercises and simulated more and this 

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:41.879
 help enough then checape for sure 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:45.110
 will facilitate at the time of the entrance exam 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:45.110
 Surely it makes it much easier.
