hi everyone Stacie with tiny smidgen the
end<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.460> day<00:01:40.610> who's<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.030> long<00:01:41.360> day<00:01:41.960> um<00:01:42.640> so

end of the day who's a long day um so

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.980 
end of the day who's a long day um so
it's<00:01:43.940> really<00:01:44.210> hard<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.480> get<00:01:44.570> all<00:01:44.720> this<00:01:44.840> on

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's really hard to get all this on

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.560 
it's really hard to get all this on
camera<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.560> can<00:01:45.650> see<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.460> essentials<00:01:47.060> of

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
camera so you can see the essentials of

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.300 
camera so you can see the essentials of
what<00:01:47.750> I've<00:01:47.870> got<00:01:47.900> going<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.410> but<00:01:49.010> I<00:01:49.070> think<00:01:49.100> the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
what I've got going on but I think the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.250 
what I've got going on but I think the
outside<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:49.850> easier<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.240> see<00:01:50.540> if<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.930> pan<00:01:51.229> around

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
outside is easier to see if I pan around

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.830 
outside is easier to see if I pan around
the<00:01:51.650> outside<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:52.430> what<00:01:53.090> we're<00:01:53.210> looking<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.600> is

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
the outside so what we're looking at is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.600 
the outside so what we're looking at is
the<00:01:54.050> kitchen<00:01:54.320> window<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.280> there's<00:01:55.460> the

the loft I know that doesn't make sense

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.000 
the loft I know that doesn't make sense
or<00:02:50.510> maybe<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.810> does<00:02:50.959> but<00:02:51.260> we<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:51.560> 10-foot
