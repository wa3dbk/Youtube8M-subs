living tree now chicken of the woods are

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.889 
living tree now chicken of the woods are
highly<00:00:52.010> prized<00:00:52.309> wild<00:00:52.999> edible<00:00:53.510> with<00:00:53.780> the

flavor and texture similar to chicken
hence<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.260> name<00:00:57.440> let's<00:00:58.249> take<00:00:58.429> a<00:00:58.459> closer<00:00:58.729> look

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
hence the name let's take a closer look

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.469 
hence the name let's take a closer look
at<00:00:59.149> these

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
at these

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.449 
at these
so<00:01:00.139> obviously<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.829> most<00:01:01.069> striking

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:01.459 
so obviously the most striking

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:03.069 
so obviously the most striking
characteristic<00:01:02.389> of<00:01:02.539> chicken<00:01:02.780> of<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.899> woods

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.360 
of the woods are a polypore mushroom
which<00:01:23.330> means<00:01:23.570> they<00:01:24.110> have<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.350> poor<00:01:25.100> surface

which means they have a poor surface

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.610 
which means they have a poor surface
