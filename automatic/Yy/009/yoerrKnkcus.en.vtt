00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.700
 place friends it's mr address and 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.940
 today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.810
 how to make a code door 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.650
 very very very very very compact then 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.400
 this is very effective 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.490
 so I press the button that does not 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.859
 does not work then balki we get him 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.949
 will place red stone 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.230
 but the door will not open then the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.430
 only way to open the door 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 it's to operate the levers 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.070
 so that's the code I press the 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.670
 button the door or so that's all 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.520
 remaining a compact maximum 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.310
 here I hand lever too much that does not 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.130
 does not work I get it wrong 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.450
 does not work there I have already planned 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.720
 the work area here and it will be 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.840
 the good code so like there up except that 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.189
 there is no redstone 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.590
 so first of all for the antilles who 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.320
 this time I place a torch of ralston 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.450
 the door opens then the trick is 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.359
 to put the door like that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.330
 so as soon as we put a torch of 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:25.580
 redstone the door do it 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:28.010
 so so for example we want to actuated 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.520
 finally we want that if we operate the 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.400
 three levers the door or so he 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.180
 will have to place three redstone keys 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.390
 like that if I activate 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.740
 finally if I disable this lever the red 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.700
 stone room and for those we do not want 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.740
 that finally where we do not want to activate the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.930
 levers for that skin back and bah 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.990
 we put nothing but no right key 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.290
 can we now go to the eggs 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.890
 or gold buttons the button it will take a 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.600
 redstone torch and we read all this 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.640
 like that so there is the good code here 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.890
 I press the button is everything 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.450
 goes out for example I do not have the right 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.130
 code 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.160
 I press the button it stays on 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 so now we're going down 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.360
 that's it and under the door 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.810
 we will put a torch of redstone 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:40.010
 that we will join like this to an inverter 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.130
 and the inverter is going to ally them to his 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.100
 buttons finally at these levers here and has it 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.330
 so if I press the door under if I 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.790
 do the wrong code 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.250
 the door remains closed this rare 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.360
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.770
 thank you for watching the video 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.930
 do not forget the little comment and the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.550
 little I like I tell you next time 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.760
 and wear well go to more than 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.760
 world
