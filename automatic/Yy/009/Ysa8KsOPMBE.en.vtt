very very important so I wanted to give
you<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> little<00:00:32.850> bit<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.090> background<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.780> why<00:00:34.079> it

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
you a little bit of background on why it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.979 
you a little bit of background on why it
happens<00:00:34.700> now<00:00:35.700> there<00:00:35.910> are<00:00:36.000> many<00:00:36.239> many<00:00:36.510> types<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
happens now there are many many types of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.510 
happens now there are many many types of
back<00:00:37.140> pain<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.559> there's<00:00:37.739> no<00:00:37.980> way<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.460> can

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
back pain and there's no way that I can

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
back pain and there's no way that I can
diagnose<00:00:39.120> anything<00:00:39.629> through<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
diagnose anything through it with you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.970 
diagnose anything through it with you
obviously<00:00:40.760> however<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.899> type<00:00:43.620> that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
obviously however there is one type that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.529 
obviously however there is one type that
seems<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.460> slip<00:00:44.670> through<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> gaps<00:00:45.300> because

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
seems to slip through the gaps because

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.290 
seems to slip through the gaps because
it's<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.140> really<00:00:46.590> definable<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.969> lot<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it's not really definable in a lot of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.709 
it's not really definable in a lot of
medical<00:00:48.660> terms<00:00:48.989> often<00:00:49.920> people<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.280> had

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
medical terms often people have had

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
medical terms often people have had
investigations<00:00:51.719> they've<00:00:52.050> had<00:00:52.289> MRIs<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:52.920> CT

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
investigations they've had MRIs and CT

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
investigations they've had MRIs and CT
scans<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.570> don't<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> disc<00:00:55.440> bulge<00:00:55.680> they

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
scans they don't have a disc bulge they

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.410 
scans they don't have a disc bulge they
don't<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.460> any<00:00:56.610> problems<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> bones

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
don't have any problems with the bones

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
don't have any problems with the bones
but<00:00:58.020> they're<00:00:58.230> still<00:00:58.469> giving<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.190> pain

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
but they're still giving a lot of pain

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.389 
but they're still giving a lot of pain
now<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.629> often<00:01:01.050> due<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.680> muscles<00:01:02.219> in

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
now this is often due to the muscles in

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
now this is often due to the muscles in
the<00:01:02.460> low<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.149> deep<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> abdomen<00:01:04.260> not

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the low back and deep in the abdomen not

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.250 
the low back and deep in the abdomen not
actually<00:01:05.159> functioning<00:01:05.700> correctly<00:01:06.260> often

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
actually functioning correctly often

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.600 
actually functioning correctly often
people<00:01:07.380> will<00:01:07.650> try<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> lot<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> different

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
people will try a lot of different

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
people will try a lot of different
exercises<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.360> build<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.960> quite<00:01:10.200> an

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
exercises and build up quite an

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
exercises and build up quite an
intensive<00:01:10.860> core<00:01:11.100> stability<00:01:11.280> program<00:01:12.000> but

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
intensive core stability program but

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.300 
intensive core stability program but
they'll<00:01:12.570> still<00:01:12.930> experience<00:01:13.470> pain<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> low

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
they'll still experience pain in the low

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
they'll still experience pain in the low
back<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.350> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
back now this is because there are a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
back now this is because there are a
couple<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.710> different<00:01:17.130> types<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.610> muscles<00:01:17.970> in

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
couple of different types of muscles in

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.280 
couple of different types of muscles in
the<00:01:18.150> low<00:01:18.299> back<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.750> they<00:01:18.869> must<00:01:19.020> each<00:01:19.259> be

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the low back and they must each be

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
the low back and they must each be
trained<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.250> very<00:01:20.460> specifically<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.720> I'll

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
trained very very specifically so I'll

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.649 
trained very very specifically so I'll
give<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.320> rundown<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> anatomy

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
give you a little rundown on the anatomy

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.539 
give you a little rundown on the anatomy
now<00:01:24.659> obviously<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> spine<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
now obviously in the spine we have the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.490 
now obviously in the spine we have the
bones<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> ligaments<00:01:28.439> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
bones then we have the ligaments that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
bones then we have the ligaments that
actually<00:01:28.920> help<00:01:29.159> attach<00:01:29.460> those<00:01:29.610> bones

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
actually help attach those bones

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.330 
actually help attach those bones
together<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.470> people<00:01:31.650> say<00:01:31.829> ligaments

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
together now some people say ligaments

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.819 
together now some people say ligaments
are<00:01:32.520> quite<00:01:32.820> stiff<00:01:33.180> other<00:01:33.810> people<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.530> quite

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
are quite stiff other people have quite

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.069 
are quite stiff other people have quite
mobile<00:01:35.100> ligaments<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.060> may<00:01:36.240> even<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.570> hyper

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
mobile ligaments and may even be hyper

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
mobile ligaments and may even be hyper
mobile<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:38.189> allows<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:39.090> more<00:01:39.119> joint

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
mobile which allows a lot more joint

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.870 
mobile which allows a lot more joint
movement<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.460> often<00:01:41.670> see

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
movement and this is what we often see

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
movement and this is what we often see
in<00:01:42.390> people<00:01:42.840> who<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.200> back<00:01:43.439> pain<00:01:43.710> that's<00:01:43.920> very

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
in people who have back pain that's very

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.300 
in people who have back pain that's very
resistant<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.850> normal<00:01:45.270> treatment<00:01:46.189> when<00:01:47.189> we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
resistant to normal treatment when we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.649 
resistant to normal treatment when we
look<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> little<00:01:47.700> further<00:01:48.000> into<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> anatomy

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
look a little further into the anatomy

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.020 
look a little further into the anatomy
we<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.619> are<00:01:49.740> two<00:01:50.009> distinct<00:01:50.850> types

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
we see that there are two distinct types

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
we see that there are two distinct types
of<00:01:51.299> muscles<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.750> help<00:01:51.990> support<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.619> low

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
of muscles that help support the low

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.580 
of muscles that help support the low
back<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.119> all<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> deep<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.320> low

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
back we have all of the deep little low

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.160 
back we have all of the deep little low
low<00:01:55.829> back<00:01:56.070> muscles<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.700> motiveless<00:01:57.479> Rhoda

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
low back muscles that motiveless Rhoda

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440

Tori's<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> into<00:01:59.100> transverse<00:01:59.490> sorry<00:01:59.759> which

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
Tori's and into transverse sorry which

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
Tori's and into transverse sorry which
we<00:02:00.780> call<00:02:01.049> signal<00:02:01.380> until<00:02:01.799> stable

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
we call signal until stable

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.929 
we call signal until stable
so<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.659> crossed<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.950> or<00:02:05.070> two<00:02:05.490> joints

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so they just crossed one or two joints

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.120 
so they just crossed one or two joints
to<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.659> stabilize<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:07.770> very<00:02:07.920> low

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
to really stabilize at a very very low

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.729 
to really stabilize at a very very low
level<00:02:08.450> these<00:02:09.450> muscles<00:02:09.899> are<00:02:10.020> naturally

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
level these muscles are naturally

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.490 
level these muscles are naturally
designed<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.670> at<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> low<00:02:12.420> intensity<00:02:13.020> but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
designed to be on at a low intensity but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.770 
designed to be on at a low intensity but
for<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> long<00:02:14.130> period<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.670> time<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.630> they're

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
for a long period of time so they're

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.839 
for a long period of time so they're
actually<00:02:15.900> designed<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.190> dynamic

unfortunately<00:02:23.940> these<00:02:24.150> muscles<00:02:24.750> often<00:02:25.200> get

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
unfortunately these muscles often get

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.770 
unfortunately these muscles often get
inhibited<00:02:25.950> if<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.760> had<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> pregnancy<00:02:27.390> if

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
inhibited if you have had a pregnancy if

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.839 
inhibited if you have had a pregnancy if
you've<00:02:28.050> had<00:02:28.260> back<00:02:28.470> pain<00:02:28.739> or<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.519> you've<00:02:29.670> had

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
you've had back pain or if you've had

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.390 
you've had back pain or if you've had
abdominal<00:02:30.390> surgery<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.080> often<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> clients

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
abdominal surgery and often the clients

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.479 
abdominal surgery and often the clients
we<00:02:32.519> give<00:02:32.700> him<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.330> had<00:02:33.510> all<00:02:33.720> three<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.140> those

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
we give him have had all three of those

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.640 
we give him have had all three of those
then<00:02:35.489> I'm<00:02:35.850> allowing<00:02:36.299> those<00:02:36.630> muscles<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.410> have

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
then I'm allowing those muscles we have

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.520 
then I'm allowing those muscles we have
some<00:02:37.890> big<00:02:38.190> back<00:02:38.519> muscles<00:02:39.120> now<00:02:39.690> these<00:02:39.930> big<00:02:40.319> back

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
some big back muscles now these big back

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.890 
some big back muscles now these big back
muscles<00:02:40.980> are<00:02:41.250> designed<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.060> work<00:02:42.180> powerfully

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
muscles are designed to work powerfully

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.530 
muscles are designed to work powerfully
but<00:02:43.170> for<00:02:43.410> short<00:02:43.680> periods<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.310> time<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:45.360> have

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
but for short periods of time they have

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.780 
but for short periods of time they have
a<00:02:45.569> big<00:02:45.870> muscle<00:02:46.290> bolt<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.920> attaches<00:02:47.370> into

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
a big muscle bolt that attaches into

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.809 
a big muscle bolt that attaches into
multiple<00:02:48.450> joints<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.650> often<00:02:49.860> happens<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.640> if

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
multiple joints what often happens is if

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.699 
multiple joints what often happens is if
the<00:02:50.849> underneath<00:02:51.510> layer<00:02:51.780> has<00:02:52.200> not<00:02:52.470> been

the underneath layer has not been

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.039 
the underneath layer has not been
working<00:02:53.160> due<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.060> being<00:02:54.090> inhibited<00:02:54.540> by

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
working due to it being inhibited by

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.170 
working due to it being inhibited by
those<00:02:55.260> things<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.650> mentioned<00:02:56.040> before<00:02:56.130> then<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
those things I mentioned before then the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.900 
those things I mentioned before then the
big<00:02:57.390> outside<00:02:57.959> back<00:02:58.349> muscles<00:02:58.799> tension<00:02:59.400> rip<00:02:59.700> on

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
big outside back muscles tension rip on

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.690 
big outside back muscles tension rip on
and<00:03:00.239> try<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.690> compensate<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:02.190> works<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
and try and compensate this works for a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.339 
and try and compensate this works for a
short<00:03:02.940> period<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.299> time<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:03.870> it's<00:03:04.019> kind<00:03:04.290> of

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
short period of time but it's kind of

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.020 
short period of time but it's kind of
like<00:03:04.530> somebody<00:03:04.860> trying<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.400> work<00:03:05.519> day<00:03:05.760> shift

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
like somebody trying to work day shift

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.539 
like somebody trying to work day shift
and<00:03:06.239> night<00:03:06.480> shift<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.140> doesn't<00:03:07.769> work<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.519> a

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
and night shift it doesn't work for a

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.479 
and night shift it doesn't work for a
long<00:03:08.790> period<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.269> time<00:03:09.560> these<00:03:10.560> muscles<00:03:11.040> will

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
long period of time these muscles will

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.699 
long period of time these muscles will
attempt<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> stabilize<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:13.170> then<00:03:13.380> they<00:03:13.530> will

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
attempt to stabilize but then they will

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.039 
attempt to stabilize but then they will
be<00:03:13.799> very<00:03:14.040> tired<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.700> fatigued<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.329> often

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
be very tired and fatigued and often

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.740 
be very tired and fatigued and often
you'll<00:03:16.200> start<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.859> slump<00:03:17.220> or<00:03:17.549> get<00:03:18.030> very<00:03:18.299> sore

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
you'll start to slump or get very sore

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.229 
you'll start to slump or get very sore
and<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.170> outer<00:03:19.380> bit<00:03:19.739> muscles<00:03:20.190> or<00:03:20.489> feel<00:03:21.030> like

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
and the outer bit muscles or feel like

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.059 
and the outer bit muscles or feel like
you<00:03:21.359> want<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.569> massage<00:03:21.870> all<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.470> time<00:03:22.680> once

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
you want to massage all the time once

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.340 
you want to massage all the time once
you<00:03:23.190> use<00:03:23.370> heat<00:03:23.700> this<00:03:24.359> is<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.600> good<00:03:24.840> sign

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
you use heat this is a good sign

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.440 
you use heat this is a good sign
that<00:03:25.590> these<00:03:25.769> big<00:03:25.980> outside<00:03:26.430> bit<00:03:26.670> muscles<00:03:27.060> have

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
that these big outside bit muscles have

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.050 
that these big outside bit muscles have
been<00:03:27.480> overworking<00:03:28.280> now<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.340> secret<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.910> this

been overworking now the secret to this

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.960 
been overworking now the secret to this
is<00:03:30.329> actually<00:03:30.840> being<00:03:31.019> able<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.410> effectively

stabilize all of these deep little
internal<00:03:35.100> back<00:03:35.310> muscles<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.720> help

this<00:03:46.319> sounds<00:03:47.190> pretty<00:03:47.310> simple<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.329> rather

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
this sounds pretty simple it is a rather

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.199 
this sounds pretty simple it is a rather
tricky<00:03:49.380> process<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:50.250> get<00:03:50.579> all<00:03:50.819> of<00:03:51.060> these

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
tricky process to get all of these

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.780 
tricky process to get all of these
muscles<00:03:51.480> going<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.260> everyone<00:03:52.650> because<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.639> a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
muscles going in everyone because it's a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.449 
muscles going in everyone because it's a
very<00:03:54.090> very<00:03:54.359> fine<00:03:54.660> area<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.220> something

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
very very fine area and it's something

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.789 
very very fine area and it's something
that<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:57.450> can't<00:03:57.750> just<00:03:58.170> prescribe<00:03:58.440> one

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
that you can't just prescribe one

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
how to switch these on them and what

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.790 
how to switch these on them and what
