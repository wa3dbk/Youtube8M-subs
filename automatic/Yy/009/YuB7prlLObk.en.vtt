only the keyboard so well that's what I

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.450 
only the keyboard so well that's what I
did<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> pros<00:00:34.050> it's<00:00:34.530> very<00:00:35.010> thin

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
did to get to the pros it's very thin

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
did to get to the pros it's very thin
it's<00:00:35.789> very<00:00:36.230> compact<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.890> light<00:00:38.480> which

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's very compact and very light which

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.619 
it's very compact and very light which
makes<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.929> very<00:00:40.109> comfortable<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.940> carry<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.239> -

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
makes it very comfortable to carry it -

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.939 
makes it very comfortable to carry it -
where<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.319> you<00:00:43.409> going

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
where are you going

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.229 
where are you going
another<00:00:44.429> plus<00:00:44.999> is<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.289> pretty<00:00:46.739> quiet

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
another plus is that it's pretty quiet

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.849 
another plus is that it's pretty quiet
at<00:00:48.239> least<00:00:48.420> if<00:00:48.659> you<00:00:48.780> compare<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.499> usual

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
at least if you compare it to a usual

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.340 
at least if you compare it to a usual
keyboard<00:00:50.609> it's<00:00:51.359> not<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.899> hundred<00:00:52.170> percent

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
keyboard it's not a hundred percent

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.180 
keyboard it's not a hundred percent
silent<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.729> sounds<00:00:54.059> more<00:00:54.269> like<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.569> usual

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
silent but it sounds more like a usual

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.629 
silent but it sounds more like a usual
notebook<00:00:56.190> keyboard<00:01:00.679> so<00:01:01.679> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.309> sounds

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639 
notebook keyboard so I think that sounds

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:05.539 
notebook keyboard so I think that sounds
pretty<00:01:02.819> good<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.479> test<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.680> range<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.339> could

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
pretty good to test the range I could

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
pretty good to test the range I could
only<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.659> far<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:08.400> four<00:01:09.180> meters<00:01:09.680> away

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
only go as far as about four meters away

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.120 
only go as far as about four meters away
from<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.490> receiver<00:01:12.480> because<00:01:13.050> my<00:01:13.470> room<00:01:13.770> isn't

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
from the receiver because my room isn't

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.080 
from the receiver because my room isn't
that<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.730> I<00:01:15.860> tried<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.040> from<00:01:17.310> outside<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that big and I tried it from outside the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.180 
that big and I tried it from outside the
door<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> worked<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.440> can<00:01:19.620> say<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.950> same

about the mouse another thing that

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
about the mouse another thing that
worked<00:01:22.800> perfectly<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:24.090> plug-and-play

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
whatever works pretty fun what I like is

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.250 
whatever works pretty fun what I like is
that<00:01:55.260> you've<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> numerical<00:01:56.930> pet<00:01:57.930> with

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
that you've got the numerical pet with

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.530 
that you've got the numerical pet with
it<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:58.980> you<00:01:59.190> can<00:01:59.370> turn<00:01:59.550> it<00:01:59.730> on<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.880> off<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.420> you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it you you can turn it on and off if you

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.230 
it you you can turn it on and off if you
turn<00:02:00.720> it<00:02:00.810> off<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.620> got<00:02:01.920> some<00:02:02.220> extra<00:02:02.550> functions

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
turn it off you got some extra functions

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420 
turn it off you got some extra functions
on<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.230> also<00:02:04.409> has<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.800> couple<00:02:05.159> of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
on it but it also has a couple of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.570 
on it but it also has a couple of
disadvantages<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.110> biggest<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.009> guess<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
disadvantages the biggest one I guess is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.609 
disadvantages the biggest one I guess is
that<00:02:08.909> it's<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
that it's you

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.649 
that it's you
easily<00:02:09.860> sliding<00:02:10.340> around<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:11.000> your<00:02:11.150> desktop

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
easily sliding around on your desktop

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.460 
easily sliding around on your desktop
which<00:02:12.409> is<00:02:12.650> due<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.580> lack<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.849> rubber<00:02:14.720> feet

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
which is due to the lack of rubber feet

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.770 
which is due to the lack of rubber feet
and<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:16.310> upper<00:02:16.640> side<00:02:16.849> down<00:02:17.360> here<00:02:17.629> it's

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
and the upper side down here it's

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.990 
and the upper side down here it's
alright<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:18.379> here<00:02:18.620> it's<00:02:18.769> just<00:02:19.159> hard<00:02:19.489> plastic

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
alright but here it's just hard plastic

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.180 
alright but here it's just hard plastic
so<00:02:20.480> if<00:02:20.599> you<00:02:20.720> mind<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.349> have<00:02:21.379> to<00:02:21.530> glue

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
so if you mind that you have to glue

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.809 
so if you mind that you have to glue
some<00:02:22.549> rubber<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.170> black<00:02:24.440> area<00:02:25.129> up<00:02:25.489> here

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
some rubber on to the black area up here

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.880 
some rubber on to the black area up here
that's<00:02:26.480> what<00:02:26.659> I<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.989> do<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.349> another

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that's what I will do and another

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.729 
that's what I will do and another
disadvantage<00:02:28.510> which<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.720> see<00:02:29.930> right<00:02:30.230> now<00:02:30.409> is

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
disadvantage which you see right now is

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.839 
disadvantage which you see right now is
that<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:32.680> metal<00:02:33.680> down<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.190> looks<00:02:34.549> pretty

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
that the metal down here looks pretty

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.649 
that the metal down here looks pretty
nice<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.420> after<00:02:35.840> five<00:02:36.170> minutes<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:36.769> already

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
nice but after five minutes it's already

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.210 
nice but after five minutes it's already
totally<00:02:38.659> full<00:02:39.349> of<00:02:39.970> fingerprints<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:42.290> as<00:02:42.590> long

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
totally full of fingerprints but as long

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.009 
totally full of fingerprints but as long
as<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.549> faces<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:44.030> home<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.390> don't<00:02:44.540> care<00:02:44.900> about

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
as it faces the home I don't care about

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.259 
as it faces the home I don't care about
it<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:45.769> there's<00:02:46.010> another<00:02:46.160> disadvantage<00:02:46.760> I

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
it then there's another disadvantage I

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.780 
it then there's another disadvantage I
heard<00:02:47.569> about<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.260> internet<00:02:48.709> with<00:02:49.129> someone

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
heard about in the internet with someone

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.470 
heard about in the internet with someone
stating<00:02:50.329> that<00:02:50.720> his<00:02:51.290> keyboard<00:02:52.040> would<00:02:52.489> hit<00:02:52.910> the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
stating that his keyboard would hit the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.770 
stating that his keyboard would hit the
desktop<00:02:54.079> if<00:02:54.409> you<00:02:54.470> hit<00:02:54.859> the<00:02:55.099> middle<00:02:55.760> keys<00:02:56.150> with

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
desktop if you hit the middle keys with

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.990 
desktop if you hit the middle keys with
mine<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.379> only<00:02:57.620> happens<00:02:58.190> if<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.459> press<00:02:58.730> really

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
mine it only happens if you press really

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000 
mine it only happens if you press really
hard<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.970> as<00:03:02.329> long<00:03:02.750> as<00:03:02.780> it's<00:03:03.049> new<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.769> don't

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
hard but as long as it's new I don't

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.009 
hard but as long as it's new I don't
think<00:03:04.370> there's<00:03:04.549> a<00:03:04.609> problem<00:03:04.819> but<00:03:05.569> I<00:03:05.599> can

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
think there's a problem but I can

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.710 
think there's a problem but I can
imagine<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.890> once<00:03:07.670> you've<00:03:07.909> used<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.510> for<00:03:08.690> a

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
imagine that once you've used it for a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.949 
imagine that once you've used it for a
while<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.409> gets<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.769> bit<00:03:10.569> rounder<00:03:11.569> that

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
while and it gets a bit rounder that

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.080 
while and it gets a bit rounder that
this<00:03:12.260> problem<00:03:12.680> occurs<00:03:12.799> but<00:03:13.340> because<00:03:13.910> I'm

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
this problem occurs but because I'm

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.210 
this problem occurs but because I'm
already<00:03:14.329> gluing<00:03:15.079> some<00:03:15.349> rubber<00:03:15.620> down<00:03:15.889> here<00:03:16.190> I

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
already gluing some rubber down here I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.460 
already gluing some rubber down here I
will<00:03:16.459> just<00:03:16.700> put<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> little<00:03:17.060> patch<00:03:17.720> into<00:03:18.349> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
will just put a little patch into the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.490 
will just put a little patch into the
front<00:03:18.769> here<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.519> problem<00:03:20.090> solved<00:03:20.599> well<00:03:20.959> if

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
front here and a problem solved well if

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.710 
front here and a problem solved well if
you<00:03:21.709> buy<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:21.919> set<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.459> get<00:03:22.609> this<00:03:22.819> mouse<00:03:23.209> with

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
you buy the set you get this mouse with

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.830 
you buy the set you get this mouse with
it<00:03:23.930> which<00:03:24.560> works<00:03:25.190> I<00:03:25.549> didn't<00:03:26.510> have<00:03:26.690> any

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
it which works I didn't have any

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.650 
it which works I didn't have any
problems<00:03:27.319> with<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:27.889> far<00:03:28.160> it's<00:03:28.489> super<00:03:29.419> tiny

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
problems with it so far it's super tiny

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.099 
problems with it so far it's super tiny
so<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:31.010> not<00:03:31.459> very<00:03:31.790> comfortable<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.569> place

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
so it's not very comfortable to place

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.220 
so it's not very comfortable to place
your<00:03:33.410> hand<00:03:34.040> on<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:34.760> well<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.450> will<00:03:35.900> use<00:03:36.079> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
your hand on it but well I will use it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.309 
your hand on it but well I will use it
as<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.440> very<00:03:36.889> mobile<00:03:37.250> device<00:03:37.819> I<00:03:38.209> will<00:03:38.389> just<00:03:38.870> take

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
as a very mobile device I will just take

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.439 
as a very mobile device I will just take
it<00:03:39.560> with<00:03:39.769> me<00:03:39.949> when<00:03:40.340> once<00:03:40.639> I<00:03:40.819> leave<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.269> house

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
it with me when once I leave the house

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:46.500 
it with me when once I leave the house
and<00:03:41.980> when<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.010> do<00:03:43.129> that<00:03:43.250> oh<00:03:44.199> it's<00:03:45.199> just<00:03:45.500> fine

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
and when I do that oh it's just fine

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.629 
and when I do that oh it's just fine
other<00:03:47.510> than<00:03:47.629> that<00:03:47.690> at<00:03:48.079> home<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.620> will<00:03:49.250> probably

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
other than that at home I will probably

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.849 
other than that at home I will probably
not<00:03:50.180> use<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.780> well<00:03:51.379> in<00:03:51.889> all<00:03:52.280> I'm<00:03:52.970> very<00:03:53.859> happy

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
not use it well in all I'm very happy

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.879 
not use it well in all I'm very happy
about<00:03:54.949> the<00:03:55.340> keyboard<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:56.510> only<00:03:56.840> thing<00:03:57.349> is

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
about the keyboard the only thing is

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.729 
about the keyboard the only thing is
that<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.419> put<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.900> little<00:04:00.470> bit<00:04:00.590> of

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
that you have to put a little bit of

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.890 
that you have to put a little bit of
work<00:04:01.010> into<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.730> then<00:04:02.359> it<00:04:02.510> should<00:04:02.660> work

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
work into it and then it should work

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.500 
work into it and then it should work
alright<00:04:03.349> so<00:04:03.889> that's<00:04:04.099> it<00:04:04.280> remember<00:04:05.000> to
