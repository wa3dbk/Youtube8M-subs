00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello in this tutorial I teach you to 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.980
 place two different types of 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.349
 numbering in a single document of 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.900
 microsoft word on many occasions we 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.119
 they ask that our index introduction and 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.070
 objectives go with Roman numbers and the 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.890
 rest of the document 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.830
 go with normal numbering to achieve 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.259
 this we must go to the page where 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.179
 will be the transition between the numbering 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.669
 Roman or the numbering that you put in your 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.949
 document and the normal numbering in this 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.500
 here the objectives end and in the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.200
 next page I have the development of 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.330
 all my work therefore I'm going to put 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.310
 the cursor on the objectives page 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.579
 then I'll go to the design option of 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:48.850
 page option jumps and next pages 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.280
 now I go back to the start option and in the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.620
 button show everything that is in 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.230
 the set of paragraph options will 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.870
 I click 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.630
 when clicking we will see a set of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.850
 symbols like this and we must make sure 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.010
 that the section break is to say a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.460
 set of similar texts and symbols 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.869
 to this they are placed 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.509
 exactly on the last page where 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.550
 we want Roman numeration 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.740
 for example the last page where I 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.050
 I will place Roman numerals is in the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.330
 objectives then on the next page I 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.550
 I have the programming of resources and 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.700
 costs which is the development of everything 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.950
 my work now well if you look under 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.229
 with this set of symbols I get under my 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.479
 main title therefore I'm going to 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.060
 eliminate those symbols and already leaves them in 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.340
 the place where I had it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 after this we have divided 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.659
 our document in two sections the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.850
 first with we will have Roman numerals and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.979
 the second where we will have numbering 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.659
 normal in case there is any section 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 Where it is not, it has a number of 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.450
 page you should only apply another 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.460
 section break and now we're going to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.799
 remove all these symbols by clicking 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.740
 on the same button show everything and already 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.770
 our document is so normal then 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.390
 we proceed to insert the numbers of 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.660
 pages for that we're going to the option 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.390
 insert page number you choose the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 the page format you want in this 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.420
 case I'm going to choose a normal one if you 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.370
 fixed in everything I want number 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 Roman I have a normal numbering for 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.150
 so I'm not going to go to options 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.819
 page number design 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.900
 then format page number and I'll choose 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.709
 the format 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.709
 Roman 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.490
 now if you look at the part where it would be 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.700
 the index the introduction and the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.650
 targets already have normal numbering 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.170
 but where the development of the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.120
 document of a file we have a 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.030
 number four and from what starts 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.400
 with number one therefore I will go to 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.090
 the design option and here where it says 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 navigation I'm going to remove this option that 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.140
 says to link to the previous one with this already 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.300
 our two sections are 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.220
 completely divided and unlinked 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.170
 Therefore, any change you make here 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.780
 it will not affect the Roman numeration that 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.060
 I had here now I'm going to select the 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.040
 number 4 I'm going to the page number of 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.269
 new format page number and that of 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.580
 start at 1 and then we accept and 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.380
 Now we have Roman numerals in 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.760
 the first pages and numbering 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.410
 traditional that throughout the development 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.380
 of the document 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.050
 The last step is to generate an index for 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.420
 that we must place title format in 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.330
 all those issues that we want to be 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.430
 show in the index if you want a 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.140
 more detailed description of this in the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.730
 description is a link that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.950
 I had now a video that speaks 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.440
 specifically about this 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.690
 once we have placed all the titles 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.900
 desired we proceed to generate 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.849
 automatically our index we 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.030
 we go to the page where we want 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.060
 place it then the references option 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.870
 table of contents and last table 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.870
 automatic 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.489
 if you look at microsoft guard I think my 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.099
 document and in introduction and objectives 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.770
 in Roman numerals and in the rest of the 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.290
 normal numbering document 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.070
 and is now expected tutorial you have 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.070
 been very useful
