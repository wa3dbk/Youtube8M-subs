for beginners a good rule of thumb is

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.270 
for beginners a good rule of thumb is
not<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.180> show<00:01:52.390> yours<00:01:52.750> try<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.680> keep<00:01:53.890> your<00:01:54.010> hand

out of the shot giant hands can be very

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.430 
out of the shot giant hands can be very
distracting<00:01:57.240> another<00:01:58.240> good<00:01:58.630> idea<00:01:58.659> is<00:01:59.200> to<00:01:59.290> have

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
distracting another good idea is to have

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
don't your audience might get a little

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.999 
don't your audience might get a little
nauseous<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.690> also<00:02:04.960> very<00:02:05.350> important<00:02:05.979> to

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009
