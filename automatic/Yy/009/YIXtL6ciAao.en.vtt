00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
why they didn't add some kind of treble

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.100 
why they didn't add some kind of treble
and<00:01:43.590> bass<00:01:43.979> control<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.110> considering

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and bass control to this considering

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
and bass control to this considering
that<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.329> 2.1<00:01:48.329> speaker<00:01:49.140> system<00:01:49.619> i<00:01:49.799> know

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that this is a 2.1 speaker system i know

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.429 
that this is a 2.1 speaker system i know
it's<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.299> latest<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> greatest<00:01:52.049> sound

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it's not the latest and greatest sound

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's not the latest and greatest sound
system<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.460> i<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> should<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.689> least

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
system but i think it should at least

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.160 
system but i think it should at least
have<00:01:55.140> some<00:01:55.200> kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.799> basic<00:01:56.579> treble<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.689> bass

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
have some kind of basic treble and bass

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.920 
have some kind of basic treble and bass
control<00:01:58.790> considering<00:01:59.790> its<00:01:59.939> price<00:02:00.000> range<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
control considering its price range and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.160 
control considering its price range and
that's<00:02:01.829> why<00:02:02.040> i<00:02:02.070> took<00:02:02.219> off<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> point<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.630> gave

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
that's why i took off a point and gave

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.570 
that's why i took off a point and gave
this<00:02:04.380> practice

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
this practice

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.640 
this practice
and<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.540> going<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.810> test<00:02:07.050> these<00:02:07.200> speakers

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and I was going to test these speakers

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.180 
and I was going to test these speakers
out<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.190> guys<00:02:08.370> but<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.510> sound<00:02:09.900> quality

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
out for you guys but the sound quality

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
out for you guys but the sound quality
didn't<00:02:11.190> turn<00:02:11.520> out<00:02:11.700> too<00:02:12.000> well

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
didn't turn out too well

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.940 
didn't turn out too well
so<00:02:13.260> because<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.920> my<00:02:14.070> crappy<00:02:15.030> mic<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.530> guess

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so because of my crappy mic so I guess

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.350 
so because of my crappy mic so I guess
you<00:02:17.100> guys<00:02:17.220> will<00:02:17.400> just<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.760> trust<00:02:18.030> me<00:02:18.240> when

I say these speakers sound really good

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.930
