00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
pretty much run a lot of today's popular

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.830 
pretty much run a lot of today's popular
PC<00:00:23.340> games<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.760> around<00:00:23.939> medium<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.510> ultra

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
PC games at around medium to ultra

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.630 
PC games at around medium to ultra
settings<00:00:25.019> depending<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:25.949> which<00:00:26.130> game<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.340> get

settings depending on which game you get

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.759 
settings depending on which game you get
so<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> processor<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.840> chose<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> AMD

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
so for the processor I chose the AMD

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.820 
so for the processor I chose the AMD
athlon<00:00:29.220> x4<00:00:29.670> 860<00:00:30.420> K<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> quad<00:00:31.800> core

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
athlon x4 860 K so this is a quad core

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.920 
athlon x4 860 K so this is a quad core
processor<00:00:32.040> by<00:00:32.610> AMD<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.510> based<00:00:33.750> off<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
processor by AMD that is based off of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.170 
processor by AMD that is based off of
the<00:00:34.079> steamroller<00:00:34.500> architecture<00:00:35.399> now<00:00:35.910> pretty

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the steamroller architecture now pretty

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.060 
the steamroller architecture now pretty
much<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.480> $75<00:00:37.230> d<00:00:37.440> pretty<00:00:37.649> much<00:00:37.770> can't<00:00:37.980> go

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
much for $75 d pretty much can't go

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
much for $75 d pretty much can't go
wrong<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.910> quad<00:00:39.180> core<00:00:39.480> it's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
wrong with this it's a quad core it's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.420 
wrong with this it's a quad core it's
overclocked<00:00:40.290> bull<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.219> pretty<00:00:41.370> much

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
overclocked bull and it's pretty much

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.400 
overclocked bull and it's pretty much
what<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> need<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> gaming<00:00:42.329> CPU<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.230> for

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
what you need for a gaming CPU so for

price tag which is not bad at all

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.720 
price tag which is not bad at all
not<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.049> mention<00:03:55.199> that<00:03:55.410> 80<00:03:55.650> plus<00:03:55.889> gold<00:03:55.919> is<00:03:56.400> more

power<00:03:56.970> efficient<00:03:57.480> than<00:03:57.660> 80<00:03:57.870> plus<00:03:58.109> bronze

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
power efficient than 80 plus bronze

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.439 
power efficient than 80 plus bronze
which<00:03:58.769> is<00:03:58.889> certainly<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.310> plus<00:03:59.699> to<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.060> system

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
which is certainly a plus to this system

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.559 
which is certainly a plus to this system
and<00:04:01.040> 450<00:04:02.040> watts<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.489> enough<00:04:03.000> for<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.239> system

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
and 450 watts is enough for the system

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.610 
and 450 watts is enough for the system
including<00:04:04.049> overclocking<00:04:04.739> on<00:04:04.829> that<00:04:05.299> 860<00:04:06.299> KN<00:04:06.840> r9

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
including overclocking on that 860 KN r9

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.309 
including overclocking on that 860 KN r9
270<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.359> is<00:04:09.510> enough<00:04:09.750> wattage<00:04:09.959> for<00:04:10.230> the

270 so this is enough wattage for the

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.750 
270 so this is enough wattage for the
system<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.829> really<00:04:11.069> for<00:04:11.310> being<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.549> any
