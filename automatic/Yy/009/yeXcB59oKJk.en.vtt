00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 while repairing your bathroom 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.750
 Before you will be the question of what to choose 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.429
 bath or shower 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160
 let's try to understand this 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.769
 an interesting topic is needed first 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.379
 think what kind there will be your life 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.810
 your choice will depend on it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.930
 if you wake up early enough and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.380
 immediately run to work then of course a shower 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.090
 shower is what you need 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.029
 today there are so many 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.219
 interesting engineering solutions one of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.070
 them when we form a shower cabin 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.590
 using simple glass walls and when 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.989
 This is the solution to the shower 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.649
 shapes your bathroom style 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.289
 in this case it will be minimalism well 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.989
 and if the area of ​​your nay room is not 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.449
 allows you to put such an elegant cabin 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.399
 it is better to use the built-in option 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.100
 in this case, we only use 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.870
 one door that will limit 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.239
 shower space and everything 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.239
 the remaining walls are formed by walls 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.519
 the bathroom today is no longer the usual watering can 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.430
 a rain shower is used 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.530
 A hydromassage is also built in the wall. 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 all this is controlled by these 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.280
 original 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.900
 regulators small designer 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.180
 hint to embed such 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.520
 the engineering system needs to endure the wall 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.259
 slightly ahead we recommend you not 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 endure the whole wall 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.939
 form a very comfortable one 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.509
 shelf for shampoo or personal items 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.420
 hygiene 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.380
 another way to save space 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.509
 your knot yourself 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 used sliding shower doors 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.770
 cab in this case saved 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 space can be used to 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.909
 to do in cabins More 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.490
 This cabin allows you to not just go 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.420
 and take a shower and even sit down or 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.860
 take water treatments together 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.930
 some cases the shower will be 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.640
 play sleep up 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 let's look a little bit into perspective 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.110
 suppose you are coming soon 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.450
 children are small children and of course in this 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 case without water 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.190
 and there is another option when you just 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.990
 like to relax bath relieve stress and 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.360
 enjoy this life 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.280
 I choose a bath for relaxation not 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.380
 forget that there is a very interesting 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.580
 option and well firstly says and bath 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.800
 need not be 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.290
 single and second exist 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 all kinds of nozzles systems and other 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.540
 special effects several practical 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.580
 tips you don't have to use 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.660
 your standard screen, we can 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.239
 use this interesting 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.770
 decoration in the form of a tile or mosaic in 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.110
 this case is a bath 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.110
 fits well into the general hi 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.050
 bath or shower decide of course 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.959
 same to you 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.580
 but even the most avid opponents of the bath 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.580
 will not stand before such decisions
