 she will eat all that said today 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.370
 we will talk radio and music 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.350
 hide to make you wait before 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.110
 the output of the top 10 which premium 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.730
 firstly so here you have hidden radio 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.490
 in the roddick sleeve both 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.290
 first being in the heat 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.910
 so laid on tables one of the very 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.030
 generator and the second in the back 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.739
 little son stop number 3 is located 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.960
 in the workshop the central bunker 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.809
 up to the wharf of the bunk and the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.489
 radios 4 5 and 6 is in the three 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.470
 robots so going through the dock like 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.870
 you certainly know it already and she 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.910
 is in the robot's head was posing 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.770
 on the ground so not to be confused with 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.180
 the red radios we talked about 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.180
 in the third part of this video 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.030
 as you may have noticed there is 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.829
 also a first kosher music 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.720
 so just activate the three 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.280
 stones pours the first lying 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.670
 in the force too much as you can the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.229
 see at this place precisely the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.270
 second is in the workshop 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.100
 central length so you just need to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.220
 go through the main door and two 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.780
 mounted to dairy the green stone is going to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.549
 find under the bunk beds 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.840
 so you may need to 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.830
 to lengthen to activate it does not work 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.630
 not every time here it is 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.610
 and the third green stone is found 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.200
 at the foot of the mound that leads to the pack at 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 punch so right behind the little ones 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.670
 wooden crates the same it will take you to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.830
 run to operate it and so there is 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.479
 a second kosher music is a 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.710
 music a little more hard rock than those 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.720
 Elena Cimade 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.580
 so to do this it will have to be active 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.530
 and three radios red the first one 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.360
 finding as you can see in 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.159
 the small room that is under the 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.799
 punch pack where there are the bases of 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.990
 sticks the second radio is here 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.670
 even in the fright robot freya it's 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.759

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.650
 putting you at the level of the church and the 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.020
 third is in the land near 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.450

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.649
 on the floor in a small corner 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.000
