00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
mean it's true they do but not to the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
mean it's true they do but not to the
degree<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.729> need<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.380> have

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
degree that you need to to not have

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
degree that you need to to not have
muscle<00:01:17.189> imbalances<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:19.080> lower<00:01:19.229> back

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
muscle imbalances so your lower back

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.990 
muscle imbalances so your lower back
hurts<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.100> oh<00:01:20.310> man<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.700> gotta<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.909> gotta

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
hurts you think oh man I gotta I gotta

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.789 
hurts you think oh man I gotta I gotta
strengthen<00:01:21.509> my<00:01:21.570> lower<00:01:21.750> back<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.380> too<00:01:22.590> weak

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
strengthen my lower back it's too weak

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.420 
strengthen my lower back it's too weak
so<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.520> start<00:01:23.729> doing<00:01:24.799> hyper<00:01:25.799> extensions

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so then you start doing hyper extensions

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
so then you start doing hyper extensions
and<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.670> things<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> hit<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.270> lower

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and all these things to hit your lower

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.850 
and all these things to hit your lower
back<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.840> all<00:01:27.990> you're<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.380> doing<00:01:28.500> is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
back and all you're really doing is

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
back and all you're really doing is
further<00:01:29.220> facilitating<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> problem<00:01:30.540> because

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
further facilitating the problem because

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.630 
further facilitating the problem because
the<00:01:31.320> reason<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> hurts<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.159> because<00:01:32.430> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the reason it hurts is because your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.390 
the reason it hurts is because your
lower<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.270> strong<00:01:33.540> your<00:01:34.470> abs<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.310> your

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
lower back is strong your abs and your

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.789 
lower back is strong your abs and your
core<00:01:35.670> upfront<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.329> weak<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.200> your<00:01:37.380> lower<00:01:37.530> back

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
core upfront are weak so your lower back

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.530 
core upfront are weak so your lower back
has<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.159> take<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.850> load<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.329> has<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
has to take all that load and it has to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.240 
has to take all that load and it has to
pick<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.290> abs<00:01:40.470> can't<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
pick up what your abs can't do and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.249 
pick up what your abs can't do and
that's<00:01:41.400> why<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.000> slow<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> time<00:01:42.689> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that's why it's so slow all the time so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's why it's so slow all the time so
if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.680> strengthen<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.100> back<00:01:44.310> you're

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
if you just strengthen your back you're

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.789 
if you just strengthen your back you're
