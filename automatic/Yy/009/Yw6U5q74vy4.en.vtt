00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
from the skin so I hear that this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.660 
from the skin so I hear that this
particular<00:01:13.110> model<00:01:13.409> pretty<00:01:14.159> much<00:01:14.340> corrects

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
particular model pretty much corrects

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.550 
particular model pretty much corrects
all<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.330> not<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> vitamix<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.200> course

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
all of that it's not a vitamix of course

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.670 
all of that it's not a vitamix of course
however<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.600> budget<00:01:18.990> minded<00:01:19.200> folks

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
however for more budget minded folks

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.910 
however for more budget minded folks
like<00:01:19.950> myself<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> great<00:01:22.619> option

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
like myself this will be a great option

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.499 
like myself this will be a great option
so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> believe<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.700> won't<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:23.970> any<00:01:24.119> options

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so I believe I won't have any options

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230 
so I believe I won't have any options
but<00:01:24.810> any<00:01:25.080> issues<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.740> forward<00:01:26.240> I've

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
just use this so it's throw it in there

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.200 
just use this so it's throw it in there
so<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> want<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> do

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.380 

all<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.430> 9000<00:02:02.430> essentially<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
all right the 9000 essentially is the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.520 
all right the 9000 essentially is the
exact<00:02:03.719> same<00:02:03.960> size<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.670> 600<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.990> 900<00:02:07.469> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
exact same size as the 600 the 900 is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.499 
exact same size as the 600 the 900 is
the<00:02:07.619> same<00:02:07.829> size<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.280> 600<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:09.149> worried<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the same size at 600 I was worried that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.960 
the same size at 600 I was worried that
it<00:02:09.780> will<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.229> more<00:02:10.470> space<00:02:10.769> in<00:02:11.009> my<00:02:11.160> little

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
it will take up more space in my little

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.500 
it will take up more space in my little
area<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.450> I've<00:02:12.930> been<00:02:13.349> assigned<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.700> all<00:02:15.360> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
area that I've been assigned for all of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.770 
area that I've been assigned for all of
my<00:02:15.660> green<00:02:16.560> smoothies<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.310> blending<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.000> it's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
my green smoothies and blending so it's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.940 
my green smoothies and blending so it's
the<00:02:18.870> same<00:02:19.080> size<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.739> got<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.920> nice<00:02:20.810> metal

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the same size it's got a nice metal

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.500 
the same size it's got a nice metal
casing<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.220> looks<00:02:23.459> real<00:02:23.670> nice<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.120> looks<00:02:24.299> kind

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
casing so looks real nice it looks kind

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.619 
casing so looks real nice it looks kind
like<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:25.049> guess<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.010> would<00:02:26.160> be<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.629> deadly

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
like a I guess this would be the deadly

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.070 
like a I guess this would be the deadly
of<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.590> nutribullet<00:02:29.430> line<00:02:29.879> if<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.720> compare

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
of the nutribullet line if you compare

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.750 
of the nutribullet line if you compare
the<00:02:31.230> three<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.650> 600<00:02:32.160> watt<00:02:32.340> would<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the three the 600 watt would be the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.080 
the three the 600 watt would be the
Lexus<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:34.489> original<00:02:35.489> Magic<00:02:35.940> Bullet

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
Lexus and the original Magic Bullet

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.940 
Lexus and the original Magic Bullet
would<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.510> considered<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.140> entry<00:02:37.470> level<00:02:37.829> or

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
would be considered the entry level or

00:02:37.950 --> 00:03:19.250 
would be considered the entry level or
the<00:02:38.900> Lincoln<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.049> guess<00:02:40.349> so<00:02:40.799> let's<00:02:40.950> go<00:02:41.099> see<00:02:41.459> what

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.720 

one<00:03:20.260> thing<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.530> like<00:03:20.710> about<00:03:20.740> this<00:03:21.160> already<00:03:21.550> is

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
one thing I like about this already is

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.610 
one thing I like about this already is
that<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.940> don't<00:03:22.060> smell<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.870> smoke<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.530> I'm

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
that I don't smell the smoke that I'm

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.940 
that I don't smell the smoke that I'm
smelling<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.490> original<00:03:25.150> bottle<00:03:25.950> so

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
smelling in the original bottle so

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.660 
smelling in the original bottle so
that's<00:03:27.630> definitely<00:03:28.630> great<00:03:29.260> I'm<00:03:30.220> gonna<00:03:30.430> do<00:03:30.640> a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
that's definitely great I'm gonna do a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.220 
that's definitely great I'm gonna do a
four<00:03:31.000> test<00:03:31.270> just<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.600> check<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.930> consistency

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
four test just to check the consistency

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.140 
four test just to check the consistency
I've<00:03:32.710> seen<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:32.950> few<00:03:33.190> videos<00:03:33.220> where<00:03:33.730> people<00:03:33.760> have

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
I've seen a few videos where people have

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.080 
I've seen a few videos where people have
requested<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.840> see<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.400> consistency<00:03:36.400> of

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
requested to see the consistency of

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.200 
requested to see the consistency of
these<00:03:37.630> movies<00:03:38.050> I<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:39.280> definitely<00:03:39.490> tell<00:03:40.030> it's

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
these movies I can definitely tell it's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.560 
these movies I can definitely tell it's
a<00:03:40.420> lot<00:03:40.660> smoother<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.380> don't<00:03:41.650> see<00:03:41.860> any<00:03:42.300> chunks<00:03:43.300> or

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
a lot smoother I don't see any chunks or

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.210 
a lot smoother I don't see any chunks or
anything<00:03:43.750> other<00:03:44.050> than<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.820> tiny<00:03:46.830> husk<00:03:47.830> of

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
anything other than just a tiny husk of

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.760 
anything other than just a tiny husk of
the<00:03:48.910> strawberries<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.110> they<00:03:50.170> put<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.470> camera

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
the strawberries and they put the camera

00:03:50.770 --> 00:04:01.470 
the strawberries and they put the camera
down<00:03:50.800> for<00:03:51.130> a<00:03:51.160> sec<00:03:54.390> while<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.420> twist<00:03:55.870> off<00:03:56.110> the<00:03:58.050> lid

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.680 

okay<00:04:05.430> now<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.700> something<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.090> did<00:04:07.360> notice

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
okay now that something I did notice

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.170 
okay now that something I did notice
right<00:04:08.260> now<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.730> good<00:04:09.730> thing<00:04:09.900> came<00:04:10.900> off<00:04:11.129> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
right now the good thing came off the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.170 
right now the good thing came off the
lining<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:14.950> interesting<00:04:17.310> maybe<00:04:18.310> it

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
lining so that is interesting maybe it

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.400 
lining so that is interesting maybe it
was<00:04:19.269> something<00:04:19.600> I<00:04:19.690> did<00:04:19.930> I'm<00:04:20.109> gonna<00:04:20.229> have<00:04:20.320> to

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
was something I did I'm gonna have to

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.260 
was something I did I'm gonna have to
check<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:20.620> but<00:04:20.919> let's<00:04:21.130> check<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.519> pouring

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
check that but let's check the pouring

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.270 
check that but let's check the pouring
consistency<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:23.199> see<00:04:23.350> how<00:04:23.440> it<00:04:23.500> looks

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.350 

definitely<00:04:27.280> smoother<00:04:27.760> you<00:04:27.880> don't<00:04:28.060> see<00:04:28.210> any

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
definitely smoother you don't see any

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.310 
definitely smoother you don't see any
chunks<00:04:29.010> any<00:04:30.010> real<00:04:30.430> chunks<00:04:33.930> it's<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:35.110> lot

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
chunks any real chunks it's a lot

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.390 
chunks any real chunks it's a lot
smoother<00:04:36.130> definitely<00:04:37.120> a<00:04:37.150> lot<00:04:37.360> smoother<00:04:38.729> so

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
smoother definitely a lot smoother so

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.480 
smoother definitely a lot smoother so
looks<00:04:42.400> almost<00:04:42.970> completely<00:04:43.539> smooth<00:04:44.340> which<00:04:45.340> is

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
looks almost completely smooth which is

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.439 
looks almost completely smooth which is
great<00:04:49.710> right<00:04:50.710> here<00:04:51.160> maybe<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.300> was

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
great right here maybe this was

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:53.790 
great right here maybe this was
something<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.810> was<00:04:52.960> supposed<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.410> come<00:04:53.560> off

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
something that was supposed to come off

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.900 
something that was supposed to come off
no<00:04:54.520> no<00:04:54.850> but<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.289> continues<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:57.310> may<00:04:57.520> need<00:04:57.699> them

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
no no but this continues I may need them

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.990 
no no but this continues I may need them
make<00:04:58.150> my<00:04:58.360> review<00:04:58.720> but<00:04:59.500> so<00:05:00.250> far<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.520> don't<00:05:00.820> see

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
make my review but so far I don't see

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.500 
make my review but so far I don't see
any<00:05:01.180> leaking<00:05:01.630> inside<00:05:01.990> of<00:05:02.139> the<00:05:02.229> unit<00:05:03.330> which<00:05:04.330> is

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
any leaking inside of the unit which is

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.440 
any leaking inside of the unit which is
a<00:05:04.539> good<00:05:04.780> thing<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:06.160> does<00:05:06.400> come<00:05:06.639> with<00:05:06.669> two<00:05:06.849> of

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
a good thing it does come with two of

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.830 
a good thing it does come with two of
these<00:05:08.250> these<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:11.110> is<00:05:11.289> called<00:05:12.090> blades<00:05:13.090> played

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
these these this is called blades played

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
these these this is called blades played
cases<00:05:16.080> extractors<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.289> guess<00:05:17.470> is<00:05:17.620> what<00:05:17.770> they

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
cases extractors I guess is what they

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.270 
cases extractors I guess is what they
call<00:05:18.099> them<00:05:18.220> and<00:05:18.400> so<00:05:19.560> I'll<00:05:20.560> try<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.830> other<00:05:20.950> one

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
call them and so I'll try the other one

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.589 
call them and so I'll try the other one
hopefully<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.700> other<00:05:21.789> one<00:05:22.000> doesn't<00:05:22.150> do<00:05:22.389> this

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
hopefully the other one doesn't do this

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.190 
hopefully the other one doesn't do this
but<00:05:22.870> this<00:05:23.080> isn't<00:05:23.349> a<00:05:23.560> good<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:24.729> far<00:05:25.090> but<00:05:25.389> we'll

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
but this isn't a good so far but we'll

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.140 
but this isn't a good so far but we'll
see<00:05:26.410> what<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.680> do<00:05:26.830> we<00:05:27.099> always<00:05:27.460> can<00:05:27.669> return<00:05:27.970> it

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
see what to do we always can return it

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.180 
see what to do we always can return it
if<00:05:28.240> there's<00:05:28.389> any<00:05:28.539> issues<00:05:28.990> so<00:05:29.020> all<00:05:29.919> right<00:05:30.070> and
