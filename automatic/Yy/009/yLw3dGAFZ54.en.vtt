00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
here by sack in this video I think

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.910 
here by sack in this video I think
that's<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.720> greens<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.229> outside<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> just

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that's two greens on the outside I just

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.230 
that's two greens on the outside I just
realized<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.400> thought<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
realized that I thought it was one so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.230 
realized that I thought it was one so
this<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.420> 1:45<00:01:42.350> he's<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.860> tendency<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.700> push

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this is 1:45 he's got a tendency to push

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
this is 1:45 he's got a tendency to push
his<00:01:45.390> hips<00:01:45.720> back<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.470> under<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> bar<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
his hips back out from under the bar and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.310 
his hips back out from under the bar and
that<00:01:47.250> split<00:01:47.520> which<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> exactly<00:01:49.079> what's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that split which is exactly what's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
that split which is exactly what's
happening<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.490> he's<00:01:50.579> got<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> good<00:01:50.880> drive

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
happening there so he's got a good drive

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.149 
happening there so he's got a good drive
on<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.200> not<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> bar<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.979> going

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
on it and it's not that the bar is going

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
on it and it's not that the bar is going
forward<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.090> he's<00:01:54.360> pushing<00:01:54.659> himself

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
forward it's that he's pushing himself

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.030 
forward it's that he's pushing himself
backward<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> times<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.540> happens

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
backward and a lot of times that happens

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.139 
backward and a lot of times that happens
one<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.430> mentally<00:01:59.850> you're<00:02:00.000> not

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
one because mentally you're not

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270 
one because mentally you're not
confident<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.930> kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.290> subconsciously

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
confident you kind of subconsciously

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.249 
confident you kind of subconsciously
don't<00:02:03.000> allow<00:02:03.240> yourself<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.750> put<00:02:03.930> yourself

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
don't allow yourself to put yourself

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
don't allow yourself to put yourself
under<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.040> bar<00:02:05.219> because<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
under the bar because you think you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.760 
under the bar because you think you
can't<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
can't get it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.270 
can't get it
can't<00:02:07.400> support<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.410> but<00:02:09.410> also<00:02:09.590> another<00:02:10.009> big

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
can't support it but also another big

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.390 
can't support it but also another big
cause<00:02:10.550> is<00:02:11.200> people<00:02:12.200> leaning<00:02:12.709> a<00:02:12.860> heads<00:02:13.160> and

chest forward through the bar as a way

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.890 
chest forward through the bar as a way
to<00:02:15.920> get<00:02:16.099> under<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.270> pulls<00:02:17.690> the

to get under it and that that pulls the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.270 
to get under it and that that pulls the
hips<00:02:18.110> out<00:02:18.290> from<00:02:18.500> under<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.800> bar

they<00:02:19.430> over<00:02:19.760> reach<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.120> back<00:02:20.390> foot<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.959> they

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
they over reach that back foot and they

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.660 
they over reach that back foot and they
don't<00:02:21.260> have<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.860> ability<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.220> support<00:02:22.580> the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
power and that the strength we need to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.940 
power and that the strength we need to
get<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.720> bar<00:03:14.959> up<00:03:15.200> enough<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:15.709> get<00:03:15.829> himself

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
get that bar up enough and get himself

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.210 
get that bar up enough and get himself
under<00:03:16.780> lean<00:03:17.780> deadlifts<00:03:18.350> conveniently<00:03:19.100> enough

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
under lean deadlifts conveniently enough

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.640 
under lean deadlifts conveniently enough
here<00:03:19.609> in<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.820> video<00:03:20.060> or<00:03:20.959> one<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.530> ways

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
here in this video or one of the ways

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.539 
here in this video or one of the ways
we're<00:03:21.890> doing<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.690> is<00:03:24.430> 2:30<00:03:25.430> I

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
we're doing that and so this is 2:30 I

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.920 
we're doing that and so this is 2:30 I
think<00:03:27.489> this<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.700> I'm<00:03:29.420> trying<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.720> think<00:03:29.810> of

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
think this is I'm trying to think of

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.280 
think this is I'm trying to think of
when<00:03:30.140> this<00:03:30.290> was<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.680> was<00:03:30.829> probably<00:03:31.930> 2<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:32.959> 3

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
when this was this was probably 2 to 3

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.390 
when this was this was probably 2 to 3
weeks<00:03:33.320> ago<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.160> getting<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.180> range<00:03:35.569> of<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
weeks ago so getting in range of the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.880 
weeks ago so getting in range of the
national<00:03:37.790> championships<00:03:38.709> Brian<00:03:39.709> will<00:03:39.829> be

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
national championships Brian will be

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.259 
national championships Brian will be
lifting<00:03:40.250> along<00:03:40.459> with<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.730> rest<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.090> team

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
lifting along with the rest of the team

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.960 
lifting along with the rest of the team
man<00:03:41.859> so<00:03:42.859> I've<00:03:43.010> actually<00:03:43.190> kept<00:03:43.700> him<00:03:43.940> on

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
man so I've actually kept him on

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.160 
man so I've actually kept him on
deadlifts<00:03:46.329> all<00:03:47.329> the<00:03:47.600> way<00:03:47.720> up<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.079> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
deadlifts all the way up to the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.900 
deadlifts all the way up to the
competition<00:03:48.380> rather<00:03:49.130> than<00:03:49.400> switching<00:03:49.579> over

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
competition rather than switching over

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.660 
competition rather than switching over
to<00:03:50.030> poles<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.810> normally<00:03:50.870> would<00:03:51.519> because<00:03:52.519> I

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
to poles like I normally would because I

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.030 
to poles like I normally would because I
find<00:03:53.060> for<00:03:53.900> him<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:54.380> actually<00:03:54.500> for<00:03:54.829> Blake

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
find for him and actually for Blake

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.300 
find for him and actually for Blake
who's<00:03:55.340> snatching<00:03:55.760> right<00:03:55.910> now<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.769> it

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
who's snatching right now that it it

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.830 
who's snatching right now that it it
allows<00:03:58.579> them<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.850> focus<00:03:58.940> on<00:03:59.389> that<00:03:59.450> position

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
allows them to focus on that position

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.250 
allows them to focus on that position
off<00:04:00.109> the<00:04:00.230> floor<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.530> lot<00:04:00.739> better<00:04:02.079> whereas<00:04:03.079> with

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
off the floor a lot better whereas with

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.870 
off the floor a lot better whereas with
the<00:04:03.380> pole<00:04:03.650> they'll<00:04:04.220> tend<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.489> be<00:04:04.609> so<00:04:04.850> focused

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
the pole they'll tend to be so focused

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.990 
the pole they'll tend to be so focused
on<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.630> top<00:04:06.019> portion<00:04:06.350> of<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.739> lift<00:04:07.000> that

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
on that top portion of the lift that

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.120 
on that top portion of the lift that
they'll<00:04:08.239> neglect<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.959> initial<00:04:09.769> lift<00:04:09.920> off<00:04:10.100> a

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
they'll neglect the initial lift off a

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.809 
they'll neglect the initial lift off a
little<00:04:10.639> bit<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.000> don't<00:04:11.120> get<00:04:11.329> that<00:04:11.389> same<00:04:12.819> you

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
little bit and I don't get that same you

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.370 
little bit and I don't get that same you

and
that<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.940> posture<00:04:18.509> and<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.720> tension<00:04:19.199> that<00:04:19.319> I

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:19.379 
that the posture and the tension that I

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.960 
that the posture and the tension that I
want<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.919> I'm<00:04:20.069> finding<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> deadlift<00:04:20.789> in

want so I'm finding the deadlift in
those<00:04:21.090> cases<00:04:21.389> is<00:04:22.139> actually<00:04:22.409> a<00:04:22.620> better<00:04:22.830> choice

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:23.069 
those cases is actually a better choice

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:24.469 
those cases is actually a better choice
even<00:04:23.370> though<00:04:23.490> normally<00:04:23.970> you'd<00:04:24.120> be<00:04:24.150> looking

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
even though normally you'd be looking

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.670 
even though normally you'd be looking
for<00:04:24.659> more<00:04:24.870> lifts<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:25.949> a<00:04:25.979> little<00:04:26.220> more<00:04:26.340> speed

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
for more lifts with a little more speed

for more lifts with a little more speed

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:32.129 
single I believe so this is I don't

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.249 
single I believe so this is I don't
that's<00:04:32.280> 92<00:04:32.759> or<00:04:32.879> 93<00:04:33.150> they<00:04:33.539> can't<00:04:33.720> see<00:04:33.900> exactly

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
that's 92 or 93 they can't see exactly

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:40.879 
that's 92 or 93 they can't see exactly
what's<00:04:34.530> on<00:04:34.650> there<00:04:35.539> this<00:04:36.539> is<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.810> hundred<00:04:39.470> yeah<00:04:40.470> I

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
what's on there this is a hundred yeah I

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.010 
what's on there this is a hundred yeah I
can't<00:04:41.490> see<00:04:41.669> if<00:04:41.729> it's<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.360> point<00:04:42.599> five<00:04:42.780> on<00:04:42.930> the

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
can't see if it's a point five on the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.890 
can't see if it's a point five on the
outside<00:04:43.319> there<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.819> 105<00:04:45.599> I

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
outside there and this is a 105 I

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.550 
outside there and this is a 105 I
believe<00:04:46.169> his<00:04:46.620> his<00:04:47.069> best<00:04:47.340> is<00:04:47.550> 110<00:04:48.060> so<00:04:48.389> he<00:04:49.379> had<00:04:49.500> a

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
believe his his best is 110 so he had a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.159 
believe his his best is 110 so he had a
good<00:04:49.680> run<00:04:49.919> this<00:04:50.159> day<00:04:50.509> if<00:04:51.509> I<00:04:51.659> recall<00:04:51.810> correctly

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
good run this day if I recall correctly

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.110 
good run this day if I recall correctly
he<00:04:52.590> actually<00:04:52.889> had<00:04:53.009> no<00:04:53.159> misses<00:04:53.580> all<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.819> way<00:04:53.940> up

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
he actually had no misses all the way up

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.749 
he actually had no misses all the way up
so<00:04:54.710> those<00:04:55.710> are<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.949> days<00:04:56.159> that<00:04:56.190> she<00:04:56.580> always

00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:56.759 
so those are the days that she always

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.450 
so those are the days that she always
hoped<00:04:57.150> for<00:04:57.449> where<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.710> know<00:04:58.800> everything<00:04:59.129> is

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
hoped for where you know everything is

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.339 
hoped for where you know everything is
just<00:04:59.580> clicking<00:04:59.909> right<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.930> don't<00:05:01.050> get<00:05:01.199> them

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
just clicking right you don't get them

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.860 
just clicking right you don't get them
very<00:05:01.469> often<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:02.729> when<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.240> do<00:05:03.419> get<00:05:03.629> them

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
very often so when you do get them

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.689 
very often so when you do get them
sometimes<00:05:04.319> you<00:05:04.409> have<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.740> go<00:05:04.889> off<00:05:05.069> plan<00:05:05.460> and

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
sometimes you have to go off plan and

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.010 
sometimes you have to go off plan and
take<00:05:05.879> advantage<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.449> fact<00:05:06.659> that<00:05:06.840> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
take advantage of the fact that the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.129 
take advantage of the fact that the
lifter<00:05:07.349> is<00:05:07.409> feeling<00:05:07.770> good<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:09.050> you<00:05:10.050> know

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
lifter is feeling good and you know

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.080 
lifter is feeling good and you know
basically<00:05:10.770> what<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:11.009> tell<00:05:11.250> people<00:05:11.460> we've<00:05:11.879> got

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
basically what I tell people we've got

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.659 
basically what I tell people we've got
this<00:05:12.240> plan<00:05:12.539> but<00:05:12.889> you<00:05:13.889> know<00:05:13.979> if<00:05:14.099> we're<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.310> range

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
this plan but you know if we're in range

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.580 
this plan but you know if we're in range
of<00:05:14.789> a<00:05:14.879> PR<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.539> there's<00:05:15.719> a<00:05:15.780> very<00:05:16.199> good<00:05:16.379> chance

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
of a PR and there's a very good chance

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.879 
of a PR and there's a very good chance
that<00:05:17.009> we<00:05:17.400> can<00:05:17.610> get<00:05:17.759> a<00:05:17.789> PR<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.270> day<00:05:18.650> we're<00:05:19.650> more

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
that we can get a PR that day we're more

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.999 
that we can get a PR that day we're more
than<00:05:19.979> likely<00:05:20.039> gonna<00:05:20.430> go<00:05:20.669> for<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:21.060> even<00:05:21.330> if<00:05:21.419> it's

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
than likely gonna go for it even if it's

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.140 
than likely gonna go for it even if it's
kind<00:05:23.009> of<00:05:23.099> going<00:05:23.370> off<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.669> rails

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
kind of going off the rails

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.879 
kind of going off the rails
you<00:05:24.330> can<00:05:24.479> always<00:05:24.630> account<00:05:25.289> for<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:25.590> later

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
you can always account for that later

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.700 
you can always account for that later
