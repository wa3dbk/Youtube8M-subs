fast-paced than hardpoint on black ops 2
now<00:03:18.190> I'm<00:03:18.489> not<00:03:18.760> sure<00:03:18.909> if<00:03:19.030> that's<00:03:19.150> because

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
now I'm not sure if that's because

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.059 
now I'm not sure if that's because
controlling<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.140> spawns<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> little<00:03:20.980> bit

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
controlling the spawns is a little bit

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.039 
controlling the spawns is a little bit
more<00:03:21.250> difficult<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:21.849> you<00:03:22.090> spawn<00:03:22.599> in<00:03:22.750> pretty

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
more difficult so you spawn in pretty

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.680 
more difficult so you spawn in pretty
close<00:03:23.260> proximity<00:03:23.859> to<00:03:24.579> where<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.090> died<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
close proximity to where you died and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.960 
close proximity to where you died and
who<00:03:25.840> killed<00:03:26.170> you<00:03:26.409> but<00:03:26.680> it's<00:03:27.099> just<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.549> much<00:03:27.579> fun

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
who killed you but it's just so much fun

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.819 
who killed you but it's just so much fun
like<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.359> said<00:03:28.599> if<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.109> ever<00:03:29.200> want<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.530> try<00:03:29.769> it

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
like I said if you ever want to try it

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.009 
like I said if you ever want to try it
I'll<00:03:30.370> probably<00:03:30.700> post<00:03:31.060> about<00:03:31.389> on<00:03:31.599> Twitter<00:03:31.930> so

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
I'll probably post about on Twitter so

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.900 
I'll probably post about on Twitter so
you<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.410> follow<00:03:32.590> me<00:03:32.709> on<00:03:32.919> there<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.549> find<00:03:33.760> out

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
you can follow me on there to find out

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.550 
you can follow me on there to find out
when<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.209> actually<00:03:34.450> happened<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.169> anyway

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
when it actually happened so anyway

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.640 
when it actually happened so anyway
moving<00:03:35.769> on<00:03:36.040> as<00:03:36.359> far<00:03:37.359> as<00:03:37.450> black<00:03:37.690> ops<00:03:37.930> 2<00:03:38.200> we're

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
moving on as far as black ops 2 we're

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.440 
moving on as far as black ops 2 we're
really<00:03:38.859> inspires<00:03:39.400> me<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.730> play<00:03:40.180> as<00:03:40.419> a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
really inspires me to play as a

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.650 
really inspires me to play as a
competitive<00:03:41.139> player<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:42.160> watch<00:03:42.359> my<00:03:43.359> team

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
competitive player is to watch my team

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.750 
competitive player is to watch my team
actually<00:03:43.930> which<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.319> complexity<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.250> I'm<00:03:45.400> not

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
actually which is complexity and I'm not

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.339 
actually which is complexity and I'm not
being<00:03:45.970> biased<00:03:46.540> I'm<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:46.840> just<00:03:47.049> saying<00:03:47.230> that

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
being biased I'm not just saying that

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.170 
being biased I'm not just saying that
because<00:03:47.470> I'm<00:03:47.650> on<00:03:47.919> complexity<00:03:48.489> keep<00:03:48.819> in<00:03:48.970> mind

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
because I'm on complexity keep in mind

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.569 
because I'm on complexity keep in mind
that<00:03:49.299> my<00:03:49.870> channel<00:03:50.379> is<00:03:50.560> not<00:03:50.799> linked<00:03:51.310> with

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
that my channel is not linked with

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.210 
that my channel is not linked with
complexity<00:03:52.239> in<00:03:52.540> any<00:03:52.720> way<00:03:52.930> shape<00:03:52.959> or<00:03:53.319> form<00:03:53.379> I<00:03:53.739> my

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
complexity in any way shape or form I my

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.270 
complexity in any way shape or form I my
youtube<00:03:54.579> channel<00:03:54.609> is<00:03:55.000> just<00:03:55.180> my<00:03:55.359> own<00:03:55.510> thing<00:03:55.810> so

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
youtube channel is just my own thing so

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.650 
youtube channel is just my own thing so
really<00:03:57.280> whenever<00:03:57.459> i<00:03:57.669> watch<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.120> guys<00:03:58.269> play

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
really whenever i watch the guys play

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.259 
really whenever i watch the guys play
it's<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.139> it's<00:03:59.590> motivating<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.639> watch<00:04:00.940> and

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
it's just it's motivating to watch and

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.939 
it's just it's motivating to watch and
see<00:04:01.510> what<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.260> kind<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.530> damage<00:04:02.739> that

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
see what like the kind of damage that

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.129 
see what like the kind of damage that
they<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.459> do<00:04:03.669> and<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.299> kind<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.540> strategy<00:04:05.109> and

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
they can do and the kind of strategy and

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.869 
they can do and the kind of strategy and
thought<00:04:05.500> that<00:04:05.680> they<00:04:05.829> put<00:04:06.069> into<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.459> game<00:04:06.669> and

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
thought that they put into the game and

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.140 
thought that they put into the game and
try<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.510> yone<00:04:08.519> replicate<00:04:09.519> that<00:04:09.549> when<00:04:09.970> you

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
try and yone replicate that when you

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.360 
try and yone replicate that when you
actually<00:04:10.449> go<00:04:10.900> in<00:04:11.079> and<00:04:11.260> do<00:04:11.379> it<00:04:11.470> yourself<00:04:11.859> so<00:04:12.129> I

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
actually go in and do it yourself so I

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.089 
actually go in and do it yourself so I
mean<00:04:13.269> like<00:04:13.389> I<00:04:13.569> said<00:04:13.599> before<00:04:14.010> probably<00:04:15.010> the

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
mean like I said before probably the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.520 
mean like I said before probably the
most<00:04:15.449> motivate<00:04:16.449> I've<00:04:16.690> ever<00:04:16.900> been<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.320> called

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
most motivate I've ever been and called

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.620 
most motivate I've ever been and called
duty<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.949> just<00:04:18.160> keep<00:04:18.310> on<00:04:18.519> playing<00:04:18.849> it<00:04:18.970> was<00:04:19.419> when

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
duty to just keep on playing it was when

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.719 
duty to just keep on playing it was when
I<00:04:19.660> watched<00:04:19.959> fizzer<00:04:20.349> as<00:04:20.680> well<00:04:20.859> as<00:04:20.949> patron<00:04:21.459> and

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
I watched fizzer as well as patron and

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.050 
I watched fizzer as well as patron and
TKO<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.599> whole<00:04:22.810> crew<00:04:23.199> just<00:04:23.770> grind<00:04:24.190> out<00:04:24.430> snd

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
TKO that whole crew just grind out snd

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.750 
TKO that whole crew just grind out snd

playing<00:05:02.270> this<00:05:02.450> but<00:05:03.220> try<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.370> go<00:05:04.460> back<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.880> the

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
playing this but try and go back to the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.690 
playing this but try and go back to the
roots<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.480> why<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.140> are<00:05:06.350> motivated<00:05:07.220> so<00:05:07.490> much

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
roots of why you are motivated so much

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.000 
roots of why you are motivated so much
in<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.030> first<00:05:08.330> place<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.780> mean<00:05:08.930> as<00:05:09.080> far<00:05:09.860> as

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
in the first place I mean as far as

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.710 
in the first place I mean as far as
playing<00:05:10.280> competitive<00:05:10.820> goes<00:05:11.030> I<00:05:11.300> think<00:05:11.330> that

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
playing competitive goes I think that

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.050 
playing competitive goes I think that
our<00:05:11.960> our<00:05:12.290> initial<00:05:12.890> motivation<00:05:13.640> is<00:05:13.850> just

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
our our initial motivation is just

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.150 
our our initial motivation is just
watching<00:05:14.540> competitive<00:05:15.020> players<00:05:15.260> play<00:05:15.620> but

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
watching competitive players play but

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.470 
watching competitive players play but
the<00:05:16.250> more<00:05:16.460> you're<00:05:16.610> involved<00:05:17.000> in<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.240> scene

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
the more you're involved in the scene

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.090 
the more you're involved in the scene
there<00:05:17.690> are<00:05:17.840> specific<00:05:18.500> things<00:05:18.530> that<00:05:18.860> really

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
there are specific things that really

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.950 
there are specific things that really
gets<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:19.460> motivated<00:05:19.610> I<00:05:20.030> know<00:05:20.090> that<00:05:20.390> for<00:05:20.870> me

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
gets you motivated I know that for me

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.990 
gets you motivated I know that for me
personally<00:05:21.230> whenever<00:05:21.800> I<00:05:21.890> see<00:05:22.130> people<00:05:22.340> perform

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
personally whenever I see people perform

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.300 
personally whenever I see people perform
extremely<00:05:23.450> well<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.050> SMD<00:05:24.560> that<00:05:25.010> really

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
extremely well and SMD that really

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.420 
extremely well and SMD that really
motivates<00:05:25.790> me<00:05:26.000> respawn<00:05:26.540> game<00:05:26.780> types<00:05:27.050> in<00:05:27.430> not

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
motivates me respawn game types in not

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.070 
motivates me respawn game types in not
so<00:05:28.670> much<00:05:28.880> especially<00:05:29.090> when<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:29.660> watch<00:05:29.840> like

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
so much especially when I watch like

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.470 
so much especially when I watch like
hard<00:05:30.740> point<00:05:31.070> on<00:05:31.190> hijack<00:05:31.670> because<00:05:32.150> that's<00:05:32.360> just

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
hard point on hijack because that's just

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.570 
hard point on hijack because that's just
such<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:32.780> back-and-forth<00:05:33.320> map<00:05:33.830> that's<00:05:34.100> so<00:05:34.340> up

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
such a back-and-forth map that's so up

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.120 
such a back-and-forth map that's so up
in<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.790> air<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:35.330> mean<00:05:35.720> it's<00:05:35.810> like<00:05:35.930> dome<00:05:36.200> CTF<00:05:36.860> I'm

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
in the air I mean it's like dome CTF I'm

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.590 
in the air I mean it's like dome CTF I'm
either<00:05:37.280> there<00:05:37.760> really<00:05:37.910> aren't<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:38.330> many

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
either there really aren't that many

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.750 
either there really aren't that many
teams<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.080> can<00:05:39.200> completely<00:05:39.730> dominate<00:05:40.730> that

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
teams that can completely dominate that

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.780 
teams that can completely dominate that
and<00:05:41.150> win<00:05:41.420> consistently<00:05:41.960> on<00:05:42.590> those<00:05:43.220> two<00:05:43.490> maps

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
and win consistently on those two maps

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.180 
and win consistently on those two maps
so<00:05:44.150> whenever<00:05:44.900> I<00:05:44.990> see<00:05:45.260> someone<00:05:45.500> do<00:05:45.710> really<00:05:46.010> want

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
so whenever I see someone do really want

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.370 
so whenever I see someone do really want
an<00:05:46.280> SD<00:05:46.730> even<00:05:47.060> though<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.180> really<00:05:47.750> don't<00:05:48.110> like

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
an SD even though I really don't like

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.620 
an SD even though I really don't like
S&amp;D<00:05:49.160> I<00:05:49.190> mean<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.610> know<00:05:49.670> how<00:05:49.940> to<00:05:50.000> play<00:05:50.240> it<00:05:50.390> just

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
S&amp;D I mean I know how to play it just

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.510 
S&amp;D I mean I know how to play it just
fine<00:05:50.900> but<00:05:51.470> it's<00:05:51.650> just<00:05:51.830> not<00:05:51.890> very<00:05:52.040> enjoyable

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
fine but it's just not very enjoyable

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.190 
fine but it's just not very enjoyable
for<00:05:52.910> me<00:05:52.970> mainly<00:05:53.360> because<00:05:53.660> a<00:05:53.870> lot<00:05:54.080> of<00:05:54.110> people

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
for me mainly because a lot of people

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.750 
for me mainly because a lot of people
like<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.530> camp<00:05:54.920> and<00:05:55.220> that's<00:05:55.370> just<00:05:55.460> really
