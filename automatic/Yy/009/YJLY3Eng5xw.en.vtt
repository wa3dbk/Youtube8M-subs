alright so here's my 3000 it's extremely
light<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.630> seems<00:00:53.200> very<00:00:53.470> durable<00:00:53.860> I've

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
light but it seems very durable I've

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.160 
light but it seems very durable I've
been<00:00:55.059> playing<00:00:55.270> around<00:00:55.420> with<00:00:55.600> it<00:00:55.780> for<00:00:55.809> a<00:00:55.960> while

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
been playing around with it for a while

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.960 
been playing around with it for a while
here<00:00:56.440> there's<00:00:56.650> no<00:00:56.800> moveable<00:00:57.400> parts<00:00:57.610> there's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
here there's no moveable parts there's

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.090 
here there's no moveable parts there's
no<00:00:58.120> shaking<00:00:58.600> like<00:00:58.750> a<00:00:58.810> lot<00:00:59.050> of<00:00:59.080> the<00:00:59.260> other<00:00:59.410> you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
no shaking like a lot of the other you

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.060 
no shaking like a lot of the other you
know<00:01:00.190> big-box<00:01:00.670> store<00:01:00.970> brands<00:01:01.510> would<00:01:01.900> be<00:01:02.140> which

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
know big-box store brands would be which

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.880 
know big-box store brands would be which
was<00:01:03.250> very<00:01:03.460> surprising<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.210> me<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:05.650> got<00:01:05.830> a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
was very surprising to me it's got a

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.130 
was very surprising to me it's got a
high-strength<00:01:06.430> aluminum<00:01:06.759> alloy<00:01:07.330> body<00:01:07.630> which

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
high-strength aluminum alloy body which

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
high-strength aluminum alloy body which
is<00:01:08.290> part<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.619> reason<00:01:08.860> why<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.160> so<00:01:09.310> light

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
is part of the reason why it's so light

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.330 
is part of the reason why it's so light
it's<00:01:10.750> also<00:01:10.900> got<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.229> forged<00:01:11.710> one-piece

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
it's also got a forged one-piece

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.210 
it's also got a forged one-piece
aluminum<00:01:13.080> spool<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:14.320> that's<00:01:14.500> another<00:01:14.770> reason

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
aluminum spool so that's another reason

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.870 
aluminum spool so that's another reason
it's<00:01:16.180> got<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.420> carbon<00:01:16.930> fiber<00:01:17.200> rotor<00:01:17.590> here<00:01:17.950> which

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
it's got a carbon fiber rotor here which

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.680 
it's got a carbon fiber rotor here which
is<00:01:19.090> a<00:01:19.119> also<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.720> very<00:01:20.050> lightweight<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.460> durable

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
is a also a very lightweight but durable

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.630 
is a also a very lightweight but durable
material<00:01:22.690> making<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.200> light<00:01:23.380> there<00:01:24.310> is<00:01:24.340> no

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
material making it light there is no

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.330 
material making it light there is no
plastic<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.509> this<00:01:26.140> reel<00:01:26.440> at<00:01:26.649> all<00:01:26.800> that<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.100> could

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
with that that means that this is also

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.710 
with that that means that this is also
saltwater<00:02:05.440> approved<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.520> it's<00:02:07.119> going<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.330> be

saltwater approved and it's going to be

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.870 
saltwater approved and it's going to be
corrosion<00:02:08.020> resistant<00:02:08.800> has<00:02:09.190> both<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.640> left

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
some of my other reels do have that so

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.170 
some of my other reels do have that so
when<00:05:13.620> I'm<00:05:13.770> using<00:05:13.800> this<00:05:14.310> reel<00:05:14.580> compared<00:05:15.030> to

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
when I'm using this reel compared to

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.610 
when I'm using this reel compared to
those<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.570> can<00:05:15.750> definitely<00:05:16.160> tell<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.430> difference

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
those I can definitely tell a difference

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.230 
those I can definitely tell a difference
also<00:05:19.620> here<00:05:19.890> I<00:05:20.130> don't<00:05:20.550> know<00:05:20.640> if<00:05:20.730> you<00:05:20.790> can<00:05:20.970> see

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
also here I don't know if you can see

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.490 
also here I don't know if you can see
but<00:05:21.480> when<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:22.020> reel

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
but when you reel

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.610 
but when you reel
there's<00:05:23.430> no<00:05:23.670> backward<00:05:24.030> movement<00:05:24.930> at<00:05:24.990> all<00:05:25.110> it's

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
there's no backward movement at all it's

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.620 
there's no backward movement at all it's
a<00:05:25.680> lot<00:05:25.860> of<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.040> reels<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.370> have<00:05:26.610> like<00:05:27.360> I'll<00:05:27.540> be

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
a lot of the reels I have like I'll be

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.030 
a lot of the reels I have like I'll be
able<00:05:27.720> to<00:05:27.870> go<00:05:28.020> forward<00:05:28.470> and<00:05:28.620> then<00:05:28.800> back<00:05:29.010> a

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
able to go forward and then back a

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.950 
able to go forward and then back a
little<00:05:29.340> forward<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.300> then<00:05:30.450> back<00:05:30.660> a<00:05:30.690> little

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
little forward and then back a little

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.960 
little forward and then back a little
this<00:05:31.200> doesn't<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.740> that<00:05:31.770> if<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.340> go<00:05:32.580> just<00:05:32.610> a

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
this doesn't have that if you go just a

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.940 
this doesn't have that if you go just a
little<00:05:33.000> bit<00:05:33.240> you're<00:05:33.840> staying<00:05:34.170> there<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.650> drag

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
little bit you're staying there the drag

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.610 
little bit you're staying there the drag
was<00:05:35.220> super<00:05:35.640> smooth<00:05:36.380> unfortunately<00:05:37.380> I<00:05:37.440> didn't

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
was super smooth unfortunately I didn't

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.200 
was super smooth unfortunately I didn't
get<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.800> test<00:05:38.010> it<00:05:38.160> out<00:05:38.250> on<00:05:38.460> fish<00:05:38.760> because<00:05:39.090> I

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
get to test it out on fish because I

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.390 
get to test it out on fish because I
didn't<00:05:39.420> catch<00:05:39.570> anything<00:05:39.840> today<00:05:40.140> but<00:05:40.980> I<00:05:41.250> did

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
didn't catch anything today but I did

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.610 
didn't catch anything today but I did
get<00:05:41.520> snagged<00:05:41.850> a<00:05:42.030> couple<00:05:42.330> times<00:05:42.570> and<00:05:42.930> with<00:05:43.500> the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
get snagged a couple times and with the

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.230 
get snagged a couple times and with the
braid<00:05:43.890> you<00:05:44.190> know<00:05:44.370> it's<00:05:44.520> pretty<00:05:44.640> hard<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.970> break

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
braid you know it's pretty hard to break

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.390 
braid you know it's pretty hard to break
so<00:05:46.110> I<00:05:46.140> did<00:05:46.410> get<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.620> play<00:05:46.650> with<00:05:46.980> the<00:05:47.130> drag<00:05:47.370> a

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
so I did get to play with the drag a

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.600 
so I did get to play with the drag a
little<00:05:47.760> bit<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:49.200> it<00:05:49.350> is<00:05:49.440> super<00:05:49.710> super<00:05:50.310> smooth

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
little bit and it is super super smooth

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.400 
little bit and it is super super smooth
even<00:05:51.030> from<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.330> lightest<00:05:51.750> setting<00:05:52.110> to<00:05:52.290> the

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
even from the lightest setting to the

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.310 
even from the lightest setting to the
hardest<00:05:52.800> setting<00:05:53.240> when<00:05:54.240> you<00:05:54.360> pull<00:05:54.570> on<00:05:54.600> it<00:05:54.840> it's

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
hardest setting when you pull on it it's

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.140 
hardest setting when you pull on it it's
just<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.710> continuous<00:05:56.340> movement<00:05:56.580> there's<00:05:57.000> no

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
just a continuous movement there's no

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.150 
just a continuous movement there's no
jerking<00:05:57.510> in<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:58.260> reel<00:05:58.440> at<00:05:58.620> all<00:05:58.770> it's<00:05:59.040> just

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
jerking in the reel at all it's just

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.130 
jerking in the reel at all it's just
smooth<00:05:59.610> all<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.150> way<00:06:00.180> through<00:06:00.540> and<00:06:00.750> that's

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
smooth all the way through and that's

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.360 
smooth all the way through and that's
really<00:06:01.410> what<00:06:01.650> I'm<00:06:01.740> looking<00:06:01.770> for<00:06:02.250> especially

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
really what I'm looking for especially

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.030 
really what I'm looking for especially
when<00:06:02.790> fighting<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.240> bigger<00:06:03.450> fish<00:06:03.750> or<00:06:04.740> even<00:06:04.770> a

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
when fighting a bigger fish or even a
