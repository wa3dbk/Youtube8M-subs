00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.490
 I really have a people that really 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.490
 was or is severely affected by mites 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.280
 I 've been worried all the time 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.799
 now I am here on mine 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.270
 gone and now I have 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.410
 pretty strong dead fall noticed 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.430
 I do not think so 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.660
 presented how it came now 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.810
 I just want to show you how 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.939
 it now looks like moment in this case 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.019
 I can only say very bad to myself 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.910
 do not like that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.300
 and then we'll see you soon 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 into the people pure 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.590
 whether they are still alive or not treated 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.960
 I have with formic acid three times 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.780
 I did not use oxalic acid 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.690
 I thought what would I do in a week 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 today we have the twelfth of december yes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.270
 apparently either too late or 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.789
 we may look times makes me 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.640
 depending on whether the people live 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 or not 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.990
 now it comes to me like it from the flight hole 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 looks like I've already dismantled 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.260
 take a look at it so that's it 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260
 extreme 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.400
 that's extreme 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.670
 maybe that's mom too sabine 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:44.320
 So that does not say so now 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.390
 I would have to open that ever the people 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.310
 and let's see, that's extreme 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:54.760
 I do not like that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.540
 one cares for one's own and cherishes that 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.470
 people and then of course maybe 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.300
 I would not have on the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.780
 to put honey harvest 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.390
 for the people but now it's just like that 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.570
 as it is and now we look there 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.570
 purely 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.140
 So you do not see moisture here 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.140
 put 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.260
 that's what it would mean, too 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.310
 good activity is now I am leaving 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.310
 the foil 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.209
 but I do not know if you have food 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.360
 is available here you can see it all 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.360
 clear 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.989
 So and lack of feed here is none 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.600
 I believed that as she did 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.350
 and I even believe a hum 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.350
 to have perceived 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.090
 pity that I have no problem with it 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.049
 the people live a little folk 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:23.140
 but now it lives the room 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.140
 cash empty empty 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.830
 full 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.740
 full 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:44.640
 look forward 23 who so 123456 cash register full 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.599
 I am happy 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.599
 Now we close the patient
