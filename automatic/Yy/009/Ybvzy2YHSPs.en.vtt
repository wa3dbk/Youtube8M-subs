on you don't necessarily have to go that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.319 
on you don't necessarily have to go that
length<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:52.700> certainly<00:01:53.700> wash<00:01:54.060> your

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
length but you can certainly wash your

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.690 
length but you can certainly wash your
hands<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> glove

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
hands if you don't want to use a glove

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.990 
hands if you don't want to use a glove
you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:57.090> use<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.540> q-tips<00:01:58.460> cotton<00:01:59.460> swabs<00:01:59.759> and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you can use like q-tips cotton swabs and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.850 
you can use like q-tips cotton swabs and
put<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.930> basically<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.590> get<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
put it on but basically you get the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.090 
put it on but basically you get the
right<00:02:02.100> idea<00:02:02.130> I'm<00:02:02.820> gonna<00:02:02.939> put<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> glue<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:04.100> my

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
right idea I'm gonna put the glue on my

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.930 
right idea I'm gonna put the glue on my
nose<00:02:05.360> alright<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.619> using<00:02:07.799> I'm<00:02:08.280> using<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
nose alright and I'm using I'm using the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.020 
nose alright and I'm using I'm using the
webcam<00:02:09.629> as<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> mirror<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
webcam as a mirror here so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.330 
webcam as a mirror here so
and<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.170> don't<00:02:13.320> really<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.770> load<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.220> on

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and you don't really want to load it on

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.820 
and you don't really want to load it on
you<00:02:14.520> actually<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.300> want<00:02:15.570> kind<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.080> a

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
you actually just want kind of a a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.600 
you actually just want kind of a a
thinner<00:02:17.610> coat<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.660> get<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.710> area<00:02:20.010> under

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
thinner coat to it get this area under

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.280 
thinner coat to it get this area under
the<00:02:20.730> nose<00:02:20.910> there<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.870> virtually

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the nose there that is virtually

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.100 
the nose there that is virtually
impossible<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:23.100> get<00:02:23.820> blackheads<00:02:24.360> out<00:02:24.600> of<00:02:24.930> with

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
impossible to get blackheads out of with

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.930 
impossible to get blackheads out of with
the<00:02:25.200> extractor<00:02:25.710> at<00:02:25.860> least<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.550> know<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
the extractor at least you know do a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.690 
the extractor at least you know do a
complete<00:02:27.600> job<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.310> you're<00:02:29.490> putting

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
complete job of it and you're putting

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.730 
complete job of it and you're putting
this<00:02:29.880> all<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.660> your<00:02:30.959> nose<00:02:31.580> okay<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:34.350> best<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
this all on your nose okay it's best you

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.270 
this all on your nose okay it's best you
can

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
can

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.790 
can
boom<00:02:35.880> boom<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.660> little<00:02:37.500> bit<00:02:37.590> more<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.920> there<00:02:39.800> you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
boom boom a little bit more in there you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.949 
boom boom a little bit more in there you
know<00:02:40.920> technical<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:41.550> could<00:02:42.030> do<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.630> rest<00:02:42.810> of

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
know technical you could do the rest of

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.910 
know technical you could do the rest of
your<00:02:43.080> face<00:02:43.260> like<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:44.270> all<00:02:45.270> right<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:46.620> on

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
your face like that all right so it's on

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.240 
your face like that all right so it's on
my<00:02:47.160> nose<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:49.380> gonna<00:02:49.500> give<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.709> about<00:02:49.830> five

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
my nose and I'm gonna give it about five

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.340 
my nose and I'm gonna give it about five
or<00:02:50.459> ten<00:02:50.640> minutes<00:02:51.000> on<00:02:51.180> there<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.780> during<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
or ten minutes on there and during that

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.930 
or ten minutes on there and during that
period<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.800> time<00:02:52.890> two<00:02:53.370> things<00:02:53.700> will<00:02:53.910> happen

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
period of time two things will happen

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.290 
period of time two things will happen
the<00:02:54.780> blackheads<00:02:55.440> will<00:02:55.800> actually<00:02:56.340> seemingly

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
the blackheads will actually seemingly

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.780 
the blackheads will actually seemingly
come<00:02:57.900> through<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.320> surface<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.100> little<00:02:59.459> bit

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
come through the surface a little bit

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.150 
come through the surface a little bit
okay<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.989> similar<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.530> actually<00:03:02.010> how<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
okay it is similar to actually how the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.940 
okay it is similar to actually how the
aesthetic<00:03:02.760> LayCool<00:03:03.480> pulls<00:03:03.930> them<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.620> don't

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
aesthetic LayCool pulls them I don't

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.130 
aesthetic LayCool pulls them I don't
know<00:03:05.130> exactly<00:03:05.280> what<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.940> effect<00:03:06.270> is<00:03:06.480> whether

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
know exactly what the effect is whether

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.780 
know exactly what the effect is whether
this<00:03:07.350> it's<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.830> skin<00:03:08.100> going<00:03:08.280> down<00:03:08.550> with<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
this it's the skin going down with the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.490 
this it's the skin going down with the
black<00:03:08.970> gets<00:03:09.209> coming<00:03:09.510> up<00:03:09.630> or<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.810> combination<00:03:10.170> of

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
black gets coming up or a combination of

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.140 
black gets coming up or a combination of
both<00:03:10.680> but<00:03:11.100> they<00:03:11.220> will<00:03:11.370> become<00:03:11.640> more<00:03:11.670> visible

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
both but they will become more visible

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150 
both but they will become more visible
that's<00:03:12.810> good<00:03:13.260> because<00:03:13.500> we're<00:03:13.800> gonna<00:03:13.890> take

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
that's good because we're gonna take

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.710 
that's good because we're gonna take
them<00:03:14.370> off<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> second<00:03:15.570> thing<00:03:15.660> that

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
them off and the second thing that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.550 
them off and the second thing that
happens<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.650> glue<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.910> white

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
happens is the glue that is white

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.020 
happens is the glue that is white
currently<00:03:20.660> will<00:03:21.660> turn<00:03:21.870> clear<00:03:22.340> okay<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.610> if

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
currently will turn clear okay and if

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.060 
currently will turn clear okay and if
you've<00:03:24.150> ever<00:03:24.239> had<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:24.600> Elmer's<00:03:25.380> glue<00:03:25.650> school

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you've ever had just Elmer's glue school

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.160 
you've ever had just Elmer's glue school

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
glue on your fingers you can just kind

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.500 
glue on your fingers you can just kind
of<00:03:28.230> rub<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.560> off<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.160> flakes<00:03:29.549> right<00:03:30.000> so

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
of rub it off and it flakes right so

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.600 
of rub it off and it flakes right so
that's<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:30.989> we're<00:03:31.140> looking<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.310> got

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
been pretty clear I started these

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.259

one<00:05:17.960> tonight<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.650> think<00:05:19.160> this<00:05:19.730> works<00:05:19.970> pretty

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
one tonight I think this works pretty

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.500 
one tonight I think this works pretty
well<00:05:20.530> okay<00:05:21.530> try<00:05:22.220> your<00:05:22.370> best<00:05:22.580> with<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.000> black

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
well okay try your best with the black

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.750 
well okay try your best with the black
head<00:05:24.290> extractor<00:05:24.920> trying<00:05:25.190> to<00:05:25.280> get<00:05:25.400> them<00:05:25.520> out

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
head extractor trying to get them out

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.200 
head extractor trying to get them out
open<00:05:26.600> pores<00:05:26.840> obviously<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:28.190> then<00:05:28.430> these<00:05:28.700> seem

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
open pores obviously and then these seem

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.780 
open pores obviously and then these seem
to<00:05:29.420> be<00:05:29.630> like<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.140> said<00:05:30.290> okay<00:05:30.890> it's<00:05:31.130> not<00:05:31.280> as<00:05:31.430> good

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
to be like I said okay it's not as good

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.540 
to be like I said okay it's not as good
as<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.480> other<00:05:32.690> treatment<00:05:33.320> well<00:05:33.650> because<00:05:34.190> you

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
as the other treatment well because you

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.650 
as the other treatment well because you
know<00:05:34.640> it's<00:05:34.820> just<00:05:34.970> harder<00:05:35.390> to<00:05:35.420> get<00:05:35.570> the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
know it's just harder to get the

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.720 
know it's just harder to get the
blackheads<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.200> every<00:05:36.410> nose<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.950> would<00:05:37.520> say

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
blackheads that every nose I would say

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.480 
blackheads that every nose I would say
YouTube<00:05:38.390> application<00:05:38.570> of<00:05:39.200> these<00:05:39.490> probably

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
YouTube application of these probably

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.270 
YouTube application of these probably
removes<00:05:41.060> about<00:05:41.690> 50%<00:05:42.590> of<00:05:42.620> your<00:05:42.740> blackheads

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
removes about 50% of your blackheads

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.400 
removes about 50% of your blackheads
okay<00:05:43.700> so<00:05:43.760> you<00:05:44.540> know<00:05:44.630> you're<00:05:44.750> gonna<00:05:44.840> need<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.200> do

ways to do this let us know I guess I
had<00:06:18.110> this<00:06:18.200> idea<00:06:18.380> was<00:06:18.860> playing<00:06:19.100> around<00:06:19.250> with

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
had this idea was playing around with

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400 
had this idea was playing around with
like<00:06:19.520> putting<00:06:19.790> masking<00:06:20.360> tape<00:06:20.600> over<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:20.990> so<00:06:21.200> the

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
like putting masking tape over it so the

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.469 
like putting masking tape over it so the
glue<00:06:21.590> harden<00:06:22.130> right<00:06:22.340> and<00:06:22.640> I<00:06:23.240> would<00:06:23.360> put

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
glue harden right and I would put

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.240 
glue harden right and I would put
masking<00:06:24.020> tape<00:06:24.169> over<00:06:24.290> the<00:06:24.470> glue<00:06:24.680> for<00:06:25.010> a<00:06:25.040> few

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
masking tape over the glue for a few

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.409 
masking tape over the glue for a few
minutes<00:06:25.550> like<00:06:25.669> push<00:06:25.850> it<00:06:25.970> down<00:06:26.120> in<00:06:26.270> there

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
minutes like push it down in there

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.030 
minutes like push it down in there
and<00:06:26.570> then<00:06:26.930> tear<00:06:27.140> it<00:06:27.169> off<00:06:27.290> like<00:06:27.500> that<00:06:27.530> I<00:06:27.860> don't

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
and then tear it off like that I don't

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.060 
and then tear it off like that I don't
know<00:06:28.250> that<00:06:28.640> that<00:06:28.729> made<00:06:28.940> a<00:06:28.970> difference<00:06:29.440> I<00:06:30.440> kind

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
know that that made a difference I kind

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.770 
know that that made a difference I kind
of<00:06:31.100> like<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.580> fact<00:06:31.850> when<00:06:32.030> it<00:06:32.120> comes<00:06:32.330> off<00:06:32.540> is

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780
