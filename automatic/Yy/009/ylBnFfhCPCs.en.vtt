whites<00:00:21.119> now<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> reason<00:00:22.079> why<00:00:22.169> I<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> is

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
whites now the reason why I did that is

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.159 
whites now the reason why I did that is
as<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.150> there's<00:00:24.360> Gemma<00:00:24.750> legs<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
as you can see there's Gemma legs and

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.109 
as you can see there's Gemma legs and
then<00:00:25.259> large<00:00:25.710> eggs<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.640> reason<00:00:26.820> why<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> did

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
then large eggs the reason why I did

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.600 
then large eggs the reason why I did
that<00:00:27.270> is<00:00:27.360> because<00:00:27.649> once<00:00:28.649> again<00:00:28.860> two<00:00:29.250> weeks<00:00:29.279> out

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
that is because once again two weeks out

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.490 
that is because once again two weeks out

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
responds so we I decided to use one

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.069 
responds so we I decided to use one
large<00:00:56.249> egg<00:00:56.609> instead<00:00:56.999> of<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.269> a<00:00:57.329> jumbo<00:00:57.960> egg

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
large egg instead of just a jumbo egg

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.389 
large egg instead of just a jumbo egg
like<00:00:58.319> the<00:00:58.440> rest<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:58.739> egg<00:00:58.859> whites<00:00:58.890> one

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
like the rest of the egg whites one

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.020 
like the rest of the egg whites one
large<00:00:59.699> egg<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.399> measured<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.819> be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
large egg because it measured out to be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.230 
large egg because it measured out to be
and<00:01:03.389> measured<00:01:04.050> out<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.470> fit<00:01:04.739> my<00:01:04.890> macros<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.610> my

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and measured out to fit my macros and my

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.410 
and measured out to fit my macros and my
caloric<00:01:06.690> intake<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.290> lot<00:01:07.530> better<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.120> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
caloric intake a lot better so with a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
caloric intake a lot better so with a
whole<00:01:10.110> egg<00:01:10.320> you're<00:01:10.530> getting<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.100> extra<00:01:11.430> fats

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
whole egg you're getting some extra fats

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
whole egg you're getting some extra fats
the<00:01:12.120> fats<00:01:12.540> aren't<00:01:12.870> entirely<00:01:13.530> bad<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.100> when

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the fats aren't entirely bad but when

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.330 
the fats aren't entirely bad but when
you're<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.760> close<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.570> show<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:17.160> know<00:01:17.190> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you're this close to a show you know you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
you're this close to a show you know you
got<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> start<00:01:17.820> cutting<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.660> eventually

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
got to start cutting down so eventually

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.160

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I will be down to absolutely no egg

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.660 
I will be down to absolutely no egg

did you know things such as Farmar curls

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.170 
did you know things such as Farmar curls
and<00:02:10.619> sled<00:02:10.920> pushes<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.489> right<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:12.000> really

and sled pushes but right it really

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.790 
and sled pushes but right it really
isn't<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.629> complicated<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.349> guys<00:02:13.500> it's

to is a comment made on my last video in
the<00:02:28.950> comment<00:02:29.340> basically<00:02:29.670> refer<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.390> genetics

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the comment basically refer to genetics

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.130 
the comment basically refer to genetics
and<00:02:31.140> bodybuilding<00:02:32.000> with<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> exception<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.900> a

you<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.230> build<00:02:38.040> muscle<00:02:38.569> you<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> ability

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
you to build muscle you have the ability

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.250 
you to build muscle you have the ability
to<00:02:40.260> build<00:02:40.530> muscle<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:41.599> you<00:02:42.599> may<00:02:42.750> not<00:02:42.989> build

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
to build muscle then you may not build

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.910 
to build muscle then you may not build
it<00:02:43.380> as<00:02:43.560> fast<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.640> next<00:02:44.880> guy<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.709> your<00:02:46.709> body

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it as fast as the next guy and your body

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.180 
it as fast as the next guy and your body
will<00:02:47.160> not<00:02:47.400> allow<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.000> become<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.620> go

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
will not allow you to become you know go

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400 
will not allow you to become you know go
past<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.580> certain<00:02:50.970> size<00:02:51.269> based<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.290> your

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
past a certain size based on your

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.530 
past a certain size based on your
genetics<00:02:53.510> naturally<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.690> course<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:56.540> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
genetics naturally of course but you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.630 
genetics naturally of course but you

have the ability to build muscle it's a

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.699 
have the ability to build muscle it's a
it<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.150> really<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:01.019> think<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.500> poor

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
it I really do think that it's a poor

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.949 
it I really do think that it's a poor
excuse<00:03:02.069> for<00:03:02.100> somebody<00:03:02.549> to<00:03:02.610> say<00:03:02.790> I'm<00:03:03.090> not

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
excuse for somebody to say I'm not

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.240 
excuse for somebody to say I'm not
getting<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.350> results<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.769> soon<00:03:04.980> because<00:03:05.190> I

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
getting the results on soon because I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.280 
getting the results on soon because I
have<00:03:05.340> bad<00:03:05.610> genetics<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.630> know<00:03:06.660> well<00:03:06.870> let<00:03:07.200> me

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
have bad genetics you know well let me

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.900 
have bad genetics you know well let me
tell<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.470> something<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:07.830> was<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.190> guy<00:03:08.370> two

know my genetics won't you know I burned

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.850 
know my genetics won't you know I burned
too<00:03:15.720> fast<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.140> my<00:03:16.260> body's<00:03:16.500> gonna<00:03:16.650> want<00:03:16.799> to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
too fast so my body's gonna want to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.009 
too fast so my body's gonna want to
store<00:03:17.069> fat<00:03:17.280> no<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.790> was<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> horrible<00:03:18.450> excuse

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019

learn<00:03:21.840> more<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> science<00:03:22.650> about<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:23.040> and

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
learn more of the science about it and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.479 
learn more of the science about it and
each<00:03:23.910> year<00:03:24.299> my<00:03:25.260> dieting<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.890> training<00:03:26.310> just

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
each year my dieting and training just

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.539 
each year my dieting and training just
improved<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.239> saw<00:03:27.510> better<00:03:28.290> results<00:03:28.859> now<00:03:29.280> am

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.789 
improved and I saw better results now am
I<00:03:29.700> at<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.850> stage<00:03:30.180> where<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.420> want<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.720> be<00:03:30.870> no<00:03:31.320> am

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
I at the stage where I want to be no am

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.130 
I at the stage where I want to be no am
I<00:03:31.920> ever<00:03:32.010> gonna<00:03:32.160> get<00:03:32.400> there<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.790> don't<00:03:32.850> know<00:03:33.239> see

I ever gonna get there I don't know see
that's<00:03:34.620> where<00:03:34.890> genetics<00:03:35.250> will<00:03:35.340> come<00:03:35.519> into

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
that's where genetics will come into

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.910 
that's where genetics will come into
play<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.150> will<00:03:36.570> always<00:03:36.780> remain<00:03:37.350> natural<00:03:37.590> you
