00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:10.809
 and today we are going to make some cookies 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:13.419
 guava art and let's start 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.120
 making the pot for the cookies and 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:19.010
 We're going to need butter flour 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:24.290
 cream cheese and vanilla 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.990
 let's mix the butter very well 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.670
 and the cream cheese I did it in a 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.650
 processor but you can do it 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.080
 by hand remember that all 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.370
 ingredients I leave here below 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.370
 the information box 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.130
 well then we mix until I'm 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.250
 well incorporated after that we added 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:50.040
 the flour and the vanilla and we go back to 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.900

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.900

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.530
 and ready as long as our dough is well 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:19.240
 well mixed nothing else we put a 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.670
 little bit of flour so it does not stick 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 we're going to wrap that in paper 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.600
 plastic 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.740

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.060
 this is going to be saved in the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.060
 refrigerator for one hour 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.420
 since the time has passed we take them out 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.140
 of the refrigerator and we're going to start it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.810
 spread with a roller we put a 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.390
 little bit of flour work of the dough 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.490
 so that it is not going to stick and also a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.450
 little bit up so it does not stick 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.450
 to the roller 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.500

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.800
 when we have the mass already well 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.340
 extended with the help of a cutter 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.140

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.360
 doing our little circles in all the 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.850
 mass that mass that we have left can be 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.330

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.380

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.960

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.040

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.819
 around the cookie I did it with 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.510

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.510
 with your finger 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.690
 since we finish centering the cookie 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.200

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.870
 we join the center and with each of the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.150
 cookies we are going to repeat the same 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.560
 process 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.909

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.909
 as seen in the image 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:16.039
 once we have all of our 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:21.150

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:24.360
 15 minutes 2 and 15 minutes and then the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.669
