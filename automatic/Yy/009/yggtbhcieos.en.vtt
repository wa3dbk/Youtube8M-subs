side<00:02:39.370> there's<00:02:39.640> little<00:02:39.940> hash<00:02:40.150> marks<00:02:40.599> each<00:02:41.080> one

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
side there's little hash marks each one

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.770 
side there's little hash marks each one
of<00:02:41.500> those<00:02:41.620> small<00:02:41.980> hash<00:02:42.400> marks<00:02:42.849> is<00:02:43.030> two<00:02:43.239> points

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
of those small hash marks is two points

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.589 
of those small hash marks is two points
the<00:02:44.590> large<00:02:45.069> broad<00:02:45.489> line<00:02:45.849> underneath<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
the large broad line underneath the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.190 
the large broad line underneath the
number<00:02:46.870> itself<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:48.430> whole<00:02:48.940> number<00:02:49.390> or<00:02:49.569> in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
number itself is the whole number or in

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.430 
number itself is the whole number or in
this<00:02:50.440> case<00:02:50.680> 40<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.750> those<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.050> can<00:02:53.260> see

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
this case 40 and those so you can see

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.710 
this case 40 and those so you can see
our<00:02:53.590> set<00:02:53.860> up<00:02:54.010> intended<00:02:54.670> 10<00:02:55.150> knot<00:02:55.420> point

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
our set up intended 10 knot point

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.199 
our set up intended 10 knot point
increments<00:02:56.319> so<00:02:56.920> what<00:02:57.430> we're<00:02:57.580> looking<00:02:57.910> at<00:02:58.000> is

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
increments so what we're looking at is

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.900 
increments so what we're looking at is
40<00:02:58.690> which<00:02:59.410> is<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.709> black<00:02:59.920> line<00:02:59.950> underneath

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
40 which is the black line underneath

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.610 
40 which is the black line underneath
the<00:03:01.030> 40<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.540> then<00:03:02.290> we're<00:03:03.420> sitting<00:03:04.420> right<00:03:05.140> at

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
the 40 and then we're sitting right at

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.370 
the 40 and then we're sitting right at
that<00:03:05.830> right<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.190> between<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:07.299> broad<00:03:07.630> line<00:03:07.900> and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
that right in between the broad line and

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.440 
that right in between the broad line and
the<00:03:08.530> first<00:03:08.769> hash<00:03:09.010> mark<00:03:09.340> which<00:03:09.549> would<00:03:09.970> make<00:03:10.239> us

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
the first hash mark which would make us

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.130 
the first hash mark which would make us
a<00:03:10.630> 41<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:12.549> completes<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.150> test<00:03:13.360> from<00:03:13.930> that

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
a 41 that completes the test from that

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.830 
a 41 that completes the test from that
point<00:03:14.410> we<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.709> simply<00:03:15.280> back<00:03:15.580> off<00:03:15.849> and<00:03:16.420> remove

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
point we can simply back off and remove

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.630 
point we can simply back off and remove
the<00:03:16.989> part<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.500> we're<00:03:18.010> ready<00:03:18.190> for<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.459> next

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
the part and we're ready for the next

00:03:18.640 --> 00:04:18.259 
the part and we're ready for the next
test
