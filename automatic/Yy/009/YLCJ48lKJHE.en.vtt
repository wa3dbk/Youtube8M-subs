00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
into eight counts so you know for

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:30.870 
into eight counts so you know for
instance<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.130> have<00:01:30.159> this<00:01:30.430> song<00:01:30.640> right<00:01:30.850> here

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
instance you have this song right here

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.090 
instance you have this song right here
six<00:01:31.810> seven<00:01:32.649> eight<00:01:32.920> one<00:01:33.610> two<00:01:33.970> three<00:01:34.180> four<00:01:35.100> five

six seven eight one two three four five
six<00:01:36.729> seven<00:01:37.569> eight<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.679> keeps

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
six seven eight and it just keeps

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.399 
six seven eight and it just keeps
looping<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.399> looping<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.330> basically<00:01:40.750> as<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.929> DJ
