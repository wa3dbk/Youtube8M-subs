00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
believe there were twenty five dollars I

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.929 
believe there were twenty five dollars I
put<00:00:25.230> polycarbonate<00:00:25.890> lenses<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.460> them<00:00:26.609> which

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
put polycarbonate lenses in them which

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.790 
put polycarbonate lenses in them which
there<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> better<00:00:27.599> lenses<00:00:28.109> thinner<00:00:28.410> lighter

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.310 
there the better lenses thinner lighter
and<00:00:29.130> they<00:00:29.640> don't<00:00:29.880> break<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.779> extra<00:00:31.140> for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and they don't break the extra for

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.650 
and they don't break the extra for
polycarbonate<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.730> eight<00:00:32.969> dollars<00:00:33.390> and
