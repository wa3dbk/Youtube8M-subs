00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello people and rushing comes to one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:10.290
 Little trick how to brake pads 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.200
 installs changes or stops too 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.200
 I can already see mine here 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.170
 First you take a suitable one 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.070
 wrench and solves these 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.949
 screw which has the brake pads 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 Hold on that you see that already 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:39.829
 it unscrews many do you have with 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.579
 security brace under johannes calls 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.020
 right here as a speaker 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.899
 We also solve it, I have it 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.180
 I did not hear it, he writes 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.030
 just pull that off and then pull the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.120
 Screw on out there you have that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.949
 solved then he lives to one 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.539
 third from the interim storage in those 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.260
 pull out 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:14.760
 Here you have them here in such a way 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 clip attached so they will have that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:25.650
 they are quite black in some 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:28.130
 put black and if now if you 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.820
 now the german ones 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.060
 then she would have to take along 24 grind 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.119
 he sees the already opened 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.960
 my glazed because of that , however, must 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.420
 buy new ones 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.850
 so it 'll just go down with it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.649
 the black is just gone then 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 could put it back in power 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:58.259
 just after that that will be the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:01.049
 brace back on the occupied can 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.219
 So put it together and push it 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.219
 just go back to the 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.320
 bracket then I already have my new one 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.770
 job 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.520
 I also have an unboxing 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.520
 due to the description 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:48.220
 I think that's jumping is here 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.220
 the spring kawano behind the packing 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.570
 packaging instructions and the cover stop 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.829
 in the rush, so both are not out 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.709
 I can not avoid that 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:23.470
 I wish he had that , I have to 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:28.409
 Look again like that applies so now 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:52.170
 we both have burners out there 12 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:04:05.680
 and now the new clothes back here 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:07.200
 in the in the brake line mostly the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:15.060
 Sun 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.060
 then he takes me screw again 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.370
 wrench again 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:39.139
 then it looks again with a 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.139
 hand, it is really difficult 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.510
 Now I have one more important thing 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.660
 to say when we have the braking distances 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:09.410
 has outside and then presses the brake 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.480
 then it just does not have then yours 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.610
 whole brake is apart again 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.610
 pull 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.900
 that 's very elaborate because of that 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:30.920
 but do not try to make me 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:37.270
 Finally, you see in the screw 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:41.350
 the end of the end is the last one 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:48.830
 what cold altintop 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:06:00.230
 there is an extra slot you push 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:06:06.650
 then your spring just like that 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:13.040
 Everything is right for the blast 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:16.070
 it is for that because that here in the 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.530
 Screw should go out that she 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.150
 not the same house is so if you 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.150
 appearances are not revealed and 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.070
 that was my video now 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.520
 I hope you enjoyed it until the 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.520
 next time
