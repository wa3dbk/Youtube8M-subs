portion<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:55.570> what<00:01:55.750> I'm<00:01:55.869> gonna<00:01:55.990> do<00:01:56.260> is<00:01:56.410> I'm

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
portion now what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.200 
portion now what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.830> really<00:01:57.160> simple<00:01:57.580> fishtail

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
going to do a really simple fishtail

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.180 
going to do a really simple fishtail
braid<00:01:58.510> throughout<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.229> whole<00:01:59.410> rest<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.920> the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
braid throughout the whole rest of the

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.719 
braid throughout the whole rest of the
hair<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.610> a<00:02:01.000> fishtail<00:02:01.600> braid<00:02:01.660> seems

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
hair and a fishtail braid seems

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.670 
hair and a fishtail braid seems
confusing<00:02:03.729> but<00:02:04.119> it's<00:02:04.270> really<00:02:04.630> quite<00:02:04.990> simple

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
confusing but it's really quite simple

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.219 
confusing but it's really quite simple
so<00:02:06.340> all<00:02:06.610> that<00:02:06.820> it<00:02:06.940> is<00:02:07.090> is<00:02:07.300> it's<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.570> two<00:02:07.810> strand

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
so all that it is is it's a two strand

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.770 
so all that it is is it's a two strand
braid<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:09.160> you're<00:02:09.970> gonna<00:02:10.090> take<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.450> little

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
braid and you're gonna take a little

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.730 
braid and you're gonna take a little
tiny<00:02:11.080> section<00:02:11.380> from<00:02:11.980> one<00:02:12.280> side<00:02:13.320> from<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.530> back

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
tiny section from one side from the back

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.530 
tiny section from one side from the back
of<00:02:14.950> one<00:02:15.160> side<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.790> you're<00:02:15.880> going<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.030> cross<00:02:16.330> it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
of one side and you're going to cross it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.100 
of one side and you're going to cross it
over<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:17.170> join<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.340> other<00:02:18.850> side<00:02:19.209> so

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
over and join it to the other side so

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.860 
over and join it to the other side so
I'm<00:02:20.170> taking<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.590> piece<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> left<00:02:21.870> tiny

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
I'm taking this piece on the left tiny

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.600 
I'm taking this piece on the left tiny
little<00:02:23.050> piece<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.530> I'm<00:02:23.590> crossing<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.100> over<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
little piece and I'm crossing it over to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.370 
little piece and I'm crossing it over to
the<00:02:24.730> other<00:02:24.880> side<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.020> continue

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the other side and you just continue

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.830 
the other side and you just continue
this<00:02:26.680> back<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.160> forth<00:02:27.220> pattern<00:02:27.850> all<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.390> way

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
this back and forth pattern all the way

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.440 
this back and forth pattern all the way
down<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.410> hair<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:30.760> want<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.060> keep<00:02:31.239> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
down the hair you want to keep the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.110 
down the hair you want to keep the
fishtail<00:02:31.930> really<00:02:32.500> tight<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.220> go<00:02:33.400> because

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
fishtail really tight as you go because

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.150 
fishtail really tight as you go because
naturally<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:34.930> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.140> loosen<00:02:35.530> up<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:35.980> now

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
naturally it's going to loosen up so now

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.250 
naturally it's going to loosen up so now
I'm<00:02:36.370> about<00:02:36.640> four<00:02:37.030> strands<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.840> can<00:02:38.019> see

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
I'm about four strands and you can see

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.500 
I'm about four strands and you can see
the<00:02:38.380> shape<00:02:38.620> already<00:02:38.890> taking<00:02:39.459> place<00:02:39.489> keep<00:02:40.330> it

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
the shape already taking place keep it

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.650 
the shape already taking place keep it
really<00:02:40.840> tight<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:41.890> keep<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.190> tight<00:02:42.370> by

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
really tight you just keep it tight by

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.540 
really tight you just keep it tight by
tugging<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:43.959> both<00:02:44.170> sides<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:45.100> nice<00:02:45.340> thing

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
tugging up on both sides the nice thing

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.020 
tugging up on both sides the nice thing
about<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.850> fishtail<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.760> actually

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
about the fishtail is that it actually

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.540 
about the fishtail is that it actually
braids<00:02:49.630> both<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.680> front<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.190> back<00:02:51.400> of

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
braids both the front and the back of

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.030 
braids both the front and the back of
the<00:02:51.820> hair<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.019> when<00:02:53.170> we<00:02:53.410> go<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.530> roll<00:02:53.860> this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
the hair and so when we go to roll this

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.530 
the hair and so when we go to roll this
into<00:02:54.280> our<00:02:54.489> shape<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.209> create<00:02:55.480> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
into our shape it's going to create a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.440 
into our shape it's going to create a
really<00:02:55.810> beautiful<00:02:56.470> shape<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:57.700> looked<00:02:58.300> like

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
really beautiful shape it looked like

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.050 
really beautiful shape it looked like
you<00:02:58.600> did<00:02:58.780> lots<00:02:59.110> of<00:02:59.290> fancy<00:02:59.590> pin<00:03:00.040> work<00:03:00.280> when<00:03:00.910> you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
you did lots of fancy pin work when you

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.420 
you did lots of fancy pin work when you
really<00:03:01.390> don't<00:03:01.480> have<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:02.010> now<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.280> we're

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
really don't have to now that we're

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.520 
really don't have to now that we're
almost<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.180> end<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.750> minister<00:03:05.140> doing<00:03:05.440> a

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
almost to the end a minister doing a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.340 
almost to the end a minister doing a
little<00:03:05.769> bigger<00:03:06.400> sections<00:03:07.090> here<00:03:07.660> now<00:03:08.080> what<00:03:08.230> we

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
little bigger sections here now what we

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.690 
little bigger sections here now what we
want<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.620> do<00:03:08.739> from<00:03:08.860> here<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.340> want<00:03:09.519> to<00:03:09.580> make

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
want to do from here is we want to make

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.100 
want to do from here is we want to make
it<00:03:09.850> fuller<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.420> wider<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:10.900> I'm<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:10.989> to

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
it fuller and wider so I'm going to

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.479 
it fuller and wider so I'm going to
start<00:03:11.320> up<00:03:11.410> at<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.560> top<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.130> I'm<00:03:12.190> just<00:03:12.340> gonna

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
start up at the top and I'm just gonna

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.370 
start up at the top and I'm just gonna
pull<00:03:12.820> on<00:03:13.060> either<00:03:13.299> side<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.019> braid

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
pull on either side of the braid

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.650 
pull on either side of the braid
so<00:03:16.010> that's<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.400> braid<00:03:16.580> all<00:03:16.820> flattened<00:03:17.570> out

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
so that's the braid all flattened out

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.440 
so that's the braid all flattened out
and<00:03:17.720> full<00:03:18.460> you<00:03:19.460> can<00:03:19.610> do<00:03:19.730> a<00:03:19.760> couple<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.270> things

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
and full you can do a couple of things

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.440 
and full you can do a couple of things
with<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.740> can<00:03:21.950> simply<00:03:22.460> pull<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.090> back

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
with it you can simply pull it back

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.740 
with it you can simply pull it back
halfway<00:03:24.350> through<00:03:24.910> your<00:03:25.910> Topsy<00:03:26.300> tail<00:03:26.480> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
halfway through your Topsy tail and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.200 
halfway through your Topsy tail and
leave<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.050> like<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:28.580> gonna<00:03:28.730> actually

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
leave it like that I'm gonna actually

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.570 
leave it like that I'm gonna actually
twist<00:03:29.960> it<00:03:30.140> around<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.980> I'm<00:03:31.070> going<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.280> take<00:03:31.400> my
