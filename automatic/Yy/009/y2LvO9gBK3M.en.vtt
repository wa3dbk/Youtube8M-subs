00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.010
 we found rolo coaster this game 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.230
 is father and I think it is one of the most 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.520
 known in ios or and is completely 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.550

 good you have to do roller coasters 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.190
 as I'm telling you the game is very 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.320
 well accomplished of much strategy to the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.840
 principle is very easy but conforming 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.809
 you are advancing is coming from a lot 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.500
 a lot of strategy and take advantage of the day 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:52.490
 today is completely free 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:57.470
 We found the doors will do 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:00.860
 an application between a biography and a 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.620
 musical application they will give you the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.190
 biography of editors but also you 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.920
 they are going to give songs they are going to give you the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.200
 songs no songs biography is 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.510
 father if you are a rock aficionado 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.900
 You may like this application very much 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:21.100
 take full advantage of the day of 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.979
 today we also find there parking 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:29.600
 Well, I'll tell you quickly with this 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.900
 You will be able to as I explain it to you 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.920
 they try to make the interactive 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.550
 application but look are you going to be able 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.080
 control your time to some extent 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:50.950
 it's kind of an agenda but it's also 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.810
 a kind of quote of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.719
 that's how I got the name of administration 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.390
 of finance goes out they try to do very 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:04.479
 very very interactive but this is not 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.610
 ends up being at the end of accounts so 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.429
 good because what they want to do is 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.929
 do it like a game comes out but at the end 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.150
 of accounts because I think that is not the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.890
 joke of an application of this type what 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.920
 what you want is to optimize time and then 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.650
 playing a little bit because it's kind of weird 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.319
 it comes out but good try it to the best you 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.340
 Like maybe we do not find it too 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.849
 to you be maker the application is good 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.819
 what is good about in the same way 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:37.090
 you have is like this is a game you have to go 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.060
 seeing what is most used in 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.030
 certain time or you what do you use in 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.370
 determined time they will tell you 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:52.209
 I do not know at 10 o'clock in the morning like this 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.540
 example is going to help you to have 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.340
 the right accessories so you do not get 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.680
 burn the sun in case of changes in the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.440
 street but you do it the style of 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.080
 games also come out I do not know for example 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.720
 here it shows us that at 14 in the afternoon 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.670
 The sun is quite strong and you 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.400
 recommend to occupy this if you click 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.750
 in one of the icons sends you a 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.070
 kind of game but what you do not 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.989
 he wants is a game, what you want is 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.300
 know what can cover you for example 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.790
 here at 347 in the afternoon we see and below 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.070
 at level 8 but it is also strong and you 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.100
 is going to give you the options that you have for 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.090
 that you can go outside without getting burned 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.700
 We both found a good pdf provider 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.010
 that is going to be going to be able to edit you're going to 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.890
 to be able to mark you will have a kind of 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.319
 notebook on your device ios good 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.970
 to make more accurate on your ipad the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.830
 iphone well you can not do this 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.690
 because the screen is quite small 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.400
 but you're also going to be able to edit 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.720
 be able to mark but no longer in the form of 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.430
 notebook if it's not going to be in a 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.230
 normal in the air I liked quite 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.960
 because it strikes you in a kind of 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.900
 notebook and good take advantage friends is 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.350
 completely free today 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.470
 we found poch 2 already had them 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.770
 brought this game Wednesday still free 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.780
 incredible graphics truly the only 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.630
 I tell you, be careful when it comes to 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.420
 download it since it weighs 400 42 megabytes 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.299
 almost 500 megabytes and it's been something 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.690
 heavy and finally we find 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.840
 multiple bold what is this good your 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.820
 name of us everything is pinball goes out I do not 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.430
 I'm such a fan of primor indeed 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.830
 I'm honest I get bored this 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.900
 I have not downloaded it but good 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.030
 maybe you love pit bulls and 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.620
 well here is many tell me why 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.450
 you recommend games that you do not like 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.490
 and I do not know what I said in other videos 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.950
 I recommend them because we are not all 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.650
 equal to the best to me the game does not 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.020
 I hate the game but how about you 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.600
 you love what if you just 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.820
 you tell me that game is the best because 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.200
 you like it comes out is that you go 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.750
 testing and as well 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.800

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.360
