 Then she asked me if I eat. 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.740
 the inspection was working as it worked 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.730
 with respect to security at last sent 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.800
 some questions 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.930
 I'll answer that video so it was 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.879
 Thank you for your question on the theme of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.149
 video and let's ask her questions is so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.430
 Well the first question is what it would take 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.890
 with regards to backpack and everything else 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.140
 I always carry a backpack with some 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.070
 things sort of jokers so for example is 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.379
 one blouse over a T-shirt is finally 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.730
 need you go a splash on toys 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.160
 what moves on 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.620
 if you need to change your wrong side 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.960
 Anything at all, in order to have this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.680
 flexibility of clothes I always 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.720
 I take 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.760
 Usually, it's going to be hot during 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.510
 the day but the night cools so I know 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.340
 has a blouse in there is sunscreen 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.259
 by the time you left the house with filter 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 Solar I always carry in the bag to go 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.060
 reinforcing during the day but I am 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.430
 whitest sorrow then who is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.960
 very fast leads to dengue and even 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.090
 avoid the UV rays of the sun more 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.710
 cocoa butter also protect the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 lip and remember take something extra 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.880
 to hold your hair if you lose 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.159
 something like that and stay hairy 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.909
 loose on stage that is not so easy then 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.780
 I always take and then that's what I'm looking for 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.360
 take a gaffe and 600 ml and 1 liter of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.460
 coke already cold and then I 'll have this 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.040
 bottle to go and put water in the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.490
 park and everything else after the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.189
 snack in the middle of a mixed roast or 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.130
 Cold mixed something of the sort and I 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.500
 What I do is put the brother of the snacks when 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.080
 is normally 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.000
 cheese cheese tomato ham was a 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.830
 that I avoid that the ham 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.100
 spoil anything like that for 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.870
 account of the sun and places in each 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.540
 wrapped in paper towels and 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.520
 clock packs for me fat 'no 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.770
 It's okay to leave the game. 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.140
 other paper bags and do not 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.750
 clothes that will return inside the backpack and 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.120
 which is lighter a pack of wafer 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 I want to go in and do not want to eat 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.580
 snack but there a wafer in the queue of a 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.739
 the other's toy feeding and 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.650
 sometimes takes chocolate sometimes not night 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.290
 bis trained talent to speak the name of 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.850
 chocolate brand but raises the floor 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.190
 something like that is packaging of 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.190
 small chocolate then closed 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.260
 anything of the kind is fine and that's it 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.940
 I think it really is more or less 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.130
 that takes you and forms a little in the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.860
 pines station type of thing and such 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.080
 So I guess that 's the next question. 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.650
 sense theft as it is working 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.840
 safety there is already had trawler nor 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.620
 know right then gets through it is so 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.269
 so do not 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.360
 There is a little chill behind 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.280
 plenary session but I particularly never 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.900
 I saw no problem with the 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 security within the park 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 nor in the queue nor ever had anything 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.430
 Car parking problem 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.110
 Nothing inside, so it 's me. 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.780
 I'm lucky or it's really a lot 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.480
 Tranquil for is at least everything I 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.620
 I remember 2003 for nothing that I have 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.540
 adopted at least the next one that clothes 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.950
 dress more comforted by toys 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.739
 and everything else 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.410
 and I twisted my tank top off with nothing 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.940
 from the fall of the fall of the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.820
 type that can give of any type of 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.620
 problem dress or even think and there goes 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.320
 depend on the temperature of the day have been 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.150
 sound as it is today 32 degrees here in 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.400
 Minas Gerais 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.489
 change or shorts something with nothing 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.840
 too short is nothing too thin cloth 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.420
 that can tear any 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.810
 anything toy is a shirt 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.870
 and a pair of jeans shorts or some hurt 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:16.560
 either it is more resistant or in leg pants 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.790
 too often 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.130
 a little colder I still prefer one 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.630
 jeans that is going to hold you a little 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.510
 more than in relation to low 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.639
 temperature at the end of the day and that's it. 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.460
 so for the boys at least it came out 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.440
 landmarks always go from t shirt is it goes 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.060
 of jeans and take a shorts 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.980
 You can do the opposite, too. 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.750
 depend on how much heat you 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.630

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.740
 more or less comfortable clothes 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.750
 and moving it is no use putting 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.500

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.090

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.760
 if you get there on cheating 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.979
 backpack putting in the middle of so many 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.750
 clothing goes something like 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.580
 quietly never where I always 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.050

 the delayed hall gave super sure so 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.820
 It's so easy to feed you you can 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.639
 to be sure of what is already 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.830
 and you're saving because you 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.820

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.550
 snack bars 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:22.350
