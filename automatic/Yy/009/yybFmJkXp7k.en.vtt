the<00:00:59.910> second<00:01:00.239> fight<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:00.809> Robert

the second fight I think Robert

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.139 
the second fight I think Robert
Stieglitz<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.309> bull<00:01:02.550> rush<00:01:02.760> him<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
happen in and out style like he did in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.370 
happen in and out style like he did in
the<00:01:05.369> second<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.790> he<00:01:06.330> goes<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.200> goes

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the second one he goes in and then goes

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.820 
the second one he goes in and then goes
out<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.250> land<00:01:08.490> some<00:01:08.670> great<00:01:08.850> shots<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830

just<00:01:10.830> kept<00:01:11.100> keep<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.820> he<00:01:11.970> would<00:01:12.119> hold

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
just kept keep going and he would hold

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 
just kept keep going and he would hold
him<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.750> he<00:01:12.990> gets<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.540> he<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.689> win<00:01:15.840> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
him when he gets in and he will win this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
him when he gets in and he will win this
fight<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.439> think<00:01:17.009> Roberts<00:01:17.340> tickets<00:01:17.670> will

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
fight I think Roberts tickets will

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.270 
fight I think Roberts tickets will
definitely<00:01:18.180> win<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.479> third<00:01:18.720> fight<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.280> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
definitely win this third fight and I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.100 
definitely win this third fight and I
don't<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.909> why<00:01:21.090> Arthur<00:01:21.270> Abraham<00:01:21.509> wants<00:01:21.990> his

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
don't know why Arthur Abraham wants his

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
don't know why Arthur Abraham wants his
third<00:01:22.320> fight<00:01:22.560> again<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.340> he<00:01:23.400> should<00:01:23.549> have

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
third fight again I think he should have

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
third fight again I think he should have
just<00:01:23.850> moved<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.950> title

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just moved on from it but it's a title

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
just moved on from it but it's a title
shot<00:01:26.310> for<00:01:26.610> him<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.119> think<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
shot for him I think I think there was a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240 
shot for him I think I think there was a
rematch<00:01:28.350> clause<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> main

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
rematch clause i think that's the main

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
rematch clause i think that's the main
reason<00:01:29.310> why<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> Arthur<00:01:30.600> Abraham<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.990> think

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
reason why and Arthur Abraham I think

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.340 
reason why and Arthur Abraham I think
he's<00:01:31.320> also<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:33.450> top<00:01:33.659> contender<00:01:34.200> right

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
he's also the the top contender right

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
he's also the the top contender right
now<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> number<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.070> contender<00:01:35.759> for<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> WBO

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
now the number one contender for the WBO

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.980 
now the number one contender for the WBO
super<00:01:36.990> middleweight<00:01:37.740> title<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:39.409> yeah<00:01:40.409> um
