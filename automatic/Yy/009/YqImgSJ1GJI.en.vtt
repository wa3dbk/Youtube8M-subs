00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
some instructions right here don't care

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.660 
some instructions right here don't care
it<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.390> instructions<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:52.190> cables

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
it on the instructions and the cables

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.420 
it on the instructions and the cables
also<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:53.989> 45<00:02:54.530> adapter<00:02:55.010> depending<00:02:55.340> on

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
also you get a 45 adapter depending on

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.600 
also you get a 45 adapter depending on
the<00:02:55.549> inside<00:02:56.090> size<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.900> your<00:02:57.110> record<00:02:57.680> or<00:02:57.890> should

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
the inside size of your record or should

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.130 
the inside size of your record or should
I<00:02:58.700> say<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.910> vinyl<00:03:01.329> next<00:03:02.329> we'll<00:03:02.480> get<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.870> guy

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
I say a vinyl next we'll get this guy

out<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.769> box<00:03:04.040> here

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
out of the box here

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:15.060 
out of the box here
I<00:03:08.739> believe<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:09.950> does<00:03:10.730> involve<00:03:11.269> some

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.819 

preparation<00:03:16.070> before<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.640> connect<00:03:16.910> your<00:03:17.060> plan

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
preparation before you connect your plan

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.970 
preparation before you connect your plan
