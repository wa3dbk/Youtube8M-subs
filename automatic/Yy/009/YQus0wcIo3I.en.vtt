00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.040
 nice that she looked in again 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.610
 and overlooking this flying island 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.290
 we start a new preview namely 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.570
 a preview of infiniti 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.090
 these are drawn to one of the coolest 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.680
 I have ever seen and I have to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.260
 First apologize to me the last 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 video was something with the volume of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 music was overrun and the quality was 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 also so important right shit so too 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 the picture quality and everything was 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.219
 actually shit on the video 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.890
 That's why I hope this is here 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.200
 gets a lot better and yes we 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.500
 start the same time by first 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 general overview of that attracts 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.719
 There are a few floating islands and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.570
 I especially like that one 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.030
 really big even with trees can 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.699
 really nice to build something on it and then 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.860
 has a huge rock massif with very 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.670
 very many cave in especially many 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.039
 heights and it has a bit of water 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.379
 I do not have waterfalls and lava 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.810
 I did not believe in this 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.650
 goal but it also has it all 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 a bit sand and yes then I start 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.270
 through here we have the flying island 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.280
 very cool thing and then we have here 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.770
 below also what is very good is the like 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 me very well that it myself i have mine 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.500
 two ponds that bit almost already 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 so gorge are kind of bit and also 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.900
 outside we have this moon shaped 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.159
 sand beach so a very nice word 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.780
 and yes, what should I do next? 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.259
 go on back here we have 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.750
 normal mountains but also 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.369
 he has a study there with me 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 Almost like a mushroom somehow 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.719
 it's on very cool tree and strange 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.750
 yes, if we go behind we have it 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.340
 funny angular turn 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.469
 yes, I do not show every detail now 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.270
 but in general, this is also a lot 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.660
 cool aria there could be such a theater 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.610
 reinbauen so an overhang the cave 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.709
 Signed a bit so too 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.950
 that's not bad 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.800
 even now we come over here 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.569
 there are funny things here 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.970
 rock formations a huge life inc 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.970
 I think I could take that away 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.400
 soja is that is a small cave 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 and here is a huge waterfall wow 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.319
 the niagara case resp 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.840
 there is a much higher something 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.550
 to drop something with Anglo degree not 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.500
 sure but that's how he looks about 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.250
 So it's pretty thin but that's it 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.340
 bad and yes here again 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.360
 that's so cool here you can see that there 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.000
 attached at the back and a huge one 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.310
 Everything that hangs over comes as well 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.989
 another waterfall down here 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.900
 So we have the largest amount of water 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.510
 in this area it even works 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.659
 already three striking in the middle so one 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.030
 little lake actually and yes have here 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.769
 we have some more waterfalls and now 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.830
 we are already coming here too slowly 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.260
 the caves are very very cool in 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.150
 This attracts a lot of people 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.459
 strange structures and caves and here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.720
 It also has a big hole where you can go to 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.810
 example can fly in the 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.840
 administration mode of course not the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.290
 beaches are huge 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.420
 You can see very very bad coal too 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.769
 So everywhere you have no 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.260
 problem with coal and yes here they have 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.480
 even a very normal landscape picture 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.879
 let's say we have again in Sweden 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.670
 sand blog you can do something again 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.180
 huge woman power your heart bit 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.069
 desert, of course, and here also looks very 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.739
 idyllic from again a huge one 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.959
 overhang with a slightly wider of 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.220
 fall this time even here in 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.110
 a smaller flow goes over and 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.739
 you can already see the fleece movement very much 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.579
 very nicely done and yes are yes 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.019
 not done in the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.419
 randomly generated but no matter 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.669
 here again strange things 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.250
 but now I want you so 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.100
 correct the caves show here 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.010
 cool styling where you hopefully through 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.479
 meet and stand here again 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.729
 shadow here it snowed through 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.470
 so decisive in the political 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.560
 switzerland yes not but that is not so 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.539
 more the same thing 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.490
 yes exactly and there comes the snow 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.510
 Of course not 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.400
 I've never had anything like that either 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.650
 contact I did not know that yet 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.479
 that under these blocks then no 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.389
 snow is even though it is in pocket my 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.970
 anyway never does not snow so that because 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.870
 my glos too fast around here the 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.870
 to light up a bit 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:10.410
 so how huge is in this cave 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.180
 people look at you so what 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.430
 you could build everything down like this 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.580
 a proper marketplace with 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.220
 shops what vinegar or what I know 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.200
 what you have for good ideas here 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.920
 we started 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.210
 Of course there will be another one here 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.820
 winter organic with mushrooms with spruce mushrooms 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.270
 and if you get a bit higher in here now 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.600
 then you have the club as well 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.720
 increase even smaller 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.520
 such passes became an example 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.060
 and up here it comes again in a 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.730
 cave clean and then completely on the 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.540
 top is still a spruce on it is 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.220
 very well formed the royal 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.440
 enthroned again floating on it 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.510
 islands and we have another one 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:06.360
 very idyllic star where it again 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.860
 yes so little is still over pending 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.460
 a very small cave 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.730
 yes i think that was the basics about that 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.560
 Everything fell down since then 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:21.540
 update is the gravel and sand stability 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.730
 crabtree exposed and that's why 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.890
 Here you can down everything you can 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:29.610
 naturally clear away again is not a 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.980
 thing and yes I hope that looks like 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.510
 you or or 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.520
 you like the video here again 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.910
 it has already decided a lot 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.870
 strange things in minecraft 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.880
 Actually I always thought so that 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.450
 be programmed like that so what 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:47.250
 but it can not happen well if 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.540
 you know what you make of it and what 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.150
 I could build it out of it 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.030
 one of them looks great for everyone 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:56.730
 possible things here again an area 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.010
 flat the areal where you also very nice 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:02.130
 can build 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.180
 So here you have infinite underground 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.639
 to build 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.889
 you will never get ready there 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:11.930
 can fulfill all sorts of wishes 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:14.940
 According to hollow out an area-flat on areal 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.889
 and so on and so on a bit 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.410
 a bigger senior 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:22.020
 yes, in any case looks more fantastic 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:25.080
 so far almost the best 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.710
 So I saw that can be opened 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.240
 to compare every case with effort 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.720
 and yes I hope you have the video 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.000
 like 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.970
 please let me please leave that in the 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.110
 comments to this if you guys because you can 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.330
 Give a little feedback 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:43.259
 maybe how you think so 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.699
 this situation because I would like 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.710
 know how the Bavarian arrives and 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.509
 then I know yes then I am yes 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.370
 Okay, that's okay for others 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:52.560
 I make the others the videos 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.340
 or that comes at all 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.979
 not on 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.560
 Everyone knows the seed anyway and that's why 

00:07:55.979 --> 00:08:00.660
 I prefer more other videos 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.910
 Let's just leave feedback in there 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:07.139
 The comments will be very happy 

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:08.539
 and yes people subscribed to the 

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:11.580
 next video 

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:15.680
 see you soon to the next goal like or 

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.680
 whatever it
