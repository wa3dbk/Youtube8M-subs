ready to go I modified it with compost
and<00:00:28.820> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.940> see<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.270> is<00:00:30.449> these<00:00:30.660> are<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and you can see this is these are a

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.089 
and you can see this is these are a
little<00:00:31.020> bit<00:00:31.199> different<00:00:31.529> these<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.680> wider

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099

leave a little gap here so it'll be

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.440 
leave a little gap here so it'll be
enough<00:01:04.440> room<00:01:04.710> when<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> roll<00:01:05.850> my<00:01:06.120> sheet<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
enough room when I roll my sheet of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.720 
enough room when I roll my sheet of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
groove the secret to holding the plastic

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.740 
groove the secret to holding the plastic
in<00:01:14.280> place<00:01:14.310> once<00:01:14.910> you've<00:01:15.090> got<00:01:15.240> two<00:01:15.330> tucked<00:01:15.570> in

is to have these turn buckles so I'm

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.420 
is to have these turn buckles so I'm
just<00:01:18.300> going<00:01:18.510> to<00:01:18.570> attach<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.410> sheetrock<00:01:20.040> screw

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.350 

now<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:29.990> put<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:30.530> an<00:01:30.650> open<00:01:30.770> position

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
now you can put it in an open position

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.700 
now you can put it in an open position
so<00:01:32.360> we've<00:01:32.510> got<00:01:32.659> our<00:01:32.840> right<00:01:33.020> sized<00:01:33.260> piece<00:01:33.560> of

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.880 
plastic with our batting strips stapled
on<00:01:36.650> I'm<00:01:37.640> just<00:01:37.790> going<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.030> bring<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:38.299> down<00:01:38.890> now

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
on I'm just going to bring that down now

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.680 
on I'm just going to bring that down now
I<00:01:39.950> can<00:01:40.190> roll<00:01:40.549> that<00:01:40.759> up<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:41.030> little<00:01:41.240> bit

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
I can roll that up a little bit

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:55.180 
I can roll that up a little bit
tuck<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.770> into<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.040> channel<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:54.830> have<00:01:55.009> our

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
tuck it into the channel and we have our

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.870 
tuck it into the channel and we have our
little<00:01:55.659> mini<00:01:56.659> greenhouse<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.429> ends<00:01:58.759> I'm

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
little mini greenhouse on the ends I'm

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.520 
little mini greenhouse on the ends I'm
just<00:01:59.060> going<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.240> tuck<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.630> in<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.020> wait<00:02:00.289> down

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
just going to tuck it in and wait down

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.889 
just going to tuck it in and wait down
some<00:02:00.920> rocks<00:02:01.190> actually<00:02:01.789> some<00:02:02.240> bricks<00:02:02.600> or<00:02:02.840> a

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
some rocks actually some bricks or a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.540 
some rocks actually some bricks or a
little<00:02:03.080> bit<00:02:03.200> heavier<00:02:03.500> would<00:02:03.770> probably<00:02:04.190> work<00:02:04.399> a

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
little bit heavier would probably work a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.940 
little bit heavier would probably work a
little<00:02:04.729> bit<00:02:04.909> better<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.530> wind<00:02:06.740> doesn't

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
little bit better so the wind doesn't

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.170 
little bit better so the wind doesn't
take<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:08.560> early<00:02:09.560> on<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.950> season<00:02:10.190> let's<00:02:10.940> say

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
take it early on in the season let's say

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.509 
take it early on in the season let's say
early<00:02:11.690> April<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.200> singing<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:12.920> here<00:02:13.250> and

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
early April is singing in here and

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.479 
early April is singing in here and
there's<00:02:14.150> no<00:02:14.300> more<00:02:14.480> snow<00:02:14.840> get<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.130> and

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
there's no more snow get this on and

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.220 
there's no more snow get this on and
what<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.760> will<00:02:16.850> do<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.030> start<00:02:17.360> warming<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
what that will do is start warming the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.460 
what that will do is start warming the
soil<00:02:18.560> because<00:02:19.250> what<00:02:19.489> season<00:02:20.000> extension<00:02:20.470> not

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
soil because what season extension not

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.530 
soil because what season extension not
only<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.860> important<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.489> have<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.790> inside

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
only is it important to have it inside

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.570 
only is it important to have it inside
warm<00:02:23.840> environment<00:02:24.440> for<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.620> plants<00:02:25.040> but<00:02:25.519> you

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
warm environment for the plants but you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.030 
warm environment for the plants but you
have<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.970> have<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.360> soil<00:02:26.600> warm<00:02:26.989> up<00:02:27.170> too<00:02:27.440> so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
have to have the soil warm up too so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
have to have the soil warm up too so
having<00:02:28.370> us<00:02:28.519> on<00:02:28.730> about<00:02:29.000> two<00:02:29.390> weeks<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.019> have<00:02:30.530> it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
having us on about two weeks and have it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.819 
having us on about two weeks and have it
fully<00:02:30.890> closed<00:02:31.310> before<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.230> want<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.560> put<00:02:33.709> your

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
fully closed before you want to put your

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.940 
fully closed before you want to put your
plants<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:34.489> will<00:02:34.700> warm<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.180> soil<00:02:35.420> up

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
plants in there will warm the soil up

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.920 
plants in there will warm the soil up
but<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.160> later<00:02:37.880> in<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.180> season<00:02:38.360> towards<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
but then later in the season towards the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.960 
but then later in the season towards the
end<00:02:39.079> of<00:02:39.260> April<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.100> got<00:02:40.280> your<00:02:40.430> plants<00:02:40.820> in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
end of April you got your plants in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.289 
end of April you got your plants in
there<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.750> sunny<00:02:42.049> day<00:02:42.290> like<00:02:42.560> today<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:44.060> Sun

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
there and a sunny day like today the Sun

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.390 
there and a sunny day like today the Sun
is<00:02:44.450> beating<00:02:44.630> really<00:02:45.019> strong<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.250> can

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
is beating really strong and it can

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.100 
is beating really strong and it can
actually<00:02:46.549> get<00:02:46.910> too<00:02:47.209> hot<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.720> there<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.079> a

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
actually get too hot in there and a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.530 
actually get too hot in there and a
close<00:02:48.380> up<00:02:48.650> system<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.030> what<00:02:50.180> we're<00:02:50.329> going<00:02:50.480> to

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
close up system so what we're going to

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.660 
close up system so what we're going to
do<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:51.079> turn<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:52.010> into<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:53.230> little<00:02:54.230> mini

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
do is turn this into a little mini

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.830 
do is turn this into a little mini
roll-up<00:02:55.670> greenhouse<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.390> what<00:02:59.540> I'm<00:02:59.630> gonna<00:02:59.720> use

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
roll-up greenhouse so what I'm gonna use

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.319 
roll-up greenhouse so what I'm gonna use
for<00:03:00.230> my<00:03:00.380> really<00:03:00.680> high-tech<00:03:00.920> system<00:03:01.609> here<00:03:01.850> is

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
for my really high-tech system here is

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.410 
for my really high-tech system here is
these<00:03:02.650> inexpensive<00:03:03.650> hardware<00:03:04.070> clamps<00:03:04.850> that

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
these inexpensive hardware clamps that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
these inexpensive hardware clamps that
you<00:03:05.510> get<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.900> about<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.079> dollar<00:03:06.290> piece

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.250 

and<00:03:19.520> that's<00:03:20.520> all<00:03:20.700> there<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.450> when

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
you have to sort of judge what kind of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.790 
you have to sort of judge what kind of
day<00:03:27.330> it's<00:03:27.540> going<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.840> be<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.680> going

day it's going to be and if it's going

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.380 
day it's going to be and if it's going
to<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> warm<00:03:29.220> day<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.490> want<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.910> roll<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.270> up

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
to be a warm day you want to roll it up

to be a warm day you want to roll it up
get<00:03:30.960> some<00:03:30.990> Eurasian<00:03:31.770> going<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.280> then<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.700> can

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
get some Eurasian going and then you can

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.850 
get some Eurasian going and then you can
do<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.270> same<00:03:33.480> thing<00:03:33.780> with<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.080> other<00:03:34.200> side<00:03:34.500> so

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
do the same thing with the other side so

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.440 
do the same thing with the other side so
you<00:03:34.890> come<00:03:35.340> cut<00:03:35.640> complete<00:03:36.450> cross<00:03:36.840> ventilation
