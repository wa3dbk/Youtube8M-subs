00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.060 
this example I chose music I wanted to
find<00:02:26.010> duplicate<00:02:26.610> mp3<00:02:27.420> folder<00:02:27.930> files<00:02:28.380> that

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
find duplicate mp3 folder files that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.570 
find duplicate mp3 folder files that
were<00:02:29.460> wasting<00:02:30.270> space<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.950> use<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:33.270> it

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
were wasting space so I use that and it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.370 
were wasting space so I use that and it
takes<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.820> couple<00:02:36.000> minutes<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.570> scan<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
takes a couple minutes to scan and it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.080 
takes a couple minutes to scan and it
scanned<00:02:37.710> about<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.340> don't<00:02:38.670> know<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.850> few

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
scanned about I don't know a few

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.590 
scanned about I don't know a few
thousand<00:02:39.600> files<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.350> then<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.600> results

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
thousand files and then the results

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.590 
thousand files and then the results
screen<00:02:42.960> comes<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.480> here's<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
screen comes up like this here's the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.960 
screen comes up like this here's the
results<00:02:46.020> screen<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:47.280> these<00:02:47.490> are<00:02:47.670> all<00:02:47.820> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
results screen so these are all the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.730 
results screen so these are all the
duplicate<00:02:48.450> mp3<00:02:49.200> files<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.070> found<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.850> my

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
duplicate mp3 files that it found in my

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.770 
duplicate mp3 files that it found in my
folder<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.920> as<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.430> see<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:54.300> starts<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
folder and as you can see it starts to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.050 
folder and as you can see it starts to
add<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.860> doesn't<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.250> like<00:02:56.280> much<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
add up it doesn't look like much but it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.630 
add up it doesn't look like much but it
starts<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.450> add<00:02:57.540> up<00:02:57.660> there's<00:02:58.070> 579<00:02:59.070> items<00:02:59.460> in

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
starts to add up there's 579 items in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.840 
starts to add up there's 579 items in
here<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.710> it's<00:03:01.710> a<00:03:01.830> very<00:03:02.100> cool<00:03:02.340> program

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
here and it's a very cool program

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.760 
here and it's a very cool program
because<00:03:03.210> it<00:03:03.450> easily<00:03:03.750> allows<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.560> compare

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
because it easily allows you to compare

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.480 
because it easily allows you to compare
the<00:03:05.760> two<00:03:06.450> files<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.710> most<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.070> these<00:03:08.160> cases

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
the two files and in most of these cases

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.380 
the two files and in most of these cases
these<00:03:09.210> were<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.980> uploaded<00:03:10.980> on<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.670> same<00:03:11.970> day

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
these were just uploaded on the same day

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.920 
these were just uploaded on the same day
and<00:03:12.720> this<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.740> just<00:03:14.040> wasted<00:03:14.550> space<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.720> can

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
and this is just wasted space so you can

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.080 
and this is just wasted space so you can
choose<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.620> move<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.100> copy<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.700> can<00:03:17.880> choose

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
choose to move and copy you can choose

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.780 
choose to move and copy you can choose
to<00:03:18.300> burn<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.500> duplicates<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.340> then<00:03:20.580> this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
to burn the duplicates and then this

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.430 
to burn the duplicates and then this
program<00:03:21.240> will<00:03:21.420> automatically<00:03:22.020> get<00:03:22.200> rid<00:03:22.410> of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
program will automatically get rid of

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.100 
program will automatically get rid of
the<00:03:22.590> ones<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:22.920> don't<00:03:23.040> need<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:24.690> can<00:03:24.870> also

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the ones you don't need you can also

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.940 
the ones you don't need you can also

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
information about the file and the cool

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.320 
information about the file and the cool
thing<00:03:37.860> is<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.460> when<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:38.760> check<00:03:39.030> out<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
is very cool so this is the example of

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.220 
is very cool so this is the example of
how<00:03:49.140> we<00:03:49.350> would<00:03:49.620> remove<00:03:50.150> duplicate<00:03:51.150> mp3<00:03:51.900> files

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230
