me<00:02:18.440> very<00:02:18.500> much<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.340> imac<00:02:19.790> this<00:02:20.060> material

me very much of the imac this material

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.430 
me very much of the imac this material
feels<00:02:21.290> very<00:02:21.770> reminiscent<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.580> an<00:02:22.910> imac<00:02:23.440> same

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
feels very reminiscent of an imac same

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.350 
feels very reminiscent of an imac same
kind<00:02:24.710> of<00:02:24.830> look<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.250> finish<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.850> tim<00:02:26.030> kind<00:02:26.240> of

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
kind of look and finish and tim kind of

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.350 
kind of look and finish and tim kind of
feel<00:02:26.690> with<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.380> metal<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.550> base<00:02:29.120> plate

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
feel with the metal so the base plate

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.510 
feel with the metal so the base plate
has<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> nice<00:02:30.020> rubberized<00:02:30.530> padding<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.340> it

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
has a nice rubberized padding on it

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.640 
has a nice rubberized padding on it
which<00:02:31.670> will<00:02:31.820> protect<00:02:32.030> obviously<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.140> surface

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
which will protect obviously the surface

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.920 
which will protect obviously the surface
whatever<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.700> put<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.390> then<00:02:35.900> I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
whatever you put it on and then I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.050 
whatever you put it on and then I
believe<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.560> goes<00:02:36.740> together<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:37.820> you

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
believe it goes together like this you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.030 
believe it goes together like this you
can<00:02:38.210> see<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.480> two<00:02:38.660> holes<00:02:38.900> here<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.320> then<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
can see the two holes here and then the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.430 
can see the two holes here and then the
spot<00:02:40.280> for<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.580> screw<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.630> line<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.900> up<00:02:42.140> like

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
spot for the screw so we line it up like

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.160 
spot for the screw so we line it up like
so<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:43.930> believe<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:46.040> then<00:02:47.030> we<00:02:47.690> have

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
so I believe like that and then we have

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.949 
so I believe like that and then we have
to<00:02:48.200> get<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.560> hex<00:02:48.709> around<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.430> let<00:02:49.550> me<00:02:49.610> get<00:02:49.760> that

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
to get the hex around so let me get that

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.320 
to get the hex around so let me get that
pop<00:02:50.959> this<00:02:51.140> open<00:02:51.640> comes<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.910> little<00:02:53.120> tool

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
pop this open comes with the little tool

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.020 
pop this open comes with the little tool
right<00:02:53.870> here<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.320> then<00:02:55.040> one<00:02:55.310> screw<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:55.820> quite

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
right here and then one screw it's quite

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.310 
right here and then one screw it's quite
large<00:02:56.240> it's<00:02:56.630> not<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:56.870> you're<00:02:56.990> going<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.170> lose

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
large it's not like you're going to lose

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.260 
large it's not like you're going to lose
it<00:02:57.380> which<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.830> good<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.340> obviously<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.060> don't

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
it which is good and obviously you don't

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.240 
it which is good and obviously you don't
have<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.570> be<00:02:59.690> taking<00:03:00.020> this<00:03:00.140> apart<00:03:00.560> unless

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
have to be taking this apart unless

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.190 
have to be taking this apart unless
you're<00:03:01.580> going<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.790> like<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.209> know<00:03:02.239> pack<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.020> up

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
you're going to like you know pack it up

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.720 
you're going to like you know pack it up
and<00:03:03.320> bring<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:03.560> somewhere<00:03:03.980> which<00:03:04.130> I'm<00:03:04.610> not

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
and bring it somewhere which I'm not

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.790 
and bring it somewhere which I'm not
sure<00:03:05.000> how<00:03:05.150> often<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.570> would<00:03:05.660> do<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.260> what

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
sure how often you would do that so what

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.140 
sure how often you would do that so what
you<00:03:06.860> have<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.070> do<00:03:07.190> is<00:03:07.400> kind<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.850> hold<00:03:08.030> this

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
you have to do is kind of hold this

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.830 
you have to do is kind of hold this
together<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.840> then<00:03:09.620> flip<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.010> over<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.840> put

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
together and then flip it over so put

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.900 
together and then flip it over so put
the<00:03:11.959> screw<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.200> I'm<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.459> start<00:03:13.760> it

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
the screw in I'm just going to start it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.600 
the screw in I'm just going to start it
with<00:03:14.000> my<00:03:14.090> fingers<00:03:14.540> if<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:15.110> yep<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.340> then

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
with my fingers if I can yep and then

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.820 
with my fingers if I can yep and then
I'm<00:03:16.700> going<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.880> grab<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.120> hex<00:03:17.300> tool<00:03:17.650> line<00:03:18.650> it

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
I'm going to grab the hex tool line it

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.210 
I'm going to grab the hex tool line it
up<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:19.670> screw<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.720> together<00:03:21.070> see<00:03:22.070> if<00:03:22.160> I

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
up and just screw it together see if I

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.490 
up and just screw it together see if I
can<00:03:22.370> get<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:23.330> was<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> fail<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.350> let's

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
can get that that was a fail so let's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.759 
can get that that was a fail so let's
try<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.830> like<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:26.320> may<00:03:27.320> have<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.560> do<00:03:27.650> this

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
try it like that I may have to do this

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.410 
try it like that I may have to do this
off<00:03:27.950> camera<00:03:27.980> it's<00:03:28.519> obviously<00:03:28.850> not<00:03:28.940> easy<00:03:29.239> to

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
off camera it's obviously not easy to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.600 
off camera it's obviously not easy to
screw<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.750> together<00:03:29.930> one<00:03:30.320> holding<00:03:31.190> my<00:03:31.280> hands

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.789 
screw this together one holding my hands
through<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.880> tripod<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.380> should<00:03:33.590> be<00:03:33.739> able

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
through the tripod but I should be able

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.830 
through the tripod but I should be able
to<00:03:33.950> make<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.100> work<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:34.820> if<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.120> do<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.239> now

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
to make it work see if I can do it now

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.990 
to make it work see if I can do it now
