see<00:01:41.430> if<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.549> will<00:01:41.729> let<00:01:41.880> us<00:01:41.970> uh<00:01:42.380> open<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> up

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
see if this will let us uh open it up

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
see if this will let us uh open it up
it's<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.829> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.130> warmer<00:01:44.549> than<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
it's a little bit warmer than the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.690 
it's a little bit warmer than the
plastic<00:01:46.140> film<00:01:46.290> since<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> metal<00:01:47.070> heats<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
plastic film since the metal heats up a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.560 
plastic film since the metal heats up a
little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.270> gonna<00:01:48.420> use<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
little bit more so it's gonna use a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.929 
little bit more so it's gonna use a
glove<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.020> help<00:01:49.200> us<00:01:49.350> separate<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.159> I'm<00:01:50.820> gonna

start to separate the glue on this phone

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.290 
start to separate the glue on this phone
it's<00:02:07.829> an<00:02:07.920> easy<00:02:08.039> way<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.220> save<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.060> front

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it's an easy way to save the the front

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.570 
it's an easy way to save the the front
bezel<00:02:09.599> as<00:02:09.869> well<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.950> don't<00:02:11.069> want<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> use

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
bezel as well as you don't want to use

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.180 
bezel as well as you don't want to use
anything<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:12.060> too<00:02:12.300> sharp<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.840> might

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
anything that's too sharp but we might

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.010 
anything that's too sharp but we might
damaged<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.700> LCD<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.600> we're<00:02:14.690> not<00:02:14.750> going<00:02:14.930> very

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
damaged the LCD so we're not going very

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.800 
damaged the LCD so we're not going very
far<00:02:15.470> or<00:02:15.650> deep<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.130> just<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> black<00:02:17.450> portion

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
far or deep in just to the black portion

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.650 
far or deep in just to the black portion
around<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.350> LCD<00:02:18.860> we<00:02:19.850> don't<00:02:20.000> want<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.240> separate

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
around the LCD we don't want to separate

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.470 
around the LCD we don't want to separate
from<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.740> glass<00:02:22.430> yet

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
from the glass yet

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.930 
from the glass yet
we'll<00:02:23.900> use<00:02:23.930> a<00:02:24.080> separator<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.130> do<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.460> just

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
we'll use a separator to do that just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.610 
we'll use a separator to do that just
using<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:26.270> guard<00:02:26.930> pick<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.290> go<00:02:27.380> all<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.590> way

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
using a guard pick to go all the way

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.610 
using a guard pick to go all the way
around<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.250> phone<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:29.260> basically<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.470> cut

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
around the phone and basically just cut

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.410 
around the phone and basically just cut
a<00:02:30.650> double<00:02:30.980> sided<00:02:31.160> tape<00:02:31.280> that's<00:02:31.640> holding<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
a double sided tape that's holding the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:39.160 
a double sided tape that's holding the
LCD<00:02:32.930> into<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.950> mid<00:02:34.130> frame<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.840> see<00:02:38.900> that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
LCD into the mid frame you can see that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
LCD into the mid frame you can see that
we're<00:02:39.260> starting<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.710> little<00:02:39.770> bit<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.040> progress

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
we're starting a little bit of progress

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.380 
we're starting a little bit of progress
you<00:02:40.370> go<00:02:40.460> a<00:02:40.490> little<00:02:40.580> bit<00:02:40.730> deeper<00:02:40.880> down<00:02:41.150> here<00:02:41.330> at

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
you go a little bit deeper down here at

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.930 
you go a little bit deeper down here at
the<00:02:41.480> bottom<00:02:45.130> now<00:02:46.130> playing<00:02:46.460> card<00:02:46.670> would<00:02:46.850> be

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
the bottom now playing card would be

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.460 
the bottom now playing card would be
beneficial<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.630> hold<00:02:47.900> what<00:02:48.140> we've<00:02:48.260> done

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
beneficial to hold what we've done

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.150 
beneficial to hold what we've done
already<00:02:50.260> once<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.380> start<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.710> separate<00:02:52.040> you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
already once you start to separate you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.320 
already once you start to separate you
can<00:02:52.280> put<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> playing<00:02:52.670> card<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.970> there<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.150> hold

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
can put a playing card in there to hold

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.850 
can put a playing card in there to hold
it<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.660> doesn't<00:02:53.780> reglue<00:02:54.350> itself<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.770> the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
it so it doesn't reglue itself to the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.170 
it so it doesn't reglue itself to the
mid<00:02:55.040> frame<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.820> does<00:02:56.000> work<00:02:56.180> pretty<00:02:56.210> good

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
mid frame it does work pretty good

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.610 
mid frame it does work pretty good
we're<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.270> gonna<00:02:59.390> use<00:02:59.600> our<00:02:59.780> suction<00:03:00.350> cup

the<00:03:31.549> whole<00:03:31.849> assembly<00:03:32.629> of<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.870> LCD<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:34.040> want

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
the whole assembly of the LCD you want

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.259 
the whole assembly of the LCD you want
to<00:03:34.250> start<00:03:34.430> yourself<00:03:34.670> at<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.819> top<00:03:35.030> because

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
to start yourself at the top because

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.259 
to start yourself at the top because
we're<00:03:35.480> gonna<00:03:35.629> fold<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:36.049> down<00:03:36.400> onto<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.000> ribbon

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
we're gonna fold it down onto the ribbon

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.770 
we're gonna fold it down onto the ribbon
cables<00:03:38.659> below<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:40.700> does<00:03:40.879> get<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.060> little<00:03:41.090> tricky

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
cables below it does get a little tricky

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.360 
cables below it does get a little tricky

phone you'll need to put a little bit

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.869 
phone you'll need to put a little bit
more<00:03:48.799> effort<00:03:48.920> in<00:03:49.159> to<00:03:49.250> get<00:03:49.370> underneath<00:03:49.670> the

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
more effort in to get underneath the

glass do the same thing here just trying

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.309 
glass do the same thing here just trying
to<00:03:53.450> separate<00:03:53.750> making<00:03:54.019> sure<00:03:54.109> that<00:03:54.200> I'm

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
to separate making sure that I'm

heat it up as the heat temperature fell
a<00:04:02.599> little<00:04:02.930> bit<00:04:03.049> or<00:04:03.230> you're<00:04:03.379> not<00:04:03.439> getting<00:04:03.709> the

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
a little bit or you're not getting the

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.460 
a little bit or you're not getting the
separation<00:04:04.370> of<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:05.329> glue<00:04:05.659> that<00:04:05.689> we<00:04:06.019> want<00:04:06.290> to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
separation of the glue that we want to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.740 
separation of the glue that we want to
or<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.739> tape<00:04:06.980> so<00:04:07.939> I<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.180> heated<00:04:08.420> up<00:04:08.480> around

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
or the tape so I just heated up around

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.720 
or the tape so I just heated up around
the<00:04:08.810> sides<00:04:09.049> here<00:04:09.319> since<00:04:09.859> it<00:04:09.950> RC<00:04:10.220> Hardy<00:04:10.579> has

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
the sides here since it RC Hardy has

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.280 
the sides here since it RC Hardy has
been<00:04:10.909> heated<00:04:11.180> up<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:11.389> heats<00:04:11.569> up<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:11.750> lot<00:04:11.900> faster

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
been heated up it heats up a lot faster

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.379 
been heated up it heats up a lot faster
than<00:04:12.379> it<00:04:12.500> would<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:13.430> first<00:04:13.670> initial<00:04:14.090> time<00:04:14.269> we

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
than it would the first initial time we

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.499 
than it would the first initial time we
were<00:04:14.510> giving<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.079> heat<00:04:16.329> it's<00:04:17.329> going

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
were giving it the heat it's going

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:44.540 
were giving it the heat it's going
around<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.780> corners<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.169> the<00:04:18.229> sides

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.129 

alright<00:04:45.360> we'll<00:04:45.449> go<00:04:45.509> ahead<00:04:45.569> and<00:04:45.720> start<00:04:46.020> our

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
alright we'll go ahead and start our

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.839 
alright we'll go ahead and start our
process<00:04:46.560> here<00:04:46.710> again<00:04:47.009> trying<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.340> separate

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
process here again trying to separate

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.830 
process here again trying to separate
the<00:04:48.120> tape<00:04:48.660> off<00:04:48.900> of<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:50.120> it's<00:04:51.120> got<00:04:51.240> it's<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.539> lot

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
the tape off of this it's got it's a lot

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.080 
the tape off of this it's got it's a lot
of<00:04:51.930> progress<00:04:52.110> on<00:04:52.410> this<00:04:52.650> side<00:04:53.490> over<00:04:53.669> here<00:04:53.789> so

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
of progress on this side over here so

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.969 
of progress on this side over here so
let's<00:04:54.270> go<00:04:54.330> ahead<00:04:54.389> and<00:04:54.479> keep<00:04:54.659> moving<00:04:54.960> it<00:04:55.050> down

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.029 

trying<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.009> get<00:04:59.099> underneath<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:01.470> glass<00:05:01.740> here

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
trying to get underneath the glass here

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.200 
trying to get underneath the glass here
you<00:05:02.129> can<00:05:02.220> see<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.430> it's<00:05:02.550> shattered<00:05:02.729> so<00:05:03.060> it's

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
you can see that it's shattered so it's

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.279 
you can see that it's shattered so it's
a<00:05:03.270> little<00:05:03.449> bit<00:05:03.599> harder<00:05:03.900> than<00:05:03.960> that

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
a little bit harder than that

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:16.129 
a little bit harder than that
portion<00:05:05.039> of<00:05:05.129> the<00:05:05.220> screen

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.930 

perfect<00:05:17.139> or<00:05:17.230> making<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.680> lot<00:05:18.190> better<00:05:18.430> progress

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
perfect or making a lot better progress

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.280 
perfect or making a lot better progress
now<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.210> can<00:05:19.419> see<00:05:19.540> they<00:05:19.630> certainly<00:05:19.840> come<00:05:20.020> away

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
now you can see they certainly come away

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.770 
now you can see they certainly come away
so<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.590> can<00:05:20.740> start<00:05:20.949> to<00:05:21.150> slide<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.270> all<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.720> way

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
so I can start to slide it all the way

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.750 
so I can start to slide it all the way
underneath<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.440> glass<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.580> LCD

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
underneath the glass and the LCD

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.090 
underneath the glass and the LCD
assembly<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.710> will<00:05:26.800> go<00:05:26.919> ahead<00:05:26.979> and

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
assembly and that will go ahead and

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.010 
assembly and that will go ahead and
start<00:05:27.340> to<00:05:27.430> separate<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.180> screen<00:05:28.540> for<00:05:28.840> us<00:05:28.870> a

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
start to separate the screen for us a

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:42.959 
start to separate the screen for us a
lot<00:05:29.199> easier

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:42.969 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.319 

I<00:05:43.059> have<00:05:43.599> to<00:05:43.659> use<00:05:43.809> my<00:05:43.959> Isis<00:05:44.619> mole<00:05:44.860> tool<00:05:45.129> here<00:05:45.519> to

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:46.329 
I have to use my Isis mole tool here to

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:47.789 
I have to use my Isis mole tool here to
get<00:05:46.479> underneath<00:05:46.839> the<00:05:47.019> glass<00:05:47.349> and<00:05:47.589> get<00:05:47.679> that

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:47.799 
get underneath the glass and get that

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:52.319 
get underneath the glass and get that
separated<00:05:50.309> use<00:05:51.309> it<00:05:51.459> to<00:05:51.579> start<00:05:51.939> us<00:05:52.089> a<00:05:52.209> little

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:52.329 
separated use it to start us a little

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:55.159 
separated use it to start us a little
bit<00:05:52.479> you<00:05:52.599> can<00:05:52.779> use<00:05:52.959> a<00:05:52.989> razor<00:05:53.229> blade<00:05:53.559> as<00:05:53.769> well

well<00:06:10.019> let's<00:06:11.019> try<00:06:11.169> to<00:06:11.229> pull<00:06:11.559> it<00:06:11.799> off<00:06:11.979> here<00:06:14.159> if

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
well let's try to pull it off here if

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.499 
well let's try to pull it off here if
you<00:06:15.279> have<00:06:15.369> a<00:06:15.429> hard<00:06:15.639> time<00:06:15.699> you<00:06:15.939> can<00:06:16.059> pull<00:06:16.239> it<00:06:16.329> up

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
you have a hard time you can pull it up

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.079 
you have a hard time you can pull it up
a<00:06:16.599> little<00:06:16.689> bit<00:06:16.929> and<00:06:17.110> then<00:06:17.739> use<00:06:17.949> your<00:06:18.219> tool<00:06:19.059> to

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:19.089 
a little bit and then use your tool to

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:24.019 
a little bit and then use your tool to
separate<00:06:19.839> the<00:06:20.019> tape<00:06:20.559> here<00:06:20.769> at<00:06:20.829> the<00:06:20.919> bottom

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:26.339 

alright<00:06:25.029> so<00:06:25.449> we<00:06:25.509> went<00:06:25.659> ahead<00:06:25.719> and<00:06:25.959> separate<00:06:26.259> it

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
alright so we went ahead and separate it

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.119 
alright so we went ahead and separate it
from<00:06:26.379> the<00:06:26.529> mid<00:06:26.829> frame<00:06:27.189> of<00:06:27.459> the<00:06:27.849> foam<00:06:28.919> we<00:06:29.919> can<00:06:30.039> go

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:30.129 
from the mid frame of the foam we can go

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.709 
from the mid frame of the foam we can go
ahead<00:06:30.219> and<00:06:30.459> set<00:06:30.729> that<00:06:30.909> aside<00:06:31.029> the<00:06:31.419> next<00:06:31.509> year

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
ahead and set that aside the next year

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:33.089 
ahead and set that aside the next year
when<00:06:31.809> I<00:06:31.839> go<00:06:31.989> ahead<00:06:32.110> and<00:06:32.319> do<00:06:32.499> is<00:06:32.679> try<00:06:32.829> to<00:06:32.860> take

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
when I go ahead and do is try to take

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:49.620 
when I go ahead and do is try to take
out<00:06:33.219> the<00:06:33.249> SIM<00:06:33.639> slot<00:06:33.969> in<00:06:34.179> the<00:06:34.719> mid<00:06:34.929> frame

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.570 

so<00:06:50.260> looking<00:06:50.560> at<00:06:50.680> this<00:06:50.830> you<00:06:50.890> can<00:06:51.130> see<00:06:51.160> that

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
so looking at this you can see that

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.520 
so looking at this you can see that
there's<00:06:51.850> a<00:06:51.910> slot<00:06:52.210> right<00:06:52.420> here<00:06:52.480> it's<00:06:53.200> actually

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
there's a slot right here it's actually

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.530 
there's a slot right here it's actually
hidden<00:06:53.710> under<00:06:53.980> this<00:06:54.130> matting<00:06:54.940> on<00:06:55.090> the<00:06:55.210> front

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
hidden under this matting on the front

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.970 
hidden under this matting on the front
of<00:06:55.660> the<00:06:55.810> phones<00:06:56.080> we're<00:06:56.290> to<00:06:56.380> go<00:06:56.440> ahead<00:06:56.500> and<00:06:56.710> push

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
of the phones we're to go ahead and push

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.260 
of the phones we're to go ahead and push
that<00:06:57.220> back<00:06:59.310> then<00:07:00.310> already<00:07:00.400> build<00:07:00.700> a<00:07:00.790> SIM<00:07:01.000> card

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
that back then already build a SIM card

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.760 
that back then already build a SIM card
slot<00:07:01.540> for<00:07:01.570> us<00:07:01.870> we're<00:07:02.020> just<00:07:02.050> gonna<00:07:02.260> use<00:07:02.410> a<00:07:02.440> pry

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
slot for us we're just gonna use a pry

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.340 
slot for us we're just gonna use a pry
