00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
but there are two tools that I reach for

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.779 
but there are two tools that I reach for
what<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.009> great<00:00:14.490> piano<00:00:14.969> sound

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
what I have to get a great piano sound

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:26.140 
what I have to get a great piano sound
one<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.840> other<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> GML<00:00:22.680> 8900

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.759 

let's<00:00:27.150> take<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> listen<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.740> on

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
let's take a listen to what we can do on

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.160 
let's take a listen to what we can do on
this<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.160> bar<00:00:29.730> acoustic<00:00:30.240> piano<00:00:30.539> craze<00:00:30.869> with

this one bar acoustic piano craze with
the<00:00:31.289> 8900<00:00:32.009> you'll<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.550> why<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the 8900 you'll see why I have a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.680 
the 8900 you'll see why I have a
repeating<00:00:34.130> first<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.239> idea<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.570> what

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
repeating first you get an idea of what

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.119 
repeating first you get an idea of what
the<00:00:36.780> threshold<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.829> through

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the threshold is I'm going to go through

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.030 
the threshold is I'm going to go through
a<00:00:38.190> slow<00:00:38.760> time<00:00:39.540> constant<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.680> I'm<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.980> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
a slow time constant and I'm going to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.310 
a slow time constant and I'm going to
start<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.059> crest<00:00:42.420> factor<00:00:42.690> control

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
start with the crest factor control

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.000 
start with the crest factor control
which<00:00:43.890> we'll<00:00:44.040> explain<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> minute<00:00:46.010> fully

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
which we'll explain in a minute fully

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.819 
which we'll explain in a minute fully
out<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.520> operation<00:00:48.210> fully<00:00:48.840> pliers<00:00:49.320> becomes

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
out of operation fully pliers becomes

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.410 
out of operation fully pliers becomes
more<00:00:50.219> important<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.059> turn<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
more important as we turn it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.820 
more important as we turn it
counterclockwise

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.420 

we're<00:00:54.520> going<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.730> reduce<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.210> threshold

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.149 

and<00:00:59.670> I've<00:00:59.789> got<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> very<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.140> time<00:01:01.559> comes

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.919 

what<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.820> doing<00:01:06.179> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.509> see<00:01:06.719> by<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
what it's doing you can see by the

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.910 
what it's doing you can see by the
mirror<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.619> leveling<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> penis

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
mirror it's just leveling the penis

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.609 
mirror it's just leveling the penis
taken<00:01:11.670> out

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.950 

the<00:01:18.070> dynamic<00:01:18.460> range<00:01:18.490> controller<00:01:19.030> raised<00:01:19.689> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
the dynamic range controller raised the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.280 
the dynamic range controller raised the
overall<00:01:20.470> average<00:01:20.740> level<00:01:21.399> up<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:22.750> popping

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
overall average level up that's popping

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.080 
overall average level up that's popping
out

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.859 

and<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:26.840> we<00:01:26.960> want<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:28.790> just<00:01:29.570> address

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
and what we want to do is just address

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.660 
and what we want to do is just address
that<00:01:30.140> way<00:01:30.380> we're<00:01:30.590> going<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:30.770> do<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.040> is<00:01:31.250> we're

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
that way we're going to do it is we're

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.630 
that way we're going to do it is we're
going<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:31.850> keep<00:01:32.090> our<00:01:32.329> time<00:01:32.600> constant<00:01:33.320> slow<00:01:33.640> but

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
going to keep our time constant slow but

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.050 
going to keep our time constant slow but
we're<00:01:34.850> going<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.210> dial<00:01:35.689> in<00:01:36.880> crest<00:01:37.880> factor

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
we're going to dial in crest factor

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.389 
we're going to dial in crest factor
control<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.960> fast<00:01:39.289> RMS<00:01:39.829> which<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.250> in

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
control on the fast RMS which is in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.270 
control on the fast RMS which is in
effect<00:01:41.110> going<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.229> help<00:01:42.409> us<00:01:42.560> control<00:01:42.979> that

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
effect going to help us control that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.830 
effect going to help us control that
peak

you<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.220> hear<00:01:53.460> how<00:01:53.670> it

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.260 

it's<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.799> song

it's<00:02:05.259> really<00:02:05.530> reducing<00:02:06.130> its<00:02:06.250> level<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.820> a

it's really reducing its level in a

it's really reducing its level in a
fairly<00:02:07.240> transparent<00:02:07.600> way<00:02:08.200> that's<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.920> fairly

fairly transparent way that's a fairly

fairly transparent way that's a fairly
low<00:02:09.459> ratio<00:02:09.880> now<00:02:10.119> we're<00:02:10.270> going<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.450> tune<00:02:10.750> how

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
low ratio now we're going to tune how

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.770 
low ratio now we're going to tune how

much effect overall we want on the piano
with<00:02:14.019> ratio<00:02:14.470> control<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.090> about<00:02:16.269> four<00:02:16.569> to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
little bit with the fast RMS detective

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.039 
little bit with the fast RMS detective
it's<00:03:13.349> pretty<00:03:13.560> good

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.699 

let's<00:03:17.049> put<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.349> 8900<00:03:18.099> on<00:03:18.219> a<00:03:18.250> little<00:03:18.689> wider

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
let's put the 8900 on a little wider

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.920 
let's put the 8900 on a little wider

sample of piano same settings 8 bar
piece<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.980> we're<00:03:27.250> going<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:29.709> turn<00:03:29.920> on

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
piece and we're going to just turn on

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.240 
piece and we're going to just turn on
the<00:03:30.159> setting<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.459> they<00:03:30.670> have<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.920> note<00:03:32.920> that

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
the setting that they have and note that

the setting that they have and note that
when<00:03:33.819> we<00:03:33.849> do

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.630 

that<00:03:39.600> our<00:03:39.750> low-level<00:03:40.200> stuff<00:03:40.410> comes<00:03:40.709> up

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.170

rest

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.480 

let's<00:03:51.660> take<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.870> out

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.589 

we're<00:03:56.970> obviously<00:03:57.090> bringing<00:03:57.690> up<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.870> Lola

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.890 

back<00:04:03.599> in

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.750 

the<00:04:07.260> other<00:04:07.470> thing<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.739> we<00:04:07.890> can<00:04:07.920> do<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.370> in<00:04:08.610> the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
the other thing that we can do is in the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.490 
the other thing that we can do is in the
context<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.540> mix<00:04:11.360> we<00:04:12.360> can<00:04:12.690> adjust<00:04:12.959> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
context of the mix we can adjust the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.550 
context of the mix we can adjust the
peak<00:04:13.739> control<00:04:14.330> so<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.660> piano<00:04:16.019> just

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
peak control so that the piano just

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:29.930 
peak control so that the piano just
Peaks<00:04:17.400> through<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.030> mix

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.360 

this<00:04:30.450> is<00:04:30.600> with<00:04:30.840> the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
this is with the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.840 
this is with the
crest<00:04:32.940> factor<00:04:33.150> reduced<00:04:34.490> we<00:04:35.490> hear<00:04:35.700> them

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.139 

you're<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.480> peach<00:04:39.720> talk<00:04:40.050> through

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:43.149 

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:52.440 

style<00:04:43.779> the<00:04:44.049> crest<00:04:44.319> factor<00:04:44.559> in

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.719 

so<00:04:52.990> we<00:04:53.110> here

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
so we here

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.269 
so we here
that<00:04:55.300> we've<00:04:55.479> adjusted<00:04:55.629> the<00:04:56.080> Peaks<00:04:56.409> to<00:04:56.559> be<00:04:56.680> just

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:57.279 
that we've adjusted the Peaks to be just

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.600 
that we've adjusted the Peaks to be just
above<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:58.419> level<00:04:58.719> of<00:04:58.779> the<00:04:58.930> trap

above the level of the trap

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.339 
above the level of the trap
independently<00:05:00.610> of<00:05:01.089> the<00:05:01.449> overall<00:05:01.779> level<00:05:02.289> of
