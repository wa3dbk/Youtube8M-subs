00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
everyone this is Noah zerkin at the end

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.930 
everyone this is Noah zerkin at the end
of<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.440> long<00:00:04.620> week<00:00:06.200> been<00:00:07.200> playing<00:00:08.010> around<00:00:08.220> with

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
of a long week been playing around with

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.810 
of a long week been playing around with
the<00:00:09.469> IMU<00:00:10.580> 6050<00:00:12.259> evaluation<00:00:13.259> board<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:14.519> sorry

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the IMU 6050 evaluation board I'm sorry

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.269 
the IMU 6050 evaluation board I'm sorry
that's<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> mpu<00:00:15.599> 6050<00:00:16.440> evaluation<00:00:17.010> board

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that's the mpu 6050 evaluation board

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.740 
that's the mpu 6050 evaluation board
from<00:00:17.580> invent<00:00:18.150> sense<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:20.390> just<00:00:21.390> got<00:00:21.539> that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
from invent sense and just got that

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.609 
from invent sense and just got that
plugged<00:00:22.500> into<00:00:22.680> an<00:00:22.980> Arduino<00:00:23.369> mega<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:24.619> it's

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
plugged into an Arduino mega here it's

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.130 
plugged into an Arduino mega here it's
been<00:00:25.859> rather<00:00:26.490> difficult<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.949> AK<00:00:30.140> 89

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
been rather difficult to get the AK 89

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.930 
been rather difficult to get the AK 89
75<00:00:31.890> datasheet<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.860> magnetometer

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
75 datasheet that's the magnetometer

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.380 
75 datasheet that's the magnetometer
that's<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.920> on<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> board<00:00:38.340> along<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.210> it

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that's there on the board along with it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.369 
that's there on the board along with it
the<00:00:39.950> mpu<00:00:40.950> 60<00:00:41.430> 50<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.850> special<00:00:42.210> because<00:00:42.379> it

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the mpu 60 50 is special because it

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
the mpu 60 50 is special because it
includes<00:00:43.980> both<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.309> tri-axial

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
includes both the tri-axial

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.319 
includes both the tri-axial
accelerometer<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.899> gyroscope<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.910> single

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
accelerometer and gyroscope on a single

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:58.220 
accelerometer and gyroscope on a single
die<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> I've<00:00:51.739> added<00:00:53.329> an<00:00:54.329> hmc<00:00:56.210> 5843<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
die so I've added an hmc 5843 on the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.390 
die so I've added an hmc 5843 on the
auxiliary<00:00:58.949> bus<00:01:00.170> on<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.739> evaluation<00:01:02.370> board

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
auxiliary bus on the evaluation board

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.570 
auxiliary bus on the evaluation board
right<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:07.350> rapid<00:01:07.890> prototyping

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
right now just for rapid prototyping

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.570 
right now just for rapid prototyping
sick<00:01:08.909> I'm<00:01:09.470> bringing<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.799> into<00:01:11.189> processing

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
sick I'm bringing that into processing

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.670 
sick I'm bringing that into processing
three<00:01:14.580> last<00:01:14.939> values<00:01:15.479> are<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> external

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
three last values are the external

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.140 
three last values are the external
magnetometer<00:01:17.670> values<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> three<00:01:20.610> first<00:01:20.909> ones

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
magnetometer values the three first ones

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:31.750 
magnetometer values the three first ones
or<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> accelerometer<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.460> here

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.380 

and<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:34.110> next<00:01:34.320> three<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.010> gyro<00:01:35.580> this<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and the next three are the gyro this is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.100 
and the next three are the gyro this is
some<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.900> high<00:01:37.140> frequency<00:01:37.830> unfiltered

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
some really high frequency unfiltered

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.330 
some really high frequency unfiltered
output<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:41.720> until<00:01:42.720> InvenSense<00:01:43.350> grants

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
output and until InvenSense grants

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.730 
output and until InvenSense grants
access<00:01:44.550> to<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.150> digital<00:01:45.690> motion<00:01:46.229> processor

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
access to the digital motion processor

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.340 
access to the digital motion processor
circuitry<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.210> chip<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.870> really

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
circuitry on the chip which is really

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.380 
circuitry on the chip which is really
what<00:01:49.620> makes<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.040> special<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:54.270> know

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
what makes it special it will you know

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.760 
what makes it special it will you know
I'm<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> work<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.650> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I'm just going to work with the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.730 
I'm just going to work with the
unfiltered<00:01:56.070> data<00:01:56.250> anyhow<00:01:57.350> yeah<00:01:58.350> that's<00:01:58.680> what

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
unfiltered data anyhow yeah that's what

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.600 
unfiltered data anyhow yeah that's what
I've<00:01:58.950> been<00:01:58.979> playing<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.490> today<00:01:59.670> right
