two<00:00:22.830> different<00:00:22.859> versions<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.430> resist<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> PC

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
two different versions of resist the PC

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.420 
two different versions of resist the PC
version<00:00:24.630> which<00:00:24.750> we'd<00:00:24.960> normally<00:00:25.199> use<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.890> if

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
version which we'd normally use for if

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.279 
version which we'd normally use for if
you're<00:00:26.580> switching<00:00:26.789> from<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.210> non<00:00:27.449> galaxy<00:00:28.019> phone

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
you're switching from a non galaxy phone

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
you're switching from a non galaxy phone
to<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> galaxy<00:00:29.070> phone<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:30.240> case<00:00:30.480> we're

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
to a galaxy phone in this case we're

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.150 
to a galaxy phone in this case we're
actually<00:00:31.050> transferring<00:00:31.439> between<00:00:31.590> two

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
actually transferring between two

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680 
actually transferring between two
different<00:00:32.340> pretty<00:00:33.000> much<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> same<00:00:33.480> galaxy

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
different pretty much the same galaxy

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.630 
different pretty much the same galaxy

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
Mobile and then we bring it up here now

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.810 
Mobile and then we bring it up here now
the<00:01:15.060> way<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:15.840> connect<00:01:16.439> essentially<00:01:17.310> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the way they connect essentially is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
the way they connect essentially is
through<00:01:18.180> audio<00:01:18.570> frequencies<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.380> can

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
through audio frequencies they can

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.920 
through audio frequencies they can
that's<00:01:19.979> basically<00:01:20.310> how<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:20.810> hear<00:01:21.810> each

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that's basically how they hear each

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.080 
that's basically how they hear each
other<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.290> connect<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> each<00:01:22.770> other<00:01:22.979> rather<00:01:23.220> so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
other or connect to each other rather so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.149 
other or connect to each other rather so
what<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> pay<00:01:25.710> much<00:01:25.890> you

what you want to do is you pay much you
can<00:01:26.310> read<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> directions<00:01:26.759> here's<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.420> know

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
can read the directions here's you know

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.840 
can read the directions here's you know
you<00:01:27.659> bring<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> device<00:01:28.110> within<00:01:28.619> 50<00:01:28.950> meters<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
you bring the device within 50 meters of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
you bring the device within 50 meters of
each<00:01:30.030> 50<00:01:30.329> centimeters<00:01:30.810> open<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> Smart

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
each 50 centimeters open the Smart

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
each 50 centimeters open the Smart
Switch<00:01:31.920> smart<00:01:32.430> switching<00:01:32.820> both<00:01:32.970> devices<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> I

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
Switch smart switching both devices so I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
Switch smart switching both devices so I
connect<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> devices<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
connect to one of the devices and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.710 
connect to one of the devices and
transfer<00:01:37.560> data<00:01:37.880> once<00:01:38.880> you're<00:01:39.060> connected<00:01:39.299> so

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
transfer data once you're connected so

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.649 
transfer data once you're connected so
why<00:01:40.470> connect<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
why connect here and you can see the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.440 
why connect here and you can see the
other<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:42.990> starts<00:01:43.350> up

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.999 

now<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.170> is<00:01:47.229> probably<00:01:47.439> gonna<00:01:47.560> be<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.740> key

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
now this is probably gonna be a key

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.440 
now this is probably gonna be a key
thing<00:01:48.220> you're<00:01:48.340> gonna<00:01:48.460> use<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.820> safe<00:01:49.240> you're

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
thing you're gonna use a safe you're

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.980 
thing you're gonna use a safe you're
gonna<00:01:49.570> go<00:01:49.810> from<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.850> galaxy<00:01:51.850> s4<00:01:52.090> galaxy<00:01:52.689> s3

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
gonna go from a galaxy s4 galaxy s3

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
because there's so many math text

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.860 
because there's so many math text
messages<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.550> had<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:24.850> transfer<00:04:25.270> over<00:04:25.420> so

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
messages that had the transfer over so

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.960 
messages that had the transfer over so
you<00:04:26.650> got<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.860> be<00:04:26.950> kind<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.460> conscious<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:27.850> if

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.310 
them through Wi-Fi to rec so you got to
remember<00:04:31.000> it<00:04:31.420> it's<00:04:31.600> not<00:04:31.690> only<00:04:31.750> transferring
