I was thinking of and that I had in mind
so<00:02:03.619> this<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.159> v-neck<00:02:06.469> thought<00:02:07.469> you're

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
so this is the v-neck thought you're

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.199 
so this is the v-neck thought you're
gonna<00:02:07.950> see<00:02:08.670> once<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:11.009> major<00:02:11.430> cuts<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
gonna see once you have major cuts and

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.320 
gonna see once you have major cuts and
stuff<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
stuff like that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.920 
stuff like that
sooo<00:02:14.460> okay<00:02:15.460> I'm<00:02:15.700> going<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:15.970> just<00:02:16.030> put<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.570> on

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
sooo okay I'm going to just put this on

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.020 
sooo okay I'm going to just put this on
over<00:02:17.620> my<00:02:17.770> shirt<00:02:18.070> so<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:18.580> see<00:02:18.820> what<00:02:18.940> it

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
over my shirt so you can see what it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.860 
over my shirt so you can see what it
looks<00:02:19.210> like

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
looks like

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.030
