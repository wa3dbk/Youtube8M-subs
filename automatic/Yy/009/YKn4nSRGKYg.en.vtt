00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:10.469
 in general, the whole point is that two 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.790
 standard pants here mount under 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:19.100
 ordinary carb carburetor tip that is here 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.900
 she here she mount 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:28.410
 Here such that is, it is suitable only 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:33.840
 there are these three pawns here 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:40.860
 way to give here mount in posku under 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:43.670
 hairpin under the usual hairpin on 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.870
 geek carburetor 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:57.890
 carburetor with dikov fasteners to here such 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.890
 Here rezinochka and generally dirty trick that 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:08.760
 hole in the first peak we are not 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.409
 match well then of course you can say 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:21.680
 that all this can be adjusted to waste and 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:23.580
 so on but there is a second question to 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 this rubber 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:37.460
 on one adjoined to our usual 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:37.460
 standard standard countries but 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.910
 in general, if you connect them then this 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.120
 rezinochka she loosely fit and 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.430
 means sucking air in general all this 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:57.890
 the system also does not inspire confidence 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:05.460
 I had this carburetor at sunrise 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:08.700
 33 of the party on which the plant stood 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.320
 this carburetor at sunrise and on it the show 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:17.910
 here is such an adapter adapter is put 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.400
 as follows that is the essence of it 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:27.120
 adapter 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:33.060
 in that this rezinochka so that she as 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:36.680
 would now disconnect the seals so that you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 rezinochka she lay tight 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:45.540
 the carburetor so well then you can continue 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.280
 deal with here together, I do not know at 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.540
 I stood at sunrise like that 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.540
 kaigu were still close 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.650
 here these bolts they come from 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.579
 supplied 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.849
 curls on instead of pants that is 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:14.299
 here it is so it rolls over 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:20.150
 somehow neatly the whole thing with this 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:22.909
 hand put the carburetor rubber with 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.370
 this side here so you're screwed to 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:32.200
 the camps of our usual Izhevsk Soviet 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:39.790
 shorter mount without these here 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:44.870
 gum all of these will come even a carburetor 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.000
 placing here it is clear that the strengthening here 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.129
 This is all basically draws bonds 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.139
 for him and in general we replace all of them with one and 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:04:00.010
 the same but the St. Petersburg special mills 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:03.699
 there are simply no rezinochku 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.989
 surface added such casting 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:14.389
 what is it that you yourself are well 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:19.030
 I wanted to clarify this 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:25.300
 the conflict between the carburetor peaks and 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.300
 standard Soviet mount all
