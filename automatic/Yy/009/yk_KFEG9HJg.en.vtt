00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.699
 all 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.290
 so in this video I'll show you 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.630
 how to make an excellent ice cream yes 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 comment also you asked us how 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.970
 prepare a version of ice cream the most 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.000
 healthy and light compared to ice cream 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.610
 also bought classic ice cream 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980
 then with the cream or the eggs and the yolks 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.660
 therefore quite fat 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 we started doing some tests 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.050
 they discovered ice cream was not 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.630
 just as simple because for 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.660
 make them which decrement needed 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.609
 a good dose of fat inside 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.800
 then we started experimenting 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:45.750
 and use only good fats 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.449
 trying to get rid of the cream by removing 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.239
 absolutely memories in the eggs and 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.070
 we started doing these tests 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.949
 finally we managed to get 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 a perfect recipe for ice creams are 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.019
 very proud because he will come 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.890
 upgraded great will not be the classic 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.050
 ice cream between the quarrel that becomes almost a 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.500
 sorbet then removing everything stay 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.180
 water and sugar at the end and fruit 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.340
 instead this one looks very creamy 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.830
 just the pd ice cream bought at 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 supermarket in ice cream parlor I will 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.550
 I guarantee this is what you have to do 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.710
 absolutely recipe living the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.550
 ingredients we will need presents 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.820
 fifty grams of rice milk 70 g 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.640
 of coconut meat 60 g of sugar of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.430
 white house 4 grams of flour 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.650
 carob and 200 grams of why pulp 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.780
 then we begin immediately to do the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.750
 ice cream is very simple 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.620
 then mix 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.340
 dispare the recipe to design it is not 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.110
 easy but then the procedure is a lot 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.140
 very simple 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.020
 therefore I have indicated 200 g of pulp 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.110
 of fruit this still and all the people 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.420
 it was then we will pass it with dough but 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.310
 with the blender and sells will serve 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.920
 then 200 grams not the source at the fair 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.630
 then let's start and put into the 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.630
 100 linen rice milk 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.630
 I chose rice milk though 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.200
 committed you have you can put milk 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.870
 what do you want 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.230
 also wanting a cow's milk if not 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.500
 you want to do the megan version then 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.660
 let's put in the guilt of coconut 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.920
 the fault of coconut is not really milk 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.360
 of coconut 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.510
 you have to go look for the side 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.810
 infection that has written cream 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.850
 coconut fault every brand then indicates it 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.430
 in a different way and it is the most part 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.410
 fat of the art then of the body if 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.890
 but you only have plates you can 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.340
 do as I do that you separate it 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.830
 the latin bnp cuddly at the latina or dal 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.049
 I was putting in a jug 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.660
 wait a few hours for the water to come 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.360
 deposits on the bottom and the biggest fault 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.049
 go up high with the spoon go 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.510
 to pick the blame ok this one 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.510
 will be our most hunting part 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.959
 which basically replaces the earth 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.920
 now let's put the saucepan on the stove 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.620
 let's get to one 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.150
 temperature of around 80 degrees though if 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.230
 you don't have the thermometer, for example 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.000
 I don't have it 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.590
 it will be enough for you to feel when it is enough 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.920
 hot with so much that milk warms up and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.989
 we can put carob flour 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.930
 in sugar this is not a 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.640
 I touched the supermarket at 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.160
 organic cane sugar is found 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.989
 white I recommend it because then it 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.720
 brown cane sugar lasts a while 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.950
 too much ice cream so if it stays longer 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.900
 white flour is also better 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.590
 heat is easily found at 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.110
 biological 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.500
 or if you have n't found in organic stores 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.260
 but very difficult you can look in 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.120
 stores that sell wholesale 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.700
 sell or supply the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.590
 pastry shops and ice cream parlors as you can 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.340
 also ask about dairy ice cream parlor 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.519
 crafts 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.370
 if they give you some carob flour or 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.800
 the neutral one the powder that is used in 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.140
 evenings are called inside you can 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.030
 or to ask very little mortar also 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.539
 milk hot enough so now 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.450
 take an immersion blender 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:39.740
 I call myself to pour it down 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.740
 sugar with carob flour 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:48.919
 ok it's up to you to melt 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:54.229
 we all do now get to 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:57.639
 boil and then remove from heat 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.990
 the milk is boiling it so I can 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.530
 we will put out put in a jug for 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.449
 let it cool and then when it will be a 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.990
 room temperature is put in the fridge 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.930
 for at least a couple of hours senate we cut 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.639
 the fruit and now I'm doing bits and pieces 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.639
 I chose peaches mum isn't either 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.990
 apricots the fruit you prefer 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.320
 as long as it's not too much fruit 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.479
 he accuses because then he forms you a little 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.910
 ice lolly so it gets a little too much 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.510
 sorbet and little fruit plus 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.970
 mature more compact and better after having 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.160
 cut the fruit into small pieces we find 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:39.080
 the peel and then the cork, then the 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.940
 milk is lower it is ending up 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.100
 cool down but still we are 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.680
 the ice cream maker is cooling nor every 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.229
 so we founded our guilt of 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.210
 peaches now we dream of putting 1 2 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.780
 spoons of liqueur I chose a rum 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:57.139
 and liquor you may not even put it 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:06:01.960
 serves to prevent it from freezing and from a 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.960
 good aroma though open baby channels 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.340
 then almost fig cold milk 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.790
 I'm going to be a sentence right away 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.270
 Latin freezing hands will have started 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.890
 take some creamy consistency 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.600
 illustrate ourselves a little bit we go trade 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.130
 he knows we don't put it at the end 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.340
 because otherwise I'll do some 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:28.900
 difficulty to blend well we can 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:31.900
 then pour the chorea and we do 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.940
 end of failed reinterpretation today is the 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.390
 our ice cream the ready I turn off the 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.390
 jelly 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:52.960
 here is the dirt of if keep it pressed 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.810
 select recipe 10 absolutely you 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.530
