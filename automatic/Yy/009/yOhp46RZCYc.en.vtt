floral wire and then you need some fake
flowers<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.710> could<00:00:22.830> use<00:00:22.980> real<00:00:23.220> ones<00:00:23.460> except

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
flowers you could use real ones except

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.240 
flowers you could use real ones except
for<00:00:24.180> they<00:00:24.390> would<00:00:24.570> fall<00:00:24.869> off<00:00:24.900> faster<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
for they would fall off faster so I

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.820 
for they would fall off faster so I
chose<00:00:26.820> ones<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.930> were<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> same<00:00:28.500> color

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
chose ones that were in the same color

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.420 
chose ones that were in the same color
theme<00:00:29.810> colors<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.050> make<00:00:31.260> me<00:00:31.439> feel<00:00:31.470> good

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
theme colors that make me feel good

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.330 
theme colors that make me feel good
chose<00:00:33.030> oranges<00:00:33.840> reds<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.469> yellows<00:00:34.559> they're

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
chose oranges reds and yellows they're

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.549 
chose oranges reds and yellows they're
good<00:00:35.550> colors<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.030> make<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.329> make<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.140> happy

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
good colors to make you make you happy

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.069 
good colors to make you make you happy
the<00:00:38.190> first<00:00:38.489> step<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.300> stem<00:00:39.540> wires<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the first step is the stem wires that I

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.799 
the first step is the stem wires that I
have<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:40.739> long<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.270> like<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> cut

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
have are really long so I like to cut

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
have are really long so I like to cut
them<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.079> thirds<00:00:43.670> because<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.210> makes

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
them in thirds because I think it makes

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.729 
them in thirds because I think it makes
it<00:00:45.539> easier<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> work<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.559> maybe

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it easier to work with this is maybe

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.350 
it easier to work with this is maybe
like<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> fourth<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
like a fourth but that's because the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.200 
like a fourth but that's because the
leftover<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.469> use<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.770> anyway<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
leftover we can use this anyway so and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.200 
leftover we can use this anyway so and
then<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.719> grab<00:00:52.370> one<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.699> flowers

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
then you just grab one of your flowers

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
then you just grab one of your flowers
or<00:00:54.480> flower<00:00:54.780> sections<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.559> case<00:00:55.770> they

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
or flower sections in this case they

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.380 
or flower sections in this case they
came<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.489> mini<00:00:57.210> tripods<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:59.359> grab<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
came in little mini tripods and grab it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.030 
came in little mini tripods and grab it
at<00:01:00.629> this

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
at this

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.160 
at this
it's<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.210> hard<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:03.480> make<00:01:03.630> it<00:01:03.780> look<00:01:04.019> good

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
it's not that hard I make it look good

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.590 
it's not that hard I make it look good
then<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.070> wire<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.940> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
then you just take your wire and I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.090 
then you just take your wire and I
always<00:01:09.780> wrap<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> around<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> stem<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
I'm just going to wrap it one time just

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.770 
I'm just going to wrap it one time just
by<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.869> hand<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.789> see<00:01:41.940> some<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.450> back

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
by my hand you can see some of that back

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
by my hand you can see some of that back
there<00:01:43.080> how<00:01:43.710> I've<00:01:43.890> done<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> other<00:01:44.580> ones

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
there how I've done with the other ones

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.910 
there how I've done with the other ones
it's<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.300> same<00:01:45.509> thing<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.200> order<00:01:46.440> for<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's the same thing in order for not to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.160 
it's the same thing in order for not to
get<00:01:47.039> ugly<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.880> want<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.149> have<00:01:48.300> like<00:01:48.509> layers<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
get ugly you want to have like layers of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
get ugly you want to have like layers of
them<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.380> think<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.160> can't<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.640> all

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
them I think so that you can't see all

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.389 
them I think so that you can't see all
the<00:01:50.970> wire<00:01:51.180> from<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> front<00:01:51.990> but<00:01:52.830> nobody<00:01:53.160> cares

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the wire from the front but nobody cares

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.620 
the wire from the front but nobody cares
what's<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.789> the<00:01:53.850> list<00:01:54.539> from<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.929> inside<00:01:56.630> okay

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
what's in the list from the inside okay

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.020 
what's in the list from the inside okay
and<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.380> there's<00:01:58.800> too<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.850> just

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and then if there's too much you just

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.749 
and then if there's too much you just
trim<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> trim<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> wire<00:02:04.009> tighten<00:02:05.009> it

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.580 

let<00:02:10.330> it's<00:02:10.509> tight<00:02:10.810> against<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.550> basket

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
let it's tight against the basket

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
let it's tight against the basket
