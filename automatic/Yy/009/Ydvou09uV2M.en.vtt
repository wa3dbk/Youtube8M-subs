00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so dear subscribers we are playing build 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.710
 Battle on apple Kraft server yes here 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.429
 opened the build battle and he just simply 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.759
 drop dead 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.590
 and we need to build a ski stick theme 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.960
 just from god okay basically we 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.789
 what can we do right away 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.340
 change site settings well meaning 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:33.649
 put the ice well, well, just stick this time 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.950
 ski so what do we need more we need 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:43.110
 we need some dark wood 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.719
 there now here somewhere here 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.260
 so that's okay so let's say 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.899
 let's we build not a ski stick 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.559
 separately but stupidly themselves skiing 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:01.969
 well, take off the ski stick let's begin 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:06.270
 now let's say this will be their end 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.540
 skis themselves and the day and you will not go 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.930
 along so here so ok well yet 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.280
 here let's get here like this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 so here it is now clear and now 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.100
 let's do it right here somewhere 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 distance exactly the same design 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:32.690
 so here so here so here so and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:36.090
 here is another block and build on 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.220
 so here so now these skis already 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.520
 more less like to ski, let 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.740
 let's give them a second layer from here though 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.290
 we do not have much time we still have a wand 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:53.190
 build so here and here here so 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.050
 we will do it and we will do it the same way 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.580
 track 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.130
 generally drop dead but I 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.840
 I hope I won because I don’t 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.610
 Basically it looks beautiful although it can 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.149
 be this texture pack wait i play 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.350
 2101 by the way link to the review 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.039
 I will leave a description 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.370
 download see there play those who 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.910
 wants and let's from here such a tree 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.200
 let's make these ski boards in my opinion they 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.040
 doing something like this here is something like a shelf 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.800
 big here will be a pen here let's say 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.739
 I saw them once in the mountains 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.220
 when I went skiing did not ride but 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.560
 Still, I've seen one example of how such 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 chopsticks 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.670
 here it is something like a pen so here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.940
 this one at the very end is something like 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:53.060
 such a small ring 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.459
 such 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.189
 wow, that's something like this 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.299
 Now let and even construct a 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:06.689
 one here here we are on some blocks 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.690
 this here but this line here in this 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.620
 parts so let's build up I don't know 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.629
 what level 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:19.920
 but here on the second block we will have 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:24.269
 such a ring so well so 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.239
 Now wait 699 blocks from here 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.790
 a game 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:34.950
 69 and on the ninth block that's all 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.569
 right so here so for those who are not 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.329
 I understood now from reading the amount 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.370
 blocks from here to the top to handle 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.519
 following the example of that so here we are 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:50.849
 raise by 3 as I remember yes by 3 well 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.440
 this handle carry so all now we kind of 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.540
 our skis are ready 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.199
 but we still have some time left 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.870
 to a little 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:04.379
 correct here in this style 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.299
 Well, so here's another do that damn cottage 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:12.030
 not put like this like this like this way 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.500
 now all here and now we do here 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.289
 here we will do one more 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.989
 great at raising what they should 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.660
 be in my opinion I don’t remember exactly 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.010
 Already once seen in real life 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.110
 We did not have time to build any 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.770
 dude and by the way let's see what 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.349
 defects 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.940
 effects time material polo effects 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:34.110
 no head we don't need 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:38.180
 weather weather snow let's arrange here 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.180
 snow and screenshot 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.050
 so here for the avatar just right so 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.180
 but I hope I won because I don’t 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.780
 i built a nice ski stick like 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:55.360
 said so let's take a taxi with us 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:58.979
 exactly then everything is clear so let's four 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:03.460
 three two one 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:07.900
 all clear at all let's keep buildings 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.810
 we Zion whole structure with no hope 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.030
 my way and bye observer bent and 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.979
 we start as always with my construction 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.289
 damn well damn well a stranger will not put people 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.599

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:39.069
 dude this is not skiing there too ski poles 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:41.610
 Close there is not exactly writing those shelves 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:46.030
 skiing does n't even seem like skiing 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.070
 sorry of course but it’s generally 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.090
 some kind of cobblestones built but all 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:55.090
 I will give you bad because I do not 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.190
 I know how it is not so not I imagine 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.080
 Of course here the texture pack just a little 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.500
 under the subject changes me well of course you 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.659

 this format wool with flowers but still 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:11.759
 it was necessary by the very block it was not 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:16.419

 beautiful even very much like this 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:30.009
 here is a wine circle I imagined 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:33.039
 however I wanted to deliver well but not 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.740
 had time to look for such an aunt in glasses 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.260
 generally just drop dead here for this 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.870
 the building I will put it 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.880
 and still bear the days for minutes 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.430
 tolerated 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:48.150

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:51.010

 Generally terrible, just do not leave me well 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:58.330
 for a long time he tried to build this stick 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:07:01.510
 the barbell is correct in general the person is not in this 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.760

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.680
 ok but also like in the morning here 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:09.190
 First, I did not have to try for a long time. 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:13.840
 to build it all and not much 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:16.540
 I put it tolerantly here I will put it 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.210
 bad for a while you tried when you built 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.520
 I certainly appreciated this dude 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.650

 seriously forgive if I offended someone 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.550
 if the author you can build but all 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.290
 same way and that's a winner and I am the way 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.150
