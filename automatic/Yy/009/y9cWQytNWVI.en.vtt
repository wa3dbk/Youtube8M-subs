00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello everyone decided to do today 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.109
 a small review on the bottle Dr. Pepper 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.070
 but also on the bottle coca-cola which so 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 produced bottled and as the price 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.240
 the price is the same in full and that's what 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.989
 I didnâ€™t like the most about it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:43.530
 is that the lid so now this is now 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:48.620
 the cap is stolen that's the doctor 's cap 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:53.750
 and here's a coca-cola cap 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 from above they do not look like 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:05.180
 here it is more flat but here it is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:11.580
 such a curved well so that should still same 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:16.260
 it's made of plants is not normal this 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.660
 something like that here 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.900
 In this I can say that there is caffeine and 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.990
 this taste is not so let's then 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.880
 try to pour each cup 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:35.520
 by doctor peter and coca cola 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 zero equal amount and try 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880
 drink up 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:51.500
 well and here after opening these bottles and 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.990
 I found that Dr. Pepper and it is on 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:02.720
 completely motionless i stayed this 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:07.580
 the thing to do here is completely 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.160
 such a stable stands still and here 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.110
 these are not like that 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.590
 the latch is not for the slits above the doctor these 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.420
 things that hold the cork they all 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.870
 almost the same 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.959
 came off and I will tell you at once that Coca-Cola 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.980
 this is a moving ring 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:35.870
 his immunity can also be crippled 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:42.680
 take off with your finger in general is easy 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:46.400
 just like this and these things 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.900
 who hold the cork they are all they 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:55.220
 steadily detached from jumping 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:59.060
 so here it is to remove the ringlet there 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:03.250
 even the place is not that finger hurt well 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:08.860
 let's pour now and wait a little more here 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.860
 rubber pad is still there 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.530
 which is hard forces so it used to be 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.840
 sang a bottle was so because about 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.930
 I will say this cork 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.380
 she has almost identical sounds on quality 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.990
 surely doctor peper wins 10 bye 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.970
 so what now we will try 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:40.300

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.300

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:56.160

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:59.630

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.660

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.660
