the ports always embrace new
technologies<00:01:21.430> we<00:01:21.909> were<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.120> first<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.570> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
technologies we were the first on the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.440 
technologies we were the first on the
west<00:01:22.840> coast<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.200> adopt<00:01:23.530> containerization

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
west coast to adopt containerization

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.190 
west coast to adopt containerization
because<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.570> our<00:01:25.690> extensive<00:01:26.049> rail

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
because of our extensive rail

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.899 
because of our extensive rail
connections<00:01:26.710> we<00:01:26.950> developed<00:01:27.430> intermodal

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
connections we developed intermodal

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.460 
connections we developed intermodal
transport<00:01:28.450> methods<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.900> get<00:01:29.020> containers

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
transport methods that get containers

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.210 
transport methods that get containers
from<00:01:29.590> shifts<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.190> trucks<00:01:30.460> efficiently<00:01:32.220> this

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
from shifts to trucks efficiently this

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.410 
from shifts to trucks efficiently this
has<00:01:33.340> helped<00:01:33.550> us<00:01:33.640> relieve<00:01:33.910> traffic<00:01:34.120> congestion

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
has helped us relieve traffic congestion

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.360 
has helped us relieve traffic congestion
on<00:01:34.930> nearby<00:01:35.080> highways<00:01:35.470> because<00:01:35.620> trucks<00:01:36.160> don't

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
on nearby highways because trucks don't

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.200 
on nearby highways because trucks don't
have<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.640> make<00:01:36.790> as<00:01:36.910> many<00:01:37.030> trips<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:37.510> them

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
have to make as many trips on them

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.900 
have to make as many trips on them
faster<00:01:40.210> more<00:01:40.480> secure<00:01:40.840> we<00:01:41.020> keep<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.530> moving
