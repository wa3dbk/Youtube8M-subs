know have this out like in a very cold

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.959 
know have this out like in a very cold
environment<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> plastic<00:00:38.399> may<00:00:38.579> become

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
environment the plastic may become

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
environment the plastic may become
brittle<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.329> crack<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.530> feels<00:00:40.770> like

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

I'm<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.369> sure<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.640> they're<00:01:11.729> made<00:01:11.880> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
I'm not really sure what they're made of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.240 
I'm not really sure what they're made of
they're<00:01:12.090> definitely<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.479> sort<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> cotton

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
they're definitely some sort of cotton

don't smell like they're soaked in

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
don't smell like they're soaked in
anything<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.540> they<00:01:15.659> probably<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.530> sort

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
anything but they probably got some sort

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.390 
anything but they probably got some sort
of<00:01:16.770> chemical<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.189> them<00:01:17.600> all<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.400> here's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
of chemical on them all right so here's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.469 
of chemical on them all right so here's

survival<00:01:28.500> spark<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.070> that's<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.280> is

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
survival spark I think that's what is

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
survival spark I think that's what is
called<00:01:30.020> basically<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> same<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> has

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
called basically the same thing this has

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
called basically the same thing this has
been<00:01:31.950> around<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.430> longer<00:01:32.490> they

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
been around for a lot longer they

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.840 
been around for a lot longer they
basically<00:01:33.600> took<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.020> idea<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.490> ran<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.549> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
basically took this idea and ran with it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.910 
basically took this idea and ran with it
so<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.960> plastic<00:01:37.200> right<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so this is all plastic right here and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.410 
so this is all plastic right here and
then<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.130> got<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.400> he's<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> flint

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
then it's got this he's got a flint

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.200 
then it's got this he's got a flint
built<00:01:39.630> into<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.790> got<00:01:41.939> arrows

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
built into it and it's got arrows

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.510 
built into it and it's got arrows
telling<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:42.659> way<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> pull<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.520> I'll

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
telling you which way to pull so I'll

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.800 
telling you which way to pull so I'll
move<00:01:44.640> these<00:01:44.759> all<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> way<00:01:45.030> before<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.510 

these<00:01:48.810> things<00:01:49.020> lighting<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.829> sorrel<00:01:50.189> kits<00:01:50.340> on

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
these things lighting my sorrel kits on

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:02.719 
these things lighting my sorrel kits on
stuff<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.210> fire<00:01:52.460> so

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.889 

all<00:02:03.729> right<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.299> get<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.509> idea

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
all right you get the idea

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.480 
all right you get the idea
it's<00:02:05.560> kind<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.740> hard<00:02:05.920> reaching<00:02:06.219> around<00:02:06.429> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
it's kind of hard reaching around the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.639 
it's kind of hard reaching around the
camera<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.000> while<00:02:07.270> holding<00:02:07.450> these<00:02:07.659> things<00:02:07.929> so

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
camera and while holding these things so

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.680 
camera and while holding these things so
that's<00:02:08.769> how<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:08.979> works

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that's how it works

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.160 
that's how it works
all<00:02:10.690> right<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:12.090> think<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.300> read<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:13.989> like

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
all right I think I read that it's like

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.650 
all right I think I read that it's like
good<00:02:14.349> for<00:02:14.470> ten<00:02:14.739> thousand<00:02:15.280> strikes<00:02:15.910> different

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
good for ten thousand strikes different

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.619 
good for ten thousand strikes different
so<00:02:17.610> takes<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> more<00:02:18.849> than<00:02:19.000> ten<00:02:19.209> thousand

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
so takes you more than ten thousand

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.839 
so takes you more than ten thousand
strikes<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:22.769> light<00:02:23.769> a<00:02:23.799> fire<00:02:23.920> you're

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
strikes to light a fire you're

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.420 
strikes to light a fire you're
anyways<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:26.200> here's<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.560> little<00:02:26.980> instruction

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
anyways so here's the little instruction

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.940 
anyways so here's the little instruction
kit<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.760> came<00:02:27.879> with<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.560> spark<00:02:29.560> light<00:02:29.739> should

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
kit that came with it spark light should

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.750 
kit that came with it spark light should
we<00:02:30.040> tested<00:02:30.459> yearly<00:02:32.130> there's<00:02:33.130> really<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.579> this

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
we tested yearly there's really of this

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.640 
we tested yearly there's really of this
was<00:02:33.940> made<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.450> kit<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.140> 93

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
was made in the kit that I have is 93

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.720 
was made in the kit that I have is 93
but<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:36.099> looks<00:02:36.280> pretty<00:02:36.430> good

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
but it looks pretty good

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.190 
but it looks pretty good

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
definitely with the tender quicks you

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.199 
definitely with the tender quicks you
could<00:03:37.540> even<00:03:38.370> I'm<00:03:39.370> not<00:03:39.549> gonna<00:03:39.700> pull<00:03:40.000> my<00:03:40.090> knees

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
apart right now but the way that it

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:46.229 
apart right now but the way that it
looks<00:03:42.819> like<00:03:42.970> they're<00:03:43.150> formed<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.730> may<00:03:45.910> even

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
looks like they're formed you may even

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.809 
looks like they're formed you may even
take<00:03:46.389> a<00:03:46.450> knife<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.109> cut<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:47.919> in<00:03:48.099> half<00:03:48.130> and

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
take a knife and cut this in half and

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.640 
take a knife and cut this in half and
you<00:03:49.269> might<00:03:49.450> still<00:03:49.690> be<00:03:49.750> able<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.019> do<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.380> if

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
you might still be able to do it so if

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.080 
you might still be able to do it so if
you<00:03:50.799> cut<00:03:50.980> these<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.220> half<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.639> works<00:03:51.849> and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
you cut these in half and that works and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.740 
you cut these in half and that works and
that's<00:03:54.090> sixteenth<00:03:55.090> fires<00:03:55.329> that<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.630> can

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
that's sixteenth fires that you can

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.470 
that's sixteenth fires that you can
start<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.669> definitely<00:04:00.669> I<00:04:00.760> mean<00:04:01.000> for<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.299> size

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
start so definitely I mean for the size

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.300 
start so definitely I mean for the size
