00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.110
 one day I asked what would become of me 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.470
 when they open 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:21.240
 I did not know what the future would bring 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:25.689
 doubt everything was so start I thought 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:30.869
 footballer could have been better 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.869
 maybe police fireman maybe broken 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.090
 once someone bright said do what 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.250
 what you like and you will not have to work 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.780
 not a day of your life feels what you do 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.720
 imagine an ideal world and do it 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.120
 reality turns your dreams into magic and 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.730
 live life as if today did not have 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.220
 tomorrow become the captain of your 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.180
 own boat and discover new 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.900
 opportunities and fears 20 years doing 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.880
 art and culture I'm a project producer 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.880
 I am a communicator 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.950
 543 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.950
 two 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.900
 I believe that interest for me means 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.020
 life the itv for me means training 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.770
 means training and means the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.200
 beginning of a dream that I would be a 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.690
 ungrateful if I do not recognize that the itv has 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.610
 totally marked my life from 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.310
 this time I take off my hat when 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.130
 you're already on a television channel 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.960
 small big you see the result of what 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.360
 that you learned from everything that you 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040
 gave in the mesh of each subject was 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.659
 something that has contributed and actually 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.910
 when already you practice it 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.460
 you know that everything can for good that what 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.220
 main thing that I learned and that I consider 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.759
 which is a great strength is the knowledge 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.320
 work in a team and do it with passion 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.050
 I am very happy that you continue 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.020
 keep growing because one thing is 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.179
 start well but stay well is the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.330
 true challenge is an institution of the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.220
 which I value very much I read a lot and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.459
 I will always be grateful 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.490
 everything that has given me so much in what 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.200
 personal as not as professional 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.360
 I congratulate ITV for these 20 years and
