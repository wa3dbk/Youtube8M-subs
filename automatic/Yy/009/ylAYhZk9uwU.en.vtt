Devon YouTube there's a switch fighter

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.670 
Devon YouTube there's a switch fighter
trike<00:00:56.239> here's<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.480> original<00:00:57.600> base<00:00:58.109> which<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
trike here's the original base which I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.330 
trike here's the original base which I
turned<00:00:58.739> into<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> launch<00:00:59.489> pad<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.539> radar<00:01:01.340> I've

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
turned into a launch pad with radar I've

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.450 
turned into a launch pad with radar I've
moved<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.789> elevator<00:01:05.330> down<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
moved the elevator down here to this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.160 
moved the elevator down here to this
side<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.990> was<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> being<00:01:10.380> right<00:01:10.590> there

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
side because it was to being right there

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.719 
side because it was to being right there
but<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.680> better<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.070> because<00:01:14.369> I

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
but I think it's better here because I

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.870 
but I think it's better here because I
have<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.330> there<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.280> how<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:17.460> get

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
have that there and this is how they get

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140 
have that there and this is how they get
the<00:01:18.060> pods<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.189> had<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the pods on and I had to do that in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.399 
the pods on and I had to do that in
order<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> make<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.049> pipe<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:23.430> down<00:01:23.610> there<00:01:24.409> so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
order to make that pipe go down there so

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
order to make that pipe go down there so
this<00:01:25.799> would<00:01:26.009> go<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.460> goes<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> pod

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
this would go this goes up with the pod

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.999 
this would go this goes up with the pod
put<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> pot<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.829> right<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:30.590> going<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:33.829> it<00:01:34.829> goes

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
put a pot in right now going up it goes

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.969 
put a pot in right now going up it goes
in<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.090> pipe<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.200> suck<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
in and then the pipe and then suck it

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.480 
in and then the pipe and then suck it

right ok now it's in there it's in that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.650 
right ok now it's in there it's in that
pipe<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.870> see<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.910> switch<00:02:46.910> in<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.150> pipe<00:02:47.330> over

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
pipe I see it switch in the pipe over

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.470 
pipe I see it switch in the pipe over
here<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.850> sometimes<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:50.030> do<00:02:50.090> have<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.390> little

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
here and sometimes I do have a little

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.980 
here and sometimes I do have a little
trouble<00:02:50.810> sometimes<00:02:51.140> but<00:02:53.170> going<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.290> print<00:02:54.530> it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
trouble sometimes but going to print it

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.250 
trouble sometimes but going to print it
and<00:02:56.990> there<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.370> gets<00:02:58.490> a<00:02:58.640> little<00:02:58.790> messy<00:02:58.880> but

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
and there it gets a little messy but

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.600 
and there it gets a little messy but
goes<00:03:00.260> right<00:03:00.500> through<00:03:00.740> into<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.100> command<00:03:01.430> base

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
goes right through into the command base

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.350 
goes right through into the command base
right<00:03:01.910> in<00:03:02.090> there<00:03:02.440> well<00:03:03.440> then<00:03:04.360> they<00:03:05.360> examine<00:03:05.840> it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
right in there well then they examine it

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.850 
right in there well then they examine it
goes<00:03:08.360> through<00:03:08.690> they<00:03:08.990> can<00:03:09.170> put<00:03:09.440> down<00:03:09.620> these

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
goes through they can put down these

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:19.410 
goes through they can put down these
things<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:15.130> let's<00:03:16.130> do<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:18.020> thing

here's<00:04:46.330> my<00:04:46.570> little<00:04:46.840> landing<00:04:47.350> area<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
here's my little landing area so the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.710 
here's my little landing area so the
Astros<00:04:49.530> can<00:04:50.530> run<00:04:50.740> through<00:04:51.070> here<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.120> board<00:04:52.570> a

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
Astros can run through here and board a

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.990 
Astros can run through here and board a
ship<00:04:52.780> quickly<00:04:53.320> more<00:04:54.100> quickly<00:04:54.130> than<00:04:54.550> going<00:04:54.760> out

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
ship quickly more quickly than going out

of the base running through the ships
docking<00:04:57.280> area<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:58.000> then<00:04:58.630> boarding<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.200> so

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
docking area and then boarding it so

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.160 
docking area and then boarding it so
