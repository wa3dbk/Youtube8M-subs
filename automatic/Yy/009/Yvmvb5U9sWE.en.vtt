stop by pressing the block button to
briefly<00:00:38.250> bring<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.850> shield<00:00:39.410> this<00:00:40.410> lets

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
briefly bring up your shield this lets

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.830 
briefly bring up your shield this lets
you<00:00:40.800> run<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.579> cancel<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> run<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
you run in and then cancel the run so

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.150 
you run in and then cancel the run so
that<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> forward<00:00:43.649> tilt<00:00:44.010> or

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
that you can do a forward tilt or

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.490 
that you can do a forward tilt or
something<00:00:44.520> instead<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.059> dash<00:00:45.210> attack

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
something instead of your dash attack

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
something instead of your dash attack
even<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:46.770> important<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> dash

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
even more important is that if you dash

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
even more important is that if you dash
in<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.210> hold<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.510> shield<00:00:48.840> you'll<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.500> able

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in and hold your shield you'll be able

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
in and hold your shield you'll be able
to<00:00:49.739> keep<00:00:49.950> your<00:00:50.160> momentum<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.789> slide<00:00:51.090> forward

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to keep your momentum and slide forward

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.819 
to keep your momentum and slide forward
just<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.410> helps<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
just a little bit and that helps to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
just a little bit and that helps to
extend<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.309> throw<00:00:53.579> range<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.719> how<00:00:54.809> far<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
extend your throw range see how far you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.150 
extend your throw range see how far you
can<00:00:55.199> throw<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.649> opponent<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.070> this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
can throw the opponent with this

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.020 
can throw the opponent with this
technique<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.039> also<00:00:59.280> cancel<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.850> dash

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
technique you can also cancel your dash

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
technique you can also cancel your dash
with<00:01:00.359> an<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.690> smash<00:01:01.050> instead<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> shield<00:01:02.280> but

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
with an up smash instead of a shield but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.889 
with an up smash instead of a shield but
you<00:01:02.699> can't<00:01:02.879> cancel<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.300> into<00:01:03.539> any<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you can't cancel it into any of the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.649 
you can't cancel it into any of the
other<00:01:04.019> smashes<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.460> easy<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> execute<00:01:06.330> this

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
other smashes it easy is to execute this

other smashes it easy is to execute this
if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> dash<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.740> press<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.549> the

this next one's pretty hard to execute

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.760 
this next one's pretty hard to execute
but<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:26.990> worth<00:01:27.140> learning<00:01:27.350> with<00:01:27.590> some

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
but it's worth learning with some

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.010 
but it's worth learning with some
characters<00:01:28.250> run<00:01:28.970> toward<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.390> opponent<00:01:29.900> and

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
then at the last moment hold away from

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.399 
then at the last moment hold away from
them<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.210> you<00:01:32.270> turn<00:01:32.420> around<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.900> then<00:01:33.050> jump

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
them so you turn around and then jump

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.680 
them so you turn around and then jump
and<00:01:33.710> then<00:01:34.250> towards<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.850> opponent<00:01:35.090> press<00:01:35.450> a

plus<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.570> attack<00:01:38.900> even<00:01:39.409> though<00:01:39.470> you're

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
plus a attack even though you're

plus a attack even though you're
traveling<00:01:40.040> towards<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.670> opponent<00:01:40.909> instead

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659

of<00:01:41.690> away<00:01:41.810> from<00:01:41.960> them<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.909> purpose<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.330> this<00:01:44.479> is

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
of away from them the purpose of this is

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.359 
of away from them the purpose of this is
that<00:01:44.750> many<00:01:45.050> characters<00:01:45.440> have<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.649> good<00:01:45.890> fast

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
that many characters have a good fast

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.330 
that many characters have a good fast
back<00:01:47.090> aerial<00:01:47.659> attack<00:01:48.110> like<00:01:48.649> Yoshi's<00:01:49.070> tail

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
attack but slower towards a attacks so

while<00:03:35.120> rising<00:03:35.360> will<00:03:35.840> make<00:03:35.960> you<00:03:36.050> lose<00:03:36.290> speed<00:03:36.650> if

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
while rising will make you lose speed if

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.770 
while rising will make you lose speed if
you<00:03:37.310> pull<00:03:37.520> up<00:03:37.700> right<00:03:38.000> when<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.240> start<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:38.570> glide

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
you pull up right when you start a glide

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.360 
you pull up right when you start a glide
you'll<00:03:39.170> lose<00:03:39.410> so<00:03:39.650> much<00:03:39.770> speed<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.280> you'll

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
you'll lose so much speed that you'll

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.910 
you'll lose so much speed that you'll
just<00:03:40.460> end<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.940> right<00:03:40.970> away<00:03:41.620> practice<00:03:42.620> steering

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
just end it right away practice steering

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.560 
just end it right away practice steering
up<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.280> down<00:03:43.460> so<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.880> can<00:03:43.970> keep<00:03:44.150> your<00:03:44.270> speed

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
up and down so you can keep your speed

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.650 
up and down so you can keep your speed
up<00:03:44.600> while<00:03:44.960> moving<00:03:45.200> forward<00:03:45.970> we<00:03:46.970> can<00:03:47.150> cancel<00:03:47.390> a

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
up while moving forward we can cancel a

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.170 
up while moving forward we can cancel a
glide<00:03:47.930> by<00:03:48.560> either<00:03:48.770> pressing<00:03:48.980> B<00:03:49.430> or<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.910> jump

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.270 
glide by either pressing B or the jump
button<00:03:50.330> or<00:03:51.320> you<00:03:51.530> can<00:03:51.650> end<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:51.920> glide<00:03:52.100> by

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
button or you can end a glide by

lighting is especially powerful with
meta<00:03:56.630> night<00:03:56.870> because<00:03:57.410> he<00:03:57.530> can<00:03:57.650> also<00:03:57.860> initiate

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
meta night because he can also initiate

meta night because he can also initiate
it<00:03:58.880> with<00:03:59.030> his<00:03:59.180> up<00:03:59.390> be<00:03:59.660> attack<00:03:59.990> so<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.800> means

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
it with his up be attack so that means

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.770 
it with his up be attack so that means
he<00:04:01.130> can<00:04:01.280> jump<00:04:01.550> way<00:04:01.880> out<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.330> side<00:04:02.570> of<00:04:02.600> the

he can jump way out to the side of the
stage<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:03.350> glide<00:04:03.740> and<00:04:04.130> then<00:04:04.850> he<00:04:04.940> can<00:04:05.060> turn

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
stage and glide and then he can turn

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.780 
stage and glide and then he can turn
around<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:05.990> use<00:04:06.290> his<00:04:06.530> up<00:04:06.680> be<00:04:07.040> attack<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.580> glide

around and use his up be attack to glide

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.970 
around and use his up be attack to glide
back<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.240> safety<00:04:08.480> he<00:04:09.320> can<00:04:09.500> even<00:04:09.590> glide
