00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:13.080
 Good day to all this I have smoked points 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:15.780
 Today I will show cancer example but people 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.779
 walk so here it is just a small lamp in 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.619
 the land around you 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.650
 bricks laid here 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.380
 oscar is quieter 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.769
 anyway lie bucket sawdust and here it is 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.050
 still smoke slowly slowly 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.290
 smokes it is the second tab that is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.309
 two days should be smoked for an hour she 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.149
 less smoking is already underway and so she 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.100
 through this here that's 7 meter pipe not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:54.860
 comes dock oil lamp practice too 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.660
 elementary fridge old here it is 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:04.010
 on top of a hole for the blow pipe 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.620
 and hang fish they hung two days just 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.790
 lounged and now they two days to take 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:13.970
 here she goes slowly 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.530
 crazy slowly all here is this bird on 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.610
 this is evident from the fact that now opened 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.360
 access vlohov both 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.430
 but I think it's still not enough and 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.100
 for a little faster Musin is not in Germany 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.590
 Ditan whole year sausage is smoked and stands 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.590
 500 euros talib taleh 100 grams round 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.990
 I do not remember a kilogram 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.000
 faster this whole thing so i decided 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.149
 pipe shortened a little as she 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.630
 I do not need 7 meter I do not need 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.060
 it will be necessary to put the well dad 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.940
 to break but I decided to make three meters and 4 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.039
 meters three meters as a way to cut here 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.160
 I'll show you a piece of paper 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.700
 2 pieces a 4-bet with contracts back 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.280
 page selected add-on notes 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.069
 contracts and need 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.030
 glued and exactly now this is how 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:10.700
 tip time 2 contract when uneven here 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.980
 here we do not draw with a pencil 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.730
 right here this sheet of tape stick 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.740
 and now grinder cut well of course 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.319
 here it will be necessary to make a notch one of 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.599
 second so that later when docked already by 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.260
 the circle could be leveled like this 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.610
 somehow the rows are here and then this thing 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.319
 it will be easier to cook 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 then it will definitely be a friend 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.280
 upright when I have my whole story and and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.980
 again well meaning but all a 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.730
 so now just smoke is cold very he 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.569
 somewhere comes to this case and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.510
 stops i mean i when there 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.510
 open the map 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.099
 come back here it is this whale is the second 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.750
 and hid it from there from the pipe 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.709
 starts to slide here 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.230
 ben right on the tool on to slide into 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.750
 literally because he already 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.760
 very cold it is cold 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.010
 smoking will I like this 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.830
 small fish by the way hot smoked 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.230
 and it makes no sense to make it boiled 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.360
 little will be garbage but such 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.610
 slowly and long I somehow smoked two 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.790
 Weeks were incredibly tasty product 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.290
 to was wild ask everyone cut off 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.930
 mean after making constructive 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.440
 changes namely pipe shortening on 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.829
 three meters all for 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.049
 worked much better even with this 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:44.250
 neck is not it i repeat last night 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:47.040
 loaded here is such a container with 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.190
 macrame sawdust there cheeses and still 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.680
 site and at the beginning when just broke out 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.790
 threw two all ok I do n't know what 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.900
 time and with a little already people 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.000
 ate ate show sawdust is no longer 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.540
 stretched through this tube more especially 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.780
 it was night there cold wind not clear then 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.290
 there is 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:20.000
 and then when cut off the pipe flowed under 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:20.000
 another tank can not be so here 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:30.880
 demar is generally good enough for him 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.770
 can now be adjusted by opening 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.750
 here is this cap 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.360
 so the question will show here again in the ear 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.639
 protection just what was at hand by her 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.229
 right in the heat of such a plan and here it is 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.080
 us 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:51.310
 fish droplet birds and even the most 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.660
 slow coals of sawdust is still 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.760
 there is no cold smoking 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.090
 there is absolutely no temperature 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.090
 chill 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.900
 the smoke drives away more flies that is possible there 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.690
 she doesn't bother like that 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.320
 down below also i will shut up these all have been and 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:17.500
 began to notice that there is not exactly sawed off and 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.320
 the breeze blew the wind blows the pressure 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.190
 here my smoke rises 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:28.870
 ramming back so here 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:34.060
 ramming back into the pit shorter with 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:37.659
 now filled with sawdust like clay 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:41.440
 literally flooded clay shovel where slakes 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:46.750
 poured some water and while she shed there 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.360
 it all slapped and smoothed were here 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.789
 all good flies will not be slow 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.330
 slowly the whole thing will come to one such 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:58.240
 bookmarks may even last two days 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.289
 here, too, all good clay with some water 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.710
 chili stuffed 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.740
 and the easiest way is to dig a hole down 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.580
 earth and then literally bricks 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.820
 drenched in gray clay 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:15.100
 it's easier and on the floor pipe all the same here 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:19.090
 we have 20 centimeters 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.770
 here 0 is not specifically added under the pipe 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:26.620
 nothing pipe diameter 160 in my 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:31.210
 thick wall length of 4 meters that is here 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.760
 it's something that can be done quickly on 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.350
 its plot for smoking fish 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:42.210
 this cold smoking once again 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:44.860
 so evening came, you can show 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.230
 improvement in shortening the pipe to 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.810
 what led 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:54.840
 this house itself take up the rise with 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:07:01.060
 mom his smoke goes 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:03.970
 open here it is so all this is smoked i 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.070
 I didnâ€™t even throw up how much 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.820
 closed and remained but now before 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:12.660
 departure, of course I also drank turn down 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:15.660
 increased by one row the amount 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.660
 shelves 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:22.320
 I also think everything will be fine 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:25.270
 stop doing that . 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.270
 Here is such a simple smoked points on 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.030
 Plot term just had to spend 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:36.450
 literally gender saying 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:36.450
 dog I come to say that's not all yet
