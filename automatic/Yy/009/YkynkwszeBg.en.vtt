also going to be discovering regular
x-ray<00:01:03.510> techniques<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:06.710> assuming<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.770> Mike

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
x-ray techniques so assuming that Mike

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.200 
x-ray techniques so assuming that Mike
would<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.119> walker<00:01:10.340> what<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> would<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> is

we get the clinical crown but we don't
elongate<00:06:11.030> that<00:06:11.210> root<00:06:11.389> system<00:06:11.440> so<00:06:12.440> what<00:06:12.590> I'm

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
elongate that root system so what I'm

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.200 
elongate that root system so what I'm
going<00:06:12.860> to<00:06:12.919> do<00:06:13.099> now<00:06:13.310> is<00:06:13.669> I'm<00:06:13.820> going<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.030> have

Mike tilt his head that way a little bit

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.640 
Mike tilt his head that way a little bit
and<00:06:17.479> then<00:06:17.930> towards<00:06:18.349> me<00:06:18.610> look<00:06:19.610> like<00:06:19.940> this<00:06:20.349> okay

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
and then towards me look like this okay

and then towards me look like this okay
poker<00:06:23.340> and<00:06:23.550> then<00:06:24.300> towards<00:06:24.720> me<00:06:24.840> a<00:06:24.870> little<00:06:25.020> bit

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
poker and then towards me a little bit

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.909 
poker and then towards me a little bit
there<00:06:25.500> you<00:06:25.620> go

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
there you go

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.390 
there you go
so<00:06:26.490> now<00:06:26.669> I'm<00:06:27.000> still<00:06:27.419> parallel<00:06:28.130> but<00:06:29.130> I'm<00:06:29.250> able

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
so now I'm still parallel but I'm able

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.120 
so now I'm still parallel but I'm able
to<00:06:29.520> come<00:06:29.760> in<00:06:30.030> be<00:06:30.990> completely<00:06:31.530> protected<00:06:31.740> by

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
to come in be completely protected by

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.820 
to come in be completely protected by
that<00:06:32.310> shield<00:06:32.639> get<00:06:33.600> the<00:06:33.750> route<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.229> get<00:06:34.680> the

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
that shield get the route and get the

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.379 
that shield get the route and get the
clinical<00:06:35.250> crown<00:06:35.460> and<00:06:35.790> it's<00:06:36.060> going<00:06:36.180> to<00:06:36.240> be<00:06:36.360> a

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389 
clinical crown and it's going to be a

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:39.140 
clinical crown and it's going to be a
perfect<00:06:36.600> x-ray

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.590 

so<00:06:39.660> another<00:06:40.490> big<00:06:41.490> problem<00:06:42.000> in<00:06:42.210> a<00:06:42.300> lot<00:06:42.330> of

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
so another big problem in a lot of

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.750 
so another big problem in a lot of
dental<00:06:42.750> offices<00:06:43.380> is<00:06:43.919> that<00:06:44.190> they<00:06:44.310> have<00:06:44.460> a<00:06:44.490> very

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
dental offices is that they have a very

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.840 
dental offices is that they have a very
very<00:06:44.850> small<00:06:45.090> operatory<00:06:45.930> so<00:06:46.919> if<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.340> patient

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
very small operatory so if the patient

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.420 
very small operatory so if the patient
isn't<00:06:48.090> comfortable<00:06:48.720> at<00:06:49.320> sitting<00:06:49.800> at<00:06:50.160> the<00:06:50.310> edge

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
isn't comfortable at sitting at the edge

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.180 
isn't comfortable at sitting at the edge
of<00:06:50.550> the<00:06:50.669> chair<00:06:50.910> like<00:06:51.090> this<00:06:51.500> another<00:06:52.500> chair<00:06:52.979> or

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
of the chair like this another chair or

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.950 
of the chair like this another chair or
stool<00:06:53.580> if<00:06:53.970> you<00:06:54.120> will<00:06:54.270> that<00:06:54.479> you<00:06:54.540> can<00:06:54.630> utilize

you sit here Mike this is where you can
utilize<00:07:00.780> your<00:07:01.110> sensors<00:07:01.560> usually<00:07:02.310> the

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
utilize your sensors usually the

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.020 
utilize your sensors usually the
computer<00:07:02.850> is<00:07:03.000> close<00:07:03.270> by<00:07:04.760> phosphor<00:07:05.760> plates

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
computer is close by phosphor plates

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.760 
computer is close by phosphor plates
it's<00:07:06.330> easy<00:07:06.510> to<00:07:06.690> do<00:07:06.840> and<00:07:07.050> I<00:07:07.139> found<00:07:07.440> that<00:07:07.620> on

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
it's easy to do and I found that on

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.879 
it's easy to do and I found that on
double<00:07:08.100> hygiene<00:07:08.520> days<00:07:09.229> you're<00:07:10.229> really<00:07:10.530> you're

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
double hygiene days you're really you're

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.379 
double hygiene days you're really you're
really<00:07:10.919> cranking<00:07:11.490> through<00:07:11.639> the<00:07:11.760> patients<00:07:12.240> and

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
really cranking through the patients and

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:13.700 
really cranking through the patients and
sometimes<00:07:12.780> you<00:07:12.990> don't<00:07:13.110> have<00:07:13.320> a<00:07:13.380> place<00:07:13.680> for

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
sometimes you don't have a place for

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.159 
sometimes you don't have a place for
them<00:07:14.010> to<00:07:14.039> sit<00:07:14.370> so<00:07:15.030> bring<00:07:15.270> them<00:07:15.360> on<00:07:15.510> back<00:07:15.750> take

phosphorus<00:07:20.340> it's<00:07:21.060> it's<00:07:21.360> just<00:07:21.660> as<00:07:21.780> good<00:07:21.840> but

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
phosphorus it's it's just as good but

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.500 
phosphorus it's it's just as good but
you<00:07:22.860> can<00:07:23.070> go<00:07:23.190> ahead<00:07:23.280> and<00:07:23.520> take<00:07:23.669> the<00:07:23.820> x-rays<00:07:24.240> and

you can go ahead and take the x-rays and

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.909 
you can go ahead and take the x-rays and
then<00:07:24.720> you<00:07:24.840> can<00:07:24.960> have<00:07:25.110> them<00:07:25.229> go<00:07:25.380> back<00:07:25.560> and<00:07:25.770> sit

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 
then you can have them go back and sit

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:28.520 
then you can have them go back and sit
out<00:07:26.039> in<00:07:26.130> the<00:07:26.190> waiting<00:07:26.340> room<00:07:26.630> but<00:07:27.630> again<00:07:27.930> now

come<00:07:39.580> in<00:07:39.990> take<00:07:40.990> the<00:07:41.050> x-rays<00:07:41.729> cradle<00:07:42.729> it<00:07:42.850> move

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.630 
come in take the x-rays cradle it move

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.340 
come in take the x-rays cradle it move
the<00:07:43.660> sensor<00:07:44.970> click

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.350 
the sensor click

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.380 
the sensor click
move<00:07:47.980> the<00:07:48.160> sensor<00:07:48.550> and<00:07:48.730> I'm<00:07:48.880> having<00:07:49.180> the

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:49.390
