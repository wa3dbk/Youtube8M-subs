the rod from the door handle which is
also<00:03:05.549> pretty<00:03:05.850> simple<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.299> slips<00:03:06.480> right<00:03:06.569> out

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
also pretty simple just slips right out

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.860 
also pretty simple just slips right out
your<00:03:08.489> allows<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> get<00:03:09.060> your<00:03:09.120> actuator<00:03:09.660> to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
your allows you to get your actuator to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.030 
your allows you to get your actuator to
where<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.110> can<00:03:10.290> see<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.430> then<00:03:11.730> it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
where you can see it and then it

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.289 
where you can see it and then it
you<00:03:13.129> just<00:03:14.079> unplug<00:03:15.079> from<00:03:15.590> each<00:03:15.799> side<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:20.060> ones

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
you just unplug from each side the ones

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:28.120 
you just unplug from each side the ones
the<00:03:21.129> actual<00:03:22.129> -<00:03:22.640> waiter<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.230> other

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.500 

the<00:03:29.130> sensor<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.640> tells<00:03:30.030> your<00:03:30.180> door<00:03:30.330> when

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the sensor that tells your door when

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:39.860 
the sensor that tells your door when
it's<00:03:30.660> open<00:03:30.930> closed<00:03:34.010> alright<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:38.780> here's<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
it's open closed alright so here's the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.690 
it's open closed alright so here's the
actuator<00:03:40.440> I'll<00:03:40.740> see<00:03:40.980> how<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.160> get<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.430> off

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
actuator I'll see how to get that off

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.190 
actuator I'll see how to get that off
and<00:03:42.770> I'll<00:03:43.770> be<00:03:44.010> with<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.460> intimate<00:03:47.990> okay<00:03:48.990> well

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
and I'll be with that intimate okay well

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.570 
and I'll be with that intimate okay well
I'm<00:03:49.680> not<00:03:49.770> gonna<00:03:49.890> bore<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.160> with<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.370> women

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
I'm not gonna bore you with the women

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.220 
I'm not gonna bore you with the women
you<00:03:50.730> know<00:03:50.820> Boyer<00:03:51.060> with<00:03:51.150> it<00:03:51.270> right<00:03:51.390> now<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.870> think

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
you know Boyer with it right now I think

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.290 
you know Boyer with it right now I think
it's<00:03:52.770> just<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.370> way<00:03:53.460> looking<00:03:53.850> at<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.150> and

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
it's just the way looking at it and

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.540 
it's just the way looking at it and
looking<00:03:54.780> at<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.020> replacement<00:03:55.530> part<00:03:55.770> I<00:03:56.070> think

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
looking at the replacement part I think

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.920 
looking at the replacement part I think
it's<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.940> matter<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.240> sliding<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.780> off

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's just a matter of sliding it off

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.230 
it's just a matter of sliding it off
it's<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.170> little<00:03:58.200> real<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.730> let's<00:03:59.910> see<00:04:00.090> how<00:04:00.210> that

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
it's a little real so let's see how that

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.360 
it's a little real so let's see how that
works<00:04:00.630> out

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
works out

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.240 
works out
and<00:04:02.450> actually<00:04:03.450> just<00:04:03.980> plugs<00:04:04.980> into<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.920> actual

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
and actually just plugs into the actual

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.750 
and actually just plugs into the actual
walking<00:04:08.760> mechanism<00:04:08.960> plays<00:04:09.960> inside<00:04:10.490> man<00:04:11.490> ego

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
walking mechanism plays inside man ego

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.620 
walking mechanism plays inside man ego
problem<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.740> just<00:04:13.980> slides<00:04:14.460> right<00:04:17.630> there

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
problem is it just slides right there

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.200 
problem is it just slides right there
you<00:04:18.720> go<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:20.070> here's<00:04:20.310> where<00:04:20.489> your<00:04:20.700> actuator

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
you go so here's where your actuator

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.570 
you go so here's where your actuator
should<00:04:21.660> be<00:04:21.780> going<00:04:21.930> up<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.200> down<00:04:22.320> it's<00:04:22.560> not<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
should be going up and down it's not you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.340 
should be going up and down it's not you
just<00:04:23.820> slides<00:04:24.030> into<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.420> little<00:04:24.600> yellow

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
just slides into this little yellow

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.830 
just slides into this little yellow
grommet<00:04:25.860> which<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.820> or<00:04:27.420> whatever<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.750> head

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
grommet which is or whatever the head

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.530 
grommet which is or whatever the head
come<00:04:27.990> on<00:04:28.050> o'clock<00:04:28.230> which<00:04:29.160> is<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.700> way<00:04:29.820> the

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
come on o'clock which is the way the

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.900 
come on o'clock which is the way the
other<00:04:30.660> rods<00:04:30.900> want<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.350> so<00:04:31.740> pretty<00:04:32.250> simple

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.880 

and<00:04:35.000> this<00:04:35.780> new<00:04:36.350> one<00:04:37.990> only<00:04:38.990> looking<00:04:39.260> moderately

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
and this new one only looking moderately

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.350 
and this new one only looking moderately
similar

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.960 

hopefully<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.390> single<00:04:44.840> work

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
hopefully a single work

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.460 
hopefully a single work
straight<00:04:47.630> from<00:04:47.780> China<00:04:49.570> now<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.600> saw<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.020> video

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
straight from China now I saw the video

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.650 
straight from China now I saw the video
the<00:04:51.950> guy<00:04:51.980> posted<00:04:52.640> on<00:04:52.730> YouTube<00:04:53.060> which<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:53.450> why

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
the guy posted on YouTube which is why

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.600 
the guy posted on YouTube which is why
I'm<00:04:53.900> even<00:04:54.290> giving<00:04:54.440> this<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.740> shot<00:04:54.770> so<00:04:55.340> thank<00:04:55.520> you

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
I'm even giving this a shot so thank you

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
I'm even giving this a shot so thank you
very<00:04:55.760> much<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.210> love<00:04:56.270> your<00:04:56.570> name<00:04:56.690> but<00:04:58.630> pretty

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
very much I love your name but pretty

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.250 
very much I love your name but pretty
cool<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.900> you<00:04:59.960> to<00:04:59.990> do<00:05:00.140> that<00:05:01.780> but<00:05:02.780> he<00:05:02.900> complained

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
cool of you to do that but he complained

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.590 
cool of you to do that but he complained
that<00:05:03.410> these<00:05:03.560> actuators<00:05:04.310> are<00:05:04.670> like<00:05:04.820> 60<00:05:05.450> bucks

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
that these actuators are like 60 bucks

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.910 
that these actuators are like 60 bucks
or<00:05:05.840> whatever<00:05:06.080> he<00:05:06.170> said<00:05:06.350> oh<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:09.050> bought<00:05:09.770> this

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
or whatever he said oh and I bought this

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.450 
or whatever he said oh and I bought this
one<00:05:10.070> for<00:05:10.220> 17<00:05:10.640> bucks<00:05:11.170> eBay<00:05:12.170> yeah<00:05:13.100> it's<00:05:13.310> from

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
one for 17 bucks eBay yeah it's from

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.830 
one for 17 bucks eBay yeah it's from
China<00:05:13.670> but<00:05:14.210> I<00:05:14.300> figured<00:05:14.630> for<00:05:14.900> 17<00:05:15.440> bucks<00:05:16.840> you

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
China but I figured for 17 bucks you

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.150 
China but I figured for 17 bucks you
know<00:05:17.900> I'd<00:05:18.320> give<00:05:18.620> it<00:05:18.710> a<00:05:18.740> shot<00:05:19.300> if<00:05:20.300> it<00:05:20.480> fails<00:05:20.750> I

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
know I'd give it a shot if it fails I

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.410 
know I'd give it a shot if it fails I
figure<00:05:22.160> I<00:05:22.220> can<00:05:22.370> replace<00:05:22.640> it<00:05:22.700> you<00:05:22.940> know<00:05:23.060> four<00:05:23.390> of

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
figure I can replace it you know four of

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.010 
figure I can replace it you know four of
them<00:05:23.600> for<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.350> price<00:05:24.500> of<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:25.070> $60<00:05:25.670> one<00:05:25.850> or<00:05:26.810> you

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
them for the price of a $60 one or you

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.530 
them for the price of a $60 one or you
do<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.260> math<00:05:27.410> and<00:05:27.590> figure<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.830> out<00:05:28.010> um<00:05:28.340> so<00:05:29.330> I

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
do the math and figure it out um so I

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.170 
do the math and figure it out um so I
will<00:05:29.840> try<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.080> put<00:05:30.230> all<00:05:30.260> this<00:05:30.440> back<00:05:30.620> together

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
will try and put all this back together

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.720 
will try and put all this back together
which<00:05:32.180> is<00:05:32.750> generally<00:05:33.170> the<00:05:33.230> harder<00:05:33.530> part<00:05:33.740> but

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
which is generally the harder part but

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.600 
which is generally the harder part but
so<00:05:35.120> far<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.360> seems<00:05:35.480> pretty<00:05:35.660> straightforward

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
so far it seems pretty straightforward

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.350 
so far it seems pretty straightforward
back<00:05:37.610> to<00:05:37.790> you<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:37.970> Mack<00:05:39.550> okay<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:40.940> actuator

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360
