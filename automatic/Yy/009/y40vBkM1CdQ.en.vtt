here<00:00:11.650> at<00:00:11.770> infineon<00:00:12.129> ward<00:00:12.340> we've<00:00:12.610> had<00:00:12.760> a<00:00:12.820> great

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:13.269 
here at infineon ward we've had a great

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.690 
here at infineon ward we've had a great
time<00:00:13.599> crafting<00:00:14.080> the<00:00:14.530> benchmark<00:00:15.309> of<00:00:15.580> the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
time crafting the benchmark of the

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.070 
time crafting the benchmark of the
modern<00:00:15.969> day<00:00:16.000> shooter<00:00:16.480> on<00:00:16.689> current-gen<00:00:17.430> she

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.849 

but<00:00:23.080> there's<00:00:23.230> also<00:00:23.350> a<00:00:24.510> big<00:00:25.510> big<00:00:25.960> map<00:00:26.320> changing

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
but there's also a big big map changing

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:46.380 
but there's also a big big map changing
events

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.040 

it<00:00:47.390> was<00:00:47.540> really<00:00:47.780> more<00:00:48.110> about<00:00:48.700> doing<00:00:49.700> a<00:00:50.050> more

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
it was really more about doing a more

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.260 
it was really more about doing a more
like<00:00:51.200> cinematic<00:00:52.070> destruction<00:00:52.820> rather<00:00:53.060> than

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
like cinematic destruction rather than

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:19.100 
like cinematic destruction rather than
just<00:00:53.690> destruction

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.010 

so<00:01:20.110> what<00:01:20.290> we<00:01:20.409> did<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:21.150> with<00:01:22.150> ghosts<00:01:22.420> as<00:01:22.630> we<00:01:22.780> is

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
so what we did is with ghosts as we is

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.500 
so what we did is with ghosts as we is
we<00:01:23.290> wanted<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.770> bring<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.369> lot<00:01:24.940> of<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.180> sort<00:01:25.420> of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
we wanted to bring a lot of the sort of

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.320 
we wanted to bring a lot of the sort of
cinematic<00:01:26.140> moments<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.770> single-player<00:01:27.549> into

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
cinematic moments of single-player into

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:40.399 
cinematic moments of single-player into
multi<00:01:28.630> Claire

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:02:21.940 

Oh

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.410 

these<00:02:22.950> new<00:02:23.160> MP<00:02:23.520> features<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.030> are<00:02:24.180> most

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
these new MP features that are most

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:58.670 
these new MP features that are most
excited<00:02:24.720> about<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.410> dynamic<00:02:26.160> maps
