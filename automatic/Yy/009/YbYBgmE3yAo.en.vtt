hey guys welcome back to another
tutorial<00:00:02.250> this<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.689> suggested<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
tutorial this is a suggested the

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.039 
tutorial this is a suggested the
tutorial<00:00:04.740> from<00:00:05.040> potty<00:00:05.490> bub<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.299> he<00:00:06.569> asked<00:00:06.899> me

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
tutorial from potty bub and he asked me

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.440 
tutorial from potty bub and he asked me
to<00:00:07.230> make<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.620> light<00:00:07.859> switch<00:00:08.160> or<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> house<00:00:09.059> and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
to make a light switch or a house and

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.970 
to make a light switch or a house and
I'm<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.820> but<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:11.969> pretty<00:00:12.150> simple

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
I'm a one but it's pretty simple

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.720 
I'm a one but it's pretty simple
hopefully<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.040> gives<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.250> guys<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.580> more

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
hopefully it gives you guys some more

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.990 
hopefully it gives you guys some more
ideas<00:00:14.960> but<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> reason<00:00:16.230> why<00:00:16.470> it's<00:00:16.619> not<00:00:17.000> more

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
ideas but the reason why it's not more

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.849 
ideas but the reason why it's not more
complicated<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.750> because<00:00:19.320> they're<00:00:19.470> changing

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
complicated is because they're changing

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
complicated is because they're changing
glowstone<00:00:20.250> robberies<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.570> don't<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:22.109> if

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
glowstone robberies so I don't know if

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.890 
glowstone robberies so I don't know if
I'll<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.800> able<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.220> push<00:00:23.430> Pistons<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.570> off<00:00:24.689> i'll

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I'll be able to push Pistons or off i'll

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.210 
I'll be able to push Pistons or off i'll
be<00:00:24.990> able<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> push<00:00:25.320> close<00:00:25.529> down<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.830> pistons

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
be able to push close down with pistons

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
be able to push close down with pistons
but<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.449> looks<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
but this is what it looks like in a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.250 
but this is what it looks like in a
glass<00:00:28.949> house<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.519> much<00:00:29.670> easier<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.029> see

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
glass house so it's much easier to see

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.130 
glass house so it's much easier to see
when<00:00:31.260> i<00:00:31.289> push<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.859> lever<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> turn

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
when i push the lever it's going to turn

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
when i push the lever it's going to turn
on<00:00:34.320> all<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.360> redstone<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
on all the redstone and it's going to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.680 
on all the redstone and it's going to
push<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.760> blue<00:00:38.760> block<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> stopped<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
push this blue block and stopped the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.130 
push this blue block and stopped the
light<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.530> getting<00:00:40.980> into<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> room<00:00:41.899> if<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
light from getting into the room if the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.250 
light from getting into the room if the
piston<00:00:43.710> properties<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:45.020> different<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
piston properties are different and you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.010 
piston properties are different and you
can<00:00:46.440> push<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.510> sticky<00:00:48.510> pistons<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
can push them with sticky pistons and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660 
can push them with sticky pistons and
stuff<00:00:49.230> then<00:00:49.950> i'll<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> much<00:00:50.640> better

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
stuff then i'll make a much better

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
stuff then i'll make a much better
cooler<00:00:51.329> tutorial<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> probably

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
cooler tutorial for now this is probably

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.130 
cooler tutorial for now this is probably
the<00:00:54.770> best<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.539> for

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the best thing we can do I think for

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.130 
the best thing we can do I think for
lights<00:00:58.640> anyway<00:01:00.530> let's<00:01:01.530> build<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.660> so<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> made<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
lights anyway let's build it so I made a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.770 
lights anyway let's build it so I made a
spectacle<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> house<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.420> right

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
spectacle of the house and it's right

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.719 
spectacle of the house and it's right
here<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> figure<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.610> where

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
here so we're going to figure out where

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.690 
here so we're going to figure out where
we<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:08.939> our<00:01:09.090> light<00:01:09.299> switch<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.950> how

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
we want our light switch to be and how

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
we want our light switch to be and how
about<00:01:11.880> on<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.390> wall<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.860> I'm

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
about on this wall right here so I'm

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
about on this wall right here so I'm
gonna<00:01:14.010> put<00:01:14.189> my<00:01:14.280> white<00:01:14.700> wool<00:01:15.090> block<00:01:15.299> down<00:01:15.509> there

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
gonna put my white wool block down there

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.760 
gonna put my white wool block down there
so<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.659> which<00:01:18.659> blocks<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.290> redstone

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so we can see which blocks have redstone

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.350 
so we can see which blocks have redstone
and<00:01:21.020> I'm<00:01:22.020> gonna<00:01:22.140> attach<00:01:22.409> torches<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.180> side

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and I'm gonna attach torches on the side

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.859 
and I'm gonna attach torches on the side
of<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.560> when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> flip<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> switch<00:01:26.869> it

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of it so when you flip the switch it

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.859 
of it so when you flip the switch it
should<00:01:28.080> turn<00:01:28.229> off<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> torch<00:01:29.570> alright<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.810> now

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
should turn off the torch alright so now

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.780 
should turn off the torch alright so now
I'm<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> add<00:01:31.200> some<00:01:31.229> more<00:01:32.900> redstone<00:01:33.900> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
I'm going to add some more redstone and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
I'm going to add some more redstone and
there<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:35.990> alright<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.290> ready<00:01:37.560> now

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
there we go alright so that's ready now

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.929 
there we go alright so that's ready now
we<00:01:37.829> got<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> figure<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.340> where<00:01:38.729> ever<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.909> want

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
we got to figure out where ever you want

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.580 
we got to figure out where ever you want
our<00:01:39.329> lights<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> how<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.560> one

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
our lights to be and how about we do one

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.819 
our lights to be and how about we do one
here<00:01:41.119> but<00:01:42.119> we'll<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.680> for<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
here but we'll do one here for that

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.600 
here but we'll do one here for that
we're<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> need<00:01:44.460> our<00:01:45.149> pistons<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> let's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
we're going to need our pistons so let's

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.560 
we're going to need our pistons so let's
place<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.759> and<00:01:50.759> then<00:01:51.479> we're

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
place them here in here and then we're

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.609 
place them here in here and then we're
going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> add<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> block<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
going to add the block that's going to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.670 
going to add the block that's going to
cover<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:54.020> cover<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> holes<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
cover them up cover the holes up and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.990 
cover them up cover the holes up and
we're<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> attach<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.640> redstone

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
we're going to attach the redstone

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.109 
we're going to attach the redstone
wiring<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.750> both<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.890> those<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.000> that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
wiring to both of those just like that
