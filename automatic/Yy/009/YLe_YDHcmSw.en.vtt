 soon you will need to use the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.829

 only one washing point. 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.229
 water supply and a drainage system

 Remember that little thing. 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.790
 Let's use it now to remove the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.729
 transport screws that are in the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.920
 Let's now to the leveling of the feet is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.500
 very simple using that same key 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.900
 adjust the feet of the machine so that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.869
 that everyone is in contact with the ground 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.079
 then place each hand on one side 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.570
 opposite the machine and try to 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.720
 if you stand firm it is because your feet are 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.189
 properly leveled if you do not 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.829

 only the installation of hoses 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.040
 open the washer door and remove the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.560
 hoses and a hose holder 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.480

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.570
 the orange detail serves 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.240
 for hot water the blue detail is already 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.650
 for cold water 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.070
 connect the hose with blue details 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:18.060
 where leather is written and with 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.580
 orange detail where it is written hot 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.590

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.530
