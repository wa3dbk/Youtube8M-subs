00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.870
 box 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.470
 here we have the title of the series of 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 we are new and here we have a 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:54.180
 illustration of the rural who have the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 sheet and how can you see this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 firing missiles 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.229
 and here we have another illustration that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.590
 comes 2 in a museum that has has 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:13.229
 extended in launching the missiles that 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.259
 the world occupied our product that is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.830
 the stable although we have a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.230
 illustration I have how they light up like 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.330
 the musicians were firing 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.020
 and here again we have an illustration 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 of that but it is no longer shooting the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.320
 missile is now with the same 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.470
 let's see the back in front 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.570
 here we have an illustration of our 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.040
 product and this distance is from where 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:54.150
 it comes out and here we have other illustrations 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.610
 of the exam to which it is extended and 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.729
 here is firing the missiles we can 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.080
 see that the missiles can be put on 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.570
 other places like here and below and here 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.310
 we have an illustration of this one 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.310
 helmet to see this 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.159
 to cover it 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:27.049
 well let's see the exam here we can 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.409
 see where it launches the missiles and 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.290
 Here, you can see that it gets 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:38.969
 the other missiles and down here too 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.500
 and how can you see their color by almost 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:46.450
 everything enters that is green 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.840
 and the idea that it has as a circle 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:55.100
 red and all this here as you can 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.470
 see the gray with black here from here 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.930
 It is also black and below 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.010
 It is also sad and here we see the 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:07.820
 trigger and the button that you have for 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.360
 understand our saber and here we have the 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.840
 good on / off button let's go 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.590
 to see the saber way to get the one that you 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.360
 we have to beat him like this and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.360
 pull this lever down 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.969
 and how can we see reactions from 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.969
 movement as if it were moving 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.430
 and as if I was returning a 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.099
 person is like blows 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.170
 and to download it you have to search from here 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.110
 up and so it becomes 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.800
 and how can you see that right now I'm 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.020
 they launched and the missiles are launched with 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.020
 this one with this trigger throw the missiles 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.390
 and the ones below are saved in case 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.129
 they want to shoot again good as 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.870
 we can see is an exact replica of the 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.720
 iron saber that comes out in the series 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.819
 star one rebels can this 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.400
 collect or can buy it for 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.600
 play, I recommend them very much 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:26.229
 because he is so father and because between 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.270
