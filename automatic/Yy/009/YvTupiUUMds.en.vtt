00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 in my house warned by twitter I'm going to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.610
 upload videos even though I'm in the shit 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.019
 extreme is that I swear to you that I am 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.630
 dying inside 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.179
 good art is crap the art 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.119
 I used to molaba not before what you see is a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 picture was at least appreciated 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
 I leave now 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.289
 now there is a shit but but one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 shit that is called art this this is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.810
 shit and this is called art and now 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.570
 the best thing about us having that is bullshit 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.210
 I mean, it's bullshit, what I see there is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.430
 something very political day of some faces that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 They are a little scary good and what 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.410
 you want to see you know that if you throw a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.360
 cinnamon, you see the future here, but 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.280
 nothing that I have another image quite 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.949
 striking that you give me I go there 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.629
 a group of girls dancing around 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.000
 a bonfire I swear that is the only thing 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.760
 I see but good they threw is abstract art 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.320
 what are we going to do this this is 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.730
 a sculpture that is a shit os 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.010
 you have found that sculptures of 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.420
 you are on the safe street because the 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.330
 they put then we think that the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 give away with the choco krispis but nothing 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.440
 here we have another exactly the same 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.750
 the chocÃ³ krispis I think this 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.740
 it seems that the glass ceramic that 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.780
 puts everything red 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.979
 once seen that the art of today is 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.289
 shit 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.369
 we go with the intro and now you will see a 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.369
 somewhat special video 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.120

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.320

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.980
 before death again 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:37.020
 just a pyramid of art for boys what 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.280
 what happens is that you notice this 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.050
 what is a few stacked bricks worth only 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.020
 by passing over the bricks 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.800
 without touching them experience in anger is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.530
 incredible be 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.100
 also a guy tell me either 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.550
 worry that supposedly it's art 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.020
 is to drink tea 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.560
 Minecraft 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.230
 the art of minecraft that I do not care if 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.640
 it's super fun if you laugh a lot 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.670
 yes that's art 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.440
 I do not really understand what they explain to me 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.670

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.290
 sun or burst the and it's art 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.290
 and split a grenade 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:29.080
 I'm freaking out, guys were trunks 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.599
 trunks as they are cut 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.540
 bricks as such placed on the floor 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.580
 if in plan with this look and I swear to you 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.580
 they cheated me and they are going to throw me 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.980
 of the museum is good the exhibition is for 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.900
 try to jump over a 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.530
 sculpture because of course you are 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.250
 a row bricks like this but very long 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.290
 but 20 meters of stacked bricks 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.180
 what it says I'm going to walk 20 meters to 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.610
 come back here because there is a 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.380
 row of bricks so wide that they do not 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.720
 I can jump because I was a whore 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.299
 sculpture are we fools or who 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.620
 honestly it bothers me it bothers me that 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.450
 that's called art because for me 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.799
 It looks like a fucking shit if anyone 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.690
 like the abstract art that I 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.510
 please explain why I do not understand 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.630

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.549
 nothing to understand I see things or pints 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.340

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.500

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.910

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.200
 the one that is charging millions but that 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.930
 no longer 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.910
 well it's something like being youtuber and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.340
 charge a lot of romantic until the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.790
 today's video if it's different from having more 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.280
