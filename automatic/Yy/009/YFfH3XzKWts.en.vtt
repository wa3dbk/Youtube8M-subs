00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hi to all of you guys and welcome back to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.890
 all of you today are here for 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.390
 talk about an issue that has aroused 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.370
 my interest was taking a leap 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.599
 in multiplayer.it is in fact a little law 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.019
 news about the news on the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.059
 video games 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.610
 when my eye falls on a piece of news 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 in particular that is one morning against 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.449
 violent video games by 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.050
 fouls j inadequate to defend the medium 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.580
 gaming 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.140
 I want to immediately say that I am against 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.060
 Parisian absolutely nothing person 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.470
 very good made with what you want 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.849
 but I don't follow her because she is doing video 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.609
 I am absolutely not interested 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.590
 so let's not create hatred and hatred 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.270
 where there is practically no inside 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.770
 of this article we talk about how to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.300
 a bet of one morning, yes 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.280
 tackled the video game topic 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 violent and to defend these was 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 called an expert let's say maybe 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 expert in quotes that makes the vj 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.320
 his speech was quite a bit 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.000
 inadequate at times a little confusing 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.289
 even going to use 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.210
 very delicate words in this 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.550
 question is but the times are different 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 these games were certainly better 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.390
 avoid certain certain statements in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 this context the problems all this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.690
 and it is not dj the real problem and how 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.280
 usually it is dealt with in a manner 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.570
 wrong I fear it is video games 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.979
 violent on television because this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.030
 it is done as usual by people 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.510
 who do not know what they are 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.549
 speaking 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.979
 just hear a few words where they speak 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.260
 of a video game where points are made 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.760
 investing people and killing women 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.530
 this for them is that among other things 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.450
 pronounces in an inexpressible way they could 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.040
 also save it after the problem 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.830
 even more serious that a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.020
 expert where the expert is not happy 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.640
 he is not an expert does vj and a person who 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.070
 became famous thanks to his 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.840
 video games thanks to his fun of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.909
 facing these screaming orlando doing 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 the dick a little bit in the sense 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.030
 positive in front of video games but 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.520
 certainly can not be defined a 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 ejeie expert a public figure is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.290
 a person known for knowing how to play 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 have fun in front of the games not a 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.409
 expert the expert for me who is the expert 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.720
 is that person that an experience 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.399
 decennial in the field as a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.409
 journalist an editor someone who has 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.240
 worked for years in the sector having 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.680
 gained some experience 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.049
 I in the first place and for example I can't 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.219
 call me an expert I am an amateur 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.530
 of video games a person who anyway 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.850
 it is documented and informed at will 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.550
 stay updated on what i am 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.470
 video games in all its aspects 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.910
 But I can not call me maybe 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.040
 an expert if maybe they asked me 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.370
 of you happening inside something 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.170
 as an expert figure I might have had the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.030
 decency to decline leaving space to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.110
 who actually experienced us guys 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.240
 we must also pay close attention 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.710
 to the phenomenon of youtubers because 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.750
 often the following rule applies to 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.970
 charity with due exceptions where it is 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.580
 achieved notoriety and fame thanks to the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.750
 play with pure entertainment by fucking around 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.640
 source video games to our curamente 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.620
 demonstrating a knowledge of this 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.360
 sector while people maybe 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.340
 make videos with us we say in 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.020
 more passionate than the following 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.820
 this is not true but they realize 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.280
 video perhaps passing on knowledge e 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.660
 maybe their deep bond with 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.610
 video games will have an audience following 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.770
 minor because they will go to 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.210
 other people like him maybe less 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.580
 they see video games in something 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.530
 we also say important with this 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.090
 so we have to understand that it was often 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.440
 the case does not give him too much credit 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.940
 we can follow youtuber 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.220
 esteeming as a person can be a lot 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.720
 fun but before throwing him 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.430
 the person who can be an expert 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.560
 however tatar videogame in a manner 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.050
 Full c where perhaps a moment to think 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.520
 and with this guys and everything I hope 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.410
 may you believe the figure in me 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.820
 of an experienced passionate player who 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.800
 try to convey all this in 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.239

 violent and how they come about 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.620
 dealt with superficial manner in 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.910
 television with a commentary and maybe 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.890
 in the future he made a video where 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.540
 we will talk among ourselves and make expert people 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.920
