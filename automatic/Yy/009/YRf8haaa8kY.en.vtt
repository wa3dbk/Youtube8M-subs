00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.299
 why be a technology teacher 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.040
 I went through the industry before and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.860
 I did not necessarily find my way 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.750
 in the industry and then through a competition of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.880
 circumstances to I steered myself more 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 particularly on teaching and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.930
 hello college technology you 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.560
 return after 20 years I do not regret the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.560
 all this orientation 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.019
 we had started working the astrÃ©e 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.309
 last year on the distributor of 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.140
 automatic soap 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.510
 this session you go over 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.420
 particularly interested in the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.269
 Dosing function on which piece act 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.619
 to decrease the amount of soap we have 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.719
 because she was too important 

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:55.210
 so from there we will ask ourselves 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:02.600
 next problematic how to decrease 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:04.580
 the amount of soap distribute all 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.880
 first the students appropriate the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.619
 produced by disassembling it after they go 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.539
 we but especially on the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.830
 dosing function and ask oneself 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.509
 questions how does the system work 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.479
 so they will discover a system well 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.459
 the manual what will allow them 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.899
 to make assumptions about the 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.080
 operation of the system and the 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.470
 modification could draw the piece 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.470
 amended 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.979
 from the moment they figured out that 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.619
 the eccentric had an important role to 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.780
 play on the piston stroke and they 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.680
 will change this position on a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.430
 3d representations software 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.530
 now that you have drawn 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.300
 opinion with the new position of 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.000
 the eccentric we will be able to print it 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.860
 using the 3d printer more 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.259
 if you will very quickly get 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.450
 your new sprocket and you'll be able to 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.220
 test by putting this new gear on 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.299
 our distributor and from there 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.910
 validate your solution 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.820
 okay so let's go we'll take 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:15.200
 the file on this pc and the opinion is going 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:17.150
 print very quickly until 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.250
 present it's true that we stopped at 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.370
 the virtual representation of the object 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.050
 and now through the use of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.489
 3d printers we manage to finalize 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.500
 this channel means it's 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.330
 the outcome of this process of 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.800
 this chain of information that we 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.390
 lets get to something 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.650
 concrete that the student can have in 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.930
 standards 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.340
 more of its printers is that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.110
 already she does not brake place 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.180
 we do not need to use tools 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.800
 cutting we do not need a hood 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.879
 protection because there is a risk of 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.560
 injury and so on 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.030
 so we still have an easy 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.470
 of use by students who is 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.470
 interesting and reassuring 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.989
 from the moment we arrive at 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.269
 integrate the use of this machine 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.370
 in projects that are carrying this 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.110
 kind in use of course 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.700
 that she has a real interest in doing 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.269
 part of the laboratory equipment of 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.610
 technology 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.650
 this eminent 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.780
 go ahead you take the opinion you the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.960
 gathered in place of the initial gear 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.270
 in box and well the eccentric go 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.150
 I was the other one and so you go 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.710
 to be able to test and so look at the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.600
 piston displacement is that 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.060
 actually you have decreased or not 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.340
 the amount of soap moving the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.450
 piston so the amount of sand so at 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.160
 from there what can you 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.980
 find out with respect to this 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.020
 wandering and singular modification 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.090
 so the dose of soap has decreased so 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.590
 indeed it was necessary to act on the 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.600
 position of the eccentric and one 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.790
 realizes that by mounting the new 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.380
 piece printed very quickly well 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.209
 we can validate in the session our 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.780
 solution we will stop there for 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.700
 today 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.200
 and then we will continue next meeting 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.880
 on another possibility of 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.920
 modification by working on the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.380
 reprogramming the system when we pose 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.540
 a 3d printer on a table 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.430
 students are amazed good it's not the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.260
 all hostile to force 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.000
 I did not imagine at all like that it's 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.230
 original it's new that comes out of 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.760
 ordinary 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.250
 when they go to see the piece printed 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.750
 go from nothing to a 3d piece that's 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.790
 still a little revolution 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.130
 before using the printer did 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.979
 the piece of the coup we have the impression that 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.530
 it's us who do things so 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.940
 quite a lot more interesting here 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.310
 who is secret like that and try it 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.280
 for me I love it I love doing that 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.140
 it is a material that is very easy 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.080
 of access there is no training 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.180
 needed to have used the fit he 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.450
 will face the fake just turn on a 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.190
 sailing files on the computer 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.410
 printed and that's it 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.030
 the interest of this machine is 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.620
 to use very little material so we 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.140
 can do a lot of objects 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.820
 if we made a mistake we change the feet 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.650
 on a computer we restart them and here we go 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.920
 yes we are wrong to the error with this api 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.480
 which is important I think to show 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.990
 to our students is that this printer 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.120
 does not have a field of use 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.320
 reserved for mechanics we have more than 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.060
 constraints we have more constraints of 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.950
 form we have nothing left to them to 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.670
 release to the udc let go they 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.380
 have fun 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.420
 I think we need to open their minds 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.410
 creativity and this machine goes right 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.410
 in time that sense 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 Oh 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.860
 and 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 and
