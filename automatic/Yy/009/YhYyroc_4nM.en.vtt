00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
spoons ready and we're going to use a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.720 
spoons ready and we're going to use a
whisk<00:00:21.230> now<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.279> type<00:00:23.699> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
however we kind of like this one because

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.209 
however we kind of like this one because
it<00:00:34.680> has<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.860> round<00:00:35.280> bottom<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:37.500> lets<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it has a round bottom and it lets the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.340 
it has a round bottom and it lets the
whisk<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> egg<00:00:40.110> yolk

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
whisk get through all of the egg yolk

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.619 
whisk get through all of the egg yolk
later<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.950> you'll<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> maybe<00:00:42.270> two

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
later on you'll see this is maybe two

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
later on you'll see this is maybe two
bagels<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.340> doesn't<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.789> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
bagels in here and it doesn't have a

bagels in here and it doesn't have a
round<00:00:45.090> bottom<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:46.289> we're<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.500> try<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
round bottom now we're gonna try to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.810 
round bottom now we're gonna try to
separate<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> egg<00:00:48.000> yolk<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:48.960> fingers

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
separate the egg yolk with our fingers

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.889 
separate the egg yolk with our fingers
let's<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.989> successful<00:00:53.510> maybe<00:00:54.510> yes

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
let's see if we are successful maybe yes

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.939 
let's see if we are successful maybe yes
maybe<00:00:55.170> no<00:00:56.960> practice<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.440> bit<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
maybe no practice this a little bit I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.130 
maybe no practice this a little bit I
don't<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.430> better<00:00:59.640> than<00:01:00.420> using<00:01:00.690> any<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
don't like it better than using any of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.990 
don't like it better than using any of
these<00:01:01.289> gadgets

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
let's take our bowl and kind of whisk it

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.250 
let's take our bowl and kind of whisk it
a<00:02:08.509> little<00:02:08.750> bit<00:02:08.960> first<00:02:09.319> okay<00:02:10.009> like<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.959> now

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
a little bit first okay like so and now

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.590 
a little bit first okay like so and now
we'll<00:02:12.500> introduce<00:02:12.770> this<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.670> heat<00:02:13.940> and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
we'll introduce this to the heat and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.870 
we'll introduce this to the heat and
let's<00:02:15.410> go<00:02:15.620> ahead<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:15.920> turn<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> stove<00:02:16.610> off

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
let's go ahead and turn the stove off

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.090 
let's go ahead and turn the stove off
now<00:02:17.209> because<00:02:17.870> we've<00:02:18.140> got<00:02:18.350> plenty<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.800> hot

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
now because we've got plenty of hot

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.300 
now because we've got plenty of hot
water<00:02:19.310> going<00:02:20.150> there<00:02:20.510> as<00:02:20.780> we<00:02:21.020> settle<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.500> town

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
water going there as we settle this town

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.490 
water going there as we settle this town
I<00:02:22.340> think<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.330> heats<00:02:23.540> gonna<00:02:23.810> be<00:02:23.990> enough<00:02:24.260> so

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
I think the heats gonna be enough so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.420 
I think the heats gonna be enough so
there<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.800> are<00:02:24.830> we<00:02:25.010> turned<00:02:25.400> off<00:02:25.580> clark<00:02:25.880> spoke

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
there we are we turned off clark spoke

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.280 
there we are we turned off clark spoke
and<00:02:28.430> they<00:02:28.640> start<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.150> process<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.810> whisking

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
and they start the process of whisking

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.190 
and they start the process of whisking
the<00:02:30.470> idea<00:02:30.830> here<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.490> not<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.480> have<00:02:32.750> too<00:02:33.020> much

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
the idea here is not to have too much

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.500 
the idea here is not to have too much
heat<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.950> will<00:02:34.190> create<00:02:34.580> scrambled<00:02:35.330> eggs

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
heat that will create scrambled eggs

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.320 
heat that will create scrambled eggs
instead<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.140> hollandaise<00:02:36.620> sauce<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:38.120> we've

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
instead of hollandaise sauce and we've

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.060 
instead of hollandaise sauce and we've
got<00:02:38.540> our<00:02:38.690> little<00:02:38.840> patties<00:02:39.320> of<00:02:39.350> butter<00:02:39.739> ready

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070

over there
as<00:02:40.880> these<00:02:41.720> melts<00:02:42.670> we<00:02:43.670> will<00:02:43.850> be<00:02:44.060> adding<00:02:44.450> more

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480
