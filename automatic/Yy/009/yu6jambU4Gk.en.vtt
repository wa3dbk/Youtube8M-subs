00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.160 
very very very long-lasting color when
it<00:02:22.020> does<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.280> fade<00:02:23.730> out<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.330> very<00:02:24.600> very

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it does like to fade out it's very very

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.940 
it does like to fade out it's very very
very<00:02:25.470> gradual<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:27.560> slowly<00:02:28.560> becomes

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
very gradual and it's slowly becomes

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.790 
very gradual and it's slowly becomes
this<00:02:29.100> really<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.610> light<00:02:30.600> blue<00:02:31.170> jean<00:02:31.410> blue

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
this really really light blue jean blue

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.830 
this really really light blue jean blue
color<00:02:32.130> which<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:34.790> think<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.120> kind<00:02:36.780> of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
color which I like I think it kind of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
color which I like I think it kind of
looks<00:02:37.820> scummy<00:02:38.820> after<00:02:39.300> about<00:02:39.600> over<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> month<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
looks scummy after about over a month I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.800 
looks scummy after about over a month I
think<00:02:41.130> especially<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.330> have<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> lot<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
think especially if you have a lot of

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.020 
think especially if you have a lot of
colors<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.590> under<00:02:43.950> your<00:02:43.980> hair<00:02:44.520> like<00:02:44.850> I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
colors like under your hair like I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.360 
colors like under your hair like I
usually<00:02:45.239> do<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.440> um<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:48.560> don't<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:50.100> have

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
usually do but um I don't really have

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.449 
usually do but um I don't really have
much<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.209> problem<00:02:51.420> with<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.780> actually<00:02:52.200> um

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
much of a problem with that actually um

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.600 
much of a problem with that actually um
it's<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.630> sorry<00:02:54.630> that's<00:02:55.019> like<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.320> only

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
it's like sorry that's like the only

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.229 
it's like sorry that's like the only
downside<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.640> can<00:02:56.850> think<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.120> um<00:02:58.130> for<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.280> goes

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
downside I can think of um for that goes

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.280 
downside I can think of um for that goes
on<00:03:00.420> easy<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:01.019> an<00:03:01.250> ice-cream<00:03:02.420> base<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:04.110> like

products um when you mix it with
conditioner<00:03:10.320> I'm<00:03:11.310> trying<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.640> think<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.880> don't

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
conditioner I'm trying to think I don't

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.729 
conditioner I'm trying to think I don't
actually<00:03:12.390> think<00:03:12.690> I've<00:03:13.050> done<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.440> one<00:03:13.620> in

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
actually think I've done this one in

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.150 
actually think I've done this one in
conditioner<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.459> might<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
conditioner I might have and I think the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.910 
conditioner I might have and I think the
color<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.459> got<00:03:17.640> was<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.850> bit<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.650> not<00:03:19.650> sure

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
color I got was a bit like this not sure

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.300 
color I got was a bit like this not sure
I<00:03:21.290> might<00:03:22.290> be<00:03:22.410> thinking<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.829> a<00:03:22.890> different<00:03:22.920> one

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
I might be thinking of a different one

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.759 
I might be thinking of a different one
entirely<00:03:23.670> but<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.030> think<00:03:24.390> that's<00:03:24.959> what<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.320> is

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.100 

but<00:03:28.769> um<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.489> can<00:03:29.760> try<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.030> again<00:03:30.150> sometime<00:03:31.079> soon

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
but um I can try it again sometime soon

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.090 
but um I can try it again sometime soon
and<00:03:31.590> show<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.190> guys<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:33.380> anyway<00:03:34.380> still

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
and show you guys but anyway still

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.490 
and show you guys but anyway still
really<00:03:35.310> long<00:03:35.459> lasting<00:03:35.670> oh<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.810> think<00:03:37.290> this

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
really long lasting oh I think this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.170 
really long lasting oh I think this
might<00:03:37.650> be<00:03:37.709> a<00:03:37.829> good<00:03:38.130> example<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.730> color<00:03:38.940> it

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
might be a good example of the color it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.610 
might be a good example of the color it
turns<00:03:39.209> when<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.100> fades<00:03:41.100> out<00:03:42.380> it's<00:03:43.380> kind<00:03:43.590> of

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
turns when it fades out it's kind of

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.509 
turns when it fades out it's kind of
like<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:44.989> just<00:03:45.989> from<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> bracelet<00:03:47.070> I'm<00:03:47.190> just
