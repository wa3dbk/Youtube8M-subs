California<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:49.049> built<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.409> 1800s

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
California that was built in the 1800s

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.219 
California that was built in the 1800s
so<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.820> California<00:01:51.390> redwood<00:01:51.780> it's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so this is California redwood it's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.590 
so this is California redwood it's
probably<00:01:52.500> several<00:01:52.979> hundred<00:01:53.159> years<00:01:53.399> old<00:01:53.820> we

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
probably several hundred years old we

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.319

stable neck like quarter sawn necks are
very<00:05:05.900> stable<00:05:06.140> this<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.710> probably<00:05:07.100> more<00:05:07.310> rigid

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
very stable this is probably more rigid

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.730 
very stable this is probably more rigid
than<00:05:07.670> that<00:05:07.910> so<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.420> last<00:05:08.630> very<00:05:09.260> long<00:05:09.350> time<00:05:09.710> and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
than that so the last very long time and

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.710 
than that so the last very long time and
probably<00:05:10.160> will<00:05:10.310> never<00:05:10.460> work<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.690> just

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
probably will never work and it just

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.060 
probably will never work and it just
looks<00:05:12.140> really<00:05:12.440> interesting<00:05:12.670> like<00:05:13.670> bamboo

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.560
