00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.890
 here it is middle of youtube 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.960
 Summertime is well known 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.240
 water gun time and today i introduce myself 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.240
 you have the following water gun before 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.260
 today imagine the super joker 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.289
 two microbus before 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.910
 The Amazon costs nine euros 99 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.740
 Environment on the video interest in the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.130
 water gun on the left is in the text 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.219
 always click on it in the video 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.980
 without the micro to 2 so look now 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.110
 the packaging from juba infos tank contents 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.660
 250 milliliters and that should be up to ten 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.110
 meter far then shoot practically 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.910
 this time from the micro cars 2 of super 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.160
 thing looks like we have 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 blue white and orange tones far ahead too 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270
 here again very great 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.510
 which can sometimes fall down because 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.010
 nothing happens so fast we demand 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.479
 come to me the water jet house here 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.360
 the water comes in, and that's easy 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.369
 so to the side open water march 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.920
 and when happy again press on it 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.970
 and then wanted to turn to the side with the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.030
 Super summer shooting is not quite 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.580
 just on the other side 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.909
 you have to go forwards to the back 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.740
 you always get the water out for 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.680
 beautiful hetlingen is pleasant in the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 hand with the flash glass is a bit 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.850
 voluminous the drag a bit fat 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.030
 but otherwise if you go now 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:53.119
 Comparing the length is doing so well 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.119
 how not so bad the mikrowelt 2 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.350
 and there already something that does so in 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.350
 range from five to ten meters 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.640
 water march 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.440
 album sonz graz a bit grades 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.380
 you can keep a little bit weird 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.990
 but I shot it already empty 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:24.860
 without that it was pretty fast 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:29.780
 the soft shot so beautiful 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.220
 nine meter area 4 89 meters and mens 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.790
 that's a few splashes to the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.800
 teeth gear 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.300
 but that easily creates nine meters times 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.880
 from about 1 meter away here on 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.690
 shoot the glass and then see 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:52.190
 you look like the water jet 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:03:01.240
 namely only times out pretty 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:01.240
 are vigorously from the side here 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.520
 ulli sima 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.810
 what about the super micro 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.930
 burst finally say that one 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.659
 really nice little water pistol with 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.019
 a nice handling why the cluster 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.420
 of course with the water tank know 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.209
 little I liked that very much 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.040
 this point mechanism because he would have to 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.950
 could not build pressure and could do so 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.790
 long your opponent or pals times wet 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.799
 make it until the tank is empty he will be up 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.150
 she gave me ten meters 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.680
 not done so minimal right now 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.139
 You can shoot a bit diagonally 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.239
 on 9 meters 10 meters were possible but 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.590
 then they almost kept it that way 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.810
 that is more interesting 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.280
 nonetheless great water pistol and 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.690
 if you are interested in the link to it 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.010
 and just write under the video 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.199
 Click on it as an example 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.340
 from youtube but it first time and 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.210
 if I subscribe does not miss any 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.210
